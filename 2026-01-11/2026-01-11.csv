            • ICE protests: Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem today stood by the comments she made immediately after the killing of a Minneapolis woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. More demonstrations are planned today after nationwide outcry over shooting spilled into the streets of cities across the US yesterday.
    


            • Iran intervention: President Donald Trump is weighing a series of potential military options in Iran following deadly protests in the country, two US officials told CNN, as he considers following through on his recent threats to strike the country should they use lethal force against the Iranian people.
    


            • Venezuela's oil: Meanwhile, Trump is pressing ahead with his plans for the US to overhaul Venezuela's oil industry after removing Nicolás Maduro from power. American energy executives have been noncommittal, so far.
    


            Democratic Sen. Tina Smith, of Minnesota, said Immigrations and Customs Enforcement should be “reformed, not abolished,” after an ICE agent fatally shot a woman in her home state, and she added that she's willing to withhold her vote on a key funding bill in Congress over the issue.
    


            “Clearly, I see a role in our country for strong border security, but we need to get serious about what is actually happening with this unaccountable agency that is not abiding by any of the laws or the procedures that we would expect to see from professional law enforcement,” she told CNN's Manu Raju on “Inside Politics Sunday.”
    


            Smith, who is retiring after this term, left the door open to joining her progressive colleagues who have urged the party to draw a “red line” over demands to include ICE restrictions in ongoing negotiations to pass funding bills to avert a shutdown by the end of the month.
    


            “It is hard for me to imagine how I could vote to support a budget bill for the Department of Homeland Security, given how the Department of Homeland Security is functioning right now in my community. I want to see work done that would bring some serious reforms to ICE,” she said.
    


            Smith also cast doubt on the federal government's ability to conduct a legitimate probe of the shooting, as administration officials blame rhetoric by Democrats for the violence.
    


            “I don't see how we can trust the outcome of this probe when they are blocking out state investigators and when the people that are in charge, that are in power in the Trump administration, have already said what they think has happened here,” she said. “It seems clearly that it would be a prejudiced investigation to me.”
    


            Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem today stood by the comments she made immediately after the shooting death of a Minnesota mother by an ICE officer last week, when she said Renee Good committed an act of domestic terrorism by trying to run over an ICE agent.
    


            “If you look at what the definition of domestic terrorism is, it completely fits the situation on the ground,” Noem told Jake Tapper on CNN's “State of the Union.”
    


            She added: “This individual, as you saw in the video that we released just 48 hours after this incident, showed that this officer was hit by her vehicle. She weaponized it, and he defended his life and those colleagues around him and the public.”
    


            Pressed on how she could have asserted that there's no ambiguity in the situation or Good's motives before an investigation plays out, Noem said she had spoken to the officers and their supervisors and watched videos before she went to speak at the press conference after the shooting.
    


            Noem did not acknowledge the possibility that Good could have been fleeing the scene.
    


            “The facts of the situation are that the vehicle was weaponized, and it attacked the law enforcement officer. He defended himself, and he defended those individuals around him,” Noem said.
    


Context: On the day of the shooting, Noem held a press conference where she said good “refused to obey (the ICE officer's) commands. She then proceeded to weaponize her vehicle and she attempted to run a law enforcement officer over. This appears as an attempt to kill or to cause bodily harm to agents; an act of domestic terrorism.”
    


            When confronted on CNN's “State of the Union” with a video of January 6, 2021, rioters, who were pardoned by President Donald Trump, attacking law enforcement, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed that laws are equally enforced under the Trump administration.
    


            Anchor Jake Tapper asked Noem if she believes that law enforcement would have been justified in using deadly force against those attacking them on January 6, based on her assessment of the Minneapolis shooting.
    


            “Every single situation is going to rely on the situation those officers are in,” Noem said. “But they know that when people are putting hands on them, when they are using weapons against them, when they are physically harming them, that they have the authority to arrest those individuals, and make sure they're facing the consequences.”
    


            Pressed on Trump pardoning people who assaulted police officers that day, Noem said Trump is focused on equally enforcing laws.
    


            “Every single one of these investigations comes in the full context of the situation on the ground,” Noem said. “That's one thing that President Trump has been so focused on, is making sure that when we're out there, we don't pick and choose which situations are and which laws are enforced and which ones aren't. Every single one of them is being enforced under the Trump administration.”
    


            Tapper responded, “I showed you video of people attacking law enforcement officers. Undisputed proof, undisputed evidence, and I just said, ‘President Trump pardoned all of them,' and you said that President Trump is enforcing all the laws equally. It's just not true.”
    


            Noem responded: “These instances and these investigations all have to be taken and done and done correctly in context of every situation that is happening on the ground,” adding that her department is making sure it is “targeting the worst of the worst, and that we're talking factually about each situation.”
    


            Minnesota Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said the federal government is stoking “chaos” with its heavy-handed immigration enforcement efforts in the wake of last week's shooting death of a US citizen.
    


            “What we have seen in Minneapolis is ICE agents oftentimes jumping out of their cars. These are unmarked cars. Oftentimes they're wearing a mask. They're approaching, running towards cars. They're pulling people out of those cars. Oftentimes, these people are citizens,” Omar said Sunday on CBS' “Face The Nation.”
    


            “What they are doing is creating confusion, chaos, trying to intimidate people from being able to exercise their regular, normal activities that they would,” she added.
    


            Omar's comments come in the wake of Wednesday's ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis that killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.
    


            Omar said it is important for Americans to “create the level of accountability and transparency that we need” when it comes to ICE-involved activities.
    


            “Oftentimes these people have documentation of their legal right to be in this country, and we know that DHS has lied repeatedly when it comes to these accounts, so it is even more important for there to be recording from eyewitnesses every single time these actions are taking place,” Omar said.
    


            “There is no reason to have over 2,000 people coming into our city and creating the level of terror that they have,” she added.
    


            It's “quite likely” that American companies will have an expanded presence in Venezuela but exactly how that's going to work will “unfold over time,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Sunday, despite skepticism in the industry about Venezuela being a viable investment.
    


            “Venezuela has been a very dangerous, very destabilized place,” Wright told CBS News' “Face the Nation.”
    


            “With United States influence now, by controlling the sale of their oil and therefore the flow of funds into the country, we think we will see relatively rapid change, improvement on the ground in Venezuela.”
    


            These comments come after President Donald Trump met with more than a dozen energy executives at the White House Friday as his administration is working to convince the companies to reinvest in Venezuela. Several of the executives expressed reluctance, warning that the industry would first need to secure extensive security and financial guarantees before beginning a yearlong effort to ramp up oil production.
    


            “We had a great meeting with oil executives. We sort of formed a deal,” Trump told reporters as he prepared to depart to Mar-A-Lago for the weekend.
    


            Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday that they are sending “hundreds more” officers to Minneapolis today and tomorrow.
    


            “We're sending more officers today and tomorrow, they'll arrive. There will be hundreds more in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely,” Noem said on Fox New's Sunday Morning Futures.
    


            A DHS spokesperson clarified to CNN that Customs and Border Patrol officers will be sent.
    


            Noem criticized Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for what she called a failure to help and work alongside ICE's efforts, accusing them of putting criminal undocumented immigrants above their constituents.
    


            “They've said they're not going to help us, so we'll make sure that we protect our officers, but we also follow through on making sure these criminals are brought to justice,” Noem said.
    


            Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem today called on officials in Minnesota to “grow up,” following their complaints that federal officials aren't cooperating with state and local officials on investigating the killing of a Minnesota woman by an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agent.
    


            Asked on CNN's “State of the Union,” about those complaints, Noem homed in on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who she said have politicized the shooting and encouraged “destruction” and “violence” in the city.
    


            “They've extremely politicized and inappropriately talked about the situation on the ground in their city. They have inflamed the public. They have encouraged the kind of destruction and violence that we have seen in Minneapolis the last several days,” Noem said. “I would encourage them to grow up, get some maturity, act like people who are responsible, who want people to be safe, and the right thing be done.”
    


            As for DHS, Noem said, “We do work with locals when they work with us, but on the investigation piece of it, ICE and the Department of Homeland Security have a process and a protocol that we've always followed, and we're doing the same thing in this situation.”
    


            Noem clarified that she wanted local officials to work with DHS to arrest criminal undocumented immigrants.
    


            White House Border Czar Tom Homan asked people who are critical of the response to the deadly ICE shooting in Minneapolis to “tone down the rhetoric” and defends the officer involved.
    


            “I truly believe this officer, in his mind, thought his life was in danger which allows him to use lethal force,” Homan said Sunday in an interview with NBC's “Meet the Press” today.
    


            “Let the investigation play out,” Homan said pointing to other potential evidence that could emerge. “There's a lot of video we probably haven't seen that the FBI has that we don't. Where's the forensics and the ballistics? That hasn't been released. How about the officer's statements?”
    


            “We need to let this play out, but while we're doing that, we've got to stop the hateful rhetoric,” Homan said. “Saying this officer is a murderer is dangerous. It's just ridiculous. It's going to infuriate people more, which means there's going to be more incidents like this because the hateful rhetoric is not only continuing, it has tripled down and doubled down.”
    


            As Homan made the point that people should wait for more details, he was pressed multiple times on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision to say the woman who was shot and killed during the incident was committing an “act of terrorism.”
    


            “I'm not going to judge what the secretary says, but if you look at the definition of terrorism it certainly can fall within in that,” Homan said. “I think we've all got to agree, there's no reason for this lady to do what she did.”
    


            Homan said people have the right to protest, but he warned protesters: “Don't actively impede and interfere, and certainly don't drive a 4,000-pound vehicle toward an officer.”
    


            President Donald Trump is weighing a series of potential military options in Iran following deadly protests in the country, two US officials told CNN, as he considers following through on his recent threats to strike the country should they use lethal force against the Iranian people.
    


            Trump was briefed in recent days on different plans for intervention, the officials told CNN, as violence in the country has led to dozens of deaths and arrests. Some of the discussions have also included options that do not involve direct US military force, one of the officials said.
    


            The president has not yet made a final decision on intervention, the officials said, but he is seriously considering action as the death toll in Iran continues to rise.
    


            “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before,” Trump posted to social media on Saturday. “The USA stands ready to help!!!”
    


            On Friday, Trump told reporters that if Tehran engaged in deadly violence against protestors, the US would “get involved.”
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke Saturday about the ongoing protests, two sources familiar with the call said. The leaders also discussed the situation in Syria and Gaza, they said.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Sunday it is “monitoring developments” in Iran as the country enters its third week of anti-government protests.
    


            Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey pushed back today on Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's claims surrounding the shooting death of a Minnesota mother by an ICE officer last week.
    


            Frey strongly condemned the incident and urged ICE officers to get out of Minneapolis after 37-year-old mother of three Renee Good was shot and killed by a federal officer in Minneapolis Wednesday.
    


            In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” moments earlier, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Good had been engaging in domestic terrorism and that Frey needed to tone down his rhetoric around the incident.
    


            “She's calling Minneapolis this dystopian hell hole. You know how many shootings we've had so far this year? Two, and one of them was ICE,” Frey told Tapper.
    


            Frey doubled down on his assertion that the officer who shot Good was “a federal agent recklessly using power that ended up in somebody dying.”
    


            “Am I biased in this? Of course. I'm biased, because I got two eyes. Anybody can see these videos, anybody can see that this victim is not a domestic terrorist,” Frey said.
    


            The mayor called for an independent investigation into the shooting.
    


            “It should be a neutral, unbiased investigation, where you get the facts,” he said. “And by the way, I shouldn't be the one conducting the investigation, nor should Kristi Noem, but you should have an entity that is able to do it with some common sense and operating in reality.”
    


            Democratic Sen. Mark Warner expressed no appetite today to potentially force another government shutdown over demands to place restrictions on ICE after a fatal shooting by an agent in Minneapolis.
    


            “I think we went through the longest government shutdown in American history last year. I don't think we need to repeat it,” Warner told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”
    


            Some progressives have been urging the party to draw a “red line” in negotiations over ICE provisions in a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security through the fiscal year.
    


            Warner, who voted against the GOP-led short-term package last fall to reopen government through this month, urged Congress to forge ahead with bipartisan appropriations bills and “keep the government operating.”
    


            The Virginia Democrat said “we're starting to see a little bit of splintering” as some lawmakers cross party lines on bipartisan initiatives, like the five Republicans who crossed party lines and backed advancing a resolution to limit President Trump's war powers in Venezuela.
    


            “Congress has got to provide some level of check on Donald Trump again,” he said.
    


            Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said today there should be more checks on President Donald Trump's ability to intervene militarily around the world than the president's own “morality.”
    


            “We're depending on Donald Trump's morality to decide whether we put troops in harm's way. That is not what our Constitution set up. That is why our country was founded on the notion that one individual can't take our country to war. You've got to consult with Congress, which this president has completely blown off throughout his whole first year,” he told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”
    


            Trump suggested in an interview with The New York Times last week that his “morality” was the only thing that could stop him from wielding American military power abroad. The paper also reported this weekend that the president has been briefed on new options for strikes in Iran as unrest mounts amid anti-regime protests.
    


            Warner acknowledged that leaders like Nicolás Maduro are “bad guys,” but added, “the last thing I thought was Donald Trump was going to be the world's policeman for his moral view of the world. That's not what, I think, we signed up for.”
    


            He argued that the US should put “as much pressure in support of the Iranian people” on the region as possible, but warned that military intervention could lead to strategic consequences and impact the “internal dynamics” of Iran.
    


            “I want to know what the president talking about. Is he simply talking about another airstrike? Is he talking about boots on the ground in Iran to take out military facilities?” Warner asked, pointing out that an aircraft typically stationed in the Middle East is currently off the coast of Venezuela. “We get stretched pretty thin.”
    


            Elsewhere, President Donald Trump said yesterday the US is ready to help the Iranian people — without spelling out what that help might look like — posting a message in solidarity with those standing up to the Iranian regime.
    


            “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!” Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday.
    


            Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, today also told the Iranian people that they've caught the president's attention, forecasting that their “long nightmare” would soon be over.
    


            “Your bravery and determination to end your oppression has been noticed by @POTUS and all who love freedom,” Graham said on X.
    


            Graham elaborated on what he believes Trump means by “Make Iran Great Again” and signaled “help is on the way.”
    


            “It means the protestors in Iran must prevail over the ayatollah. That is the clearest signal yet that he, President Trump understands Iran will never be great with the ayatollah and his henchmen in charge. To all who are sacrificing in Iran, God bless. Help is on the way,” Graham said.
    


            Without elaborating further on what role the Defense Department might play, Secretary Pete Hegseth reposted Trump's message that “The USA stands ready to help” the Iranian people.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio also posted yesterday that “The United States supports the brave people of Iran.”
    


            Nationwide outcry over the killing of a Minneapolis woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent spilled into the streets of cities across the US on Saturday, with protesters demanding the removal of federal immigration authorities from their communities and justice for the slain Renee Good.
    


            In Minneapolis, snow flurries drifted down as thousands of people gathered in parks, along residential streets and outside federal buildings, chanting Good's name, whose death has become a focal point of national outrage over federal authorities' tactics in US cities while carrying out President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown.
    


            Similar protests unfolded across the US – from Los Angeles and New York to Washington, DC, El Paso and Boston. More than 1,000 demonstrations were planned across the country this weekend by the “ICE out for good” national coalition of advocacy groups.
    


            “The response to ICE's horrific killing of Renee Nicole Good is loud, peaceful, and inescapable,” coalition member group Indivisible said in a Saturday Facebook post accompanied by images of protests in multiple cities.

            President Donald Trump has renewed his calls for the US to take control of Greenland, telling reporters last week that if he is not able to acquire the Arctic territory “the easy way,” then he will have to “do it the hard way.”



            Officials and residents in the autonomous Danish territory insist it is not for sale.
    


            Here's part of the reason why control of the island is so significant:

            Nationwide outcry over the killing of a Minneapolis woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent spilled into the streets of cities across the US on Saturday, with protesters demanding the removal of federal immigration authorities from their communities and justice for the slain Renee Good.
    


            In Minneapolis, snow flurries drifted down as thousands of people gathered in parks, along residential streets and outside federal buildings, chanting Good's name, whose death has become a focal point of national outrage over federal authorities' tactics in US cities while carrying out President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown.
    


            Similar protests unfolded across the US – from Los Angeles and New York to Washington, DC, El Paso and Boston. More than 1,000 demonstrations were planned across the country this weekend by the “ICE out for good” national coalition of advocacy groups.
    


            “The response to ICE's horrific killing of Renee Nicole Good is loud, peaceful, and inescapable,” coalition member group Indivisible said in a Saturday Facebook post accompanied by images of protests in multiple cities.
    


            The demonstrations are in response to “the escalation of ICE violence in our communities,” the fatal ICE shooting of Good as well as “the months-long pattern of unchecked violence and abuse in marginalized communities across America,” the coalition said, noting that all gatherings are meant to be “nonviolent, lawful, and community-led” actions to honor the people who have died in ICE confrontations and demand accountability.
    


            Now, “hundreds more” Customs and Border Patrol officers will be sent to Minneapolis, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures.
    


            “We're sending more officers today and tomorrow, they'll arrive. There will be hundreds more in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely,” Noem said.
    


            After Mayor Jacob Frey strongly condemned the shooting and urged ICE agents to get out of his city last week, Noem told CNN's Jake Tapper Sunday that Frey and other leaders needed to tone down their rhetoric.
    


            In a separate interview with Tapper on Sunday, Frey doubled down on his assertion the officer who shot Good was “a federal agent recklessly using power that ended up in somebody dying.”
    


            Frey called for a “neutral” and “unbiased” investigation into the shooting.
    


            “And by the way, I shouldn't be the one conducting the investigation, nor should Kristi Noem, but you should have an entity that is able to do it with some common sense and operating in reality,” he said.
    


            Saturday's protests in Minneapolis started at Powderhorn Park, a historic spot for demonstrations and a central gathering place during the 2020 protests after the killing of George Floyd, whose deadly encounter with police occurred not far from where Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was fatally shot.
    


            From there, thousands marched through nearby neighborhoods before converging on the street where Good died Wednesday morning.
    


            As temperatures hovered near 20 degrees, demonstrators shared blankets and hot drinks, holding signs reading “ICE will melt,” and “It's not very pro-life to kill our neighbors,” as repeated chants of Good's name echoed through the park and surrounding streets.
    


            Elsewhere in the city, loud bangs rang out and agents fired pepper balls at a much smaller crowd of protesters outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, where demonstrators have been confronting ICE agents during daily protests.
    


Whistles, then gunfire: How the deadly ICE shooting unfolded in Minneapolis



            According to CNN's Omar Jimenez, who was on the scene, the law enforcement presence outside the facility increased significantly after several instances of cars being hit with snow and ice, or protesters trying to block vehicles from leaving the facility. Jimenez reported that rallies at the Whipple building have been more confrontational than other demonstrations around the city, as the location puts protesters directly across from the federal agents they're protesting against.
    


            During a large protest of about 1,000 people Friday night in downtown Minneapolis, some individuals “broke off” from the crowds and began spraying graffiti and causing damage to the windows of a hotel, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said at a news conference Saturday. Demonstrators have converged outside hotels where they believe federal agents are staying in the Twin Cities.
    


            More than 200 Minneapolis police officers and state troopers responded, and 29 people were detained, cited and later released, O'Hara said, noting one officer suffered minor injuries.
    


            Mayor Jacob Frey said Saturday that most demonstrators had acted peacefully but warned that those who damaged property or endangered others would be arrested. “We cannot take the bait,” Frey said. “We will not counter chaos with chaos.”
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz echoed that message, urging protesters to remain peaceful while sharply criticizing federal authorities.
    


            “Trump sent thousands of armed federal officers into our state, and it took just one day for them to kill someone,” Walz wrote on social media. “Now he wants nothing more than to see chaos distract from that horrific action. Don't give him what he wants.”
    


            The protests also unfolded amid a growing dispute over federal transparency, after three Minnesota Democrats – Reps. Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison – said they were turned away from an attempted oversight visit to a Minneapolis immigration facility on Saturday. A recent court ruling temporarily blocked a Trump administration policy limiting congressional visits.
    


            Large crowds of demonstrators were seen in major cities such as Philadelphia, New York, Washington, DC, and Los Angeles. Smaller protests took place in Portland, Oregon; Sacramento, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Denver, Colorado; Durham, North Carolina; and Tempe, Arizona, where protesters lined a bridge overlooking a highway.
    


            By Saturday afternoon, demonstrators were marching through downtown Los Angeles, holding signs that read “ICE out for good,” and chanting “Trump must go now.”
    


            As night fell, about 150 protesters gathered outside a strip of federal buildings along Alameda Street, outfitted with upside-down American flags and handmade anti-ICE posters. Much of the crowd dispersed after officers blocked off a nearby intersection, but a small group remained. Police later issued a dispersal order, citing vandalism.
    


            “Several arrests” were made and at least one person was detained for battery on a police officer after initially fleeing the scene and later returning to the area, the LAPD said on social media. CNN reached out to police for more details.
    


            In Washington, DC, demonstrators marched in front of the White House despite steady rain, holding signs condemning federal immigration tactics and calling for state oversight of ICE.
    


            “I'm deeply concerned about the 10th Amendment being downtrodden by this administration and about the lives of common American citizens being endangered by a government that, in my opinion, has gone beyond its law enforcement responsibilities,” Jack McCarty, a protester who said he is originally from Minnesota, told CNN.
    


            When asked by CNN what he believes needs to happen to ensure a death like Good's never happens again, McCarty said, “I think independent accountability and oversight over ICE activities at the state level, in addition to empowering state lawmakers and investigators to be able to hold ICE agents accountable for actions within their state is a step forward to ensuring this tragedy never happens again.”
    


            In Austin, Texas, some protesters confronted armed officers outside a federal building. Several armed law enforcement officials wore helmets and masks and stood outside while holding batons, CNN affiliate KEYE reported.
    


            “I'm glad we're taking to the streets,” protester David Whitfield told KEYE. “I think this is the type of action that we need. We really need people out here right now. I think the turnout could be bigger.”

US President Donald Trump is weighing the possibility of ordering new strikes against Iran in response to Tehran's crackdown on protests and riots triggered by soaring inflation, the New York Times reported on Saturday, citing American officials familiar with the discussions.

According to the newspaper, Trump has been briefed in recent days on several attack options, including strikes on non-military targets in Tehran, but has not made a final decision. The president has issued multiple threats against Iran in the past and publicly voiced support for protesters on Saturday.

“Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.

The protests erupted in Iran on December 28 after the collapse of the national currency led to sharp increases in the price of food and other staple goods. Demonstrations quickly escalated into widespread unrest, with rioters clashing with police and attacking government institutions in Tehran and other cities. Authorities cut internet and phone connections nationwide on Thursday in an effort to contain the violence.

Tehran has accused the US and Israel of fueling the unrest. “Believing that the Islamic Republic of Iran is like other countries, the US is pursuing the same measures by encouraging certain individuals to create chaos and riots,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote on X on Saturday.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei denounced the threats as “baseless,” saying the country “will not back down against vandals.”

The US carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities in June 2025 in support of Israel's 12-day air campaign against the country. Tehran responded with a missile barrage targeting a US base in Qatar, causing no casualties.

A Nobel Peace Prize cannot be withdrawn or handed over to another person, the organization behind the award has said, ruling out the possibility of it being transferred to US President Donald Trump.

The clarification came after the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Venezuelan opposition figure Maria Corina Machado, told Fox News earlier this week that “the Venezuelan people, because this is a prize of the Venezuelan people, certainly want to give it to him [Trump] and share it with him.”

The US president has been actively campaigning to get the prize since taking office a year ago, but the organizers opted to present it to Machado during a ceremony in Oslo, Norway in December.

A statement published on the Nobel Prize office website on Friday stressed that the award “can neither be revoked, shared, nor transferred to others. Once the announcement has been made, the decision stands for all time.”

The statement did not directly mention Trump or Machado, but noted that the organizers “receive a number of requests for comments regarding the permanence of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate's status.”

“As a matter of principle, the Norwegian Nobel Committee will not comment upon what the Peace Prize Laureates may say and do after they have been awarded the prize,” it added.

When asked by Fox News about the willingness of the Venezuelan opposition figure to give her Nobel Prize to him, Trump responded by saying that he has “heard that she wants to do that, that would be a great honor.”

The US president also announced that Machado will be visiting Washington next week. “I look forward to saying hello to her,” he said.

Machado fully backed the US intervention into Venezuela and the kidnapping of its president, Nicolas Maduro, in early January. However, last week, Trump dismissed her as a potential new head of the oil-rich Latin American country. “I think it'd be very tough for her to be the leader. She doesn't have the support or the respect within the country. She's a very nice woman but she doesn't have the respect,” he said.

BRATISLAVA, January 11. /TASS/. In an interview with TA-3 television channel, Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico expressed his strong opinion that Kaja Kallas should resign from her position as the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs.

""We must replace Ms. Kallas,"" Fico asserted, emphasizing that her leadership has significantly hindered the EU's ability to respond effectively to contemporary challenges or to establish a coherent stance on current international issues.

""The EU is facing an unprecedented crisis,"" he declared. ""Only those who are resilient - whether economically, militarily, or in the energy sector - will endure."" Fico pointed out that the post-World War II global order has been fundamentally altered following the US military intervention in Venezuela, and he is awaiting the EU's response to these developments.

He also reaffirmed that the EU constitutes Slovakia's ""living space"" and that his country remains an integral part of it. Looking ahead, Fico announced plans to discuss Slovak-American cooperation with President Donald Trump during his upcoming visit to the United States, with a particular focus on EU-related issues.

Regarding military involvement, Fico confirmed that Slovakia, under his leadership, will not send troops to Ukraine. Instead, Bratislava will continue providing humanitarian aid. He criticized France and the United Kingdom for their plans to deploy soldiers to Ukraine, describing such actions as provocative and potentially escalating the conflict.

""It's perplexing that two of the Soviet Union's former staunch allies during World War II - Great Britain and France - are pursuing such provocative policies,"" Fico stated. ""This is a provocation. Russian officials have warned that any foreign soldier on Ukrainian territory will be considered a legitimate target. I ask: is this about peace or war? Are we willing to start a conflict at any cost? What are we truly discussing?""

Fico expressed his belief that the strategy of weakening Russia through military conflict in Ukraine is ineffective and does not lead to a sustainable resolution.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, January 11. /TASS/. The European Union's potential sanctions against the United States are unlikely to be effective, Andrey Klishas, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Legislation and Statehood in Russia's upper house of parliament, said, commenting on a Sunday Telegraph report.

""We are looking forward to the EU's first package of sanctions against the US, which is going to be as ineffective as the 101st package of restrictions on Russia,"" he wrote on Telegram.

The Sunday Telegraph reported earlier, citing sources, that the EU was working on sanctions against American companies over US President Donald Trump's plans to acquire Greenland.

Trump stated in March 2025 that the United States would annex Greenland, a self-ruling territory of Denmark. The American leader has repeatedly said that Greenland should become a part of the United States. He threatened to impose high trade duties on Denmark if it did not give up the island. Even during his first term, Trump offered to buy Greenland. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has rejected these ambitions, stressing that Greenland is part of Denmark.

In 1951, Washington and Copenhagen, in addition to their allied commitments to NATO, signed the Greenland Defense Treaty. Under it, the United States committed to defending the island from aggression.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Michael Steele argues law firms, universities and media capitulated with startling speed and voters want accountability

The biggest surprise of Donald Trump's first year back in office is how quickly America's institutions capitulated to “the bully”, said Michael Steele, a former chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC) turned arch critic.

But with the midterm elections for Congress looming, Steele predicts a resounding Democratic victory amid a hunger among voters to hold the president and his allies accountable for threatening democracy.

Steele, 67, was the first Black chair of the RNC and coined the phrase “Drill, baby, drill!” in a speech at the 2008 Republican national convention. He was implacably opposed to Trump's takeover of the party and is now a co-host of The Weeknight on the liberal-leaning MS NOW network.

As the first anniversary of Trump's second inauguration approaches, Steele said the president's authoritarian assault on the constitution and rule of law was more expected than the way in which many law firms, universities and media companies caved.

“The only thing that would be surprising is the speed with which institutions collapsed,” he said in a recent phone interview. “I thought that there would be more resistance from lawyers and institutions of higher learning than we've seen.

“The administration came out of the gate with an everything-everywhere-all-at-once strategy that overwhelmed institutions and processes in a way that it was easier to collapse and give in than to stand and resist. The few institutions that did have proven that in the long run was probably the better strategy.”

Trump targeted law firms that opposed his policies or were involved in investigations related to the 2016 election. The threats included revoking security clearances, restricting access to federal buildings and terminating government contracts. Many firms negotiated settlements that involved providing pro bono legal services aligned with Trump's priorities.

The White House also hit elite universities with funding freezes totalling more than $5bn in federal grants and contracts, often linked to investigations into alleged antisemitism; diversity, equity and inclusion practices; or perceived liberal biases. This led many to negotiate financial settlements, policy changes and oversight concessions to restore funding. Harvard was a notable holdout.

Steele commented: “Once you beholden yourself to a bully, you will always be bullied. It's not a complicated narrative. In that regard, I'm not surprised by the ultimate outcome but I am surprised at the speed with which we've gotten there. Literally within six months of taking the oath of office, Donald Trump had pretty much slapped the crap out of everything and everyone he could and instead of fighting back they cowered in a corner.”

As Trump's first year wore on, there were signs of dissenters finding their footing. Millions of people took to the streets in No Kings protests. Disney reinstated ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel after its decision to suspend him over comments about Charlie Kirk was met with criticism from unions, free speech advocates and some Republicans, as well as millions of cancelled subscriptions.

But Steele cautioned that, even if 79-year-old Trump's pace slows in his second year in office, his allies are eager to maintain the moment. “I guess at a certain point an old man will run out of steam, but he's got enough other engines around him in [Steve] Bannon and [Stephen] Miller and [Kash] Patel and the like that they will keep things going.

“They know what he wants. They have bought into his diktats. They see themselves benefiting directly and indirectly from everything that is happening so they will continue to pursue those agendas.”

Steele grew up Washington DC, studied at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and spent three years as a seminarian in the Order of St Augustine in preparation for the priesthood. He joined the Republican party in 1976 and became the first Black person elected to statewide office in Maryland, serving as lieutenant governor from 2003 to 2007.

Steele was elected chair of the RNC 10 days after Barack Obama was sworn in as the US's first Black president in 2009. He oversaw major gains for the party in Congress, governor's mansions and state legislatures in the 2010 midterm elections but lost the chairmanship to Reince Priebus the following year.

Steele opposed Trump from the start and had a spell at the Lincoln Project, a group formed by anti-Trump Republicans, while also pursuing a media career. He became a pundit then a presenter on MSNBC, recently rebranded MS NOW, where since last May he has co-hosted The Weeknight with Alicia Menendez and Symone Sanders-Townsend.

He remains a pungent critic of the president. When, for example, the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington was rebranded the “Trump-Kennedy Center”, Steele posted on social media: “So pathetic. Such a lonely, desperate cry for acceptance. A craving not even his family can satisfy – he has to appropriate another family's legacy.”

He voted for Democrats Joe Biden in 2020 and Kamala Harris in 2024 but has not quit his party, describing himself as a “Motel 6 Republican” who has to “leave the lights on” in the hope the party will find its way back to its principles. When that day comes, he hopes, the legions of Trump enablers who indulged his autocratic tendencies will face a reckoning.

Steele said: “For me the most important conversation Democrats and independents and like-minded Republicans like myself need to be having is: are we prepared to hold every last one of these folks accountable? You may be doing Donald Trump's bidding but, at a certain point, Donald Trump will no longer be president and you will be exposed.”

He continued: “That, to me, is the next big piece in conversations going into the '26 cycle: why the Democrats need to take the Congress, why the Democrats are in a position to make the Senate competitive. A lot more Americans are going to align themselves with demanding some level of accountability and wanting that process to unfold.

“It's not impeachment of the president, because we've done that twice and failed. But individuals in their capacities as secretaries and administrators and directors and advisers can be held accountable and must be held accountable.”

With Trump sinking in the polls, Steele believes that Democrats should be looking to pick up a minimum of 30 to 35 seats in November's midterm elections for the House of Representatives. “There are a lot of similar similarities to what I saw on the political landscape in 2010 that will be relevant some 16 years later in 2026 that can give you a very good indicator of how things could play out.”

The former Republican chair noted the Democrats' run of successes in elections in 2025, including the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races and Proposition 50 in California, which allows the use of new congressional districts drawn to benefit Democrats in an effort to counter redraws by Republicans in Texas and other states.

“All of these are very important indicators for Democrats that are signals from the American voter about how they're looking at these things,” he said. “And how they are going to respond.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Exclusive: Before Randall Gamboa Esquivel died, his health had deteriorated badly while he was in ICE custody

Costa Rican family demands answers after ICE deportation and death: ‘Have you ever smelled a cadaver?'

The family of a Costa Rican man who was deported from the United States in a vegetative state and died shortly after arriving back in his home country is still urgently seeking answers from the authorities about what happened to him while he was in detention.

Randall Gamboa Esquivel had left Costa Rica in good health and crossed the United States-Mexico border in December 2024, according to his family. However, Gamboa was detained by the US authorities for re-entering American soil unlawfully, as he had previously lived there undocumented between 2002 and 2013.

Gamboa was initially held at the Webb county detention center in Laredo and then transferred to the Port Isabel detention center in Los Fresnos, both in south Texas. Nearly 10 months later, in September 2025, the Trump administration flew the 52-year-old to the Costa Rican capital of San José on an air ambulance.

He never came round and five weeks later Gamboa was pronounced dead at a hospital in Pérez Zeledón, his home town, around three hours south of the capital.

The Guardian spoke with relatives, neighbors and old friends in Costa Rica who remain shocked and outraged about what happened. His younger sister, Greidy Mata, said she is still trying to make sense of how his health deteriorated so badly while in the custody of US Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE).

In an exclusive interview in Pérez Zeledón, Mata recounted that Gamboa had sounded and looked healthy when they talked via video calls while he was in detention, until 12 June, which marked their last conversation, after which he seemed to vanish. Mata waited for weeks to hear from him, but in fact Gamboa had fallen into a health crisis.

“My brother disappeared and we had to reach out to agencies, lawyers, consulates, anyone willing to help,” Mata said in Spanish, standing across the street from the hospital where Gamboa died on 26 October.

“How is it possible that a man that left healthy, tall, chubby, robust, came back dirty, looked abandoned, with ulcers on his entire body, in a vegetative state?” she said.

Medical records related to Gamboa's time in US custody and shared with the Guardian show that there was a transfer request for him from the Port Isabel detention facility to Valley Baptist medical center in Harlingen, 28 miles (45km) east, on 23 June.

According to a document included in the medical records and issued by Ice Health Service Corps (IHSC), a service within ICE that provides healthcare in immigration custody and assesses people slated for deportation, Gamboa was hospitalized with an “altered mental status”. The document also indicates he had been taking antipsychotic and antidepressant medications.

Relatives and friends denied Gamboa had a history of mental illness before he migrated to the US.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary at the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the parent company of ICE, said in an email response when asked about Gamboa's detention and health that: “While in custody, medical professionals diagnosed him with unspecified psychosis and hospitalized him at Valley Baptist Hospital so he could get proper mental health and medical care.”

McLaughlin added that medical care for those in the custody of ICE includes “dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility, and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care”. She added: “This is the best health care that many aliens have received in their entire lives.”

By 7 July, Gamboa had been diagnosed with at least 10 conditions, medical documents from the hospital show. Sepsis, a life-threatening reaction to an infection, is listed as his primary diagnosis, followed by rhabdomyolysis, a condition in which damaged muscle tissue breaks down rapidly.

Other conditions outlined in the records included protein malnutrition and toxic encephalopathy, caused by an infection or prolonged exposure to drugs, radiation or metals that ultimately alters brain function.

“I can't sleep thinking what would've happened if we knew he was sick? Why did they keep this information from us? We found out where he was in August,” said Mata, making an effort to keep a calm composure despite crying on the recent December afternoon in Pérez Zeledón when she gave an interview.

“The information didn't come from the Costa Rican consulate, nor ICE, it came from a lawyer whom we asked for help and who called us saying: ‘I found him in a bed, he follows you with his eyes, but can't talk, he is in a vegetative state',” she said.

Costa Rica's Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined an interview with the Guardian to discuss Gamboa's case. It also didn't answer a series of questions including whether any of their consular officers visited Gamboa during his hospitalization in Texas.

The director of Costa Rica's migration agency, Omer Badilla, said his office was notified that Gamboa was being deported back to San José, but didn't receive any details regarding his health.

According to a further document in Gamboa's medical reports from the hospital, a doctor who visited Gamboa on August 2 wrote: “He doesn't move or respond. He does blink at times … there is immobility and mutism present. The patient appears exhibiting the decerebrate posturing.”

“Decerebrate posturing” typically refers to a patient's arms and legs being held stiffly straight, with head arched back and toes pointed down. The doctor also noted that Gamboa was “undergoing tube placement”.

The medication list included in the medical records showed that by 7 August, nearly a month before his deportation to Costa Rica, Gamboa had received IV injections and more than a dozen medications. He was assessed as catatonic.

“At times this all seems like a horror story or a lie,” said Mata, as she prepared to mark Christmas while in mourning for her brother.

She said that when Gamboa came home, there was at first a flicker of optimism. “It was nice seeing and touching him again because it gave us hope that he could recover,” she said, adding: “But the doctors never said that ... and we realized then that the condition in which he arrived was irreversible.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Organisers clarify award ‘cannot be revoked, shared or transferred' after Venezuelan opposition leader's comments

The organisers of the Nobel peace prize have said it “cannot be revoked, shared or transferred” after Venezuela's opposition leader, María Corina Machado, said she wanted to give her award to Donald Trump.

When Machado was named Nobel laureate in October, it was seen as a snub by the White House, despite Machado rushing to dedicate the prize to the US president and his “decisive support of our cause”.

Trump has made no secret of his strongly held desire to be awarded the Nobel peace prize, the winner of which is selected by an independent five-person committee in Oslo.

After the US launched airstrikes and a raid in Venezuela that led to the seizure of its leader, Nicolás Maduro, Machado last week told Fox she wanted to “give it to him [Trump] and share it with him” on behalf of the Venezuelan people.

“What he has done is historic. It's a huge step towards a democratic transition,” she added.

Asked whether he would accept the Nobel peace prize from Machado, Trump, who has said he will meet with Machado in Washington this week, said “that would be a great honour”.

But the Norwegian Nobel Committee and the Norwegian Nobel Institute have since issued a warning indicating that such a transfer of the award would not be possible.

“The facts are clear and well established,” they said in a statement. “Once a Nobel prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared or transferred to others. The decision is final and stands for all time.”

Neither Alfred Nobel's will nor the statutes of the Nobel Foundation make any mention of being able to withdraw the Nobel prize, they said, citing the statutes, which say: “No action may be brought against the decision of the awarding committee in Stockholm or Oslo.”

None of the awarding committees have ever considered withdrawing a Nobel prize, they said, adding: “In principle, the Norwegian Nobel Committee never comments on what peace prize laureates say or do after they have been awarded the prize.”

Machado, who escaped Venezuela in December to secretly travel to Oslo with the intention of attending the Nobel prize ceremony, also spoke in support of Trump's military invasion of Venezuela and removal of Nicolás Maduro. So far, Trump has held off from backing her to lead the country and has put Washington's support behind Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's deputy.

“A lot of people, most people, said it was impossible to achieve what he has just done on Saturday, 3 January,” Machado told Fox.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

“I am happy to have won, but I didn't have much energy left in me,” the 24-year-old said. 

“If I had to play long rallies with him, I don't think I would be able to beat him,” he added.

The women's singles final saw world number one South Korean An Se-young clinch her third consecutive Malaysian Open title with a 21-15, 24-22 victory over China's Wang Zhiyi.

The 23-year-old was dominant in the first game, but had to overturn a 19-13 deficit in the second.

“I never give up and I always play with confidence. I'm happy to win, I do not think about titles,” said An, who won a record-equaling 11 BWF World Tour events last year.

Chinese world champions Tan Ning and Liu Shengshu beat South Koreans Baek Hana and Lee So-hee 21-18, 21-12 to win the women's doubles.

Their fellow Chinese and top seeds, Feng Yanzhe and Huang Dongping, were equally clinical in the mixed doubles, winning the final 21-19, 21-19 against compatriots Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin.

The men's doubles was won by South Korea's Kim Won-ho and Seo Seung-jae 21-15, 12-21, 21-28 against Malaysia's Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik.

The reigning NBA champions looked to be heading for a third straight loss after the Jazz inched into a 114-112 lead following Lauri Markkanen's layup with just three seconds remaining in the fourth quarter.

Thousands of farmers in Ireland and France on Saturday protested against the EU's trade deal with the South American bloc Mercosur, a day after EU states approved the treaty despite opposition from some members. 

In central Ireland, tractors streamed into the roads of Athlone for a demonstration, displaying signs including “Stop EU-Mercosur” and with the EU flag emblazoned with the words “sell out.” 

“We have good quality Irish beef and good standards here, and they don't have the same standards in South American countries,” said Trisha Chatterton, a 50-year-old farmer. “There is not a lot of traceability on their beef.”

The agreement is widely opposed by farmers for fear it would result in an influx of an extra 99,000 tonnes of cheap beef from South America, disrupting European agriculture. 

The Irish Farmers' Association (IFA), Ireland's main farmers' lobby group, called the result “very disappointing.” 

It said it would “renew” focus on securing a majority against the deal in the European Parliament. 

“We expect Irish MEPs [members of the European Parliament] to stand behind the farming community and reject the Mercosur deal,” IFA president Francie Gorman said in a statement. 

In France, police on Saturday ejected farmers occupying a fuel depot near Bordeaux in the southwest. 

Later in the day, other farmers tried to block road traffic to the port of Le Havre in the northwest. Two highways remained blocked on Saturday in the southwest of France, farmer unions said. 

Farmers on Friday also marched in Poland, and blocked roads in France and Belgium as the EU gave the green light to the trade deal. 

While the accord has been welcomed by business groups, European farmers have bitterly criticized it. 

The deal, more than 25 years in the making, would create one of the world's largest free-trade areas, boosting commerce between the 27-nation EU and the Mercosur bloc comprising Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay. 

Major Mercosur exports to the EU include agricultural products and minerals, while the EU would export machinery, chemicals and pharmaceuticals with lowered tariffs applied. 

Many European farmers fear their livelihoods would be undercut by a flow of cheaper goods from agricultural giant Brazil and its neighbors. 

Such concerns prompted Ireland, France, Poland, Hungary and Austria to vote against the accord. 

The Mercosur deal still has to be approved by a majority of MEPs in the European Parliament in the coming months, where voting coalitions have become more volatile and unpredictable.

The Anne Frank Trust UK, of which Schloss was honorary president, said she died on Saturday in London, where she lived.
Britain's King Charles III said he was “privileged and proud” to have known Schloss, who cofounded the charitable trust to help young people challenge prejudice.
“The horrors that she endured as a young woman are impossible to comprehend and yet she devoted the rest of her life to overcoming hatred and prejudice, promoting kindness, courage, understanding

The day-long procession began before dawn, with barefoot volunteers pulling the heavy carriage through narrow streets where the devout waited in hopes of touching the icon, believed to hold miraculous powers.

Ukrainian forces struck three Russian drilling platforms belonging to Lukoil, one of Russia's largest oil producers, in the Caspian Sea, Ukraine's General Staff reported on Jan. 11.

Separately, Ukraine also hit a Russian Buk-M3 anti-aircraft missile system in the occupied parts of Ukraine's Luhansk Oblast and other military assets, according to the statement.

The three Lukoil Corporation drilling platforms hit by Ukraine — the V. Filanovsky, Yuri Korchagin, and Valery Graifer platforms — are used for oil and gas extraction. 

""Direct hits have been recorded. The extent of the damage is being assessed,"" the statement reads.

These platforms supply fuel to the Russian army, according to Ukraine's Special Operations Forces (SSO), which carried out the strikes on the night of Jan. 11. The SSO also published video footage of the alleged attacks.

Oil and gas exports cover a major part of Russia's federal budget and play a significant role in sustaining Moscow's war in Ukraine.

Ukrainian forces also struck a warehouse and technical support unit of Russia's 49th Combined Arms Army in the area of the town of Novotroitske, in the Russian-occupied part of Kherson Oblast. This army group is the main Russian force in the region.

The Kyiv Independent was unable to verify the military's claims.

Ukraine has escalated its campaign against oil facilities inside Russia and Russian-occupied territories throughout 2025, primarily relying on domestically developed drones.

Ukraine's Special Operations Forces (SSO) carried out drone strikes on a Russian patrol ship and an oil platform in the Caspian Sea on Dec. 19. The attack also targeted a Russian oil platform located at the Filanovsky oil and gas field in the Caspian Sea.

At the start of the year, Russian forces used a new Geran-5 attack drone against Ukraine for the first time, military intelligence (HUR) reported on Jan. 11.

The unmanned vehicle, which resembles the Iranian-designed Karrar drone, utilizes the Telefly jet engine, though with a greater thrust than the Geran-3 model, according to HUR.

Attack drones play a key role in Russia's aerial campaign against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, which escalated in recent weeks as Moscow seeks to knock out the country's energy grid.

The new drone is approximately 6 meters (20 feet) long with a wingspan of 5.5 meters (18 feet). Unlike other Geran models — which are based on the Iranian Shahed drones — the Geran-5 is built in a conventional aerodynamic configuration.

Other features resemble those of earlier models in the series, including the 12-channel satellite navigation system Cometa, and a tracker based on the Raspberry Pi microcomputer and 3G/4G modems, HUR said.

The drone can carry a 90-kilogram warhead and has a claimed range of almost 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), meaning it could potentially reach any point in Ukraine.

According to Ukraine's intelligence, Russia is considering fitting attack aircraft like Su-25 with Geran-5s to increase their range. Equipping the drones with R-73 air-to-air missiles to counter Ukrainian aircraft is also being considered, HUR said.

As Russia seeks to modernize its drone fleet, Ukraine is also developing new tactics to counter Russian aerial strikes.

Apart from using Western-supplied air defenses, Ukraine has ramped up production of interceptor drones, designed to counter Russian Shaheds.

Just over the past week, Russian forces launched close to 1,100 strike drones against Ukraine, as well as 890 guided aerial bombs and 50 missiles, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 11.

Russian forces are attempting to create a beachhead for new offensive operations in Ukraine's northeast, potentially setting the stage for an ""advance toward the city of Sumy,"" the Ukrainian military reported on Jan. 11.

""All such attempts are promptly detected and thwarted,"" the 7th Corps of Ukraine's Airborne Assault Forces said on its Telegram channel.

Russian forces are reportedly intensifying operations in Sumy Oblast with the goal of advancing toward Khotin, a village located approximately 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) north of Sumy, the regional center.

Sumy, home to about 250,000 residents, has been a regular target of Russian shelling and aerial strikes but has never been occupied by Russia.

Russian forces currently hold a handful of settlements in parts of Sumy Oblast, primarily in the northern part of the region, adjacent to Russia's Kursk Oblast. According to the DeepState monitoring group, Moscow's troops were about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from Khotin as of Jan. 9.

Russian forces are ""routinely carrying out ground attacks and ramping up drone activity in certain areas,"" the 7th Corps reported, noting that Russia is avoiding frontal attacks and seeks to penetrate the flanks.

Soldiers of Ukraine's 78th Airborne Assault Brigade are facing units of Russia's 810th Marine Corps Brigade and the 9th Motor Rifle Regiment, according to the military.

""Our active defense and constant reconnaissance enable us to keep the situation fully under control,"" the 7th Corps reported.

After retreating from Sumy Oblast in 2022, Russia launched another offensive into the region last spring and summer after pushing Ukraine out of Kursk Oblast, seeking to establish a ""buffer zone"" in the area.

Ukraine said in September 2025 that the offensive had been ""completely thwarted,"" despite Russian forces continuing to hold limited territory there.

In December 2025, the ""Kursk"" Group of Forces said that Russian forces continued attempts to seize Ukrainian territory in the Sumy Oblast border area. Fighting was ongoing near the villages of Yunakivka, Yablunivka, Varachyne, Andriivka, and Kindrativka.

Russia also entered the border village of Hrabovske in the eastern part of Sumy Oblast at the end of last year, abducting 52 residents to Russia, an act considered a war crime.

Ukraine's State Border Guard reported on Jan. 11 that Russian forces continue to occupy Hrabovske, but Ukrainian troops prevent them from advancing further.

A Ukrainian drone strike killed one person and wounded three others in the Russian city of Voronezh, local officials said Sunday. Meanwhile, thousands of residents were still without power in Kyiv, following an intense Russian bombardment.

A young woman died overnight in a hospital intensive care unit after debris from a drone fell on a house during the attack on Saturday, Voronezh regional Gov. Alexander Gusev said on Telegram.

Three other people were wounded and more than 10 apartment buildings, private houses and a high school were damaged, he said, adding that air defences shot down 17 drones over Voronezh. The city is home to just over one million people and lies some 250 kilometres from the Ukrainian border.

Ukraine's General Staff said Sunday said its forces hit three drilling platforms operated by Russian oil giant Lukoil in the waters of the Caspian Sea. Ukraine's long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion.

The attacks came after Russia bombarded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight into Friday, killing at least four people in the capital Kyiv, according to Ukrainian officials. For only the second time in the nearly four-year war, Russia used a powerful new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine in a clear warning to Kyiv and NATO.

Ukraine's largest private energy supplier, DTEK, said Sunday that 30,000 people in Kyiv were still without power following the attack. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Friday around half the apartment buildings – nearly 6,000 – in snowy Kyiv were left without heat in daytime temperatures of about minus 8 degrees Celsius.

The intense barrage and the launch of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile followed reports of major progress in talks between Ukraine and its allies on how to defend the country from further aggression by Moscow if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday in his nightly address that Ukrainian negotiators “continue to communicate with the American side.”

Chief negotiator Rustem Umerov was in contact with U.S. partners on Saturday, he said.

Separately, Ukraine's General Staff said Russia targeted Ukraine with 154 drones overnight into Sunday and 125 were shot down.

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry's main intelligence directorate said Sunday that Russia this month deployed the new jet-powered “Geran-5” strike drone against Ukraine for the first time. The Geran is a Russian variant of the Iranian-designed Shahed.

According to the directorate, the drone can carry a 90-kilogram warhead and has a range of nearly 1,000 kilometres.

Ask a Doctor is a series of physician-authored columns offering insights and advice on common health topics. It is not a substitute for seeking medical care.

As an emergency doctor and a mom of young kids, I often see how quickly a regular day can turn into a nightmare. I've spent my career treating children who were just having fun – at birthday parties, the cottage or after-school adventures – when something went sideways and they ended up in the emergency room. 

We can't (and shouldn't) protect our kids from every bump or bruise, but seeing what I do for work has shaped how I think about acceptable risk. There are some things I simply don't let my kids do, not because I'm overprotective, but because I've seen what can happen when things go wrong. 

Trampoline use, especially in commercial parks, is a leading cause of fractures, head and neck injuries and spinal trauma, according to the Canadian Paediatric Society and Parachute, a national charity focused on injury prevention. In many cases, it's not reckless play that causes these injuries, but simple physics: A heavier child jumping beside a lighter one can lead to the so-called 'double jump,' resulting in leg injuries, a collision with another child's head or an awkward fall putting the spinal cord at risk. 

I've treated kids with broken bones, severe concussions or neck fractures after what was supposed to be a fun birthday party at a trampoline park. The risk just isn't worth it to me. 

There's a role for risky play in childhood, with solid evidence that it benefits a child's physical, mental and social development. Thankfully, there are plenty of ways for a child to engage in risky play where they are the ones in control. 

In my family, we focus on playgrounds, biking and climbing – situations where the ground is stable and the hazards are visible. And while my kids aren't allowed to jump at busy trampoline parks, I do let them jump solo on completely enclosed backyard trampolines, because I think the risk is significantly lower. 

Ask a Doctor: I'm a family doctor who practises in rural Canada. Here are five things I've learned

Every summer, the ER fills with all-terrain vehicle and off-road dirt bike injuries. As I've written before, helmets save lives, but they can't prevent every outcome when a 300-pound machine flips over or hits a tree. The Canadian Paediatric Society advises that children under 16 shouldn't operate ATVs at all because they lack the size, strength and good judgment to handle them safely. 

I've seen everything from broken bones and devastating head trauma to ruptured spleens and liver lacerations sustained in ATV or dirt bike accidents. Even with full protective gear, these crashes can be catastrophic. 

When my kids want that outdoor thrill, I have them stick to biking, frontcountry skiing or camping and hiking with family. They still get to feel capable and adventurous, just not at the controls of something that can lead to serious injury or death. 

Choking is one of my biggest fears as a mom and a doctor. A grape, a hot dog bite, a piece of popcorn – all of these foods are the perfect size to block a child's small airway. According to SickKids, choking is one of the most preventable injuries and leading causes of death in infants and children – often from small, round foods. 

The risk isn't only what kids eat, but how. Toddlers and young children frequently move around while snacking, and it takes only a minor trip or fall for food to obstruct the airway. 

The rule in our house is simple: If you're eating, you're sitting or standing still. We skip certain foods entirely (popcorn, hard candy or whole grapes) until our kids are old enough to manage them safely, which experts say is around age four. 

Food for Thought: Four nutrition trends to watch in 2026

Not every risk is related to physical injuries. Some involve emotional readiness and personal boundaries. Parents may think sleepovers are low risk but I've seen how easily situations can become unsafe, whether from bullying, exposure to inappropriate content or just being in a setting where a child doesn't yet have the confidence to say no or call for help. That's why I believe sleepover invitations should be considered carefully.

For my young kids, I've opted for ‘sleepunders' instead of sleepovers. When my kids are invited for sleepovers, I let them stay until bedtime and then pick them up to sleep at home. And their friends can come for dinner, movies and even pyjamas at our house, but at bedtime, everyone goes home.

As my first child has gotten older, and we've had ongoing conversations about potential risks, listening to discomfort and knowing how to advocate for themselves, we've revisited this rule and they can now attend some sleepovers that we both feel comfortable with.

While some parents may find it awkward to approach these conversations, there are resources that can help guide you.

In my work, I see how smartphones and social media use contribute to youth mental health crises. 

The U.S. Surgeon General has warned that frequent social media use is associated with higher rates of anxiety and depression in adolescents. The Canadian Paediatric Society has raised concerns about the effects of screen use on sleep and emotional well-being, particularly when children have unrestricted or unsupervised access. 

In our home, we use shared devices in public areas to look up information together or connect with friends and relatives. We recently reintroduced a land line so our kids can talk on the phone. The goal isn't to avoid technology, it's to delay the most high-risk aspects of it until our kids can navigate those spaces with more maturity and support. 

These decisions aren't about eliminating all risk or shielding my children from the world. They're about using the vantage point I have, shaped by years in emergency medicine, to identify the situations where a small adjustment can meaningfully reduce the chance of preventable harm. 

Dr. Shazma Mithani is an emergency physician working with adult and pediatric patients in Edmonton. Dr. Mithani is actively involved with the Canadian Medical Association, Alberta Medical Association and Sexual Assault Centre of Edmonton. She is also co-host of The Doc Talk Podcast.

Australia became the world's first country to ban social media for children under 16 on Wednesday, blocking them from platforms including TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and Facebook. The ban is being closely watched by other countries considering similar age-based measures as concerns grow over the impact of social media on children's health and safety.

Right-wing Trump supporters in Central and Southeastern Europe have operated in a legal gray area for years. After the US's attack on Venezuela, there's a growing awareness that Trump could pose a threat to them, too.

For years, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has tirelessly praised Donald Trump as a ""man of peace."" He sang the president's praises for brokering the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Orban also repeated Trump's claims that, if he had been US president in 2022, Russia would never have started its war against Ukraine. This is all part of Orban's ""peace rhetoric"" — a cornerstone of the Hungarian prime minister's current election campaign.

But, when the ""man of peace"" attacked Venezuela on January 3 and kidnapped its leader, Nicolas Maduro, Orban's channels went silent for hours. In the evening, two terse sentences appeared on the prime minister's Facebook page: There were ""no Hungarian casualties or injuries"" following the military action in Venezuela. Contact had been made with Hungary's embassies in the region to ensure that no Hungarians were in danger.

It was not until two days later, at his regular press conference at the beginning of the year, that Orban found a way to explain Trump's attack on Venezuela. It was about ""eliminating a narco-state,"" he said, adding that this was ""good news"" for Hungary.

Later, the prime minister posted a short video on Facebook showing Hungarian police officers conducting an anti-drug raid. Orban has not yet made any statements relating to the international legality of the US military intervention. 

Trump's attack on Venezuela and Maduro's arrest caught the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe, most of which are considered friendly to the US, off guard — especially those where populists and authoritarian Trump supporters are in power. Although many of the latter rule by circumventing existing legal systems at will, the attack on Venezuela plunged them into tight-lipped silence, with some even expressing horror.

In the weekly magazine HVG, Hungarian journalist Imre Para-Kovacs highlighted how there is a growing risk that other leaders could suffer a similar fate: ""Venezuela is the first country. But even the thick-headed politicians of Europe could quickly find themselves in a New York prison.""

Other observers point out that Russia is now the main threat to Central and Southeastern Europe in Trump's new world order. For Poland, journalist Artur Bartkiewicz sees ""very dark clouds gathering on the horizon,"" as he wrote in the newspaper Rzeczpospolita. Polish security expert Justyna Gotkowska posted on Facebook that Russia will ""put the US and its willingness to defend the borders it has maintained so far to the test.""

Poland's right-wing populist leader, President Karol Nawrocki, meanwhile, has not yet made his position clear. To date, he has said nothing about the US attack on Venezuela. In general, Polish right-wing populists and right-wing extremists have tended to be extremely cautious about responding to the attack.

Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski took a sarcastic tone on X: ""Another day goes by without our nationalists defending Venezuela's national sovereignty. Does it only apply to the European Union, which poses no threat?""

In Czechia, right-wing populist Andrej Babis, who has been back in office as head of government for a few weeks, also reacted cautiously and with a concerned undertone. ""Let's hope that all this will lead to the citizens of Venezuela being able to enjoy freedom and democracy and that they will elect a democratic government.""

Babis, a billionaire, is sometimes referred to as the ""Czech Trump"" and is known for quickly adjusting his stance depending on the political climate or his interests. He has been under investigation for years for subsidy fraud and has also been criticized for conflicts of interest between politics and business activities.

Unlike his Central European allies in Poland, Czechia, and Hungary, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico reacted to the news. ""International law no longer applies, military power is being used without a UN mandate, and anyone who is big and strong does whatever they want to assert their own interests,"" Fico wrote on Facebook hours after the US attack on Venezuela. ""As prime minister of a small country, I must resolutely reject such a violation of international law. I am curious to see how the EU will respond to the attack on Venezuela, which deserves to be condemned.""

A day later, Fico softened his tone slightly, saying he would do everything in his power to ensure that Slovakia ""never gets involved in military adventures."" 

Unlike Nawrocki, Babis, and Orban, Fico has a rather distant relationship with Trump. The Slovak prime minister is technically a social democrat, but in recent years he has increasingly shifted toward nationalist right-wing populism. He is currently trying to transform Slovakia along the lines of Orban's model. He increasingly claims that any criticism of this agenda is an anti-Slovak conspiracy, especially after an assassination attempt on him in May 2024, which he narrowly survived.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic also reacted in shock to the US attack on Venezuela. ""The international legal order and the UN Charter no longer work,"" Vucic said at a meeting of the National Security Council in Belgrade on January 3. ""The world is ruled by the law of force, the law of the strongest, and that is the only principle of modern politics that exists in the world today.""

These words sound cynical coming from the Serbian leader, a nationalist and right-wing populist, and a former information minister under dictator Slobodan Milosevic. He has ruled the largest country in the Western Balkans autocratically for over ten years, often operating on the edge of legality. He has tried to curry favor with Trump in various ways, most recently with a controversial real estate project in Belgrade led by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, which ultimately failed. Serbia's oil industry is currently under severe pressure due to US sanctions against the Russian energy sector. In addition, ongoing civil protests have been challenging Vucic's power for over a year.

Overall, Trump's policies reveal how politically isolated Central and Southeastern Europe's nationalist and populist rulers actually are. This is particularly true of Viktor Orban, who for years has been trying to forge an alliance of populists and right-wing extremists — with limited success.

Orban could now also become the biggest victim of the policies of the man he has been flattering vigorously for years. Hungary's prime minister has long boasted that he is the US president's closest ally in Europe. He has pushed the narrative that he, alongside Trump, stand for peace in Europe and the world — while ""warmongers"" are in power in Brussels. This line of argument collapsed overnight with Trump's military intervention.

Orban seems aware how this could rattle parliamentary elections in April. On January 9, he posted a personal letter from Trump (dated from early December) on Facebook. In it, the US president thanks Orban for an invitation to Hungary, but leaves open whether or not, and when, he will come. His post underscores how, for Orban, a visit by Trump during the election campaign would represent a huge boost.

Another round of US strikes has reportedly hit targets belonging to the militant Islamist group believed to be behind an attack that killed two US soldiers in Syria in December.

The United States and allied forces hit several positions of the so-called Islamic State (IS) militant group in Syria on Saturday, the US military said.

The strikes came as a response to a deadly ambush that left two US soldiers and a civilian interpreter dead in late December.

US Central Command (CENTCOM) said the strikes were conducted at 1730 GMT.

It said several IS positions were hit but gave no information on the possible number of casualties.

On December 13, US forces were ambushed in Palmyra by forces believed to belong to IS.

Another three people were injured in the attack.

In response, the Trump administration launched Operation Hawkeye Strike.

""Our message remains strong: if you harm our warfighters, we will find you and kill you anywhere in the world, no matter how hard you try to evade justice,"" CENTCOM said on Saturday.

But these were not the first retaliatory strikes. On December 19, another large-scale attack hit some 70 IS targets across central Syria.

US forces have been present in the country for years as part of an operation to fight against IS.

Although originally working with Kurdish forces in the north, the White House has also increased its ties with the new government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","As China sales slow, Germany's carmakers look to India","https://www.dw.com/en/how-german-cars-became-famous-and-how-they-fell-behind/a-75206421","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 17:47:32 GMT","

For decades, German cars symbolized engineering perfection and economic power. Now, sales are down as China, a key market, goes electric. India could fill some of that gap for German carmakers. But will it be enough?

The Nürburgring in the Western hills of Germany is the world's longest permanent race track. It's almost a century old and was the site of many Formula One Grand Prix races.

The track's main part is called the Nordschleife, or the Northern Loop. The 20.8-kilometer (12.9-mile) track is nicknamed the ""Green Hell"" — because of the surrounding forests of the Eifel region, and its punishing layout.

To understand the importance of engineering and performance in German carmaking, the Nordschleife is a good place to start, said Misha Charoudin, car racer and influencer.

""If a car can do a good lap time here, it means all the components work: suspension, tires, engine, chassis, and of course also the driver itself,"" he said, while barreling through a corner at 190 kilometers per hour (118 miles per hour). ""It's better than a roller coaster.""

All the big carmakers have test centers at the Nürburgring, he said. In fact, the testing of cars was an important reason for building the race track in 1927.

Germany's auto industry has used this legacy, and the no-speed-limit Autobahn, Germany's public highway system, to its advantage in advertising and brand building.

Brands like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi and Volkswagen stood for precision engineering, performance and reliability. They weren't just cars — they were cultural icons, and the backbone of Germany's economy.

But today, that magic is fading.

Germany's auto industry employs over a million people and has long been a barometer of economic health. In 1950, German car makers sold about 200,000 vehicles. Today, they sell around 14 million globally. For decades, the formula was simple: world-class engineering plus global demand equaled success.

But the good times are over. Sales are shrinking, jobs are being cut and factories face closure. ""The pressure rises, the cost savings are tremendous,"" said one Mercedes employee, who wished to remain unnamed. ""It's all about cost cuts everywhere.""

The first cracks appeared in 2015 with Dieselgate, when Volkswagen was caught cheating on emissions tests. The scandal cost VW more than €30 billion ($35 billion) and shattered trust in German brands. Worse, it coincided with a global pivot toward climate-friendly technologies. While Tesla doubled electric car sales, German manufacturers hesitated.

For years, China was the promised land. In the 1980s, China's political leaders invited Volkswagen (which in German translates to ""car of the people"") to form joint ventures and build cars in China, for China's people. There were times when Volkswagen's market share approached 50%.

Later, other carmakers followed suit. The more China's economy grew, the bigger the country's car market became. Until a few years ago, Germany's car makers sold every third car in China.

""It was gold digger time,"" recalled Beatrix Keim, who spent two decades with VW in China and is now a director at CAR, an industry consultancy in Duisburg. ""Selling lots of cars, earning lots of money. There was not much of a Chinese competition.""

But China had a plan: learn from foreign partners, then lead. In 2009, Beijing passed to law to pushelectric vehicles. ""It was not really driven by climate change,"" Keim explained. ""It was to find a technology where China had a chance to overtake the foreigners, where China could thrive.""

German carmakers didn't see this coming, she added. They had underestimated the determination of China's leadership, and the speed of development. 

Billions in subsidies and infrastructure later, China is now the world leader in electric vehicles and batteries. 

""Starting with EV, they had the once-in-a-lifetime chance to overtake Germany. And they did,"" said Manuel Vermeer, who teaches Chinese culture and business at the University of Applied Sciences in Ludwigshafen.

Today, every second car sold in China is electric — and almost all are Chinese brands. German sales have tanked in their most important market.

""I think it has a lot to do with arrogance"", said Vermeer. ""I've been conducting intercultural trainings for Germans regarding China for more than 30 years. And the German point of view is always: We are superior, how can we teach them what to do, they should learn from us. But hardly ever was it something like: We could learn from them, we should listen more, or maybe they are different from what we think?""

And Germany depends on China for batteries. ""Even if we build very good EV cars, we'd still need the batteries from China,"" said Vermeer. ""We are more dependent than we used to be.""

With China slipping away, attention is turning to India, now the world's most populous country. Could it be the next big thing?

If you watch the dense traffic in Chennai, a city in India's southeast, you rarely spot a German car. Indian, Japanese and Korean cars dominate the streets of the city that is often called ""India's Detroit,"" due to its many car factories.

BMW's Chennai plant produces just around 80 cars a day, compared to 1,400 at the carmaker's German flagship. Still, growth is strong — over 10% annually.

""There's a big rush to the Indian market,"" said plant manager Thomas Dose. ""Everybody feels like: if we are not in India now, we'll miss some opportunity.""

But Dose is realistic. ""Is India the new China? I would say no. It's India, it's different. It has its potential. But we will not have this extensive growth like in China.""

Experts agree. India's market is promising, but German carmakers face cultural hurdles. ""We want to sell the best cars in the world,"" said Vermeer. ""But that's over-engineering. In India, being at 80% works — get feedback, adapt. Our sense of 'perfect' is not the best thing for this market.""

Beatrix Keim believes German carmakers are trying to change. ""They understood they need to be faster, come down from their ivory tower and learn,"" she said. 

Meanwhile, the race for building successful electric vehicles is in full swing. In China, local EV manufacturers are struggling with overcapacities and falling prices. They are also trying to sell their EVs in Europe, so far with moderate success. 

But EV carmakers from China and elsewhere are testing their cars on Germany's own Nürburgring, a symbolic twist in a story of lost dominance.

Could German carmakers miss the boat entirely? ""It can happen,"" said racing Misha Charoudin. ""Look at [Finnish mobile phone maker] Nokia. They were thriving. And then all of a sudden, they missed the boat.""

Bob Weir, a founding member of the Grateful Dead, has died aged 78.

Weir was a guitarist and singer in the legendary jam band which became an icon of America's countercultural movement in the 1960s.

Together with frontman Jerry Garcia, Weir helped the band – which fused a wave of sounds including jazz, country, folk and psychedelia – to become one of the most important groups in the history of rock music.

According to a family statement posted to his Instagram page on Saturday, Weir “succumbed to underlying lung issues” after overcoming cancer.

“It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,” the statement said.

“He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.

“For over sixty years, Bobby took to the road. A guitarist, vocalist, storyteller, and founding member of the Grateful Dead. Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music.

“His word did more than fill rooms with music; it was warm sunlight that filled the soul.”

Weir, whose birth name was Robert Hall Parber, was raised by adoptive parents in Atherton, California.

He met Garcia and joined the Grateful Dead, originally known as the Warlocks, in San Francisco in 1965 when he was 17.

Review

The band became known for a pioneering fusion of genres and released the songs Uncle John's Band, Casey Jones and Touch of Grey.

Weir wrote some of the band's most popular songs, such as Sugar Magnolia, Playing in the Band and Jack Straw.

He is credited with much of the band's experimentalism and their influence on modern rock music.

Over decades of endless touring and marathon live jams, they inspired a legion of fans known as “Deadheads”, who adopted the trappings of tie-dyed psychedelia.

The group shared a communal house at 710 Ashbury Street in the Haight-Ashbury neighbourhood of San Francisco, an area of creativity that is still synonymous with the countercultural revolution.

After Garcia's death at age 53 in 1995, Weir carved out a solo career – much of it with his band, RatDog – and participated in reunions of surviving Grateful Dead members in different configurations.

One such group, Dead and Company, played a series of concerts for the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary in July at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, drawing some 60,000 fans a day for three days.

Weir has been honoured as a Kennedy Centre Honours recipient, with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and as an inductee of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.

In June last year, he played his first London show in more than two decades when he took to the stage at the Royal Albert Hall alongside the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra and his band, Wolf Bros.

In 2017, Weir, a vegetarian and animal rights activist, was appointed as a United Nations Development Program goodwill ambassador to support the agency's work to end poverty while fighting climate change.

He was diagnosed with cancer in July last year.

The statement on his death added that his wife, Natascha, and their daughters, Monet and Chloe, “request privacy during this difficult time and offer their gratitude for the outpouring of love, support, and remembrance”.

“May we honor him not only in sorrow, but in how bravely we continue with open hearts, steady steps, and the music leading us home,” it read.

Three members of the Minnesota congressional delegation were denied access to a Minneapolis ICE jail on Saturday.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

Amidst national outrage this week over the killing of Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good by a federal agent, members of Minnesota's congressional delegation on Saturday were blocked from full access to a federal immigration detention center in the city — but at least one lawmaker among them warns something much more sinister is now taking place in the state.

“I was just denied access to the ICE processing center at the Whipple Building,” Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who represents the state's 5th District. “Members of Congress have a legal right and constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight where people are being detained. The public deserves to know what is taking place in ICE facilities.”

Omar shared a video of herself, along with Reps. Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison, outside the facility as large numbers of masked federal agents in protective gear blocked the driveway entrance.

In a telephone interview with MSNOW, Omar later explained that she and her colleagues arrived at the facility Saturday morning in order to conduct oversight activities. While Omar said they were initially allowed to enter the building, they were shortly after told they “had to wait until higher-ups were able to come speak with us.”

It seemed to Omar, she said, that the order to halt their visit “maybe came from Washington to deny us the proper access that we needed to complete those oversight duties that we are obligated as members of Congress.”

Calling it a clear violation of their oversight authority, Omar and Craig explained to reporters what happened after they were denied further access to the facility:

""This is beyond the pale."" Democratic Congresswomen Rep. Ilhan Omar and Rep. Annie Craig had their access to a federal detention facility revoked while touring the building. pic.twitter.com/KthvotCREX

Congresswoman Craig also spoke to MSNOW's Ali Velshi:

Rep. Angie Craig: ""We were told because this facility is being funding by the 'Big Beautiful Bill,' not the congressional appropriations act, that we would not be allowed to enter the facility. That's complete nonsense … I informed them they were violating the law. They said… pic.twitter.com/vCOqgldB2Q

Noting the size and scale of the presence of armed federal agents now deployed in her state, Omar suggested in her interview with MSNOW that the recent Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) operations being conducted serve no purpose other than to harass and terrorize local communities. That militarized presence has only grown since Trump ordered more agents to the city following Wednesday's killing of Good and the protests that have erupted as a result.

“Protest is as American as apple pie,” said Omar. “People come out to register their opposition to what they do not like or want to accept. It is important for people to be able to do that in a democracy.”

“What we are seeing right now, not only from the surge of 2,000 federal agents — now we have another 1,000 apparently coming in — it is essentially trying to create this kind of environment where people feel intimidated, threatened, and terrorized. And I think the ultimate goal of [Homeland Security Security Secretary] Kristi Noem and President Trump is to agitate people enough where they are able to invoke the Insurrection Act to declare martial law.”

“There is,” she continued, “no other justifiable way to describe what is taking place in Minneapolis at this moment. There is no justifiable reason why this number of agents is here in our state.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

The Trump administration now has zine distributors and jail support efforts in its sights.

Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.

I've been making zines since I was 14 years young. I've been distributing them since I was 16. I'm now 37 years old and pursuing a doctorate in art history studying communities of zine makers.

In recent years I've seen a notable increase in people talking about zines, making them, and attending zine fests — it's been heartening and wild to witness! I've watched what felt at times like this niche and nerdy part of my life blossom into something much more expansive. 

When working with my students, or hosting community zine making workshops, I often define zines as small, independently published objects that are amateurish in the best way — they're free or cheap to get copies of, contain typed or handwritten text, and depending on what zine you find, they're filled with collage, art, poetry, political history, personal stories, recipes, health advice, quite literally everything you can think of. Zines are an embodiment of the “do it yourself” ethos.

Now, the latest targets of President Donald Trump and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's agenda of political repression include a diverse group of protesters, jail support volunteers, educators, and, crucially, zine distributors, and print artists. More than a dozen people face criminal charges, including riot; conspiracy to use and carry explosives; the use and carrying of explosives; attempted murder of officers and employees of the United States; discharging a firearm during, in relation to and in furtherance of a crime of violence; and corruptly concealing a document or record. And at the center of their charges is a box of zines and jail support group chats. 

From a Typical Noise Demo to a Series of FBI Raids

On July 4, 2025, protesters had gathered at the Prairieland Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in Alvarado, Texas, to oppose immigration enforcement practices and show support for detainees, using fireworks and noise-making as their demonstration method — a traditional form of protest in solidarity with incarcerated people. When local police responded to ICE's call to remove the protesters, an officer reportedly suffered a neck injury that authorities attributed to a gunshot. Prosecutors have only identified two individuals as alleged shooters despite the broad scope of arrests. Following the demonstration, federal authorities launched an extensive investigation that resulted in charges against 16 individuals known as the Prairieland Defendants, and harassment of their extended friends, families, and neighbors.

Guidelines issued by the White House in September detail how the Trump administration will target and pursue anyone it deems to be motivated by “anti-Americanism, anti-Capitalism, and anti-Christianity” as domestic terrorists. Trump has also designated “antifa” as a domestic terrorist organization. Those of us who are anti-fascist know that “antifa” simply refers to a collective sense of being anti-fascist and believing that fascism is ultimately a real and present threat to all life. It is not a unified entity or organization. Antifa is a rallying cry, a politic, a historical reference that connects one to a legacy of fighting Nazism in Germany, and fighting other fascists in Italy, Spain, and elsewhere in the 1930s. 

Zines have been criminalized before our current moment, and at times their creation and circulation was made punishable by death.

Texas resident Des Revol, in particular, is being targeted by the Trump administration under these guidelines. He did not attend the July 4 demonstration in Alvarado, Texas, but he was arrested two days afterward after he had a phone call with his wife, who was detained at the noise demonstration. FBI agents stopped him for a traffic violation in Denton, Texas, and took him into custody at gunpoint. Authorities charged him with evidence tampering constituting obstruction of justice as well as conspiracy, alleging he “transported a box that contained numerous Antifa materials” from his residence to another location. This literature — pamphlets and zines commonly found in activist spaces — became the basis for his prosecution. Despite having no connection to the original demonstration, Des faces potential federal imprisonment and additional risks from both immigration enforcement and hostile right-wing groups that have publicly identified him online.

When we spoke, Lydia Koza, the wife of Prairieland Defendant Autumn Hill, plainly stated what's happening: “At the most abstract level, I believe the Trump administration and the state of Texas know in some collective-unconscious way that authoritarian, grasping models of power are unsustainable and require ever-greater levels of escalation; and that models predicated on care and equity are both more natural and more sustainable. Solidarity and compassion therefore become threats.”

Meanwhile, Prairieland Defendant Savanna Batten has lost more than 30 pounds since her incarceration in September of 2025, according to her sister, Amber Lowrey. When we spoke about her mounting concerns, Lowrey said:

When an individual becomes a target of state repression, it harms everyone within their orbit. Everyone who was taken from the Prairieland protest has lost, at very least, their employment. Many lost their homes or vehicles, and some owe huge repair bills as a result of violent raids that left their dwellings badly damaged and exposed to the elements. At least two minor children said goodbye to their parents as they left to go to a protest five months ago, and they never came back. Pets have had to be rehomed … State repression is violent. It is extreme. It is incredibly isolating, and that is by design. This has been, by far, the most traumatic experience of my life — and I wasn't even the target.

Likewise, when the FBI began raiding the home of Autumn Hill and Lydia Koza, “I wondered if I was going to die or be taken to a rendition site,” Koza said. “At that moment, I had resigned myself to losing everything I cared about. Every ounce of ideological opposition to police violence, to state terror, to incarceration, suddenly became viscerally relevant.”

Are Zines a Threat?

I myself have copies of most, if not all, of the zines that Des Revol had in that box. Those zines were free or cheap to get, and are filled with history, free thought, anarchist political analysis, discussions of shared struggle, and hope. I have many such titles, and yes, I believe they are at once paper and ink and also incendiary devices. I reject the framing of innocence and crime being used to describe zines and those who make or share them. 

“Zines could be called the atomic unit of free speech — the simplest possible, highest-impact pamphlet; the most entry-level way of disseminating ideas that can't find footing in mainstream discourse,” Koza told me.

Two other Prairieland Defendants had previously established a small, independent print shop and literature distribution to support local book clubs as well as anarchist and socialist reading groups, and had only just begun tabling at book fairs and zine fests. These artists' and writers' arrest and subsequent incarceration has shuttered this local resource, ending access to affordable and free printing and breaking up print communities — an outcome the Trump administration is all too happy to execute. 

How many of us have visited a public library's zine rack, or attended a local print fair or zine fest? Under a fascist political regime, all oppositional discourse … is subject to attack.

Zines are often sources of great inspiration and personal conviction. If being against a regime that deports, kills, silences, poisons, and cages is criminal, then we must abandon the nonsensical concept of innocence. Political literature should make you feel, think, learn, and act. Zines have been criminalized before our current moment, and at times their creation and circulation was made punishable by death — in revolutionary France, in the post-revolutionary United States, and in Nazi Germany, just to name a few. Nothing about the Trump administration's tactics should surprise us; we are sure to see more zines, pamphlets, leaflets, and other print culture be labeled “domestic terrorism materials” in the future. 

Even still, there is solidarity everywhere. In October, I traveled to Athens, Greece, and visited La Zone, a beautiful anarchist community space and cafe, with a tremendous selection of zines, books, artwork, and free literature. At the time of writing this, I learned that La Zone hosted a “letter-writing & solidarity evening for the imprisoned Prairieland (Texas) codefendants.” Yes, zines are folded pieces of paper, but they're also lifelines, histories, and embodiments of hope. 

How many of us keep a box of zines, or leaflets, or political pamphlets around the house? Around our offices or apartment? How many of us have visited a public library's zine rack, or attended a local print fair or zine fest? Under a fascist political regime, all oppositional discourse, literature, art, and life is subject to attack. We must recommit to solidarity, and rise to the defense of those whose lives and actions become criminal by default. The Trump administration wants us to live in ignorance and fear, so we must continue making, thinking, and learning together. Zines will continue to play vital roles in our movement organizing and political education. Keep informing yourself about the calls for support and solidarity with the Prairieland defendants. Keep reading, keep making.

We must reject the argument that climate protection is a burden on the economy, says energy expert Hans-Josef Fell.

Since Donald Trump took office, the U.S. government has been more aggressively boosting fossil fuels to exert geopolitical dominance. President Donald Trump stated unequivocally that the military assault on Venezuela and the kidnapping of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife are aimed at gaining control of the country's oil reserves. Meanwhile, oil company shares are soaring, a dividend on the investments of “Big Oil,” the major donor to Trump's election campaign. It is also no coincidence that Nigeria (which the U.S. bombed over Christmas) and Iran and Greenland, which Trump repeatedly threatens, are oil-rich regions, too.

While the U.S. is focusing on fossil fuel extraction, a dramatic transformation is taking place worldwide. In China, CO2 emissions have been stagnating or declining for over a year and a half. The expansion of global renewable energy capacity reached an unprecedented 582 gigawatts (GW) last year. USD 2.4 trillion was invested in the energy transition, a third of which went into renewables. These are historic records, even if they are not enough to achieve the goal set at COP28 in Dubai: tripling the installed capacity of renewable energy worldwide by 2030.

Against this backdrop, climate and energy expert Hans-Josef Fell sees the world at a crossroads. Opting for fossil fuels not only leads to planetary catastrophe, but it is also economically misguided, he says.

Hans-Josef Fell was a member of the German Bundestag from 1998 to 2013. As a leading climate figure of the Green Party, Fell helped to advance the energy transition in Germany. He was a drafter of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG), a law that came into force in Germany 25 years ago and has been copied by more than 60 countries. EEG promotes renewable energies (wind, solar, hydro, biomass) and guarantees their preferential feed-in to the power grid as well as fixed feed-in tariffs (which provide above-market prices) in order to drive forward expansion and shape the energy transition.

Today, Fell is president of the Energy Watch Group, an international network of scientists and parliamentarians researching fossil, nuclear and renewable energy resources, and, together with climate activists such as Bill McKibben, is an advocate for 100 percent renewable energy. In this interview, Fell discusses the widespread rollback of climate policies, how to transition to a zero-emission economy, and how investment in renewable energy is driving China's economic boom.

This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.

David Goeßmann: While greenhouse gases continue to rise to record levels globally, the U.S. is still the second-largest emitter in absolute terms, but with much higher per capita consumption and historical emissions than China. President Donald Trump has reversed the steps toward energy transition initiated under the Biden administration, attacked all environmental protection measures, and issued thousands of new oil and gas drilling permits while U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are going up again. In Europe, we see a boom of fossil gas and gas-fired power plants while overall climate policy is in decline. For instance, the German government under Chancellor Friedrich Merz watered down the European Union's (EU) climate targets and undermined the EU's ban on combustion engines from 2035. The EU has also weakened the so-called Green New Deal. How do you assess climate protection in the industrialized world?

Hans-Josef Fell: There is no climate protection worthy of the name in the rich countries, nor globally. The Earth's temperature is accelerating toward three degrees Celsius by 2050, as new calculations by the German Meteorological Society and the German Physical Society show. The Energy Watch Group has also clearly described this; one only has to extrapolate the current path of exponentially rising temperatures from the last 20 years.

This alarming result is also clear, because as early as 1990, the limit of 350 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that is sustainable for human civilization was exceeded. Today, the atmosphere is already overloaded with almost 430 ppm. An effective climate protection target that could enable the planet, which is already overheated by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius in 2024, to cool down can therefore only be to reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (not to be confused with annual emissions!) to below 350 ppm. This can only be achieved if all emissions are stopped in about two decades and, at the same time, huge amounts of carbon are removed from the atmosphere. The anti-climate measures mentioned above and many others are irresponsibly counterproductive, as they even reward new increased emissions with tax breaks and, with tax subsidies, even promote the expansion of highly climate-damaging natural gas power plants and natural gas infrastructure. At the same time, these tax breaks for climate polluters place a further burden on the already highly indebted national budget, which could lead to crises that we remember all too well from Greece's national bankruptcy crisis in 2010.

We see in different industrialized countries that emissions are going down; even in the U.S., the trend since 2005 shows a slight decrease. The EU has a climate goal to be climate neutral by 2050 while the Biden administration at least committed to net zero emissions by mid-century, though Trump revoked that. Will policies like these be enough?

Since we need to return to 350 ppm in a few decades, climate neutrality in 2045 is far too late and far too weak. In addition to achieving a zero-emission economy, we also need a strong carbon-reducing economy, which can be achieved through reforestation, regenerative agriculture, and marine algae farming.

A zero-emission economy with 100 percent renewable energies and an emission-free circular economy is possible — all the technologies are there. All that is needed is the declared political and social will and strong investment from the financial sector and private individuals. Building an emission-free industry would also boost the economy. However, only China is currently pursuing such a strategy aggressively. In the EU and the U.S., fossil fuel interests have regained the upper hand.

You're often in China. How do you see developments there in terms of climate protection and the energy transition compared to Europe and the U.S.?

A zero-emission economy is based on an energy supply that is 100 percent renewable. If we had that globally, about 60 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions would be stopped. China alone — currently still the largest emitter of greenhouse gases — is on an industrial growth path toward this goal. Sixty-two percent of global photovoltaic growth, 71 percent of global wind energy, and about 60 percent of all batteries and electric vehicles were brought to market in China last year. In 2024, more than 90 percent of the solar cells installed worldwide and 70 percent of electric car batteries were produced in China. Investment in clean energy has been growing for years, while production capacities are being expanded. In 2023, investment increased by 40 percent compared to the previous year.

This is the key driver of China's economic boom, which has been ongoing for years. Europe, with its half-hearted renewable energy policy, and the U.S. under Trump, with its anti-energy transition agenda, are threatening to go into industrial decline. The industry of the near future will be clean, renewable, and emission-free. Those who still insist on subsidizing natural gas, fossil fuel combustion engines, fossil fuel heating systems, and fossil fuel-based industrial production will ultimately lose entire industries to China and end up in the poorhouse.

At the moment, we are seeing a backlash against the green transformation in many societies, especially in the rich industrialized countries. Do you nevertheless see positive developments in the global energy transition?

Yes, renewable energies are advancing massively worldwide. However, this is being driven primarily by China and increasingly also by BRICS countries other than Russia [the BRICS group includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa]. Those who, like the U.S. and the EU, want to protect their own dirty fossil fuel economy from Chinese dominance with tariffs on solar products or electric cars will only lose market share, as we are already seeing clearly today with the German car manufacturers VW, Daimler, and BMW, which are late to the game and still half-hearted in their commitment to e-mobility.

You say that an energy transition in most countries can be completed within 10 years. Explain how such a rapid transition could take place.

Until around 2012, we had in Germany about 30 percent annual growth in solar energy, and until 2017, similar growth in wind energy. Had these growth rates in solar expansion not been halted in 2012 in the wake of the devastating amendments to the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) by Federal Environment Minister Peter Altmaier, and then in wind energy from 2017 onwards by Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel, Germany could have achieved a full supply of 100 percent green electricity by around 2022 with the corresponding parallel expansion of storage facilities. The increases in natural gas prices as a result of Russian President Vladimir Putin's war against Ukraine would have had little impact on our economy, energy security would have been very high, the average 81 billion euros in import costs for fossil fuels would have fallen dramatically, and emissions would have been significantly lower.

Today, we must build on the success story of the EEG from 2000 with its basic principles of fixed feed-in tariffs, whereby a modern EEG should also be geared toward system integration into the electricity grid. Then, with the simultaneous expansion of electric heating, e-vehicles, and industrial production, a full supply of 100 percent green electricity can be achieved by 2030. Such a market ramp-up would also give the domestic renewable energy industry a chance and reduce dependence on China.

If a rapid transition is possible and even economically advantageous, why is it not being implemented politically? Who is continuing to put the brakes on this?

The fossil fuel and nuclear industries have a firm grip on large parts of the media, both traditional and social, and thus also on the political debate. Fake news is constantly being produced, e.g., that renewable energies are driving up electricity prices or that there is a nuclear renaissance in the world. Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder recently claimed that Germany could support its economy by quickly building small nuclear power plants like those already in operation in Canada. A glance at Canada shows that there are no such small nuclear reactors there, not even under construction. There are only two in the planning stage, and their completion is still up in the air. So even a high-ranking politician can lie to the public with impunity.

In the broader debate, climate protection is often portrayed as a burden. In your opinion, what is wrong with the way the energy, transport, and agricultural transitions to protect the environment are discussed in the media?

From the outset, the fossil fuel industry has managed to defame climate protection as a burden on the economy. However, this only applies to the fossil fuel industry, which will of course have to completely cease its business activities involving oil, gas, and coal. But climate protection is a booster for the clean, emission-free economy, as China is now making abundantly clear.

But even many climate activists have adopted the fossil fuel industry's framing and talked about burden-sharing in climate protection. Spending on renewable energies is not a cost burden, but rather an investment that creates jobs and tax revenue while reducing the costs of damage to health care due to poor air quality or environmental and climate damage. Climate protection is therefore not a burden, but an improvement in prosperity for everyone, except for businesses in the fossil fuel-polluting economy.

In recent years, environmental movements and climate activists have developed various strategies to promote more climate protection in countries. At the moment, it has become difficult to put the issue on the agenda. The pandemic, the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and the rise of right-wing authoritarian parties have dominated the headlines. In your opinion, what strategies make sense to get governments to take climate action?

Climate activists must finally free themselves from the narratives of fossil fuel industry representatives and demonstrate that climate protection is an essential contribution to the economy, creates new jobs and industries, reduces the costs of disease and environmental damage, relieves private households of high energy costs, and ultimately slows down the galloping national debt. Furthermore, the lack of climate protection is one of the causes of the major problems that are weighing so heavily on us: increasing refugee movements, famines as a result of crop failures, wars over oil or natural gas, fossil fuels as a means of political blackmail, and much more.

Let us finally stop leaving the debate to the fossil fuel and nuclear climate destroyers, of which the oil and gas industry alone has been making around $2.8 billion in net profits every day for 50 years, ultimately leaving behind more and more poverty, suffering, disease, and a destroyed planet.

            Becky Pepper-Jackson, the high school sophomore at the center of the Supreme Court appeal on transgender sports, flashes a grin when asked to describe the basic technique of the shot put, one of her favorite track and field events.
    


            “It's just throwing something that's heavy,” the 15-year-old West Virginian said. “Far.”
    


            That description could also apply to her blockbuster legal case.
    


            While Pepper-Jackson sounds like any teen navigating school assignments, friends and a demanding practice schedule, the transgender girl has also been carrying the weight of a national cultural and political battle that will reach a crescendo Tuesday when the Supreme Court debates two appeals dealing with state bans on trans girls playing on women's teams.
    


            And Pepper-Jackson understands that — in the hands of a 6-3 conservative court that has been increasingly skeptical of transgender rights — her effort is a long shot.
    


            “Someone has to do this because this is just a terrible thing,” Pepper-Jackson told CNN in an interview with her family and attorneys. “I know that I can handle it and it's never crossed my mind to stop, because I know I'm doing it for everybody.”
    


            The Supreme Court over the past year has repeatedly ruled against LGBTQ Americans. In May, it allowed the Trump administration to enforce a ban on transgender service members in the military. In June, the court let stand state laws that bar transgender care for minors. Nearly five months later, a majority of justices let the administration require US passports to include a traveler's sex at birth, rather than a person's gender identity.
    


            Now, in one of the most divisive issues on the court's docket this year, the justices will decide if state laws banning transgender athletes from competing on sports teams that align with their gender identity violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment or the landmark 1972 anti-sex discrimination law known as Title IX.
    


            The appeals have arrived at a moment of enormous political backlash against transgender people. Roughly two-thirds of Americans believe that athletes should play on teams that match their sex at birth and more than half of US states have enacted laws similar to the one in West Virginia.
    


            Supporters of those bans say that the promise of Title IX, and the vast expansion of participation in women's sports in the decades since, is threatened by transgender athletes. Cisgender women, they say, would be forced to compete against “bigger, faster, and stronger” athletes who were born as males and would ultimately lose.
    


            “To say that allowing only biological females to compete in girls' sports violates Title IX fails the commonsense test,” West Virginia Attorney General JB McCuskey, a Republican, told CNN. “What we're talking about here is the need to have fair and safe playing fields for them to compete.”
    


            Critics say that assumes an influx of transgender students trying out for girls' sports teams. Court documents suggest that, in fact, West Virginia has identified only Pepper-Jackson.
    


            McCuskey said that shouldn't matter.
    


            “It may be that we have one defendant,” he said, “but there's a nationwide issue here.”
    


            Pepper-Jackson says she's been a girl for as long as she can remember.
    


            She began transitioning socially in the third grade and, by the end of the sixth grade, she was taking hormone therapy. Given those treatments, her attorneys stress, she has “never experienced the effects of testosterone on her body” and doesn't have the inherent biological advantages states like West Virginia are attempting to regulate with their laws.
    


            Nor does Pepper-Jackson come across as a teen driven to win her weekend track meets at any cost. She jokes that she found her way to shot put and discus only because she “sucked at running.” She says she hasn't thought much about competing in college. She said she likes to play sports because of her friends and the “life skills that you won't learn anywhere else.”
    


            She is proud of her personal record in discus, 120 feet. But she says she achieved it because of hard work, not her sex at birth.
    


            For Pepper-Jackson, feelings of accomplishment are often followed by self-doubt. What if, she wonders, a long throw becomes ammunition for those who believe she doesn't belong?
    


            Heather Jackson, Becky's mother, recalled watching her daughter's face shift from pride to fear when she toppled a previous personal best a few years ago.
    


            “She knew that's what they were going to focus on,” Jackson said of her daughter's critics. “No kid should feel guilty for doing their best.”
    


            But others say they are uncomfortable competing against transgender girls whom they believe have an inherent advantage.
    


            Lilyana Williams, a former team captain of her high school track team in Pennsylvania, helped to organize a policy at her school prohibiting transgender students from competing on teams that match their gender identity.
    


            Williams, who recently graduated from nursing school, said she worked with the religious Pennsylvania Family Institute to implement that policy after a transgender student briefly competed on her team. She said that arrangement didn't just hurt the team's top athletes but also many others who were “just wanting to finish in a specific spot.”
    


            “None of it was coming from a perspective of hate,” Williams told CNN, “but rather the idea that women deserve equality, both on the field and off the field, and we deserve a right to fairness.”
    


            Transgender sports bans have spread like wildfire across the US in just a few years. The popularity of the laws on the right was so strong that three statehouses overrode vetoes from Republican governors to codify them.
    


            The legal backlash has also been swift. Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, part of the team representing Pepper-Jackson, challenged several of the bans and secured early court victories that – at least temporarily – prevented full enforcement of some of them.
    


            The Supreme Court will hear arguments Tuesday in two of those cases – one from Pepper-Jackson challenging West Virginia's law. The other comes from a student at Boise State University, Lindsay Hecox, who is challenging Idaho's law.
    


            The decision, expected by the end of June, will almost certainly decide the fate of other laws across the country.
    


            The Idaho law, enacted in March 2020, was blocked later that year when a judge appointed by President Donald Trump ruled it was likely unconstitutional.
    


            In that ruling, US District Judge David Nye pointed to a “dearth of evidence in the record to show excluding transgender women from women's sports supports sex equality, provides opportunities for women, or increases access to college scholarships.” The San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision in 2024, leading to Idaho's appeal to the Supreme Court.
    


            In Pepper-Jackson's case, a federal district court sided with West Virginia. But the Richmond-based 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2024 that the state's ban violated Pepper-Jackson's rights under Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex at schools that receive federal aid.
    


            The Supreme Court in 2023 allowed Pepper-Jackson, then a middle-school student, to temporarily continue competing in cross-country and track while her litigation played out. Two conservative justices – Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito – dissented from that decision.
    


            LGBTQ advocates frame the issue as a manufactured new front on the right and have taken aim at groups like the Alliance Defending Freedom, the religious public interest law firm that has brought many successful challenges to the Supreme Court. ADF is part of the legal team in both the West Virginia and Idaho cases.
    


Takeaways from the Supreme Court's historic decision on transgender care



            “People believe this stuff that ADF tells them because they don't know a trans kid who's playing sports, and so they don't have a frame of reference for how completely egregiously untrue these claims are,” said Cathryn Oakley, the senior director of legal policy for the Human Rights Campaign.
    


            Matt Sharp, a senior counsel at ADF, insisted that “it very much was an issue” before the avalanche of laws banning trans athletes from competing on teams that align with their gender identity. He pointed to a long-running case in Connecticut, where several cisgender athletes were challenging a permissive state sports policy.
    


            “These lawmakers were saying, ‘We want to prevent this from ever happening in our state,'” Sharp said. “And that's what led to 27 states ultimately looking at this and coming up with a solution to preserve the fairness that Title IX had originally given young women.”
    


            Title IX bars schools that receive federal funding from treating students differently based on their sex. Pepper-Jackson and her attorneys say that is exactly what categorical bans on transgender student athletes do.
    


            “When Becky is prevented from being on teams with other girls just like her, she is subjected to discrimination that effectively excludes her from participating in the school's educational programs,” said Joshua Block, a senior counsel with the ACLU who will argue the case before the Supreme Court on Tuesday.
    


            McCuskey counters that the law treats biological males the same as biological females.
    


            Lurking behind that debate is a landmark Supreme Court decision from 2020, Bostock v. Clayton County, that concluded that a federal law that bars discrimination in the workplace “on the basis of sex” also protects gay and transgender employees.
    


            Writing for the court, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch stressed that the opinion applied only in the workplace. But given that the two anti-discrimination laws are worded similarly, the court – if it sides with the states – will have to explain why the logic of Bostock doesn't apply in other contexts, like sports.
    


Samuel Alito keeps getting his way. So why does he seem so unhappy?



            And that is likely to be a central debate in the arguments Tuesday.
    


            So, too, is the question of whether transgender people are entitled to the same anti-discrimination protections that race and sex have under the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court dodged that question in last year's decision on transgender care bans, US v. Skrmetti, though several conservative justices indicated in separate opinions that they believe the answer to that question is “no.”
    


            Pepper-Jackson and her family are aware of those challenges. But, they said, they believe they're engaged in a longer game.
    


            “Getting this far and bringing light to this case and showing that this is an issue,” Pepper-Jackson said, “is a win.”

            In four short videos on an electronic device found with his body, the suspect in last month's fatal shootings at Brown University and of an MIT professor laid out a patchwork of details about the attacks.
    


            Woven among his confessions to the crimes and winding related thoughts, several nuggets match facts that emerged as authorities were identifying Claudio Neves Valente, 48, as wanted in the killings of students Ella Cook and MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, and Professor Nuno F.G. Loureiro.
    


            As the videos' transcripts – translated from Portuguese and released this week by the US Attorney's Office in Massachusetts – raise fresh questions, they also intersect with key known elements of the case. Here's how some of the suspect's own words flesh out – or further blur – the crimes that rocked Greater Boston and a manhunt that captured national attention.
    


                    Okay, (sighs) as you can see, my eye is kind of f**ked up. It's a shell round, bounced there. I don't know if there are any kind of implications on the success of what I wanted to do or not …
                





            As he'll more clearly explain, Neves Valente was hurt during one of the shootings. His eye injury was not shared publicly, if known at all, by law enforcement between the Brown attack on December 13 and the discovery five days later of the suspect dead by suicide at a storage facility.
    


                    Uhm (pause) It's done. It was, it was six months, man. Not six months, six semesters. Uh … I had already planned this for a little more. It seems that I'm starting to see a bit better out of my eye, but very little or almost nothing. The time for the final conclusions has arrived. The time for the final conclusions has arrived. Uhm, it was all a little incompetent but at least something was done. The only objective was to (pause) leave more or less on my own terms, and – and it's – it's already long overdue.
                





            The suspect seems to reveal how long he planned at least one of the attacks. But even as he speaks of “final conclusions” and his “only objective,” he offers no motive for the shootings at this or at any point in the videos; it's a critical element of the case still under scrutiny by federal investigators.
    


                    And at least leave (pause) that I wasn't – wouldn't be the one who ended up suffering the most from all of this. No, that cannot happen. So, if you don't like it, tough luck. Tough luck. There was also a lot of sh*t that I did not like, and I had to put up with it. So, what has been done now … I'm in a storage space in Salem, (New Hampshire), I've had this here for three years, I think.
                





            Neves Valente doesn't go into what exactly he “had to put up with” before pivoting to his location: the storage space he says he rented far longer than the few weeks investigators had thought.
    


Brown University shooting suspect planned attack for a long time, offering no motive in video confession, officials say



            After killing his former academic colleague Loureiro on December 15 in Brookline, Massachusetts – about 50 miles away from the Brown attack in Providence, Rhode Island – the suspect immediately drove about 40 miles and swiped into the storage unit in Salem, New Hampshire, according to Rhode Island's attorney general. It appears he never swiped out.
    


                    I still have money. I would have money for a few more good years, if it was in Portugal or a cheaper place it would still be a long time, but I don't care. I've been here … I've been here without caring for a very long time now.
                





            From Entroncamento in central Portugal, Neves Valente was a “very bright” but reclusive young man who was estranged from his family and whose mother once told a neighbor her son “needs help, but he doesn't want to get it,” said his former neighbors in Lisbon, where he and Loureiro both were students between 1995 and 2000 at a prestigious engineering school.
    


            Neves Valente began studying at Brown in 2000 on an F-1 visa – a nonimmigrant visa for full-time international students – US Attorney Leah Foley of Massachusetts has said. He likely took physics classes in the Barus & Holley building where the December shooting unfolded.
    


                    To say that I was extraordinarily satisfied, no, but I also don't regret what I did. Honestly, my only regret is this thing in the eye (laughs). But it was really hard, man. I really have far – far too much inertia. But since I was almost confronted by a guy there that day … not almost, I actually was confronted and he knew my … my … my license plate … .
                





            Right before the gunfire at Brown, the suspect stopped in a bathroom at the Barus & Holley building, where a man – later identified as John, per a police affidavit – noticed his clothes seemed inadequate for the cold weather. John earlier had seen nearby a “grey Nissan with Florida plates, possibly a rental,” the document states, and he soon saw the suspect leave the building and appear to unlock the Nissan with a key fob. 



            John stayed outside as the man suddenly turned from the vehicle and walked in a different direction, then circled back before changing directions whenever he saw John, the witness told investigators. At one point, John confronted the man, asking him why he kept circling the block, the affidavit says. The man responded: “Why are you harassing me?” it say﻿s. John then walked down the street as the man walked toward the car, the affidavit says.
    


            Authorities also mapped the suspect's winding path right before and after the attack around the Barus & Holley building based on footage from neighbors' cameras and released the details during the manhunt.
    


                    … I honestly never thought it would take them so long to find me.
                





            Stumbles and hurdles in the search for the Brown gunman, then the MIT professor's killer, meant the manhunt dragged on for days. From the dearth of surveillance cameras in the Brown building where the shooting erupted to authorities' early identification of the wrong man, plus behind-the-scenes friction between local law enforcement and the FBI, to the crush of tips investigators had to sift through, five days elapsed between the first shot and the discovery of the suspect's body.
    


                    But look, I did one more, basically, since I'm not sure; it was done at a relatively short distance and (pause) quickly, and I don't know exactly when I was hit in the eye, so I don't know exactly … I hope that at least the first one hit. I don't know. I don't care. It's all over.
                





            The suspect “grumbled about a self-inflicted injury he suffered when he shot the MIT professor at close range,” the US Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts said in releasing the transcripts.
    


                    I am not going to apologize, because during my lifetime no one sincerely apologized to me. Uhm, the few times there was an appearance that it had happened, I later had access, uhm, to the people privately, the conversations we had privately showed it was all fake. Uhm (pause) so they are not going to get anything from me. I did not like any one of you. I saw all of this sh*t from the beginning. I began to grow suspicious since I barely had conscious memories, at the age of three. At the age of five, I was already sure … So go f**k yourselves, to hell with you.
                





            Throughout the videos, the suspect “showed no remorse,” federal prosecutors said. “(O)n the contrary, he exposed his true nature when he blamed innocent, unarmed children for their deaths at his hand.” The suspect did not give any further details about prior apologies he'd gotten or his suspicions as a young child.
    


                    Three e-mails should go out today, tonight, people will receive them, basically. I'm not saying anything else.
                





            The US Attorney's Office in Massachusetts has stated it would provide further updates as new information becomes available and victims are properly notified. A spokesperson declined to comment Thursday on the existence or contents of the emails.
    


                    And the thing is with this eye situation, I even thought about doing it with glasses on, and then at the last moment I thought: no, because the glasses fog up, this is at close range, (unintelligible). I was stupid. If I had done it, it wouldn't have … But I also have no interest whatsoever in staying here. That's it. (unintelligible). I also have no interest in being famous. I don't give a damn about how you judge me or what you think of me. The overwhelming majority of things that are going to be said, I can already imagine.
                





            Many mass shooters have shown ﻿a fascination with or been fixated on other mass shooters and their lives out of a need to feel understood, to have role models and to be part of a community, according to experts in the psychology of school shooters. Neves Valente seems to nod to the culture that fawns over mass attackers while insisting he wants no part of it.
    


                    In fact, I was already reading, uhm, I particularly like Trump's sh*t, to have – have called me an animal, which is true. I am an animal and he is also, but uhm, I have no love – I have no hatred towards America, I also have no hatred at all. This was an issue of … of opportunity. I would really like to thank you for the only opportunity that you gave me here, which was this one ﻿… .
                





            “Hopefully, they're going to capture this animal,” President Donald Trump told reporters December 15 from the Oval Office, adding it's “always difficult” to manage an investigation of this kind. Trump also deflected questions about why the manhunt was taking so long, saying the feds “came in after the fact.”
    


Neighbors in Lisbon recall Brown University attack suspect as quiet, reclusive student



            “This was a school problem. They had their own guards, they had their own police, they had their own everything,” he said. “But you'd have to ask that question, really to the school, not the FBI.”
    


                    Even though the stupid car is outside, and obviously there is a record of my entry, and there are cameras and sh*t, but it will probably be a few good hours, so, the longer I stay here, the better. Let's see if I've got the balls to do this to myself now, because it was hard as hell to do it to all of these people, man. It was hard as hell … It's 10:00 PM, and that's it.
                





            Before arriving late December 15 to the storage facility, the suspect's rental car was seen several times around Brown between December 1, when he got it in Boston, and December 12, including by John. Between the university shooting and the professor's killing, Neves Valente swapped its license plates to an unregistered Maine plate. Still, the suspect parked his car outdoors at the storage facility, where he knew there'd be proof he swiped in.
    


            Meanwhile, authorities plugged a description of the Nissan into a system run by Flock Safety that can read license plates and identify other vehicle details, then match sightings of ﻿the same car, including with different tags. The technology helped locate the suspect, Providence's police chief said.
    


            Neves Valente also appears to portend his own manner of death.

                    (Unintelligible) When I say that I have no – no hatred toward America, I also have no love for it – you can barely see this – I have no love. Actually, I think that coming here, both times I did, was a f**king mistake. But to say that you all are extraordinarily bad, that would be … nei – nei – neither bad nor good. It's the same sh*t. You are monkeys like the other ones. But I wanted to leave this … I was reading the recording I made … no, not reading but watching it. I said I had no hatred, but I also have no love. It's the same thing with Portugal, and most of the places where I have been. It says nothing. Wherever a guy goes (pause) that's how it is. Let's see how this is going to wor – work now. If I really have the courage to do this.
                





            In the shortest of the four videos, the suspect focuses on his regrets amid his intercontinental life. His first stint at Brown was brief, “attending for only three semesters as a graduate student until taking a leave in 2001 and formally withdrawing effective July 31, 2003,” the school's president wrote after his death.
    


            The suspect reentered the US in 2017 via the diversity visa program, where a specified number of applicants from designated countries are admitted through a lottery system, according to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. He got permanent legal US residency, known as a green card, and, at some point later, a Florida driver's license.
    


            Meanwhile, Neves Valente had not spoken with his parents in years, a former neighbor told CNN. At one point, his mother confided to the neighbor her fear he would sell his Lisbon apartment and disappear, which the neighbor says eventually happened.
    


                    In these two instances, I needed a catalyst – for both of them. But for the first one, it was the fact that I was confronted, and in the second, I also had one, you could say, a little bit. So …
                





            It is not clear whether or how Neves Valente and Loureiro may have interacted during their time in the same Portuguese physics program and if they were in touch afterward. Loureiro graduated in 2000 with his physics degree and stayed on as a researcher before becoming a professor in 2016 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
    


            Loureiro, 47, was found wounded in the foyer of his condo building in Brookline, Massachusetts, a neighbor told the Boston Globe, and later died at a hospital. “There was security footage that captured (Neves Valente) within a half mile of the professor's residence in Brookline, and there is video footage of him entering an apartment building in the location of the professor's apartment,” said Foley, the US attorney for the District of Massachusetts.
    


            Loureiro is believed to have been targeted, a law enforcement official said.
    


                    I already know that you are going to say that I am mentally ill, or some sh*t like that. That is all nonsense. That's all bullsh*t excuses. You are (pause) Uh … those are all excuses for you to f**k whoever you don't care about. I am – I am sane, … and (pause) I've always been, more or less. No – no – no, no – no one is perfect, but (sigh) (pause) In my … In my take on all of this (pause) is that (pause) I think the world cannot be redeemed. To sum it all up, that is it.
                





            Suspects in some high-profile attacks have been described as having mental health problems, but that doesn't mean their mental health issues are to blame for the killings, experts have said. Indeed, people with mental illness are much more likely to be victims, rather than perpetrators, of violence, studies show. Mental illness is a strong causal factor in suicides, studies show.
    


                    I do not even know if I'm going to leave this here. But even if I delete it, it is on an SD card, it's going to be a little hard. I want to know if you are going to post this, maybe I would prefer that you don't, and (pause) I don't care at all about being famous, having a legacy, and sh*t like that, manifestos and f**king stuff. I have absolutely no patience for that. Even though I would have a lot to say and write, I don't care. I'm not going to give you the right to that.
                





            Federal officials released the transcripts Tuesday.
    


The feds are investigating Brown University's safety after this month's shooting. Here's what's at issue –– and at stake



                    Just one more scene. It seems like someone over there said that I was saying that I was … Allah Akbar (phonetic) or some sh*t like that. I do not remember having said anything. If I did say something, it must have been some kind of an – an exclamation, uhm, because I thought that one …
                





            “Allahu Akbar,” meaning “God is greater,” is used by Muslims in moments of celebration and gratitude. The phrase also sometimes is used as a battle cry and has been employed by those with a nefarious agenda to instill fear of anyone who utters it and to raise concerns about Islam itself, according to Muslim scholars and civil rights advocates.
    


                    I – I never wanted to do it in an auditorium. I wanted to do it in a regular room. And I had plenty of opportunities, especially this semester, I had plenty of opportunities, but I always chickened out, and I already explained why I did it this time. So, it all went wrong. I think that outside is what turned out best, but when I entered the auditorium, basically I only saw one guy down there, if I even saw him initially. And I thought, fuc – it was, and I must have made an exclamation like, “Oh no!” or something like that, to express that it was empty, that is, if I said something like that.
                





            It was about 4 p.m. when a 21-year-old teaching assistant was wrapping a review session with a reported 60 or so students in the Barus & Holley building's room 166, one of its largest classrooms. Joseph Oduro heard shots in the hall before the gunman entered his room through a door at the back, locked eyes with the economics teaching assistant, yelled something incomprehensible, then “just started shooting,” Oduro said.
    


                    I thought that the people had left. Because they were kind of stupid. There is – there is an emergency exit (laughs) on the lower right side. They ah … all of those people that were hiding, under the … the table, or whatever the hell, they could have perfectly left through there. I thought that they had – that that was what happened when I was outside, which I assume is where it turned out best, but maybe not, actually, because when I left, I didn't see anyone there anymore. Ah … I assume … I thought they had all left through there. But then I realized that no. That they were all actually hiding under the – the – the chairs and the … it was hard to see, but that's it. Uhm, now that should be everything.
                





            Some students escaped through other doors. Oduro and about 20 students ducked and huddled behind a 10-foot-long desk at the front of the auditorium, and he called 911, then waited what “felt like an eternity” for the gunfire to stop, he said. He didn't lift his head until campus public safety officers arrived and told them it was safe to leave.
    


            Two students were dead. One who hid with the TA was shot in her legs, Oduro said. Eight others were wounded.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","How Trump's capture of Maduro can be traced to Marco Rubio's boyhood front porch","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/11/politics/marco-rubio-venezuela-cuba-florida","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 11:00:59 GMT","


            As a child, Marco Rubio sat at his grandfather's feet cigar-smoke curling on the front porch as stories spilled out — tales of Cuban heroes like José Martí and the guerilla soldiers who fought Spanish rule, and of life under the communist regime his family left behind. Even then, Rubio imagined himself as part of Cuba's unfinished struggle.
    


            “I boasted I would someday lead an army of exiles to overthrow Fidel Castro and become president of a free Cuba,” Rubio recalled in his 2012 memoir, “An American Son.”
    


            A half-century later, that childhood bravado appears strikingly prophetic. Rubio, now President Donald Trump's secretary of state and national security adviser, played a central role in shaping the US military's stunning capture of a different Latin American leader, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime close ally of Cuba. In the aftermath, Trump asserted Rubio would help “run” Venezuela through the resulting upheaval.
    


            The outcome did not unfold exactly as Rubio, 54, imagined it as a boy, but it bore the imprint of the politics that defined his upbringing. The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio came of age in Miami immersed in the city's exile community, rising politically within a culture where memories of the island and a deep fear of socialism remained powerful forces.
    


            Now, as Rubio emerges as the public face of a brazen new era of American foreign policy — one that has rattled allies, undercut Congress' war powers and thrust the Western Hemisphere into uncertainty — longtime friends and allies say they see the product of those formative forces.
    


            “Marco has brought to the White House not just the knowledge and the history but how people feel when they have to flee everything they have,” Tomas Regalado, a trailblazing Cuban American broadcaster and former Miami mayor, told CNN. “He is what every Cuban mother wants their sons to be – loving Miami, thanking the United States but never forgetting Cuba.”
    


            With that belief in Rubio comes the hope, if not, the expectation, that he could soon oversee the fall of the regime in Cuba as well.
    


            “Make no mistake,” said former Hialeah, Florida, Mayor Steve Bovo, a close friend, “a free Caracas should lead to a free Havana.”
    


            Miami's Cuban immigrants have long commanded outsized influence in American politics, a byproduct of their prominence in Florida, a coveted battleground state until recently. Episodes that roiled the community — from the mass immigration of Cubans to Florida in 1980 known as the Mariel boatlift, to Fidel Castro's Air Force shooting down two civilian aircraft in 1996, to the 1999 custody battle over Elián González, to President Barack Obama's groundbreaking 2016 visit to Havana — have repeatedly threatened to reshape electoral politics.
    


            In shops and restaurants throughout Little Havana, pictures memorialize decades of ambitious politicians sipping cafecito and donning guayaberas during pilgrimages to the vibrant Cuban neighborhood. When they come, regardless of their party, it's expected they share their visions for a post-communist Cuba.
    


            Exile politics are inescapable in South Florida, no matter the office on the ballot, said former Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a Miami Republican.
    


            “People want to know first that you're one of them, and then they want to hear what you're doing about everything else,” he said. “You could not be a Castro sympathizer and expect to get any votes, even if you're running for property appraiser. That's why this is so baked into Rubio's DNA.”
    


            “When you think of Cuban American Gen Xers, our entire lives have been eclipsed by the struggle for freedom, justice and democracy in countries like Cuba and Venezuela,” Curbelo went on. “We grew up in direct contact with the people who suffered through these tragic events. But we're very fully American. It's a very potent combination.”
    


            Rubio absorbed this reality through his maternal grandfather — “my mentor and my closest boyhood friend,” he wrote. His grandfather detested President John F. Kennedy for the Bay of Pigs debacle and revered President Ronald Reagan for his hardline anti-communism. He believed, Rubio wrote, that without a strong America “the world would succumb to darkness, and a strong country required a strong leader.”
    


            Those sentiments, widely shared among Cuban exiles, have given Republicans an edge in Florida, and they became “defining influences on me politically,” Rubio said.
    


            In his 20s, Rubio immersed himself in these politics. He interned in the offices of Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Díaz-Balart, Cuban stalwarts on Capitol Hill. In 1996, at age 25, he served as the South Florida coordinator for Bob Dole's presidential campaign.
    


            Two years later, fresh out of law school and newly married, Rubio challenged an incumbent for a seat on the West Miami commission. Armed with fluent Spanish and boyish good looks, Rubio canvassed neighborhoods where conversations about local concerns reliably turned toward Cuba's past and future.
    


            During that campaign, Rubio later wrote, he discovered who he was.
    


            “I was an heir to two generations of unfulfilled dreams,” Rubio wrote. “I was the end of their story.”
    


            That story, however, has shifted over the years.
    


            Rubio has often described himself as the Miami-born “son of exiles,” a distinction that implies his parents arrived in the US after Fidel Castro seized power in 1959. He has suggested as much repeatedly, including in his official US Senate biography.
    


            But in 2011, multiple news outlets uncovered official records showing that his parents first arrived in the United States more than two years before the Castro-led revolution, among other inconsistencies in the family timeline.
    


            Rubio acknowledged the errors, attributing them to his family's “oral history,” but he maintained that his parents identified as exiles because they would have returned to Cuba were it not for Castro's rule.
    


            “They were from Cuba. They wanted to live in Cuba again,” Rubio told the Washington Post at the time. “They tried to live in Cuba again, and the reality of what it was made that impossible.”
    


            Rubio won his race for West Miami commissioner in November 1998. One month later, Venezuela elected a new president: the left-wing populist Hugo Chávez.
    


            Chávez's rise alarmed Cuban exiles in Miami, many of whom insist to this day they warned Venezuelans that the political forces that overtook Cuba could take hold there as well.
    


            “Venezuelans said, ‘That can't happen to us, we have oil, we're not Cuba, we're not an island,'” said Alina Garcia, the Supervisor of Elections of Miami-Dade County. “But it did.”
    


            From 2000 to 2010, as Rubio rose through the Florida legislature to become the state's first Cuban American Speaker of the House, roughly 70,000 people fled Chávez's rule and resettled in the US. Many arrived in South Florida, joining Cuban exiles in demanding a hardline approach against socialism in Latin America.
    


            “There has never been any separation in solidarity in the call for freedom for Cuba and the call for freedom in Venezuela and Nicaragua as well,” said Ana Carbonell, a veteran GOP adviser on Hispanic engagement. “And that's something very special about South Florida.”
    


            Garcia, who served as Rubio's first legislative aide, said these new arrivals did not initially dominate conversations in Tallahassee. Coverage of Rubio's time there rarely mentions the country, nor is Venezuela addressed in his first book.
    


            “He was always inquisitive about the history of Latin America and would ask often about my father who was a Bay of Pigs veteran,” said Bovo, whose wife Viviana is a longtime Rubio aide. “But there wasn't always a forum for it until he got to the Senate. That's when he showed his chops.”
    


            Floridians elected Rubio to the Senate in 2010, and he grew increasingly outspoken on Venezuela. In 2014, he cosponsored sanction legislation and delivered a blistering Senate-floor critique of Chávez's successor, Nicolás Maduro, amid violent crackdowns on protesters.
    


            “They look more and more like Cuba economically and politically every single day,” Rubio said in his speech.
    


            Rubio ran for the GOP nomination for president in 2016 arguing Trump wasn't fit for the world stage. But after falling short — capped by a stinging second-place finish in Florida, where he failed to consolidate the Cuban vote — Rubio returned to the Senate with renewed focus on South America.
    


            He often stood out as a singular voice urging the US to confront socialist regimes in its backyard. At times, he posted hourly updates about Venezuela's humanitarian crisis on social media. He visited the country's border to push for Maduro to allow US aid to reach his citizens.
    


            His advocacy made him a recognizable figure across Latin America and Trump's point person on the Western Hemisphere. Standing alongside Rubio in Peru at the 2018 Summit of the Americas, Curbelo was taken aback by the crowds that formed around them. Everyone wanted to hear from Rubio.
    


            “Losing is very healthy for most people,” Curbelo said. “When he lost the 2016 nomination, he went from being a great politician to being a great statesman.”
    


            A campaign by Rubio to oust Maduro, though, stalled during Trump's first term. Although the administration — at Rubio's urging — joined allies in recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela's rightful president, the international push fizzled and Maduro maintained power. When Trump lost reelection, Rubio's influence waned.
    


            Meanwhile, Venezuela's collapse accelerated migration out of the country. Nearly 8 million people have fled the country since 2014, according to the United Nations. More than 750,000 landed in the US, and nearly half of them in Rubio's home state.
    


            While in office, President Joe Biden granted the vast majority of Venezuelan refugees temporary protected status allowing them to remain in the US, a move Rubio vocally backed. Trump ended those protections last year and his administration made clear this week they still face deportation following Maduro's ouster.
    


            “Secretary Noem ended Temporary Protected Status for more than 500,000 Venezuelans,” the department said in a post on X, “and now they can go home to a country that they love.”
    


            The Department of State did not respond to CNN's request for comment for this story, including the question of whether Rubio believed it was safe for Venezuelans living in the US to return to their country.
    


            Rubio is not a patient man by nature. As a child, he would complain during family visits to IHOP when his food failed to arrive quickly.
    


            “I struggle with impatience to this day,” Rubio wrote in his book, “and when I exhibit the weakness at a restaurant or in some other public place, my wife will remind me that I am behaving like that six-year-old at IHOP.”
    


            Yet, on Venezuela, Rubio has played a long game. He outlasted other Latin America hawks who were cast out of Trump's orbit when he left office in 2021. Rubio endorsed Trump during the GOP primary for president in 2024 and maintained close ties with his inner circle, including campaign manager and fellow Floridian Susie Wiles. The gambit paid off when Trump won, named Wiles chief of staff and tapped Rubio to lead the State Department.
    


            Rubio found new allies in his push for regime change in Venezuela, including senior White House adviser Stephen Miller, CNN recently reported. He also recalibrated his message.
    


            “He recognized the winning argument was no longer about nation building and toppling a dictator and bringing Democracy but going after drug traffickers and stopping Russia and China influence,” a Republican operative close to Rubio told CNN. “It didn't change his goals, but it reframed his argument.”
    


            In South Florida, many Cubans have grown emboldened by Maduro's removal and Rubio's influence on the sudden sea change in American foreign policy.
    


            “If you speak to any Cuban, they'll tell you Cuba will be soon and it'll be next,” Garcia said.
    


            Trump has not discouraged the speculation, telling reporters Cuba may soon “fall on its own.” Rubio has been less circumspect about the fate of his ancestral home.
    


            “If I lived in Havana and I was in the government,” Rubio said on Sunday, “I'd be concerned.”

            Nearly eight months after Brendan Banfield's wife and a stranger were killed in the Banfields' Virginia home in February 2023, police returned to the scene of the killings.
    


            They entered the home and went to the bedroom where Christine Banfield was fatally stabbed. There, on the bedside table, investigators found a framed photo of Brendan smiling with another woman – the family's au pair, according to court records.
    


            Brendan Banfield now faces a double-murder trial, with jury selection scheduled Monday, as prosecutors allege he plotted with the au pair to kill his wife and another man. Prosecutors say that man had been lured to the home to frame him for Christine's death – and to make his own killing appear to be an act of self-defense.
    


            Banfield – a former IRS agent, according to CNN affiliate WUSA – has pleaded not guilty to aggravated murder and a firearm offense in the fatal stabbing of his wife and the fatal shooting of Joseph Ryan.
    


            Prosecutors say Brendan Banfield and the family's Brazilian au pair, Juliana Peres Magalhães, were having an extra-marital affair and carried out the plan together. The salacious plot features allegations of BDSM sexual role play, trips to the gun range and false 911 calls, all in an attempt to kill Banfield's wife and frame Ryan, according to prosecutors.
    


            Peres Magalhães was initially charged with murder and has since pleaded guilty to a lesser count of involuntary manslaughter for fatally shooting Ryan.
    


            She has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for a recommendation that she be sentenced to time served, according to the plea agreement. She is likely to be the star witness in Banfield's murder trial.
    


            The trial is expected to last about four weeks.
    


            Banfield has been held without bond since his arrest, according to police. He faces up to life in prison on the murder charges.
    


            The case began with calls to 911 from within the Banfields' Herndon, Virginia, home on February 24, 2023. In one call, Banfield told dispatchers he'd shot a man who stabbed his wife, according to police. There was no forced entry at the home.
    


            In an upstairs bedroom, police found Christine Banfield, 37, with stab wounds and Ryan, 39, dead of gunshot wounds nearby. She was taken to a hospital and later pronounced dead, according to Fairfax County Police Chief Kevin Davis.
    


            Peres Magalhães, 25, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder and a firearm offense in October 2023 and has been in custody since her arrest.
    


            When police searched the home, they found a framed photo of Banfield and Peres Magalhães smiling together on his bedside table.
    


            A year later, in October 2024, court records show Peres Magalhães pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter. At a plea hearing, prosecutors read aloud a statement laying out the key allegations in the case.
    


            As they alleged, Peres Magalhães began working as an au pair for the couple in late 2021, and in August 2022 she and Brendan Banfield began an extra-marital relationship.
    


            “In the fall of 2022, Brendan Banfield expressed to Peres Magalhães his desire to be rid of his wife and soon thereafter began planning to kill his wife as well as, ultimately, Joseph Ryan, the victim in this case,” prosecutors said.
    


            Banfield set up an account on Fetlife.com, a sexual fetish site, began communicating with Ryan and lured him to the Banfield home, prosecutors said. Ryan “likely believed” he was meeting Christine Banfield for a consensual sexual encounter involving “violent sexual role play” with a knife, prosecutors said.
    


            Banfield directed Peres Magalhães to talk with Ryan in a phone call to confirm details, according to prosecutors. She expressed hesitation with the plan at various points, prosecutors said, but “he insisted it was too late for her to back out.”
    


            Banfield taught the au pair how to fire a gun at a local gun range in the fall and winter of 2022, prosecutors said.

            As part of their plan, when Ryan came to the home, Peres Magalhães called Banfield to report that a strange man was at the house, and Banfield was waiting at a nearby McDonald's so he could return to the home quickly, prosecutors said.
    


            He and Peres Magalhães put his child in the basement and then went upstairs to the Banfields' bedroom, with Brendan Banfield holding his service weapon and the au pair holding a firearm he had purchased a month earlier, according to prosecutors.
    


            “The two entered the bedroom and Joseph Ryan was holding Christine Banfield down,” prosecutors said. “Brendan Banfield called out, ‘Police officer,' and then shot Joseph Ryan in the head, and Ryan fell away from Christine Banfield.”
    


            Peres Magalhães called 911 but ended the call at Banfield's direction, prosecutors said.
    


            Banfield stabbed his wife, according to prosecutors. Peres Magalhães saw Ryan still moving and shot him, prosecutors said.
    


            The au pair then called 911 again and they reported the killings as if Ryan was an intruder who had stabbed Banfield's wife, according to prosecutors.
    


            Banfield was indicted on murder charges in September 2024. The indictment alleges he “willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation” killed his wife and Ryan.
    


            “I knew, I suspected, I had a feeling that there was a lot more to what met the eye that morning,” Chief Davis said. “And certainly it has taken a road, 570 days later, where we are finally in a position to announce that two persons are being charged and held responsible and introduced to our criminal justice system for these two murders.”
    


            Weeks later, Peres Magalhães pleaded guilty to the lesser charge for shooting and killing Ryan, according to prosecutors.
    


            “Today's agreement marks a significant step forward in this case, and it is an important development in our pursuit of justice for the victims and their families,” Fairfax County Commonwealth's Attorney Steve Descano said of the au pair's guilty plea.
    


            In addition, Banfield was indicted on a count of felony child abuse and neglect and felony child cruelty related to the killings in December 2024. His daughter, who was 4 at the time, was present at the scene, according to prosecutors.

Becky Pepper-Jackson knows that the upcoming sports season could be her last. West Virginia has banned transgender girls like the discus-throwing sophomore from competing in girls and women's sports. The Supreme Court hears arguments in the case this week.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Becky Pepper-Jackson finished third in the discus throw in West Virginia last year though she was in just her first year of high school. Now a 15-year-old sophomore, Pepper-Jackson is aware that her upcoming season could be her last.

West Virginia has banned transgender girls like Pepper-Jackson from competing in girls and women's sports, and is among the more than two dozen states with similar laws. Though the West Virginia law has been blocked by lower courts, the outcome could be different at the conservative-dominated Supreme Court, which has allowed multiple restrictions on transgender people to be enforced in the past year. 

The justices are hearing arguments Tuesday in two cases over whether the sports bans violate the Constitution or the landmark federal law known as Title IX that prohibits sex discrimination in education. The second case comes from Idaho, where college student Lindsay Hecox challenged that state's law.

Decisions are expected by early summer.

President Donald Trump's Republican administration has targeted transgender Americans from the first day of his second term, including ousting transgender people from the military and declaring that gender is immutable and determined at birth.

Pepper-Jackson has become the face of the nationwide battle over the participation of transgender girls in athletics that has played out at both the state and federal levels as Republicans have leveraged the issue as a fight for athletic fairness for women and girls.




“I think it's something that needs to be done,” Pepper-Jackson said in an interview with The Associated Press that was conducted over Zoom. “It's something I'm here to do because ... this is important to me. I know it's important to other people. So, like, I'm here for it.”

She sat alongside her mother, Heather Jackson, on a sofa in their home just outside Bridgeport, a rural West Virginia community about 40 miles southwest of Morgantown, to talk about a legal fight that began when she was a middle schooler who finished near the back of the pack in cross-country races.

Pepper-Jackson has grown into a competitive discus and shot put thrower. In addition to the bronze medal in the discus, she finished eighth among shot putters.

She attributes her success to hard work, practicing at school and in her backyard, and lifting weights. Pepper-Jackson has been taking puberty-blocking medication and has publicly identified as a girl since she was in the third grade, though the Supreme Court's decision in June upholding state bans on gender-affirming medical treatment for minors has forced her to go out of state for care.

Her very improvement as an athlete has been cited as a reason she should not be allowed to compete against girls.

 “There are immutable physical and biological characteristic differences between men and women that make men bigger, stronger, and faster than women. And if we allow biological males to play sports against biological females, those differences will erode the ability and the places for women in these sports which we have fought so hard for over the last 50 years,” West Virginia's attorney general, JB McCuskey, said in an AP interview. McCuskey said he is not aware of any other transgender athlete in the state who has competed or is trying to compete in girls or women's sports.

Despite the small numbers of transgender athletes, the issue has taken on outsize importance. The NCAA and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committees banned transgender women from women's sports after Trump signed an executive order aimed at barring their participation.

The public generally is supportive of the limits. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in October 2025 found that about 6 in 10 U.S. adults “strongly” or “somewhat” favored requiring transgender children and teenagers to only compete on sports teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth, not the gender they identify with, while about 2 in 10 were “strongly” or “somewhat” opposed and about one-quarter did not have an opinion.

About 2.1 million adults, or 0.8%, and 724,000 people age 13 to 17, or 3.3%, identify as transgender in the U.S., according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. 

Those allied with the administration on the issue paint it in broader terms than just sports, pointing to state laws, Trump administration policies and court rulings against transgender people.

“I think there are cultural, political, legal headwinds all supporting this notion that it's just a lie that a man can be a woman,” said John Bursch, a lawyer with the conservative Christian law firm Alliance Defending Freedom that has led the legal campaign against transgender people. “And if we want a society that respects women and girls, then we need to come to terms with that truth. And the sooner that we do that, the better it will be for women everywhere, whether that be in high school sports teams, high school locker rooms and showers, abused women's shelters, women's prisons.”

But Heather Jackson offered different terms to describe the effort to keep her daughter off West Virginia's playing fields. 

“Hatred. It's nothing but hatred,” she said. “This community is the community du jour. We have a long history of isolating marginalized parts of the community.”

Pepper-Jackson has seen some of the uglier side of the debate on display, including when a competitor wore a T-shirt at the championship meet that said, “Men Don't Belong in Women's Sports.”

“I wish these people would educate themselves. Just so they would know that I'm just there to have a good time. That's it. But it just, it hurts sometimes, like, it gets to me sometimes, but I try to brush it off,” she said.

One schoolmate, identified as A.C. in court papers, said Pepper-Jackson has herself used graphic language in sexually bullying her teammates.

Asked whether she said any of what is alleged, Pepper-Jackson said, “I did not. And the school ruled that there was no evidence to prove that it was true.” 

The legal fight will turn on whether the Constitution's equal protection clause or the Title IX anti-discrimination law protects transgender people.

The court ruled in 2020 that workplace discrimination against transgender people is sex discrimination, but refused to extend the logic of that decision to the case over health care for transgender minors.

The court has been deluged by dueling legal briefs from Republican- and Democratic-led states, members of Congress, athletes, doctors, scientists and scholars.

The outcome also could influence separate legal efforts seeking to bar transgender athletes in states that have continued to allow them to compete. 

If Pepper-Jackson is forced to stop competing, she said she will still be able to lift weights and continue playing trumpet in the school concert and jazz bands. 

“It will hurt a lot, and I know it will, but that's what I'll have to do,” she said.

Thousands of widows in western Kenya face losing their land after their husbands die. In certain ethnic groups, widows are pressured to marry their late husband's brother or have sex with another man to “cleanse” them of the stigma of widowhood. Women who refuse can be disinherited. Kenya's constitution guarantees all citizens the right to own land. But often women are unaware. But the local assembly in one Kenyan county has unanimously passed a Widows Protection Bill that would criminalize the forced disinheritance. (AP video by Jackson Njehia)

SIAYA, Kenya (AP) — Rebecca Anyango stood outside the house she has called home for 26 years, wondering how long it will remain hers.

As a widow, she's been threatened with eviction for years by her late husband's family, who claim she has no inheritance rights. This year they filed a lawsuit, and the 70-year-old Anyango has no legal representation.

She pointed out where her husband is buried, a few steps from the door.

“Where do I take the grave?” she asked softly.

Anyango is among thousands of widows in western Kenya who face losing everything after their husbands die. They are often in rural areas and with little education, unaware of their rights.

In the Luo, Luhya, and Kisii ethnic groups, widowhood can come with certain cultural expectations that can be considered illegal. One is “sexual cleansing,” in which a widow is made to have sex with another man, often a brother of her late husband, in the belief that the “dark cloud” of widowhood will lift.

Another is “wife inheritance,” in which a widow is taken in as a wife by her late husband's brother.

Those who refuse, like Anyango and others who spoke with The Associated Press, are often isolated and stripped of their land, a violation of Kenya's constitutional guarantee of the right to land ownership for all citizens.

“If the woman is not aware of what protects her, then she will be disinherited,” said Simiyu Waddimba, who teaches anthropology at the University of Nairobi and authored a paper on wife inheritance.




But in November, the local assembly in Siaya County, where Anyango lives, unanimously passed a Widows Protection Bill. If signed by the governor, it will criminalize forced disinheritance or forced remarriage.

The legislation was championed by county legislator Scholastica Madowo, herself a widow and one of four elected women in the 42-member local assembly. She said the “atrocities that the women go through” inspired her to act.

“Those cultural practices are actually a violation of their rights unless the woman does it willingly,” she said.

While Madowo wasn't forcibly disinherited or remarried, she faced opponents' insinuations about her widowhood during her campaign for office, including allegations that she had killed her husband.

Her bill would establish welfare committees to help widows access legal aid to challenge disinheritance.

In neighboring Kisii County, Anne Bonareri was stripped of her home and her commercial property, which had been in her late husband's name.

Within hours of her husband's death in 1997, her in-laws also took his possessions, including photos and clothes. Bonareri was left with three young children and another on the way.

“They took everything, and I was left with one photo of the father,” the 60-year-old recalled, her voice catching.

The day after the burial, she said, her husband's elder brother came to claim her as a wife. When she refused, armed men were sent to attack her.

Bonareri said she later worked three jobs to buy a small piece of land and build a new house.

Her daughter, Emma Mong'ute, founded the Amandla MEK Foundation in 2019 to help women in such circumstances by offering legal advice and connecting them to pro bono lawyers. She said they have had some success in helping women retain land.

Banned like her mother from their land, and unable to visit her father's grave there, Mong'ute said the disinheritance of widows creates a cycle of poverty for hundreds of thousands of children in Kenya. She said her organization would consider pushing for a bill like the one in Siaya County.

Some widows elsewhere in Africa face similar pressures. In southern Africa, there is tension between general and customary law, which dominates inheritance cases.

“While the general law protects the inheritance rights of surviving spouses and children, customary practices still allow different ethnic groups to administer estates according to their traditions, often to the detriment of widows,” said Misheck Dube, a former associate professor at the University of Limpopo in South Africa who has researched widowhood.

Most widows are disinherited because they don't understand Kenya's land succession laws, which recognize widows and children as the true inheritors, said Easter Okech with the Kenya Female Advisory Organization in Kisumu County.

She now offers legal training for women so they can represent themselves, and some are doing so in ongoing cases. She also encourages people to write wills — many people in rural areas don't make one — and have a neutral executor. 

Some widows in western Kenya have fought back on their own.

Marie Owino, a 87-year-old former teacher, said she knew her rights under the law. She said her confidence and financial independence meant her in-laws “didn't dare” to disinherit her after her husband died 33 years ago.

She still lives in the brick house she and her husband shared on their 100 acres, its manicured gardens a symbol of the boundaries she laid down long ago.

“Once you have established yourself that you can, then I'm telling you all those people will give you respect,” she said.

ST. LOUIS (AP) — World champions and Olympic favorites Ilia Malinin and the ice dance team of Madison Chock and Evan Bates turned the final night of the U.S. Figure Skating Championships on Saturday into less of a competition and more of a coronation.

Malinin easily won his fourth straight title despite a dialed-back free skate that included just three quads — still more than anyone in the field, but far fewer than the seven it could include. And the duo of Chock and Bates won their record seventh championship with a flamenco-style free dance set to a version of “Paint It Black” from the dystopian sci-fi Western show “Westworld.”

They will be the anchors for a powerful American team headed to the Milan Cortina Games in less than a month.

“I decided not to go for any risks. I wanted to play it safe, because hopefully in a few weeks I have to go again,” Malinin said.

Malinin finished with 324.88 points to continue an unbeaten streak stretching more than two years. Andrew Torgashev was a distant second with 267.62 points, while Maxim Naumov finished third by less than a tenth of a point over Jacob Sanchez.

In doing so, Naumov may have fulfilled a dream he held along with his late parents.

Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova were among those killed when an American Airlines flight collided with a helicopter and crashed into the icy Potomac River in January 2025. One of the last conversations the couple had with their son was about what it would take for the 24-year-old Naumov to earn one of three men's spots on the upcoming Olympic team.




“I gritted my teeth on everything. I fought on everything. If I had to crawl, I would crawl to the end,” Naumov said, “but I made it.”

Chock and Bates, the three-time reigning world champions, wound up with 228.87 points following the free dance. Emilea Zingas and Vadym Kolesnik were second with 213.65 while Christina Carreira and Anthony Ponomarenko were third with 206.95.

Those three are expected to fill out the American dance team for the Olympics when official selections are announced Sunday.

“The feeling that we got from the audience today was unlike anything I've ever felt before,” said Chock, who along with Bates helped the Americans win team gold at the Beijing Olympics four years ago, but finished a disappointing fourth in the ice dance.

“Our performance was definitely the best we've skated the free dance all year,” Bates said, “and it shows the plan is working, and we like to build momentum through the season. It's a great feeling going into a big event knowing you skated well the previous event.”

Chock and Bates will be heavy favorites to win gold next month in Italy. 

Just like their 21-year-old teammate from Fairfax, Virginia.

Malinin was somewhat controversially left off the American team for Beijing, when U.S. Figure Skating officials chose the more experienced Jason Brown over him. Rather than sulk, the self-styled “Quad God” with the unique, avant-garde style turned the four years since then into an unstoppable march through just about every competition he has entered.

This season, he won the the lower-level Lombardia Trophy, the Grand Prix de France, Skate America and his third consecutive Grand Prix Final, the most prestigious event outside of the Olympics and the world championships.

Skating to a musical medley featuring his own voice-over, Malinin opened with a quad flip, then landed a triple axel, before hitting a triple lutz rather than a quad lutz. Malinin added a quad lutz and a quad salchow-triple axel combination later in the program, almost as if to remind folks that even when he's playing it safe, he can still land the big jumps whenever he wants.

Skating to “In This Shirt” by The Irrepressibles, Naumov landed an opening quad salchow but tripled his other planned quad. He was otherwise solid on his jumps, other than spinning out on his last combination jump, and earned his own standing ovation.

It was an emotional week for Naumov, who brought to the kiss-and-cry area an old photo of him with his parents.

The 24-year-old Torgashev, who is half Ukrainian and still has family in the war-torn country, landed both of his quads during a clean free skate, one of them in combination with a double axel. He also one-handed cartwheeled across the ice, and he punched the air at the finish, once he was done spinning like a top in the middle of the ice.

It was an emphatic statement by Torgashev for his inclusion on the Olympic team.

Country star Kix Brooks and head winemaker of Lazarre Wines, Adam Lazarre, join 'Fox & Friends' to promote 'Wine Nation,' a three-part series hosted by Abby Hornacek on Fox Nation.

You might have an opened bottle of wine from a recent celebration and wonder, ""Is this still good?""

Wine that's been open for too long may not make you sick — but it won't taste the way it was intended, according to the ""Wine Country"" blog.

Leaving wine open for too long can strip its brightness, dull its aromas and mute its flavors, experts say.

In the worst cases, opened wine can develop a sour, vinegary taste.

What's a good rule of thumb for opening and storing wines?

An opened bottle of wine sitting in the fridge may still be drinkable, but experts warn the taste can change quickly. (iStock)

Dana Sacco, owner of The Empty Glass in Tomball, Texas, said there's a reason opened wine doesn't taste good forever.

Once opened, it's ""exposed to more oxygen, heat, light, yeast and bacteria,"" the wine bar owner said.

Those factors cause chemical reactions that alter the quality of the wine, Sacco said, which is why refrigeration is key.

""Storing wine in lower temperatures will help slow down these chemical reactions and keep opened wine fresher longer,"" she said.

Oxygen exposure begins altering wine the moment a bottle is uncorked, affecting aroma, flavor and texture. (iStock)

How long your wine can last depends heavily on the type, the wine expert said.

Sparkling wines can last between one and two days without losing too much of their flavor, while light white wines and rosés can last between four and five days, according to Sacco.

Rich white wines should generally be consumed within three to five days after opening, with red wine having a similar timeline, Sacco said. 

She noted that port is the sturdiest wine in this regard, as it can be consumed between one and three weeks after it's opened.

Sometimes an opened bottle of wine can have improved taste, experts say. (iStock)

In some cases, Sacco said, opening wine can actually improve its taste.

""Aerating wines helps soften tannins, release complex scents and elevate your overall tasting experience,"" Sacco said. ""Full-bodied reds are normally better aerated.""

""Wine is supposed to be fun and educational, along with enjoyable,"" she added.

Proper storage can make the difference between wine staying enjoyable for days or degrading overnight. (iStock)

If you want to preserve your wine at the best quality, Sacco recommends using wine pumps, which reduce the oxygen inside the bottle.

Tens of thousands of anti-ICE agitators took to the streets of major cities across the country this weekend in a raft of demonstrations largely organized by a coalition of left-wing groups.

The ICE Out for Good coalition called for a ""weekend of action"" starting Saturday, organizing more than 1,000 events nationwide. The coalition was largely organized by Indivisible, the same left-wing group that pushed ""No Kings"" protests against President Donald Trump in 2025.

Protests focus on the death of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis last week. She was killed in a confrontation with ICE agents after federal authorities say she attempted to run over one of the officers.

""Renee Nicole Good was a wife, a mother of three, and a member of her community. She, and the dozens of other sons, daughters, friends, siblings, parents, and community members who have been killed by ICE, should be alive today,"" said Indivisible co-executive director Leah Greenberg.

""This weekend, people across the country are coming together to grieve, honor those we've lost, and demand accountability from a system that has operated with impunity for far too long. ICE's violence is not a statistic, it has names, families, and futures attached to it, and we refuse to look away or stay silent,"" she added.

Protests led to scuffles with police and arrests in several states on Saturday. Austin Police detained at least three anti-ICE agitators as protests escalated there.

Footage also shows Los Angeles police facing down agitators outside an ICE detention center.

Multiple arrests were made after a dispersal order was issued and agitators refused to leave the area as instructed, according to LAPD. Multiple agitators were seen on video being detained just before 7 p.m. local time.

""You must leave the area,"" police wrote in a statement on X.

Members of the Trump administration have reiterated that the ICE operations are targeting criminal illegal aliens. Vice President JD Vance highlighted a list of individuals arrested in Minnesota that includes convicted child rapists and murderers.

 ‘Fox News Live' anchor Aishah Hasnie discusses Iran's widespread protests amid economic volatility and previews her new show during ‘Fox & Friends Weekend.'

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibility of U.S. intervention in Iran, according to a report.

The two leaders spoke by phone Saturday as Israel is on ""high alert,"" preparing for the possibility of U.S. military intervention in Iran, according to Reuters, citing multiple Israeli sources.

The report comes as nationwide anti-regime demonstrations across Iran hit the two-week mark.

On Saturday, the Iranian regime triggered an internet ""kill switch"" in an apparent effort to conceal alleged abuses by security forces and as protests against it surged nationwide, according to a cybersecurity expert. The blackout reduced internet access to a fraction of normal levels.

On Sunday, Iran's parliament speaker warned that the U.S. military and Israel would be ""legitimate targets"" if America strikes the Islamic Republic.

Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf issued the threat as lawmakers rushed the dais in the Iranian parliament, shouting, ""Death to America!"" according to The Associated Press.

President Donald Trump offered support for the protesters on Saturday, writing on Truth Social that ""Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!""

At a news conference Friday, Trump said Iran was facing mounting pressure as unrest spreads across the country.

""Iran's in big trouble,"" he said. ""It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago. We're watching the situation very carefully.""

The president said the U.S. would respond forcefully if the regime resorts to mass violence. 

""We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts. And that doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts,"" he said.

You have probably seen the viral videos of apparently vacant Somali-run and state-subsidized day cares in Minneapolis. You may have seen that New York just announced $15 billion a year in universal child care in New York City.

You probably don't know that in the last 12 years, the number of child care workers has increased by about 33%, while the number of children ages 5 and under fell by 8.8%. The explosion of the child care industry has persisted even while the number of stay-at-home mothers has risen in recent years.

GRIFTERS AND GRAFTERS

The story here is not just a matter of Somali fraudsters. It's a much bigger story about special-interest politics boosted by ideology and masquerading as family policy.

For the past two decades, Democrats have been pumping billions of dollars into the child care industry at the behest of labor unions, who then use the state funding as a lever by which to unionize all child-care workers, including the unwilling.

These same unions, in turn, funnel this taxpayer money back to the Democratic politicians.

When you hear a Democratic politician say they want “universal child care,” or campaign on expanding “affordable, high-quality child care,” you should suspect that they are playing patronage politics with the labor union allies.

Minnesota's raft of child care subsidies is just one example, but it's a telling example.

Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) was reelected in 2022, and his party took control of both legislative chambers — its first “trifecta” in a decade.

The margins were thin, but the party's ambitions were great. It accomplished almost everything it set out to do. Liberals celebrated this as “the Minnesota Miracle.” The biggest thing they did was expand all sorts of subsidies for child care.

Politicians such as Walz painted this as a win for parents, but it wasn't parents who crafted these policies and pushed them across the finish line.

Democratic Minnesota state Rep. Jamie Long explained the progressive approach: “You need good ideas. … You need elected politicians who are going to be supporting those ideas, and then you need outside organizing for elections and to support those votes.”

The Washington Post's EJ Dionne elaborated: “All three are key to getting things done. In Minnesota, key players included unions, environmental groups and faith-based organizers in the appropriately named Isaiah organization. In the run-up to the session, the outside groups were brought into the task of crafting an agenda.”

That is, Democrats let the outside groups, including the unions, craft their child care policies.

It was telling that Democrats did this with a razor-thin majority. Their aggressive actions in 2023 should be understood in part as a strategic effort to build political strength: funnel more money to their political allies, which will help them win in two, four, and eight years.

Building their political power is explicitly the goal of these outside groups. Isaiah, one of the groups Dionne cited, has “Build Power” in its motto. Isaiah's biggest project is a program called “Kids Count on Us,” which is a lobby effort to boost state subsidies for child care.

This is explicitly a supply-side project more than a demand-side one. As Kids Count on Us describes itself, “Providers, teachers, and parents organizing together.”

This is an industry lobby looking for more federal funds. The organization brags, “We won over $1 Billion in childcare funding in Minnesota.”

One item the industry won: increasing the amount the Child Care Assistance Program will pay to child care providers. Under the new law, the taxpayer would pay these subsidized child care providers well above the average going rate — specifically, equal to the 75th percentile.

In that 2023 session, the groups also lobbied successfully to extend special COVID-19-era direct payments to child care providers. Called the “Great Start Compensation Support Payment Program,” it is “designed to support the child care and early learning industry and workforce,” according to the legislature. It's a $100-million-a-year subsidy directly to the industry. This money never goes to parents. It just goes to the businesses, and thus to the unions.

In that 2022 cycle, government unions, such as AFSCME and SEIU, spent more than $13 million on Minnesota politics, with almost all of the money going to Democrats.

A similar story has played out in other states.

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) in 2019 signed AB 387, which effectively transformed tens of thousands of child care workers into state employees for the purposes of union organizing.

Workers at day cares were covered, as were grandmas who did day care in their homes. Anyone who took in state-subsidized children became a presumed member of the very partisan and hard-left unions SEIU and AFSCME.

While these day care workers would not technically be state employees, the law dictated that their negotiating counterparty would be Newsom.

This bill was crafted and pushed by a child care lobby called Child Care Providers United, a coalition formed by SEIU and AFSCME.

So, taxpayer subsidies were the mechanism by which day care workers became members of SEIU and AFSCME. These unions, which are very liberal and 100% aligned with Democrats, then tapped into these 40,000 workers as an organizing army and a source of funds — both of which were put to work for the Left.

As an added bonus, the unions often pocket money from unwilling child care workers.

“In several states, governments are automatically deducting a portion of Medicaid or other government aid from home healthcare and family childcare (day care) providers' assistance checks and giving that money to government unions,” the State Policy Network reported. “Many providers are unaware this money is even being taken; others are aware but struggle to stop their state and union from skimming money from their checks; and some caregivers allege the unions and governments are fraudulently skimming the money.”

In Washington state, this little racket started much earlier. Since 2004, SEIU has been the bargaining representative for any licensed childcare provider that receives state money through the “Working Connections Child Care” subsidy. Of course, SEIU is “bargaining” with liberal state politicians who are spending other people's money, and so it gets a lot of what it wants.

In short, Democratic politicians create subsidies for day care for poor parents, the subsidies effectively turn day care providers into members of Democrat-aligned unions, those unions then lobby to expand these subsidies to pay above market rate, and to cover more families.

Meanwhile, most parents do not want formal child care. The Bipartisan Policy Center published a paper in 2022 asking “What Keeps Employed Parents Out of the Childcare System?” The answer: parents don't want to be in the “childcare system.”

“More than half of parents would still prefer informal child care, even if formal care was free and convenient,” BPC found.

This is the consistent finding of polls and studies in the United States. Most parents would like to simply work less and thus take care of their children, and to the extent they need or want outside help, they would prefer informal, often unpaid child care, such as neighborhood babysitting co-ops or help from grandma.

IF YOU'RE A STAY-AT-HOME-PARENT, BIDEN THINKS YOU'RE PART OF THE PROBLEM

But stay-at-home mothers and informal networks do not pump money into the system that allows the unions to grow and kick money back to politicians.

So if you wonder why Democrats' only answer, when asked about family policy, is day care subsidies, just follow the money.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump on Sunday warned Cuba to “make a deal” before the United States cuts off the Caribbean island's supply of oil and money coming from Venezuela.

The president's statement comes just over one week after the U.S. military stormed Venezuela and captured Nicolas Maduro. Part of the Trump administration's calculus to overtake Venezuela was its standing as the country with the world's largest proven oil reserves.

HOW TRUMP'S OIL TANKER SEIZURES FIT IN THE US-VENEZUELA STRATEGY

Cuba relied on subsidized Venezuelan oil to bolster its strained economy. But now that the U.S. government is in charge of Venezuela for the time being, Cuba's future remains uncertain.

“Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela. In return, Cuba provided ‘Security Services' for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE! Most of those Cubans are DEAD from last [week's] U.S.A. attack, and Venezuela doesn't need protection anymore from the thugs and extortionists who held them hostage for so many years,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

“Venezuela now has the United States of America, the most powerful military in the World (by far!), to protect them, and protect them we will. THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA – ZERO! I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,” he concluded.

Trump previously said Cuba is “ready to fall” after the U.S. seized Venezuelan oil for itself.

FOUR TAKEAWAYS FROM HOUSE OVERSIGHT'S HEATED MINNESOTA FRAUD HEARING

The administration last week successfully pressed Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, to share the country's oil with the U.S. In exchange, Venezuela will buy American-made products in an oil deal that Trump says makes the U.S. into the South American nation's principal trading partner.

Rodriguez will remain in place as the country's leader unless she upsets the Trump administration in some way. In that case, she could be replaced. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. must first oversee “stabilization” and “recovery” in Venezuela before a transition of power follows.

Unless it strikes a deal as Trump suggested, Cuba is set to suffer significantly from the loss of Venezuelan oil. Reuters reported that between January and November 2025, the island received an average of 27,000 barrels per day from Venezuela. That amount covered roughly 50% of Cuba's oil deficit. The Cuban economy is already struggling with frequent blackouts and trade sanctions, among other problems.

Cuba has not responded to Trump's ultimatum on Sunday morning.

HOW MADURO'S FALL WILL HIT CUBA

Rep. Carlos Gimenez (R-FL) personally thanked Trump for getting involved in Cuban affairs.

“I was born in Cuba & forced from home shortly after the Communist takeover. Today, I represent my community in Congress,” Gimenez wrote on X. “Thank you, President Trump, first Venezuela & next is Cuba. We will be forever grateful. Our hemisphere must be the hemisphere of liberty!”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Why so many people take advantage of airlines' service dog loophole.

This past month I, like many Americans, flew back home for the holidays. On the first leg of that trip, from New York to Los Angeles, a dog in a “service dog” vest barked at me at the gate. The dog (not its given name), looked to be a stout French bulldog, paced back and forth, and yapped at a couple of other travelers.

On the way back from LAX, I noticed more dogs in service vests — a dachshund, another (different) Frenchie, a few mixed breeds — in line with their humans, waiting for desk agents. It all made me realize how many dogs traveling these days are designated service dogs, so many that there's no way each one was a thoroughly-trained working canine. Some of these pooches had to be impostors.

Granted, because so many people fly during the holidays it was probably easier to spot them; but I'm obviously not the only person who's noticed the rise of questionable, if not fake service dogs. Their proliferation raises a few questions.

Why are there so many? Why and how do so many people have them? Is certification that easy to get? Do this many people need them? Why is this one barking at me? Are these people who just want to take their dog on their trip? Does being suspicious of some of them make me awful? Is a fake service dog really that bad?

Sadly, I could not speak to an actual service dog for an interview regarding this contentious subject. But I did talk to experts, flight attendants, and people who train service dogs about how canine service impersonators make their job and the jobs of actual service dogs that much harder.

More and more people want to travel with their pets, and despite airline assurances about safety, owners still harbor some overall worry about traveling with their animals in cargo. They're also managing the reality that boarding a dog can be expensive and comes with its own set of worries.

At the same time, traveling in the US with a pet dog in cabin — thanks to a multitude of rules — is actually difficult. Officially, pups must be able to fit in an approved carrier that fits underneath the seat in front of you. They must also be able to turn around in said carrier and must remain zipped up the entire time. If a dog fits all those requirements, it'll cost roughly $150 per leg of the trip on most major US airlines.

Essentially, there's a glut of people who want to travel with their dogs, and the only way they can is only available to small ones. Even then, not every small dog is happy to be in a secured carrier. And if there's any certainty about people, it's that some of them will find a way to get what they want.

“I think a lot of people started to take advantage of the fact that we really want our dogs to be with us,” says Jessica Reiss, the program director at Canine Companions, an organization that trains and places service dogs with people living with disabilities.

At Canine Companions, Labrador retrievers, golden retrievers, and Labrador-golden crosses (goldens and Labradors are two of the “fab four” breeds that experts say excel at becoming service dogs) undergo a six-month training program that includes responding to roughly 45 or so tasks that include opening and closing doors, responding to alarms and alerts, pulling wheelchairs, and item identification. Service dog recipients complete an intensive program as well.

“In order to place a dog with a person, that person comes in and stays with us for two weeks. They are literally living, breathing, everything with the dog 24 hours a day — [they're taught] dog behavior, dog body language, how to deal with fear reactivity as the typical dog owner,” Reiss says, listing off just a few things that a person learns in those 14 days.

While training at Canine Companions is rigorous, programs like it are not the standard. Part of the problem is that there is no standard.

Reiss explained to me that even though the Department of Transportation has tried to stifle the travelers abusing pet travel (e.g., disallowing emotional support animals) and the US has made service animal designation seemingly stricter, people still find ways to circumvent those restrictions.

“There's this loophole that says, you can privately train your dog to be a service dog, and by definition what that means is the dog has to be able to provide tasks that mitigate a person's disability,” Reiss says. While private training can be more accommodating and accessible (i.e., for those unable to afford a trainer or who don't have a trainer close by), it also means that more people take advantage of the lack of regulation.

“There are plenty of owner-trained, well-behaved service dogs, and they are training their dogs to do actual physical tasks, and they should be given access. But I think we're also talking about a lot of people not wanting to leave their dogs at home,” Reiss says.

This result is a lot of confusion and lack of consistency. That's how you get dogs like the barking Frenchy in a service vest that receives the same flying privileges as a dog that Canine Companions bred, socialized, and trained. It's also why there are so many frustrating anecdotes of “service dogs” misbehaving on planes (and on land too).

I spoke to a handful of US flight attendants who confirm that they've seen an uptick in service dogs on flight. But they consistently noted that beyond paperwork, they're instructed not to ask owners any questions, even though they might have suspicions about a rowdy, howling husky puppy. One who wished to remain anonymous put it to me this way: “Surely this geriatric Chihuahua is not saving anyone's life…but it's not in my job description to verify those things.”

That said, it's even more complicated, because no one wants to be a person who treats someone with a disability with suspicion or doubt. How do you distinguish real service dogs from those sneaking in via the loophole without making someone feel attacked or dehumanized?

As an owner of a dog small enough to fit as a carry-on, there doesn't really seem to be any benefit to following the airline rules. Following all the air cabin regulations for dogs costs more (service animals fly for free) and makes flying more claustrophobic (being zipped up in a carrier versus service animals who lay on the cabin floor or on a lap). If the “right” way to get a dog onboard is so arbitrary and unappealing, and the faux way is relatively easier and free, what's the point in following the rules?

“That's the thing, the rules don't even matter,” Molly Carta, a woman living with cerebral palsy who has a service dog named Slate, tells Vox. “I feel that way half the time too. I'm like, why did I pay $50 for this vet visit to get this form filled out? This person over here is just going to walk on with their dog.”

Carta explained to me that she travels two to three times per year, and has seen the number of service dogs boom in the past decade, with the largest increase coming over the past three to five years. (By law, there is no official registry of service dogs.) Slate, whom she matched with through Canine Companions, is her second service dog, and recently they traveled from Connecticut to Wisconsin and made a connection in Chicago through O'Hare.

“There were so many other dogs in that airport that it was such a nightmare to even just get from our gate to the next gate,” she tells me, noting that multiple dogs tried to interact with, bark at, and approach Slate. While Slate is trained to maintain focus, stay put, and stay calm during flights, distractions make his job in assisting Carta harder — possibly inhibiting his ability to help her during an emergency. Carta, who uses a scooter and a walker, explains that this also puts an ample amount of unnecessary stress on Slate.

“If I'm going somewhere with a bunch of friends, a lot of times I won't travel with him because it's probably not worth the stress. If I know I have a bunch of people around that can help me in the same ways that he would,” Carta says.

Carta also often worries about where she's placed on a plane. In her experience, people with disabilities and service dogs are seated in the bulkheads. Hypothetically, if there's multiple people with service dogs, who gets that seat? And will there be multiple dogs in that row?

Carta having doubts about taking her service dog with her traveling sure seems like a failure of rules meant to help her and other people living with disabilities. She also mentioned that she tends to feel like she's on the defensive because of people questioning whether Slate is an actual service dog — likely due to their prior experiences with unruly pups and people abusing the privilege. But unless people know someone like Carta in their lives, it's hard to connect how her experience would be impacted by someone thinking they're harmlessly fudging the rules.

For a long time, Carta believed that educating people about how service dogs are a medical need was the answer. But the more and more time that passes, the more she's realized that more public awareness doesn't work if people aren't willing to listen. And while Carta hopes for legislation, untangling the knot of service animals without doing more damage to the people who need them is tricky too, now that so many people have abused the loophole.

“I don't know what that legislation would look like, but maybe something that dissuades people from taking away from those of us that really need service dogs,” Carta says. “It's about recognizing that they are a medical need.”

Perhaps the most difficult obstacle to overcome is plain individual selfishness. It's hard to put other people ahead of yourself, especially in a situation as miserable as air travel, and taking your dog on vacation seems harmless enough. In that moment, no one is thinking about any kind of social contract or how their accompanying pooch could affect someone else down the line. Teaching someone that kind of empathy is something a dog, service or not, can't even do.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:vox.com","We're probably going to learn to live with AI music","https://www.vox.com/podcasts/474751/ai-music-suno-generator","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 11:30:00 GMT","

When news breaks, you need to understand what actually matters. At Vox, our mission is to help you make sense of the world — and that work has never been more vital. But we can't do it on our own.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

Here's what the future might sound like, according to a science writer who experimented with it.

According to the French music streaming service Deezer, there are about 50,000 fully AI-generated songs uploaded to its platform every day. Many of these songs won't reach a wide audience, but over the past year, a few have gained millions of listens.

Which raises the question: If our future is going to be filled with this kind of AI music, what does that future sound like?

Deni Béchard is the senior science writer at Scientific American. For the better part of a month, Béchard has only allowed himself to listen to his own AI-generated music using the AI music app Suno. He says the experiment is an attempt to think more critically about how we might engage with this kind of music in the future.

Béchard spoke with Today, Explained host Noel King spoke about what he's learned so far and how his AI creations stack up to human-made music. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

There's much more in the full podcast — including snippets of Béchard's songs — so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Alright, so you're using Suno, you said, to create the songs. 

I come up with a prompt and I'll plug it in, and each prompt makes two songs, and I'll try to be as creative as possible. I'll usually plug it in two or three times and vary it, add different kinds of instruments or different kinds of vocals, and just plug a bunch of those in. One that made me laugh was a song called “Organ Trafficking.” I had asked for a contemporary rap song with female vocals, and I had asked for playful, ironic lyrics, and it comes up with this song, where organ trafficking is kind of the central metaphor. I was pretty surprised.

I think one of the things I've realised is that a lot of the music I listen to that is mainstream is, I would consider, heavily processed music — music that's designed to have a large market. And it doesn't feel very personal to me anyway, so I realized that in that particular context, [the music I made with AI] didn't feel very different a lot of the time.

Do you think if someone had handed you a playlist of 10 songs, five are AI, five are not, do you think you'd be able to tell the difference?

No, I don't think so.

Wow. And what does that tell you?

I mean, it tells me that the AI is getting very good.

One thing I noticed during this process was that a lot of the AI music that is popular, that people are listening to on Spotify that has millions of listeners [are] songs that are very soulful, very gritty.

It's like Xania Monet or Solomon Ray or Cain Walker's “Don't Tread on Me” — and Cain Walker's not a person. It's an AI avatar, right? Or Breaking Rust's “Livin' on Borrowed Time.” Those songs all feel just really authentic. This person really suffered through these things and felt these things. That's how they come across.

I think that AI tends to work best when it just leans into that authenticity because it kind of helps overcome the cognitive dissonance that we're thinking, This isn't really a deeply felt song, and it moves away from mainstream human-generated music — human-made music — which is often very heavily designed to be a summer hit or to go viral in some way. And it often doesn't have that level of authenticity, that feel of authenticity. I think when AI replicates that, we're more aware of it being superficial or artificial, because there's already an element of artificiality there.

Do you think when your experiment is done, you're going to keep making AI music?

I think I probably will.

Oh my god, you love the power. 

I think, you know, what has surprised me with it is, I'll be walking somewhere, and I'll think, “What if I were to ask it to combine these styles or put a banjo with a hip hop track and add this kind of vocals? What would I get?” I get curious now.

I would say now I'm at the point where I don't worry about the connection to the human. I did in the beginning. In the beginning, I was really like, “Who's this person?” When you're reading a book and you're halfway through the book and you think, “What human mind did this book come out of?” And you turn the book over and you look and see who the author was, and you Google them and you're like, “How in the world did they think of this?”

I just had that impulse so often in the beginning to want to know who felt this, who thought this. I just would have cognitive dissonance. I'd be going, “This is a machine. This machine did not fall in love. This machine did not suffer these experiences. This machine did not wake up at two in the morning and write this song just needing to express itself.” It was actually really bothering me. It kind of would block me from being able to enjoy the song.

And I thought, “Well, if somebody created an AI avatar and gave it a personality and they were a fictional character that existed in the Metaverse, and that AI avatar was a songmaker and it was singing this song, would that make it easier?” And weirdly, it would. It would make it a little easier. And so I kind of was just imagining these AI avatars, and I'm like, “Okay, I'm imagining a fictional character singing this song.” And that lasted maybe four or five days, and then I just got used to listening to the music, and I stopped thinking about it.

Does doing this experiment and seeing how you're reacting to this music change how you think about AI at all?

I think my conclusion from this is that in 10 or 15 or 20 years, there are going to be a lot of teenagers who look at the discussions we're having right now and go, “What are these people talking about? This is totally normal. Why would anybody feel so conflicted about this?”

I think we're going to adapt to it pretty quickly. That is my gut feeling. There are a lot of big questions around the creators and protecting artists and what it means to be an artist. There are a lot of questions that are going to come out of this, and I really hope that artists are as protected as possible and remunerated properly. But I think this is going to fit into our lives a lot more smoothly than I think we're realizing at the moment.

You can bet on pretty much anything these days. From sports to the weather to the price of a Labubu, platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi have offered people a new way to gamble. 

According to Danny Moses, one of the investors from ""The Big Short,"" they've also offered investors a useful tool to help navigate markets. 

Moses, who was among the investors betting against the US housing market ahead of the 2008 crash, isn't surprised by the prediction-market boom, and he thinks investors need to be watching these markets closely to stay on top of their game. 

""I think it's great to scan through all the prediction markets out there, certainly economics and business-related, because it actually will get you thinking about things you might have been missing,"" he told Business Insider in an interview before the new year.

Moses isn't too focused on short opportunities these days, despite being famous for his role in Michael Lewis's now-iconic saga of the housing crash. But he thinks that prediction markets can serve to provide valuable info for bullish and bearish investors alike.

He pointed to the recent example of popular fintech stock SoFi Technologies being listed as having a 38% chance of being added to the benchmark index in 2026, something that could be a likely catalyst for the stock, which is up 93% in the last year. 

""If you're short SoFi and you weren't thinking about the possibility of it being added to the S&P 500, like we just saw happen to Carvana recently, that's something you need to be aware of,"" Moses said.

That's not the only way prediction markets could help investors make smarter decisions. Moses said he thinks there may be circumstances where they can offer a more appealing risk-reward than investors might get from traditional derivatives. He cited crypto as an example. 

""Will bitcoin trade below $70,000 in the first quarter of 2026?"" he mused. ""Well, if I own bitcoin, and it's a much cheaper way to bet, if it's an eight cent possibility, so call it twelve to one, I might be getting a better market, or I might want to buy that rather than buying a put option on crypto.""

In his view, it's early days for prediction markets. Their usefulness will grow as a predictive tool for hedging traditional investments as well as gauging the likelihood of market-moving events. And as they grow, expect more prominent players to participate, he said. 

""I think institutions are going to start using prediction markets more, and as institutions use it, you're going to see a lot more activity,"" he said.

Tehran threatened on Sunday to retaliate against Israel and U.S. military bases in the event of U.S. strikes on Iran, issuing the warning as Israeli sources said Israel was on high alert for the possibility of any U.S. intervention.

With Iran's clerical establishment facing the biggest anti-government protests since 2022, U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in recent days, warning Iranian leaders against using force against demonstrators. On Saturday, Trump said the U.S. stands ""ready to help.""

Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, speaking in parliament on Sunday, warned against ""a miscalculation.""

""Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all U.S. bases and ships will be our legitimate target,"" said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards.

Authorities have stepped up efforts to quell the unrest that has spread across Iran since December 28. A U.S.-based rights group, HRANA, reported the death toll stood at 116, mostly protesters but including 37 members of the security forces.

The protests began in response to soaring inflation, before turning against the clerical establishment that has ruled since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The government accuses the U.S. and Israel of fomenting unrest.

Three Israeli sources, who were present for Israeli security consultations over the weekend, said Israel was on a high-alert footing, but did not elaborate on what that meant.

An Israeli government spokesperson declined to comment. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war in June last year, in which the U.S. joined Israel in launching airstrikes. Iran retaliated for those U.S. strikes by firing missiles at an American air base in Qatar.

The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout imposed by the authorities since Thursday. Internet monitoring watchdog Netblocks reported national connectivity levels remained about 1% of the norm.

A social media video posted on Saturday showed large crowds gathered in Tehran's Punak neighbourhood at night, drumming rhythmically on the railings of a bridge or other metal objects in an apparent sign of protest. Reuters verified the location.

Iranian state TV broadcast funeral processions in western Iranian cities such as Gachsaran and Yasuj for members of the security forces killed in the protests. The authorities have not said how many have been killed.

State TV reported that 30 members of the security forces would be buried in the central city of Isfahan, and that six security force members were killed by ""rioters"" in Kermanshah in the west. State TV also reported a mosque was torched by ""rioters"" in Mashhad, in the northeast, on Saturday night.

The Revolutionary Guards on Saturday accused ""terrorists"" of attacking security facilities.

Ahmad-Reza Radan, Iran's police chief, said security forces had stepped up efforts to confront ""rioters.""

Iran's rulers have quelled previous bouts of unrest, most recently in 2022 over the death in custody of a woman accused of violating dress codes.

Trump, posting on social media on Saturday, said: ""Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!""

In a phone call on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibility of U.S. intervention in Iran, according to an Israeli source who was present for the conversation.

A U.S. official confirmed the two men spoke but did not say what topics they discussed.

A senior U.S. intelligence official on Saturday described the situation in Iran as an ""endurance game"". The opposition was trying to keep up pressure until key government figures either flee or switch sides, while the authorities were trying to sow enough fear to clear the streets without giving the United States justification to intervene, the official said.

Israel has not signalled a desire to intervene, with tensions between the two arch-foes high over Israeli concerns about Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

In an interview with the Economist published on Friday, Netanyahu said there would be horrible consequences for Iran if it were to attack Israel. Alluding to the protests, he said: ""Everything else, I think we should see what is happening inside Iran.""

In this article

DETROIT – Outside General Motors' new world headquarters, between the 12-story building and the city's first new skyscraper in more than 30 years, sit two red Chevrolet pickup trucks. 

One is a 1963 Chevrolet K20. The other is a new Silverado EV. The trucks, while part of a temporary holiday display, are symbolic of what's inside the new global offices for the Detroit automaker: its past and present, woven together.

GM is occupying four of six office floors of the building and has filled them with artifacts, design nods and ""Easter eggs"" tied to the Detroit automaker's history. 

They range from a blueprint of GM's iconic design dome and an early map of its nearby proving grounds to an interior wallpaper of 300 patented technologies and a decorative wall of cassette tapes with songs featuring the automaker's brands as well playful references to executive stalwarts such as CEO Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss.

""Leadership asked when we were helping design the space to bring in some Easter eggs and details to represent who we are at GM, you know, honoring our culture and our history and our innovation,"" Rebecca Waldmeir, GM industrial design architecture and experience manager, told CNBC during a tour of the new headquarters.

Other surprises include references to relevant Detroit streets, design influences from GM's famed design campus in suburban Detroit and artwork and sculptures of its products.

Aside from the aesthetics, GM officials say the new offices will assist with collaboration and are more relevant to how the company expects its employees to work in a post-pandemic world. It will house executive offices and other corporate functions such as marketing, legal and finance.

""A headquarters really should be, at some level, a beacon for the culture of the company,"" said David Massaron, GM vice president of infrastructure and corporate citizenship. ""When you come in here, it should help people understand who we want to be.""

The new headquarters marks a significant square-foot reduction for the automaker's corporate office — from a towering complex called the Renaissance Center along the city's riverfront to just four floors, roughly 200,000 square feet, in the new building.

GM's new HQ is less than a mile from the RenCen, as it's commonly called, which has been a symbol for the city since, ironically, Ford Motor built the complex but decided not to make it its headquarters in the 1970s. GM purchased the building in 1996 as its third headquarters, all of which have been in the Motor City.

The RenCen is Detroit's fortress, a 5.6-million-square-foot complex complete with a more-than-700-foot center tower surrounded by four 500-foot towers and two smaller adjacent ones. 

The complex is infamously difficult to get in and out of and to navigate. For much of its existence, it was surrounded by concrete barriers before a redesign around the turn of the millennium. 

It has long been something of a physical permutation of GM's historically siloed culture, which Barra has made a priority to change during her roughly 11-year tenure as CEO.

""The RenCen was designed in a different era, in a pre-Covid era where everybody went to work five days a week, everybody went to their desk,"" Massaron said. ""Particularly, in a post-pandemic world, you need office space that people want to come to, because we have options.""

GM's roughly 50,000 U.S. salaried employees are currently required to work in-office Tuesday through Thursday, but the rules are more flexible than before regarding location and remote working. 

Most of the company's new executive offices on the top floor of the building will be open for executives to use as they please, Massaron said. Only four of the offices will be permanently assigned to top GM executives, such as Barra and Reuss, he said.

GM declined to disclose how many employees are expected to regularly work at the new headquarters, saying foot traffic will fluctuate based on priorities and workflows. The company also declined to disclose financial details of its 15-year lease at the new headquarters.

The building complex, known as Hudson's Detroit, is owned by a real estate company of Rocket Companies chairman and billionaire Dan Gilbert, who has been purchasing and renovating properties in Detroit for more than a decade.

Aside from the office areas and the executive floor, which all overlook an open atrium, GM also plans to open a semi-public space to display products and host events on the first floor of the building. 

Other amenities include social gathering areas and lounges, food and beverage services and a pickleball court and recreation area. 

GM's new headquarters, which remains under construction, comes months after Ford christened a new 2.1-million-square-foot global HQ and product design and development center in nearby Dearborn, Michigan.

Ford's new facility includes offices, design and industrial operations and a host of amenities such as a 160,000-square-foot dining area with eight ""kitchen concepts,"" multiple courtyards and other upgrades.

The notable difference in the size between GM's and Ford's new headquarters comes down to location, headcount and the automakers' portfolios of offices and operations throughout the region.

GM, for example, has a vast technology and design center that occupies 710 acres in nearby Warren, Michigan. That campus houses more than 24,000 employees. 

Massaron said GM didn't feel it needed to create ""a city within a city"" for its new headquarters, because it's actually ""a building within a city.""

Here's a look inside GM's new world headquarters:

Walmart and Google said Sunday that shoppers will soon be able to use Google's artificial intelligence assistant Gemini to more easily discover and buy products from the retail giant and its warehouse club, Sam's Club.

Incoming Walmart CEO John Furner and Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that the companies have teamed up on stage at the National Retail Federation's Big Show, an annual industry conference held at New York City's Javits Center. 

The CEOs did not say when the new feature will launch or share financial terms. The company said the experience will start first in the U.S. and then expand internationally.

With the Google deal, Walmart is boosting its effort to keep up with customers who are using AI chatbots to save time or look for inspiration. Walmart announced a deal with a rival to Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT, in October to allow shoppers to make purchases with ""Instant Checkout,"" a feature that allows them to buy an item without leaving the AI chatbot. OpenAI recently launched that feature with Walmart and it has Instant Checkout deals with other retailers, including Etsy and several Shopify merchants like Skims, Vuori and Spanx.

Walmart also has its own AI chatbot, a yellow smiley-faced assistant on its app called Sparky.

""The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,"" Furner said in a news release. ""We aren't just watching the shift, we are driving it.""

In his remarks on stage, Furner, who will step into Walmart's top role on Feb. 1, said Walmart is ""rewriting the retail playbook"" and, with AI, it's ""trying to close the gap between I want it and I have it.""

Pichai said that Google is excited to work with Walmart and described the adoption of AI as a ""transformative"" moment.

For Walmart, the evolution of customers' shopping habits — such as searches that start in an AI chatbot rather than its own app or website — is reshaping the retailer's digital strategy. In a statement, David Guggina, Walmart U.S.'s chief ecommerce officer, said agentic AI ""helps us meet customers earlier in their shopping journey and in more places."" 

""Over time, these agents will make it easier for customers to find what they need, want and love,"" he said.

Walmart leaders have also been vocal about how AI will change the workforce and employees' roles, comments that carry additional weight as the company is the largest private employer in the U.S.

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who is retiring and will be succeeded by Furner, has spoken about the sweeping impact of the technology, saying that ""it's very clear that AI is going to change literally every job.""

As retailers increasingly turn to artificial intelligence tools to lure shoppers and run key parts of their business, Google wants to make sure it's in the center of the action. 

At the kickoff of the National Retail Federation's annual show on Sunday, Google announced the launch of what it's calling the Universal Commerce Protocol. The company wants UCP to become an industry standard that retailers use for their AI agents and systems across tasks like discovery, buying and ""post-purchase-support.""

Google says the open-source protocol creates a unified system spanning the shopping experience, from searching to payment, so that retailers don't have to build their own tools and connect the various functions. 

""It's very important to have a standardized way so we can scale these things and everyone can be prepared for all the various steps to happen,"" Vidhya Srinivasan, vice president of Google ads and commerce, said in an interview. ""Businesses can pick and choose what they want so there's flexibility for them.""

E-commerce has emerged as one of the major battlegrounds in the booming generative AI market, with Google facing off against OpenAI, Perplexity and Amazon, as they all try and get consumers to use their various apps and services to begin their shopping journey. 

In September, OpenAI announced Instant Checkout, which allows users to buy some products through ChatGPT, taking a fee from transactions it helps orchestrate. OpenAI's Agentic Commerce Protocol developed in partnership with Stripe, is open source and could compete with UCP.

Perplexity in May said it's partnering with PayPal to let users buy products, book travel and secure concert tickets directly in its chat without leaving the platform, and in November said it will roll out a free agentic shopping product for U.S. users ahead of the holiday season. 

And earlier last year, Amazon launched ""Shop Direct,"" a feature that lets consumers browse items from other brands' sites on Amazon. Some of those items include a button labeled ""Buy for Me,"" an AI agent that can purchase products from other websites on a shopper's behalf.

By 2030, the retail market could represent a $3 trillion to $5 trillion opportunity globally due to AI-powered tools and agentic commerce, according to a report in October from McKinsey. 

Google said UCP was co-developed with companies including Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair and Target. The protocol will soon power a new checkout feature allowing users to buy direct from Google's AI Mode or Gemini App. They can pay via Google Wallet, but Srinivasan said the company plans to include other payment methods like PayPal in the future. 

Srinivasan said UCP will be compatible with other existing protocols. 

As part of Sunday's announcements, Google also introduced a feature called Business Agent, allowing shoppers to chat with brands.

""This is to address the newer consumer behavior which is shifted toward more conversational commerce,"" Srinivasan said. ""We want retailers to be able to connect to users on our surfaces but using their own voice.""

Then there's Google's core market: advertising. 

Google said it's testing ""Direct Offers,"" which will let retailers promote unique discounts, such as 20% off of a product, if a user of the AI Mode chatbot expresses intent to buy something. 

""Our role in the ecosystem is that of a matchmaker and one way is with ads,"" Srinivasan said. ""It's a really big focus for us to innovate in the space that adds value to both retailers and buyers.""

Bob Weir, the guitarist and singer who, as an essential member of the Grateful Dead, helped found the sound of the San Francisco counterculture of the 1960s and kept it alive through decades of endless tours and marathon jams, has died. He was 78.

Weir's death was announced Saturday in a statement on his Instagram page.

""It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,"" a statement on his Instagram account posted Saturday said. ""He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.""

Weir joined the Grateful Dead — originally the Warlocks — in 1965 in San Francisco at just 17 years old. He would spend the next 30 years playing on endless tours with the Grateful Dead alongside fellow singer and guitarist Jerry Garcia, who died in 1995.

Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including ""Sugar Magnolia,"" ""One More Saturday Night"" and ""Mexicali Blues.""

After Garcia's death, he would be the Dead's most recognizable face. In the decades since, he kept playing with other projects that kept alive the band's music and legendary fan base, including Dead & Company.

""For over sixty years, Bobby took to the road,"" the Instagram statement said. ""A guitarist, vocalist, storyteller, and founding member of the Grateful Dead. Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music.""

Weir's death leaves drummer Bill Kreutzmann as the only surviving original member. Founding bassist Phil Lesh died in 2024. The band's other drummer, Mickey Hart, practically an original member since joining in 1967, is also alive at 82. The fifth founding member, Ron ""Pigpen"" McKernan, died in 1973.

Dead and Company played a series of concerts for the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary in July at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, drawing some 60,000 fans a day for three days.

Born in San Francisco and raised in nearby Atherton, Weir was the Dead's youngest member and looked like a fresh-faced high-schooler in its early years. He was generally less shaggy than the rest of the band, but he had a long beard like Garcia's in later years.

The band would survive long past the hippie moment of its birth, with its ultra-devoted fans known as Deadheads often following them on the road in a virtually non-stop tour that persisted despite decades of music and culture shifting around them.

""Longevity was never a major concern of ours,"" Weir said when the Dead got the Grammys' MusiCares Person of the Year honor last year. ""Spreading joy through the music was all we ever really had in mind, and we got plenty of that done.""

Ubiquitous bumper stickers and T-shirts showed the band's skull logo, the dancing, colored bears that served as their other symbol, and signature phrases like ""ain't no time to hate"" and ""not all who wander are lost.""

The Dead won few actual Grammys during their career — they were always a little too esoteric — getting only a lifetime achievement award in 2007 and the best music film award in 2018.

Just as rare were hit pop singles. ""Touch of Grey,"" the 1987 song that brought a big surge in the aging band's popularity, was their only Billboard Top 10 hit.

But in 2024, they set a record for all artists with their 59th album in Billboard's Top 40. Forty-one of those came since 2012, thanks to the popularity of the series of archival albums compiled by David Lemieux.

Their music — called acid rock at its inception — would pull in blues, jazz, country, folk and psychedelia in long improvisational jams at their concerts.

""I venture to say they are the great American band,"" TV personality and devoted Deadhead Andy Cohen said as host of the MusiCares event. ""What a wonder they are.""

Artificial intelligence could be something of a game changer for recruiters as firms continue to be inundated with job applications, according to one LinkedIn executive.

Janine Chamberlin, LinkedIn's U.K. country manager, told CNBC Make It in an interview that AI will be a ""critical part of how hiring is done in 2026,"" as it speeds up processes. 

""Last year was the year of experimentation and companies and professionals taking their first steps. 2026 is the year of more widespread adoption of AI tools, particularly in hiring,"" she said. 

AI can help recruiters speed up manual tasks such as going through very high volumes of applications and sifting through resumes and cover letters to find the right skills for a job. 

""We've heard from 60% of recruiters that AI is helping them to find what they would call a 'hidden gem' talent — so people that they would have, in their manual search, overlooked, but actually AI is surfacing that as a candidate that is a good match for a specific job, because it can look very specifically at those skills so critically important to do it well,"" Chamberlin said. 

The job market has been rough for both employers and professionals as widespread layoffs dominate headlines and professionals face intense competition for jobs. 

Over 1 million job cuts were announced in the U.S. in 2025, the highest level since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, according to data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. 

Meanwhile, the number of applications per role have skyrocketed, making it difficult for employers to respond quickly to applications. In fact, new Linkedin research finds that U.S. applicants per open role have doubled since the spring of 2022.

Chamberlin said this is creating an overwhelming cycle in the job market that is difficult for both job seekers and recruiters to handle. 

""The job search is tougher right now, because what we are seeing is that there's such a high volume of applications for each role that there is available. So, if I'm a job seeker, I'm applying to lots of roles. On the flip side, there's companies recruiters who are receiving lots of applications.

""Companies are finding it hard to filter through these applications quickly enough to find people with the right skill set for the jobs that they're hiring for. And the job seeker on the other side of that is waiting to hear back from companies whilst getting increasingly anxious because they might not be hearing back,"" Chamberlin said. 

The anxious job seeker then goes and applies to more roles to increase their chances of getting a job, continuing the cycle. 

Chamberlin says AI is a ""big part of the solution,"" with 93% of recruiters planning to increase their use of AI in 2026, per the LinkedIn research. 

The start of the new year typically brings an influx of new job openings and motivated job seekers. However, as AI becomes central to hiring, many professionals are rethinking how to navigate the job market. 

LinkedIn's global research, which surveyed 19,000 respondents globally, including from the U.K, U.S., France, Germany and Australia, found that 80% of workers feel unprepared for the job hunt in 2026 and nearly two-thirds feel that the job search has become more challenging. 

Chamberlin advised tailoring applications and to avoid mass-applying with generic cover letters, as AI is now often the first to review a job application. 

It's important to ""be targeted"" when crafting your resume and cover letter. ""Applying for roles that genuinely match your skills will always outperform sending lots of generic applications, for both AI and for humans,"" she said. 

Chamberlin said that using AI can help make your application more succinct as it can identify where you're not highlighting the skills you need for a particular job.

""In an AI-driven job market, clarity is key,"" she said. ""If you can make sure that your skills are highlighted very clearly on your resume, on the cover letter, on your LinkedIn profile, naturally, I think that's what's really going to help you stand out.""

Finally, Chamberlin suggested prioritizing simple formats and to avoid overly stylistic templates as it can be confusing to read for AI.

To join the CNBC Technology Executive Council, go to cnbccouncils.com/tec

A million bubbles were swirling inside each glass of Champagne poured on New Year's Eve — which seems about like the number of times artificial intelligence bubbles have been mentioned by tech investors, economists and media pundits in recent months. 

Bubble fears surrounds stocks within the Magnificent 7 — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — as well as Oracle and Softbank and other tech companies' multi-billion-dollar investments in the unrelenting buildout of humungous data centers to power their AI systems. Data centers are expected to require roughly $7 trillion in capital outlays by 2030, according to a report by McKinsey & Co. The bubble speculations rage almost daily as breaking news and earnings reports send Mag 7 stock prices rising and falling, leading analysts to constantly update their buy, sell or hold recommendations.

That's essentially the 30,000-foot, macroeconomic view of AI from Wall Street's bulls and bears. For a zoomed-in, micro look at the volatility surrounding AI, there may be no better example of adjacent players in the space than Bloom Energy. 

A one-time privately funded startup darling from Silicon Valley's initial push into renewable energy which grabbed some marquee customers early on (e.g. Google and Walmart), Bloom was often in the red since its founding in 2001. Following its 2018 IPO at a price of $15 per share, it has been an unremarkable stock, trading near that IPO price as recently as last April. But Bloom has skyrocketed roughly 400% over the past year, ignited by its emergence as a standalone, onsite power supplier for electricity-guzzling AI data centers. It uses stacks of solid oxide fuel cells to provide an immediate, always-on alternative to connecting to public utilities' strained grids. Bloom is now among the priciest energy stocks, at 125 times forward earnings.

Bloom's performance chart for 2025 resembles one depicting the elevation trajectory from flat, mile-high Denver west to 12,000-foot-high Rocky Mountain National Park. The stock price had come back down to Earth lately — from a 52-week high of $147.86 in November on the strength of strong third-quarter earnings and a major deal with utility giant American Electric Power. But it continues to fluctuate in reaction to good and bad news regarding its AI customers, with the latest boost coming on Thursday. 

Bloom's stock soared on Thursday and Friday with the news that a Wyoming data center project had won a key approval. The 1.8 GW facility is expected to include 900 MW of Bloom's fuel cells, representing about $3 billion in revenue for the company in coming years, according to an analysis from Morgan Stanley's David Arcaro. In a related development, AEP announced a $2.65 billion deal to acquire a substantial portion of Bloom's fuel cells as part of a deal with an unnamed customer, presumably the same Wyoming data center. 

With the two-day spike, Bloom's stock rose roughly 30% last week, closing over $134 on Friday with a valuation near $32 billion. 

Bloom's profitability remains much more modest than its revenue or stock growth. On October 28, the company reported third-quarter revenue of $519 million, up 57% year over year. It posted a net profit of $7.8 million, compared to a $9.7 million loss a year earlier.

On Wall Street, the bulls have the upper hand over the bears in the narrative, and that has paid off handsomely for investors, but there are skeptics. Across the 26 analysts covering Bloom, five hold sell or strong sell ratings. The average price target of $115 per share — although below its current share price after last week's rapid runup — remains well above bearish bets, such as Jefferies' price target of $53.

San Jose-based Bloom has installed its proprietary fuel cells — which primarily run on liquid natural gas, but also biogas and hydrogen, resulting in lower emissions — at more than 1,200 facilities covering a swath of industries, including manufacturing, retail, health care, biotech and telecom, since 2008. In addition to Walmart and Google, initial customers included Google, Coca-Cola, Cox Enterprises, FedEx, and Staples. 

In July 2024, CoreWeave, a cloud-computing company that has risen over 90% since its 2025 IPO and is often mentioned among AI stock bubble fears, became Bloom's first AI data center partner, joined since by Oracle, Equinix and AEP.

At the dizzying rate that data centers are being built in the U.S., there's no end in sight for electricity needed to power them. 

""Bloom Energy has 1.5 gigawatts of fuel cells deployed globally,"" said Aman Joshi, the company's chief commercial officer, with more than 400 megawatts devoted to data centers. ""Equinix, our flagship customer, has more than 100 megawatts deployed across 20 sites."" 

Bloom is currently producing 1 GW of fuel cell capacity at its lone manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, Joshi said, and ""we've publicly announced we are doing 2 gigawatts [by December 2026].""

There are nearly 3,800 data centers are in the U.S, according to Data Center Map, an industry resource for data center research. Through 2028, another 280 or so are expected to come online. The Bank of America Institute has reported that U.S. electricity demand is expected to grow 2.5% annually over the next decade, five times faster than the growth rate over the past decade.

The sustainability of Bloom's stock price will rely on continued revenue growth and improved profitability, but at a macro level, access to capital to scale up production of fuel cells, and ability to compete with other power providers — all of which are predicated on the continued surge in data center construction. 

Bloom is expected to report its fourth quarter and full-year earnings for 2025 on Feb. 26.

Some analysts contend that the real bottleneck in the data center buildout is power, or as OpenAI CFO Sara Friar put it to CNBC last September, ""The real bottleneck isn't money. It's power."". 

""The bubble AI companies are facing is going to be who has planned logistically to connect their facility to power infrastructure, and maybe even further downstream to fuel infrastructure for that power,"" said Zachary Krause, an energy analyst at East Daley Analytics who covers the data center industry. ""And that's why I don't think Bloom is on the bubble. Their business model is very strong right now.""

In addition to the lucrative deals Bloom signed with hyperscalers last year, in October it entered into a $5-billion strategic partnership with Brookfield Asset Management, the world's largest AI infrastructure investor, to deploy Bloom's fuel cell technology, with Bloom CEO KR Sridhar describing the company as ""the preferred onsite provider for Brookfield's trillion-dollar infrastructure portfolio"" during its October earnings call. ""Brookfield has invested $50 billion in AI opportunities and is tripling the size of its AI strategy over the next three years,"" he said on the call.

The deal creates multiple benefits for Bloom, according to Oppenheimer analysts, including higher sales. The concentration of Bloom fuel cells will provide service efficiencies, the analysts wrote in a research note, while Brookfield can help provide financing for customers looking to lease fuel cells. ""We expect all of these dynamics to support above-consensus sales growth and margin expansion,"" they said.

Evercore analysts said that the joint venture confirms Bloom's ability to be an essential player in the energy buildout to support AI. It underscores a key point for the industry, which is ""speed to power is paramount,"" they wrote.

While the most recent quarterly results came in above expectations, Wall Street bears have pointed to aggressive assumptions about the way these deals will play out in the years ahead. The rapid rise in shares in the latter part of this past week was similar in magnitude to what occurred after the Brookfield deal was announced. At that time, Bank of America analyst team, who have held a sell rating on Bloom Energy, said they see risk in a Street that is ""assuming 5-yr perfection"" and viewing these deals as a near-term earnings catalyst rather than as gradual deployments. 

""A strategic win, yes — but the market is paying today for a decade of delivery,"" Bank of America analysts wrote in an October research note. ""Investors continue to treat Bloom's major customer announcements as additive backlog rather than potential pipelines. ... we view that as aggressive,"" they wrote. Bank of America did raise its price target from $26 to $39 after the most recent earnings though it still rates the stock at a sell.

In late December, Bloom received another capital infusion, securing a $600-million multi-currency credit facility with Wells Fargo. It will permit cash withdrawn from the facility to finance capex, including international projects, such as in South Korea, where Bloom has a distribution agreement in place with SK Ecoplant.

With those capital resources, plus around $595 million in cash reserves as of September 30, Joshi foresees no financial constraints in scaling up to 2 GW this year. ""Our fuel cells are printed,"" he said, adding that ""our raw material sources are extremely diversified. It's just a matter of us [adding] one more printing line, which will take about $100-$150 million of investment.""

In fact, Bloom has been able to lower costs by about 10% every year, said UBS analyst Manav Gupta, ""and they are very confident they can increase from these levels because, until now, the economies of scale have not kicked in."" The Fremont production facility can be expanded up to 5 GW of production capacity, he said, although ""KR is the kind of person who will not add capacity until he sees the orders,"" Gupta said.

He anticipates that Oracle and AEP will upsize their fuel cell orders in the next few months, and that Google, Microsoft or Meta will soon sign on as new data center customers. (As Bloom's very first customer, Google only used it to power a portion of its headquarters in Mountain View, California.) ""Those are the near-term catalysts that I'm looking for,"" Gupta said.

Analysts in general expect Bloom to report an even stronger fourth quarter, ending 2025 with $1.9 billion in sales and forecasting $2.46 billion this year, but volatility is likely to remain part of the stock story. Indeed, Bloom shares have experienced 76 moves greater than 5% over the last year. Thursday and Friday's upturn exemplified the stock's rollercoaster ride, starkly contrasted against last year's low of $15.15 on April 9. Bloom's shares fell 17.3% in November, even as fundamentals remained strong. On December 4, shares spiked more than 13% intraday. Four days later, the stock fell 6.2%, while still being up 24% over the prior two weeks.

In terms of competition, Bloom is considered the go-to for standalone power for data centers. Plug Power's hydrogen fuel cells are considerably more expensive to operate vs. LNG, so they are installed mostly as a backup source. Gupta dismissed FuelCell Energy as a rival, saying it ""is probably 10 or maybe 15 years behind on technology from where Bloom was 10 years ago.""

Both of those stocks have seen significant losses in share price over the past year.

Another 2025 stock boomer, GE Vernova, has LNG turbines that are utilized as backup power sources at data centers, and an 80 GW backlog of orders, which will take the company into 2029 to fulfill, CEO Scott Strazik recently told investors. In the meantime, however, GE Vernova is developing fuel cell technology, different from Bloom's, that it expects to offer data centers in two to three years.

Longer-term, industry watchers expect that nuclear reactors — large, traditional facilities and small modular reactors — as well as wind and solar sources, backed up by more efficient storage batteries, will be viable options for powering data centers. There's even talk of building solar-powered data centers in outer space.

Those options are years away from being fully developed, though, making Bloom a right-now power solution for data center operators. ""They have a good first-mover advantage in gaining entrenchment, where they're going to see a huge spike in use,"" Krause said.

For investors, especially after the run the stock has already been on, Bloom is a market bet that requires deep conviction. ""This is not a stock for the faint of heart,"" said Andrew Rocco, an analyst at Zacks Investment Research. It's going to be volatile, he said, but added, ""I expect these guys to grow high double digits or even triple digits over the next two to three years.""

¡Vaya! Parece que algo no ha ido bien

Last week Wells Fargo begun to amass Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) in substantial amounts. This development has elicited reactions from the cryptocurrency community, including a response from Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance.

Wells Fargo's decision to purchase large quantities of Bitcoin comes at a time of increasing uncertainty in the wider cryptocurrency market.

In response to this move, Changpeng Zhao, Binance's founder, has called on traders to remain resilient.

While you were panic selling, U.S. Banks were loading up on bitcoin. 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/8Xufs40ZJ8

Zhao pointed out that while many are panic selling, US banks like Wells Fargo are stocking up on Bitcoin. Such significant Bitcoin acquisitions by traditional banks are seldom accidental, suggesting a long-term strategy and anticipation of future Bitcoin growth.

Despite the current volatility in Bitcoin's price, Wells Fargo's large-scale purchase indicates a surge in investor confidence, even amidst the growing fear and uncertainty pervading the market.

While traders are increasingly divesting their Bitcoin holdings due to market uncertainty, on-chain data shows that 655,498 BTC is currently held on Binance as traders return more tokens to the exchange.

Why It Matters: Wells Fargo's move to accumulate Bitcoin in large quantities is a significant development in the cryptocurrency market. This indicates a shift in attitude by traditional financial institutions towards digital currencies, suggesting they see potential for future growth in Bitcoin.

Furthermore, the call for resilience by Binance's founder underscores the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective in the face of market volatility.

A miner who was active in the early days of crypto has moved over $181 million worth of Bitcoin.

The miner was active in the “Satoshi era,” Julio Moreno of the blockchain analysis provider CryptoQuant wrote on X. Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonymous founder of Bitcoin. Nakamoto authored the Bitcoin white paper in 2008 and launched the Bitcoin network the following year – before disappearing without a trace in 2010.

“[This is] the first time this has happened since November 2024, when Bitcoin was at around $91,000,” Moreno said. “Historically, Satoshi-era miners move their Bitcoin at key inflection points.”

The move comes a month after two so-called Bitcoin whales who had not touched their wallets since 2011 and 2012 moved their entire balances to unknown wallets.

The crypto transaction monitoring platform Whale Alert noted on December 5 that one of the wallets had sat dormant for over 13 years. The other had been inactive for 14 years.

The latest transaction has generated much speculation online, with some X users commenting that Bitcoin whales tend to sell their coins when they think markets are rallying.

Sani, the founder of the Bitcoin transaction analysis site TimechainIndex, took to X to post blockchain data showing that a miner with funds in 40 Pay-to-Public-Key wallets had sent $181 million worth of Bitcoin to Coinbase crypto exchange wallets.

Pay-to-Public-Key wallets were popular in the early days of Bitcoin, but have since become largely obsolete, with modern users favoring more private alternatives.

“A miner just sold 2,000 Bitcoin from block rewards dormant since 2010,” Sani wrote.

Bitcoin prices have held steady just above $90,000 for most of the weekend, despite bullish predictions from the investment firm heavyweight VanEck.

VanEck last week said Bitcoin prices could reach the $2.9 million mark by 2050.

The company said big business and government adoption would likely spur Bitcoin growth in the years ahead.

It also outlined a “bull case scenario” that could see Bitcoin prices rise to a whopping $53.4 million.

“In a hyper-Bitcoinisation scenario where Bitcoin captures 20% of international trade and 10% of domestic GDP, the implied value per coin could reach $53.4 million,” wrote researchers Matthew Sigel and Patrick Bush.

Sigel and Bush explained that this scenario “requires Bitcoin to achieve parity with or surpass gold as a primary global reserve asset, constituting nearly 30% of world financial assets.”

In November, Galaxy Digital said Bitcoin was maturing and warned that the days of traders making “1,000x, 100x, or even possibly 10x gains” were over.

Jan3 founder Samson Mow said Tesla CEO Elon Musk will aggressively move into bitcoin in 2026.

Mow wrote in an X post on Saturday:

“@elonmusk goes hard into BTC.”

Musk has voiced support for bitcoin at times, while also raising environmental concerns.

Tesla stopped accepting bitcoin payments in May 2021, citing environmental issues.

In July 2022, Tesla disclosed it had sold 75% of its bitcoin holdings.

Mow also predicted bitcoin will reach $1.33 million in 2026.

That would be about a 1,367% increase from around $90,596.

In a June 2025 interview, Mow said $1 million was possible in 2025, or otherwise 2026.

He said:

“[It] is a given at this point, maybe this year, maybe next year.”

Mow has previously argued that nation-state adoption could be a key catalyst.

Other executives have offered more conservative expectations.

On Dec. 28, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said he expects a long-term upward trend with strong returns but not extraordinary gains.

Mow's other 2026 predictions included Strategy (MSTR) reaching $5,000, bitcoin outperforming metals after December record highs for gold and silver, and at least one country launching a Bitcoin bond.

Ethereum's price action has spent an unusually long time moving sideways, and this behavior has tested the patience of many long-term bullish investors. When speaking of sideways movement, this movement has dragged on for many months, although Ethereum did manage to make a new all-time high in 2025.

Interestingly, a technical analysis shared on X by Egrag Crypto shows how Ethereum's current price action fits into previous playouts when viewed through an inverted monthly chart. This offers a perspective on what appears to be stagnation about to break into new price highs.

A Repeating Cycle With Changing Behavior

The analysis is based on an inverted monthly Ethereum chart, which offers an interesting perspective that flips conventional interpretations of price movement. Ethereum's inverted monthly chart shows a consistent pattern that's changing with time in market structure across multiple cycles. 

A look at the inverted chart shows that previous price cycles were characterized by short accumulation phases followed by aggressive moves. As the market matured, those accumulation zones stretched out, and the resulting moves became less violent and more controlled.

The first instance was in 2016, when Ethereum traded in a range for about 10 months before breaking out and going on a violent drop. A similar structure appeared between mid-2018 and mid-2020, when a longer consolidation phase preceded another drop that played out gradually at a softer pace. 

The current cycle, however, is playing out with a much longer accumulation. Therefore, the eventual drop should be shorter, according to Egrag Crypto.

A Drop Here Actually Means A Breakout

The most important detail in this technical framework is that the chart is inverted. What looks like a downside move on this view actually points to upside expansion on the real Ethereum price chart. 

According to the previous outcomes, once Ethereum exits this range, the next move is likely to unfold quickly. It may not match the explosive nature of early-cycle rallies, but it is expected to be more orderly, sustained, and carry Ethereum to new price highs. 

When the structure is converted back into real price terms, Egrag Crypto identifies the $3,800 to $4,500 area as the first critical zone. This region represents initial resistance that must be cleared to confirm a bullish continuation. Only after a decisive move above this range would the $6,000 to $7,500 zone come into focus as a realistic upside target.

The analysis also highlights a defined risk scenario. A pullback to the $1,800 to $2,200 region would postpone the breakout and act as a final shakeout before a final lift-off. However, as long as Ethereum holds its broader consolidation structure, such a retest would not invalidate the thesis. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,100.

Ethereum's very soul is up for debate.

Ethereum [ETH] is changing, but not everyone seems to like where it's going next.

While big money flows into staking, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is talking about privacy, local tools, and an internet that isn't owned by platforms or algorithms.

So how does one handle it when the network's biggest ideals start to clash with how it's actually being used?

In a recent post on X, Buterin urged developers to move toward a “sovereign web,” one that protects users from corporate data extraction, psychological manipulation, and closed platforms.

He took aim at what he called “corposlop”. In fact, he described today's internet as a space dominated by sleek branding, dopamine-driven algorithms, and mass data collection that destroys user agency.

“Today, “sovereignty” also means… securing your own mind from corporate mind warfare trying to extract your attention and your dollars.”

He went on to add that sovereignty also means doing things because “you believe in them, and declaring independence from the homogenizing and soul-sucking concept of “the meta.”

This means building privacy-first, local tools that work for users.

Source: X

Meanwhile, a wallet linked to Buterin deposited 330 ETH, worth roughly $1.02 million, into Paxos. This move is on-brand for the tech founder, with his history of moving Ethereum [ETH] for operational, philanthropic, or ecosystem-related reasons.

… the money seems to have already made its choice.

Source: X

Institutions are piling into ETH staking, even with yields at near multi-year lows. BitMine alone has funneled over a million ETH into staking in just a month, so the entry queue is at levels not seen since 2023.

Source: X

At the same time, regulated products like Grayscale's and 21Shares' staking ETFs have begun paying out rewards. The current state of affairs is peculiar, yet notable: While the network has an identity crisis, big money has full faith.

But do the early believers truly want them there?

Top forms like SharpLink Gaming generate millions by simply holding assets. On the other hand, smaller investors need more aggressive coins to build their initial wealth. This dynamic has intensified the hunt for the best altcoins to buy. 

DeepSnitch AI is becoming the ultimate gem for massive profits. With its presale surging past $1,138,000 and its AuditSnitch security layer now live, DeepSnitch AI offers what corporate stakers dream of. Early backers are already up nearly 120%, and there's still time to buy.

SharpLink Gaming is the world's second-largest corporate Ether holder. According to the company's dashboard, SharpLink generated 10,657 Ether, valued at approximately $33 million, in passive yield from its staking operations over the past seven months. This staking activity added about $1.4 million in value for shareholders in just the past week alone.

SharpLink's strategy is simple: “100% ETH and 100% staked.” By committing their tokens to secure the network, they earn rewards that compound over time. The company is even expanding this yield-focused strategy by deploying another $170 million worth of Ether into the Ethereum layer-2 solution Linea for additional restaking rewards.

Finding the best altcoins to buy can be hard. Here are some of the top choices to consider. 

When evaluating the best altcoins to buy, DeepSnitch AI stands alone as the highest-conviction gem of early 2026. The project has raised over $1,138,000, not because of hype, but because it solves the problems investors face in the market. 

The newly activated AuditSnitch feature allows traders to instantly audit smart contracts and detect scams and honeypots in real time. This live utility has made DeepSnitch the “Bloomberg Terminal” for the retail sector, creating a moat that few promising altcoins can cross.

The numbers tell the story. The presale price has increased to $0.03334, delivering nearly 120% gains to early investors. But the real wealth generation is happening in the staking pool. More than 28 million tokens have been staked by the community. 

Buying now at Stage 4 allows you to secure your position before the public listing, ensuring you are on the right side of the trade when the masses arrive.



GMT is one of the best altcoins to buy for momentum traders, after a massive 679% increase in trading volume over the last 24 hours as of January 9th. Moreover, the token has increased by more than 28% in the last week, outperforming the market. 



However, despite the volume explosion, the sentiment remains cautious. The Fear & Greed Index sits at 27, and the volatility is high. Also, the price prediction forecasts a 123% rise by January 2027, targeting $0.04380.

Avici is making a case for itself as one of the most promising altcoins in the Solana network. The token has seen a 195% surge in trading volume and a 53% price increase in the last seven days. Unlike many other assets, the sentiment for Avici is explicitly bullish, supported by green days more than 50% of the time over the last month.

The price prediction for Avici is optimistic, forecasting a 114% rise to reach $6.93 by January 2027. However, volatility is rated very high, meaning that while the uptrend is strong, pullbacks can be severe.

Corporate giants are chasing safe yields, but retail investors have a unique opportunity to chase life-changing growth. DeepSnitch AI offers both security and explosive upside. It is one of the best altcoins to buy now. Everything is set for a massive launch that will make a lot of people millionaires. 

Visit the official DeepSnitch AI website, join Telegram, and follow on X for the latest updates.



DeepSnitch AI tops the list of best altcoins to buy due to its live utility and massive presale success, raising over $1.13 million.

Companies like SharpLink Gaming staking millions of ETH validate the market but reduce liquidity. This leads retail investors toward high-upside crypto projects like DeepSnitch AI for better returns.

Avici is bullish with a 53% weekly gain on Solana. However, its high volatility makes DeepSnitch AI a safer bet.

Attention is returning to the market, and traders hunting the best altcoins for Q1 are starting to reposition early. Ethereum continues to anchor the ecosystem, Chainlink remains a core infrastructure layer, and both are once again part of serious accumulation strategies. Historically, the best altcoins emerge before momentum becomes obvious, when conviction forms quietly rather than during headline rallies.

That early-stage focus is why DOGEBALL is increasingly mentioned alongside Ethereum and Chainlink when discussing the best altcoins to hold in Q1. While established assets reflect stability, DOGEBALL offers early exposure at a presale level, combining timing, narrative strength, and a ground-floor entry that appeals to investors searching for the next breakout crypto presale.

Gaming adoption is shaping how capital approaches DOGEBALL during its ICO phase. The presale has just launched at a Stage 1 price of $0.0003, with a clearly defined ICO end date of 2nd May 2026. Unlike many speculative launches, DOGEBALL enters the market with a playable ecosystem already live, positioning it differently from typical meme launches seen among the best altcoins. This early traction reflects how gaming-linked tokens often attract users before traders, building demand organically.

That momentum is supported by execution. DOGEBALL runs on a custom Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain that users can already test on the presale website, complete with live on-chain activity. At the center of adoption sits the DOGEBALL game, playable across mobile, tablet, and PC, where players compete for a $1 million prize pool. Falcon Interactive, a global gaming company behind hundreds of Apple and Google Play titles, is confirmed as an official partner and will promote the DOGEBALL blockchain publicly, reinforcing adoption beyond crypto-native circles.

The implication is demand forming before exchange listings. With a total supply of 80 billion tokens and only 20 billion allocated to the ICO, adoption-driven usage creates pressure ahead of the $0.015 launch price. As capital rotates from Ethereum and Chainlink into higher-upside opportunities, DOGEBALL's gaming adoption narrative positions it among the best altcoins for Q1 risk-takers.



DOGEBALL's return profile is best viewed through presale scarcity. At $0.0003, a $1,000 investment secures roughly 3.33 million tokens. At launch price alone, that position scales to approximately $50,000. If DOGEBALL reaches the widely discussed $1 post-launch target, the same allocation exceeds $3.3 million, demonstrating why DOGEBALL is ranked among the best altcoins in early-cycle discussions.

Smaller entries highlight the imbalance further. A $250 investment secures around 833,333 tokens. For that position to approach $100,000, DOGEBALL would only need to trade near $0.12—well below the $1 projection and modest compared with past moves seen across the Ethereum ecosystem. Compared with Chainlink or Ethereum, where upside is incremental, DOGEBALL's crypto presale scarcity creates a rare upside window.

Ethereum remains one of the best altcoins for long-term exposure, supported by Layer-2 expansion and developer activity. Recent performance reflects consolidation rather than acceleration, positioning Ethereum as a stability anchor rather than a speculative play.

For Q1, Ethereum is expected to track broader sentiment. While still one of the best altcoins, its growth profile contrasts with early-stage opportunities like DOGEBALL.

Chainlink continues to secure its role across DeFi and enterprise data feeds, keeping it firmly placed among the best altcoins. Price action has remained controlled, reflecting maturity rather than hype.

As with Ethereum, Chainlink offers reliability, not explosive upside. Its presence rounds out portfolios focused on the best altcoins rather than dominating them.



Q1 often rewards decisiveness. As Ethereum and Chainlink absorb steady capital, DOGEBALL stands out as the best crypto presale available right now. With the ICO live, a $0.0003 entry price, and a fixed supply window, DOGEBALL represents a clear decision point rather than a waiting game.

For investors evaluating the best altcoins to hold in Q1, DOGEBALL currently presents the strongest upside opportunity. The best crypto presale rarely stays unnoticed for long, and checking the DOGEBALL website before the next price increase could define positioning ahead of the next market surge.

The buzz around crypto has gone quiet. Bitcoin sits still, altcoins barely move, and trading volumes have dropped to levels not seen in years. Welcome to what many call the . This is not just a dip—it's a deep freeze gripping the market.

Exchanges that once saw billions in daily trades now report numbers closer to multi-year lows. Investors watch charts with little action. What does this mean for your portfolio? Let's break it down step by step.

In crypto terms, an  happens when trading activity freezes up. Prices don't crash hard, but volumes collapse. No one buys or sells much. Liquidity dries up, making markets slow and risky.

This term comes from Bitcoin's past. After big bull runs, like in 2017, volumes tanked for months. Traders called it an ice age because everything felt frozen. Today, we see the same signs:

It's like the party ended, and everyone went home. But why now?

Let's look at the data. On major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, total crypto trading volume fell below $50 billion per day recently. That's a huge drop from the $200 billion highs in early 2024.

Bitcoin dominance is up, but even BTC volumes are down 60%. Ethereum and Solana? Even worse. Stablecoins like USDT still move, but that's mostly for parking funds, not real trading.

These numbers scream . On-chain data from Glassnode shows active addresses at 2022 lows. Whales are holding, retail is gone.

Several factors piled up to create this freeze:

This perfect storm turned  into a full .

Low volumes mean big problems:

But not all bad. It shakes out weak hands and scams. Strong projects survive.

Markets cycle. Watch these for warming:

Volume spikes on news could signal recovery. For now, patience is key.

Don't freeze up. Here's how to stay warm:

History shows ice ages end with massive thaws. 2018 lows led to 2021 highs.

The  tests true believers. Trading volumes crash, but fundamentals like decentralization endure. Stay informed, hold steady, and position for the melt-up.

What do you think? Is this the deepest freeze yet? Share in comments.

Q: How long will the ice age last?A: Past ones lasted 6-18 months. Depends on macro shifts.

Q: Is it safe to buy now?A: Risky, but DCA works in lows.

Q: Which coins will survive?A: BTC, ETH, and real utility tokens.

Keywords: , trading volumes crash, Bitcoin freeze, crypto market analysis.

Stock Analysis

Reviewed by Simply Wall St

Figure Technology Solutions (FIGR) is back in the spotlight after its shares reached fresh highs, helped by expectations of further Federal Reserve rate cuts and heightened attention on its new blockchain lending initiatives.

See our latest analysis for Figure Technology Solutions.

The recent buzz around Figure's RWA Consortium, Solana based stablecoin launch and rate cut expectations has coincided with strong momentum, with a 7 day share price return of 32.78% and a 30 day share price return of 46.11%, while the 90 day share price return of 37.47% suggests interest has been building rather than fading.

If this kind of fintech momentum has your attention, it could be a good time to see which other names are moving in high growth tech and AI stocks.

With FIGR now above its average analyst target and trading near recent highs, the key question is whether the current price already reflects its blockchain lending story and expectations for potential rate cuts, or if the market is still underpricing future prospects.

Figure Technology Solutions is trading on a P/S ratio of 32.5x, which sits against a last close of US$58.08 and points to a rich valuation compared with peers.

P/S compares a company's market value with its revenue, so a higher multiple usually means investors are paying more for each dollar of sales. For a fintech name like FIGR that is focused on blockchain based lending, trading and investing platforms, a premium P/S can often reflect expectations for strong top line expansion rather than current earnings power.

Here, the Statements Data flags that FIGR is expensive based on its 32.5x P/S against both the US Consumer Finance industry average of 1.6x and a peer average of 2.3x. That kind of gap suggests the market is pricing in a very optimistic revenue path and profitability profile rather than treating FIGR like a typical consumer finance stock.

The comparison is stark: FIGR's P/S multiple is more than 20x the industry average and well above the peer group level. This clearly places the stock at the high end of the sector's valuation range.

See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.

Result: Price-to-Sales of 32.5x (OVERVALUED)

However, there are clear risks here, including execution around the blockchain lending rollout and the chance that rate cut expectations or analyst targets prove too optimistic.

Find out about the key risks to this Figure Technology Solutions narrative.

While the P/S ratio paints FIGR as expensive, our DCF model also points to a rich setup. FIGR trades at US$58.08 compared with an estimated fair value of US$14.97, which suggests the current price already bakes in a lot of optimism.

That kind of gap can cut both ways. The real question for you is whether the story justifies paying this much above our DCF number, or if expectations have simply run too far ahead.

Look into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.

Shiba Inu introduces the SOU recovery system for Shibarium hack victims, combining Ethereum NFT claims with BSC community fundraising.

Shiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya has outlined a comprehensive recovery plan for users affected by the September Shibarium hack. The initiative introduces ""Shib Owes You"" (SOU), a dual-layer system designed to reimburse victims through blockchain-verified claims and community-driven fundraising mechanisms.

The announcement came through Dhairya's year-end letter, which detailed how the cryptocurrency project plans to address losses from the Plasma Bridge exploit. The recovery framework combines official NFT-based accounting with community-powered liquidity generation across multiple blockchain networks.

The SOU system operates through NFTs minted on the Ethereum blockchain. Each affected user receives an SOU NFT that serves as cryptographic proof of their claim against the Shiba Inu ecosystem. These tokens function as permanent, verifiable records rather than traditional database entries.

The NFTs track principal amounts owed to individual users. The recorded debt decreases as payouts occur or community donations arrive. Users can verify their original claim amount, track received payments, and monitor outstanding balances through the blockchain. The system allows NFT holders to merge, split, or transfer their claims as needed.

Shiba Inu team member Lucie provided additional clarity on the system's structure. The official layer consists of SOU NFTs on Ethereum, representing the team's formal accounting mechanism. These tokens document losses from the Plasma Bridge exploit with complete transparency and auditability.

The NFTs maintain dynamic records that specify exact amounts owed to each holder. Lucie emphasized that these Ethereum-based tokens function purely as accounting instruments. They do not generate funds but instead track the ecosystem's debt obligations to affected users.

The second component operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). This community-powered layer focuses on generating liquidity and transaction fees to support the recovery effort. Woofswap currently stands as the first project committed to this initiative.

The BSC implementation differs fundamentally from the Ethereum NFTs. Lucie clarified that BSC tokens do not replace official claim records or serve as IOUs. The tokens instead create a funding mechanism that directs trading activity toward donations and ecosystem rebuilding.

This layer generates volume through user activity, with resulting fees contributing to recovery funds. The community support structure operates independently from official Shiba Inu products. Its purpose centers on creating financial momentum rather than tracking individual claims.

The distinction between both layers remains crucial to understanding the recovery framework. Ethereum NFTs represent verified debt records—the ""truth layer"" of what the ecosystem owes. BSC tokens function as the ""liquidity engine,"" generating resources to fulfill those obligations.

In a year-end letter, Shiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya spoke about a recovery plan for Shibarium users following the hack incident in September.

Dhairya mentioned ""SOU,"" which means ""Shib Owes You,"" a system that intends to make affected Shibarium users whole.

In this system, every affected user has an SOU NFT, which is an on-chain, verifiable record of exactly what the Shiba Inu ecosystem owes them. The SOU is not a promise in a database somewhere but a cryptographic proof that Shibarium users own a claim, recorded permanently on the Ethereum blockchain.

The SOU tracks a principal amount, which is the value still owed to Shibarium users. When payouts happen, the principal goes down, as well as when donations come in from the community. Users will also be able to verify their original claim, what has been received and what is left. The SOUs can also be merged, split or transferred.

Shiba Inu team member sheds light on SOUs

In a tweet, Shiba Inu team member Lucie shares a personal explanation about SOUs. According to Lucie, the ""Shib Owes You"" has two layers, an official one and another, which is community-powered.

The official layer marks the SOU NFTs on Ethereum, which is the Shiba Inu team system. These NFTs represent what people lost in the Plasma Bridge exploit. In addition, they are on-chain, auditable and dynamic, defining exactly who is owed what. The SOU NFTs on Ethereum, according to Lucie, represent the accounting layers but do not raise money as they track the debt.

The second one, which is the community recovery layer, so far has one project (Woofswap) committed to it. This represents SOU on the BSC chains. Lucie clarifies that this is not a replacement for the NFTs but rather a liquidity and fee generation mechanism. Its role, according to Lucie, is to create volume and generate fees as part of activity geared toward recovery and ecosystem support.

Lucie explains further that the SOU on BSC represents the Shiba Inu community support for recovery. It is not an IOU, nor a claim nor an official SHIB product. Rather, it is a funding rail that can direct trading activity toward donations and rebuilding.

While SOU NFTs on Ethereum are the truth layer, on the BSC chain, it is the liquidity engine; one represents what is owed, while the other helps generate funds.

Mow Forecasts Musk Will Go ‘Hard' into Bitcoin","https://zycrypto.com/could-the-worlds-richest-man-trigger-a-bitcoin-boom-mow-forecasts-musk-will-go-hard-into-bitcoin/","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:56:19 GMT","

Samson Mow, the CEO of pro-crypto firm Jan3, has shared his ambitious targets for 2026. Mow's recent predictions have been among the most bullish since the start of the calendar year and should be taken with a pinch of salt.

Samson's Predictions for 2026 🥂➡️ $1.33M #Bitcoin➡️ ♎️🕯️➡️ At least 1 country launches #BitcoinBonds➡️ @elonmusk goes hard into BTC➡️ $MSTR to $5,000➡️ Bitcoin outperforms metals

While other predictions are typical hot takes from Mow, one that stands out is that Musk will go “hard” into Bitcoin. It means that the Tesla and SpaceX CEO will invest massively in the premier digital currency.

According to recent estimates by Forbes and Bloomberg, Musk is worth anywhere between $600 billion and $700 billion, and if he goes hard into the digital currency economy, it will be a massive boom for the market. Not to mention, Musk's companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, and X (formerly Twitter), are worth in excess of $2.5 trillion and advancing aggressively.

While the decision to go on the offensive and buy Bitcoin rests solely on Musk's eccentric shoulders, he has done it before. Back in 2021, Musk dropped a bombshell by announcing a major $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchase through Tesla, representing roughly 10% of the company's cash on hand.

The move was one of multiple reasons that led to a major crypto boom in the year, but the Tesla CEO's eccentric ways arguably caused a significant price drop later on when he announced he would sell a significant portion of the company's stash.

Because of Musk's history of impulsive, rash decisions when buying or selling Bitcoin, the crypto community might be apprehensive about his involvement. He usually tries to dominate the news headlines after investing in a company or asset, as seen in his 2021 BTC purchase and his 2022 hostile takeover of Twitter.

However, it is no secret that Musk prefers Bitcoin over fiat. Elon Musk described Bitcoin as a “less dumb form of liquidity than cash”. He made this statement in February 2021 to defend Tesla's $1.5 billion investment in cryptocurrency.

Musk has given little indication of such an aggressive pivot, and it remains to be seen whether he will go through with it.

Oops, something went wrong

Two crypto exchanges registered in the United Kingdom processed approximately $1 billion in transactions linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps while publicly operating as conventional trading platforms, blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs revealed in a January 9 report.

Zedcex and Zedxion facilitated operational financing for the IRGC, with illicit flows accounting for roughly 56% of their total transaction volume and peaking at 87% in 2024.

The exchanges incorporated in the UK between 2021 and 2022 used nominal directors, virtual office addresses, and repeatedly filed dormant accounts despite processing billions in on-chain activity.

Corporate records directly connect Zedcex to Babak Morteza Zanjani, an Iranian sanctions-evasion financier previously sanctioned by the US and EU in 2013 for laundering billions in oil revenue on behalf of regime entities, including the IRGC, before those penalties were lifted under the now-defunct Iran nuclear deal.

IRGC-linked addresses at Zedcex processed $23.7 million in 2023, representing 60% of total activity, before surging to $619.1 million in 2024 when the IRGC share jumped to 87%.

Activity declined to $410.4 million in 2025 as non-IRGC flows increased, reducing the corps' share to 48%.

The two exchanges operated as a single enterprise despite separate UK incorporation, with both entities sharing directors, addresses, and coordinated timing that indicated continuity rather than independence.

Zanjani's withdrawal from Zedxion in 2022, followed immediately by Zedcex's incorporation under the same control structure and address, suggested operational continuity rather than separation.

After being arrested in Iran and sentenced to death for embezzling millions from Iran's National Oil Company, his sentence was commuted in 2024 after repaying funds, and he re-emerged publicly with proximity to regime-linked economic projects through DotOne Holding Group, a conglomerate spanning cryptocurrency, foreign exchange, logistics, and telecommunications.

Source: TRMLabs

TRM analysis linked Zedcex wallets directly to addresses designated by Israeli authorities as IRGC property under the Administrative Seizure Order ASO-43/25, issued in September 2025, many of which Tether subsequently blocklisted.

Transfers conducted almost entirely in USDT on the TRON blockchain routed funds between designated IRGC addresses, offshore intermediaries, and domestic Iranian exchanges, including Nobitex, Wallex, and Aban Tether.

Source: TRMLabs

The exchanges also integrated with Zedpay, a Turkey-based mobile payment processor that maintains relationships with Turkish financial entities, including Vepara, whose license was later suspended amid money laundering concerns, and Vakif Katilim, a state-owned Islamic bank previously scrutinized for facilitating Iran-linked financial activity.

This integration extended capabilities beyond trading to support fiat settlement and real-world payments for actors under sanctions constraints.

On-chain tracing revealed that over $10 million in USDT transferred directly from wallets dually attributable to Zedcex and the IRGC to addresses controlled by Sa'id Ahmad Muhammad al-Jamal, who is sanctioned by the US Treasury for providing material support to the IRGC and operating smuggling networks that generate revenue for Yemen's Houthis.

The absence of intermediary routing established Zedcex infrastructure as an active funding rail rather than an incidental touchpoint.

The case emerges as sanctioned nation-states increasingly dominate crypto crime statistics, with Chainalysis reporting illicit addresses received at least $154 billion in 2025, marking a 162% jump from $59 billion in 2024, driven largely by a 694% increase in sanctioned entity activity.

Source: Chainalysis

Stablecoins accounted for 84% of all illicit transaction volume, mirroring broader ecosystem trends in which these assets offer easy cross-border transfers and lower volatility.

Iran's broader crypto operations have faced mounting pressure throughout 2025, with flows involving Iranian entities falling to $3.7 billion between January and July, a 11% decline from 2024.

The Treasury Department sanctioned two Iranian nationals in September for coordinating over $100 million in cryptocurrency oil sales benefiting the IRGC, while Iran has explored accepting digital currencies for advanced weapons sales, including ballistic missiles and drones marketed through its Ministry of Defense Export Center.

Russia launched its ruble-backed A7A5 token in February 2025, processing over $93.3 billion in transactions in less than a year as Moscow similarly leveraged crypto infrastructure to circumvent Western financial restrictions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This wild fruit is getting a CRISPR makeover","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260110211240.htm","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 07:09:44 GMT","

For roughly 10,000 years, farming communities have improved their crops by saving seeds from plants with the best flavor, size, and toughness. This slow and careful process shaped nearly every fruit and vegetable found in grocery stores today. Most modern crops are the result of centuries or even millennia of selective breeding.

Researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) believe they have discovered a much quicker way to guide crop development. Using the gene-editing tool CRISPR, plant biologists focused on goldenberry, a small fruit related to tomatoes. Their approach could make the plant easier to grow and manage, opening the door to large-scale farming in the U.S. and around the world. The same strategy could also speed the development of crops that can better withstand disease, pests, and drought.

""By using CRISPR, you open up paths to new and more resilient food options,"" said Blaine Fitzgerald, the greenhouse technician in CSHL's Zachary Lippman lab. ""In an era of climate change and increasing population size, bringing innovation to agricultural production is going to be a huge path forward.""

Why Goldenberries Are Hard to Farm

The Lippman lab focuses on plants in the nightshade family, which includes staple crops like tomatoes, eggplants, and potatoes, along with lesser-known species such as goldenberries. Goldenberries are mostly grown in South America and are becoming more popular because of their nutrition and their balance of sweet and tart flavors. Some shoppers may already recognize them from supermarket shelves.

Despite their appeal, goldenberries remain difficult to cultivate on a large scale. Farmers still rely on plants that are ""not really domesticated,"" said Miguel Santo Domingo Martinez, a postdoctoral researcher in the Lippman lab who led the study.

""These massive, sprawling plants in an agricultural setting are cumbersome for harvest,"" Fitzgerald explained.

Shrinking the Plant Without Losing the Flavor

Earlier work from the Lippman lab used CRISPR to modify tomatoes and another tomato relative called groundcherry, producing plants that were smaller and easier to grow in urban environments. Using that experience, the team edited similar genes in goldenberries. The modified plants were about 35% shorter, which made them easier to maintain and allowed farmers to plant them more densely.

The researchers then focused on taste. To identify the best fruit, they sampled goldenberries directly from the field. Fitzgerald described the process as eating ""hundreds of them, walking a field, and trying fruit off every plant in the row.""

New Varieties and What Comes Next

After several generations of breeding, the team developed two promising goldenberry lines that combined compact growth with strong flavor. Although the fruits were slightly smaller, the researchers see room for improvement using the same gene-editing tools.

""We can try to target fruit size or disease resistance,"" Santo Domingo said. ""We can use these modern tools to domesticate undomesticated crops.""

The next step is regulatory approval, which would allow growers to access seeds and begin producing the newly developed goldenberry varieties on a wider scale.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A new theory of gravity could explain cosmic acceleration without dark energy","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260110211221.htm","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 13:13:14 GMT","

Why the universe is expanding faster and faster remains one of the biggest open questions in physics. Current theories cannot fully explain this accelerating growth. Today's standard picture of the universe is built on Einstein's general theory of relativity and the standard model of particle physics. Within this framework, scientists usually assume the presence of a mysterious force known as ""dark energy"" to account for the speeding expansion of space. Despite its widespread use in cosmology, the true nature and origin of dark energy are still unknown.

Now, researchers from the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM) at the University of Bremen, working with colleagues at the Transylvanian University of Brașov in Romania, suggest a different way of looking at the problem. Their work indicates that the universe's expansion might be explained -- at least partially -- without invoking dark energy at all.

Why Dark Energy Was Added in the First Place

Cosmologists use Einstein's general theory of relativity along with the Friedmann equations to describe how the universe changes over time. However, when these equations are applied to real astronomical observations, they fall short. To match what telescopes see, scientists must manually add an extra ""dark energy term"" to the equations. This addition is not derived naturally from the theory itself, which has long made it an unsatisfying solution.

A New Approach Using Extended Gravity

Because of this limitation, the team at ZARM and their Romanian collaborators explored an alternative idea. Their results, published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, rely on an extension of general relativity (GR) known as Finsler gravity. This approach has been developeded over recent years and uses a broader description of spacetime geometry.

Unlike the standard formulation of GRT, Finsler gravity can describe the gravitational behavior of gases more precisely. This difference turns out to be crucial when modeling the large-scale behavior of the universe.

Accelerated Expansion Without Dark Energy

When the researchers applied Finsler gravity to the Friedmann equations, they uncovered a striking result. The modified equations, known as the Finsler-Friedmann equations, naturally predict an accelerating universe even in empty space. No extra assumptions are required, and no additional ""dark energy"" term needs to be added by hand.

""This is an exciting indication that we may be able to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe, at least in parts, without dark energy, on the basis of a generalized spacetime geometry,"" says Christian Pfeifer, ZARM physicist and member of the research team. ""This new geometric point of view on the dark energy problem opens up new possibilities for better understanding the laws of nature in the cosmos.""

Tumors in the human body contain immune cells called macrophages that are naturally capable of attacking cancer. However, the tumor environment suppresses these cells, preventing them from doing their job. Researchers at KAIST have now found a way to overcome this barrier by directly transforming immune cells already inside tumors into active cancer-fighting therapies.

KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced on the 30th that a research team led by Professor Ji-Ho Park from the Department of Bio and Brain Engineering has developed a new treatment approach. When a drug is injected directly into a tumor, macrophages already present in the body absorb the drug and begin producing CAR (a cancer-recognizing device) proteins. This process converts them into anticancer immune cells known as ""CAR-macrophages.""

Why Solid Tumors Are So Hard to Treat

Solid tumors -- including gastric, lung, and liver cancers -- form dense structures that block immune cells from entering or functioning effectively. Because of this physical and biological barrier, many existing immune cell therapies struggle to work well against these types of cancers.

CAR-macrophages have emerged as a promising next-generation immunotherapy. Unlike some immune cells, macrophages can directly engulf and destroy cancer cells. They also stimulate nearby immune cells, helping to amplify the body's overall anticancer response.

Despite their potential, current CAR-macrophage therapies rely on extracting immune cells from a patient's blood, growing them in the lab, and genetically modifying them before reinfusion. This process is slow, expensive, and difficult to scale, which limits its practicality for many patients.

Reprogramming Immune Cells Directly Inside the Body

To bypass these challenges, the KAIST team focused on ""tumor-associated macrophages"" that naturally gather around tumors. The researchers developed a method to reprogram these cells directly inside the body rather than modifying them outside it.

Their approach uses lipid nanoparticles -- engineered to be easily taken up by macrophages -- loaded with both mRNA that carries cancer-recognition instructions and an immune-activating compound.

As described by the researchers, this method creates CAR-macrophages by ""directly converting the body's own macrophages into anticancer cell therapies inside the body.""

Strong Tumor Suppression in Animal Studies

When the treatment was injected into tumors, macrophages quickly absorbed the nanoparticles and began producing proteins that identify cancer cells. At the same time, immune signaling was activated. The resulting ""enhanced CAR-macrophages"" showed much stronger cancer-killing ability and stimulated surrounding immune cells, leading to a powerful anticancer response.

In animal models of melanoma (the most dangerous form of skin cancer), tumor growth was significantly reduced. The researchers also found evidence that the immune response could extend beyond the treated tumor, suggesting the potential for broader, body-wide immune protection.

A New Direction for Cancer Immunotherapy

Professor Ji-Ho Park said, ""This study presents a new concept of immune cell therapy that generates anticancer immune cells directly inside the patient's body."" He added that ""it is particularly meaningful in that it simultaneously overcomes the key limitations of existing CAR-macrophage therapies -- delivery efficiency and the immunosuppressive tumor environment.""

Study Details and Funding

The study was led by Jun-Hee Han, Ph.D., from the Department of Bio and Brain Engineering at KAIST as the first author. The findings were published on November 18 in ACS Nano, an international journal focused on nanotechnology.

The research was supported by the Mid-Career Researcher Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A room full of flu patients and no one got sick","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260110211204.htm","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 07:47:52 GMT","

This year's flu season has been especially harsh, driven in part by the rapid spread of a new variant known as subclade K. As cases rise, a newly released study offers surprising insight into how influenza spreads and how people may better protect themselves from getting sick.

To better understand how flu moves from person to person, researchers from the University of Maryland Schools of Public Health and Engineering in College Park and the School of Medicine in Baltimore designed an unusual experiment. College students who were already infected with influenza were placed in a hotel room with healthy middle-aged adult volunteers. Despite close contact, none of the healthy participants became infected.

""At this time of year, it seems like everyone is catching the flu virus. And yet our study showed no transmission -- what does this say about how flu spreads and how to stop outbreaks?"" said Dr. Donald Milton, professor at SPH's Department of Global, Environmental and Occupational Health and a global infectious disease aerobiology expert who was among the first to identify how to stop the spread of COVID-19.

Why the Flu Did Not Spread

The study, published on January 7 in PLOS Pathogens, represents the first controlled clinical trial to closely examine airborne flu transmission between people who were naturally infected, rather than intentionally infected in a laboratory, and people who were not infected. Milton and his colleague Dr. Jianyu Lai explored several reasons why none of the volunteers became ill.

""Our data suggests key things that increase the likelihood of flu transmission -- coughing is a major one,"" said Dr. Jianyu Lai, post-doctoral research scientist, who led data analysis and report writing for the team.

Although the infected students carried high levels of virus in their noses, Lai explained that they rarely coughed. As a result, only small amounts of virus were released into the air.

Ventilation also played a key role. ""The other important factor is ventilation and air movement. The air in our study room was continually mixed rapidly by a heater and dehumidifier and so the small amounts of virus in the air were diluted,"" Lai said.

Age may have been another protective factor. According to Lai, middle-aged adults tend to be less vulnerable to influenza than younger adults, which likely contributed to the absence of infections.

What This Means for Flu Prevention

Many scientists believe that airborne transmission is a major driver of flu spread. However, Milton emphasized that changes to global infection-control guidelines require strong evidence from randomized clinical trials like this one. The research team is continuing its work to better understand how flu spreads through inhalation and under what conditions that transmission is most likely.

The lack of transmission observed in this study provides valuable clues about how people can reduce their risk during flu season.

""Being up close, face-to-face with other people indoors where the air isn't moving much seems to be the most risky thing -- and it's something we all tend to do a lot. Our results suggest that portable air purifiers that stir up the air as well as clean it could be a big help. But if you are really close and someone is coughing, the best way to stay safe is to wear a mask, especially the N95,"" said Milton.

Inside the Flu Experiment

The research took place on a quarantined floor of a Baltimore-area hotel and included five participants with confirmed influenza symptoms and 11 healthy volunteers. The study was conducted across two groups during 2023 and 2024. A similar quarantine design had been used in earlier research, along with specialized testing of exhaled breath developed by Milton and his colleagues.

Participants lived on the isolated hotel floor for two weeks and followed daily routines designed to mimic real-life social interactions. These included casual conversations and physical activities such as yoga, stretching, and dancing. Infected participants also handled shared items like a pen, tablet computer, and microphone, which were then passed around the group.

Researchers closely tracked symptoms and collected daily nasal swabs, saliva samples, and blood samples to monitor infection and antibody development. They measured viral exposure both in the air participants breathed and in the room itself. Exhaled breath samples were collected daily using the Gesundheit II machine, invented by Milton and colleagues at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Why Flu Research Still Matters

Finding better ways to limit flu outbreaks remains a major public health priority, according to Milton. Influenza continues to place a heavy burden on health systems worldwide. Each year, up to 1 billion people globally become infected with seasonal flu. In the United States alone this season, there have already been at least 7.5 million cases, leading to 81,000 hospitalizations and more than 3,000 deaths.

The study included contributions from researchers at UMD's interdisciplinary Public Health Aerobiology Lab, including Kristen Coleman, Yi Esparza, Filbert Hong, Isabel Sierra Maldonado, Kathleen McPhaul and S.H. Sheldon Tai, as well as collaborators from the UMD Department of Mechanical Engineering, the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, the University of Hong Kong, and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Funding for the research came from the NIAID Cooperative agreement U19 grant (5U19AI162130), the University of Maryland Baltimore Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR), the University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State (MPower), and gifts from The Flu Lab and Balvi Filantropic Fund.

Three newly identified compounds were found to strongly inhibit α-glucosidase, an enzyme that plays a central role in breaking down carbohydrates during digestion. Because this enzyme directly affects how quickly sugars enter the bloodstream, the discovery points to possible new functional food ingredients aimed at managing type 2 diabetes.

Functional foods offer more than basic nutrition. Many contain naturally occurring molecules that may support health, including compounds with antioxidant, neuroprotective, or glucose-lowering effects. Finding these helpful substances is difficult because foods are chemically complex. Older discovery methods can be slow and inefficient, which has pushed researchers to adopt more advanced tools such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). These techniques are especially valuable for studying roasted coffee, which contains a wide range of overlapping chemical components.

Researchers led by Minghua Qiu at the Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, reported their findings in Beverage Plant Research. Their work highlights previously unknown anti-diabetic activity in coffee and adds new insight into its role as a functional food.

The team designed a three-step, activity-focused process to uncover bioactive diterpene esters in roasted Coffea arabica beans. Their approach aimed to detect both common and extremely low-level compounds that could inhibit α-glucosidase, while also reducing solvent use and speeding up analysis.

First, the crude diterpene extract was separated into 19 fractions using silica gel chromatography. Each fraction was then analyzed with ^1H NMR and tested for α-glucosidase inhibition. By applying cluster heatmap analysis to the ^1H NMR data, the researchers identified Fr.9-Fr.13 as the most biologically active fractions based on distinctive proton signal patterns.

Further analysis of a representative sample, Fr.9, using ^13C-DEPT NMR revealed the presence of an aldehyde group, confirming earlier findings. After purification with semi-preparative HPLC, the scientists isolated three previously unknown diterpene esters, named caffaldehydes A, B, and C. Their chemical structures were verified through 1D and 2D NMR along with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRESIMS).

Stronger Effects Than a Common Diabetes Drug

Although the three caffaldehydes differed in their fatty acid components (palmitic, stearic, and arachidic acids), all showed notable α-glucosidase inhibition. Their IC₅₀ values were 45.07, 24.40, and 17.50 μM respectively, indicating stronger activity than the comparison drug acarbose.

To uncover additional trace compounds that were difficult to detect using NMR or HPLC alone, the team applied LC-MS/MS to combined fraction groups. They then built a molecular network using GNPS and Cytoscape. This analysis revealed three more previously unknown diterpene esters (compounds 4-6) that were closely related to caffaldehydes A-C. While they shared similar fragment patterns, these molecules contained different fatty acids (magaric, octadecenoic, and nonadecanoic acids). Searches of existing compound databases confirmed that these substances had not been reported before.

Together, the results show that this integrated dereplication strategy is highly effective for identifying structurally diverse and biologically meaningful compounds in complex foods such as roasted coffee.

What This Means for Functional Foods and Future Research

The findings suggest new opportunities to develop coffee-based functional foods or nutraceuticals that support glucose control and may help manage diabetes. Beyond coffee, the same low-solvent, high-precision screening approach could be applied to other complex food sources to rapidly uncover health-related compounds. Future studies will focus on testing the biological effects of the newly discovered trace diterpenes and evaluating their safety and effectiveness in vivo.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A never-before-seen creature has been found in the Great Salt Lake","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260110211227.htm","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 02:39:52 GMT","

Scientists studying the Great Salt Lake have identified at least one species of nematode that is completely new to science, with evidence suggesting there may be a second. Researchers from the University of Utah recently published a paper describing the tiny roundworm and formally naming it in a way that honors the Indigenous people whose ancestral lands include the lake.

The species has been named Diplolaimelloides woaabi and appears to live only in the Great Salt Lake. That makes it endemic to the lake and potentially an important, though still poorly understood, part of its ecosystem. To choose the name, the research team, led by University of Utah biology professor Michael Werner, worked with the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation. Tribal elders suggested Wo'aabi, an Indigenous word meaning ""worm.""

Why Nematodes Matter

Nematodes are among the most widespread animals on Earth. They are found in nearly every environment imaginable, including polar ice, deep-sea hydrothermal vents and ordinary backyard soil. Most are smaller than a millimeter, which is why they often go unnoticed.

Despite their size, nematodes are extraordinarily abundant. Scientists have identified more than 250,000 species so far, making them the most numerous animal phylum in both land and water ecosystems. Roughly 80% of animal life in terrestrial soils and about 90% of animals living on the ocean floor are nematodes.

The First Discovery in the Lake

Until recently, no nematodes had been definitively documented in the Great Salt Lake. That changed in 2022, when field expeditions led by Julie Jung uncovered nematodes living in the lake's microbialites. These are hardened, mound-like structures formed by microbial communities on the lakebed.

Jung, who was a postdoctoral researcher in Werner's lab at the time, collected samples while traveling across the lake by kayak and bicycle. The team reported that initial discovery in a scientific paper published last year.

""We thought that this was probably a new species of nematode from the beginning, but it took three years of additional work to taxonomically confirm that suspicion,"" said Jung, now an assistant professor at Weber State University.

Only the Third Animal Known to Survive There

With this finding, nematodes became just the third group of animals known to live in the Great Salt Lake's extremely salty water. The other two are brine shrimp and brine flies, which are crucial food sources for millions of migratory birds that stop at the lake each year.

Further research suggests the story may not be finished. Genetic evidence indicates there could be a second, previously unknown nematode species among the samples collected. Thomas Murray, an undergraduate researcher and second author on the paper, has been helping sample different regions of the lake to investigate this possibility.

""It's hard to tell distinguishing characteristics, but genetically we can see that there are at least two populations out there,"" Werner said.

How Did the Worms Get There?

The discovery raises two major questions for scientists. First, how did these worms arrive in the Great Salt Lake? Second, what role do they play in the lake's ecosystem?

From early on, the team suspected the nematodes belonged to the family Monhysteridae. This is an ancient group of nematodes known for surviving in extreme conditions, including very salty environments. Genetic and physical analyses confirmed that the species belongs to the genus Diplolaimelloides, a group typically found in coastal marine and brackish waters.

That makes the Great Salt Lake discovery especially puzzling. Only one other member of this genus is known to live outside coastal regions, and that species is found in eastern Mongolia. The Great Salt Lake, by contrast, sits about 4,200 feet above sea level and is roughly 800 miles from the nearest ocean.

""That begs some more interesting, intriguing questions that you wouldn't have even known to think of until we figured out the alpha taxonomy,"" Werner said. ""There are two hypotheses, two models that are both kind of crazy for different reasons.""

Ancient Seas or Traveling Birds

One explanation comes from coauthor Byron Adams, a nematologist and biology professor at Brigham Young University. He suggests the worms may have been living in the region for millions of years. During the Cretaceous Period, much of what is now Utah was located along the shoreline of a vast inland sea that split North America in two.

""So we were on the beach here. This area was part of that seaway, and streams and rivers that drained into that beach would be great habitat for these kinds of organisms,"" Adams said. ""With the Colorado Plateau lifting up, you formed a great basin, and these animals were trapped here. That's something that we have to test out and do more science on, but that's my go-to. The null hypothesis is that they're here because they've always kind of been here.""

Werner pointed out a major challenge to that idea. Northern Utah has not always been salty. Between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago, the region was covered by Lake Bonneville, a massive freshwater lake.

""If the nematode has been endemic since 100 million years ago, it has survived through these dramatic shifts in salinity at least once, probably a few times,"" he said.

The alternative explanation, which Werner admits is even ""crazier,"" is that the worms were transported by migratory birds. In this scenario, nematodes could have clung to feathers after birds visited saline lakes in South America and were then carried thousands of miles north.

""So who knows. Maybe the birds are transporting small invertebrates, including nematodes, across huge distances,"" Werner said. ""Kind of hard to believe, but it seems like it has to be one of those two.""

A Potential Early Warning for Lake Health

Back in the lab, researchers noticed another unexpected pattern. Female nematodes were far more common than males in samples collected directly from the lake.

""That's another confusing part of the story for us. When we sample out there on the lake and bring them back in the lab, we get less than 1% males. But when we have cultured them in the lab, the males make up about 50% of the sex ratio,"" Werner said. ""We're super happy to be able to culture them in the lab, but there's something about it that's clearly different than the lake environment.""

The worms live within algal mats that coat the lake's microbialites, feeding on bacteria that thrive there. Researchers found that the nematodes are concentrated in just the top few centimeters of these mats and are absent below that layer.

While scientists are still determining their exact position in the food web, nematodes are known to be ecologically important in many environments. Their presence in the Great Salt Lake suggests they likely play a meaningful role there as well.

Nematodes are also widely used as bioindicators. Changes in their populations, diversity or distribution can signal shifts in water quality, salinity or sediment chemistry. With the Great Salt Lake under increasing pressure from human activity, this newly identified species could become a valuable tool for monitoring environmental change.

""When you only have a handful of species that can persist in environments like that, and they're really sensitive to change, those serve as really good sentinel taxa,"" Adams said. ""They tell you how healthy is your ecosystem.""

Because Diplolaimelloides woaabi appears to live exclusively on microbialites, it may have unique relationships with microbes or unusual survival strategies that scientists have yet to uncover. Since microbialites play a central role in producing energy and supporting life in the lake, any interactions involving these nematodes could have effects that spread throughout the ecosystem.

Study Details and Funding

The research appears in the November 2025 issue of the Journal of Nematology under the title, ""Diplolaimelloides woaabi sp. n. (Nematoda: Monhysteridae): A Novel Species of Free-Living Nematode from the Great Salt Lake, Utah.""

The study's authors include Solinus Farrer, Abigail Borgmeier and Byron J. Adams of Brigham Young University; Jon Wang and Morgan Marcus of the University of Utah; Gustavo Fonseca of the Federal University of São Paulo; and Thomas Powers of the University of Nebraska. Funding was provided by the National Institutes of Health, the Society of Systematic Biologists, the National Science Foundation and the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico.

Margaret Thatcher, who was known for sleeping only four hours a night, is often credited with saying “Sleep is for wimps!” But sleep is actually work. Putting down the phone, setting aside personal or political worries—these require discipline. True relaxation calls for training.

Sleep coaches used to treat mainly newborns (and their exhausted parents). But recently, as anxieties about sleep have spiked, grown-ups have found they need help with their habits too. A Gallup poll from 2023 found that 57 percent of Americans think they would feel better with more sleep, up from just 43 percent in 2013. Only about a fourth of those surveyed reported getting the commonly recommended eight or more hours per night—down from 34 percent 10 years prior.

Sleep professionals are seizing the opportunity to help adults realize their dream of waking up rested. WIRED spoke to a sleep consultant who, after years of working with kids, tapped into that underserved population. She says it's entirely possible to transform daytime and nighttime habits to optimize for good sleep. Why not start tonight?

Usually, an adult comes to me with one of two things: First, a major life event—work stress, having a baby, losing a parent, a relationship ending—that destabilizes their system. Sleep is always the first thing to go. The second is that they have a chronic pattern. There are people who've really struggled with sleep since childhood, and then it becomes a part of how they see themselves. They've tried everything, and then they say, “I'm an insomniac.”

In both cases, they're exhausted. I always laugh, because when I'm cornered at a dinner party it's like, “Oh, I just have a quick question. I haven't slept through the night in 19 years.”

I've been a sleep consultant for over 20 years. I started my child sleep practice after getting my master's in clinical psychology. I was working with a lot of parents, and I really started to notice a common issue: Their children's sleep issues were literally pushing them to the brink of divorce.

Even once I got their kids to be fabulous sleepers, the parents were still struggling due to long-standing habits from way before their kids arrived. That's when I realized I needed to help the adults too.

There are camps: trouble falling asleep or trouble waking up at night—or both. So that's my job: to unravel that mystery of what's keeping someone up at night. Some of the toughest cases are people who come in only focusing on their nighttime habits and don't disclose things happening during the day.

One of my clients had trouble sleeping through the night for years. We realized that they consumed most of their calories at night, and nothing during the day. So they kept waking up to eat, and that completely dysregulated their system.

Another client, a woman who exercised all the time and drank 200 ounces of water a day, never made the connection that she was getting up to pee literally every hour. We had to diminish the amount of water she drank and have her stop drinking at a certain hour.

Sometimes people actually just stop functioning. I'm thinking about a mom who says, “I just forgot to clip my child's seatbelt on in my car.” “I put my keys in the refrigerator.”

I start with the basics. Of course, we're doing sleep hygiene, but that's anything that you can Google: Get blackout shades, have a sleep sanctuary. Most people think they have a good setup, but their habits or their environment are working against them. That's where coaching helps, because I can spot what they're missing.

People have these stories that they've told themselves, like, “If I sleep, then I'm not working hard enough” or “I'm young and I don't need that much sleep.” What's the new story that you can tell yourself about sleep? From there, I use a lot of journaling, cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, mindset work, breath work.

I typically work with people in 12 sessions over a three-month period. In between sessions, I follow up. It's a lot of texting. A lot of the time their friends and coworkers are tired of hearing that they're not sleeping and tune them out. I don't tune out.

Self-judgment is the sleep killer. You're up at night like, “I'm failing. I'm not going to have a good day.” But sleep's a birthright. It's something we're supposed to do to survive.

We're overstimulated by screens, social media, constant notifications, the 24-hour news cycle, doomscrolling—this just floods our brain with cortisol, which is adrenaline, and then it perpetuates anxious thinking.

A lot of us weren't taught how to self-soothe when we were little. Let's say you were a kid who had trouble sleeping, or you co-slept with your parents. When we become adults, it becomes a harder process. Most people grab their phones and doomscroll. Instead of actually dealing with how they feel, they want to mask how they feel. And then you start looking through the news, and it's like a spark plug to your anxiety.

I always say, “Let's have some designated worry time” so that I'm not taking away worry from people. I'll give you an hour to just worry to your heart's desire, just get it out. When you wake up at night and you start thinking, “How am I going to pay the mortgage? What's happening in the world?” you can say, “You know what? This isn't the right time to do this.”

Some people are like, “Oh, this has just been going on for so long, forget it.” We are fully capable of changing our situations and our sleep. It's never too late.

Geopolitics are being reduced to videos lasting just a few minutes. Social media has surpassed traditional media, not only in the speed with which it is created and shared, but also in its ability to frame our reality. People have the illusion of knowing what is happening and why within just a few hours—or less—of major world events. But reality is more complicated.

In the early hours of January 3, the United States attacked Venezuela. The sky thundered over Caracas with multiple explosions. Cuban president Miguel Díaz-Canel acknowledged that 32 Cuban soldiers died in combat during the US intervention. The attacks caused at least 80 deaths among other military personnel and civilians, according to reporting from The New York Times. The attack included the capture of president Nicolás Maduro, who was transferred to New York to be tried for narcoterrorism conspiracy and other charges.

Hours later, US president Donald Trump said he would run the South American country until there was a transition he considered satisfactory. At the same time, he said, US oil companies would revive the Venezuelan oil industry. Later, from Caracas, Venezuela's vice president Delcy Rodríguez called for Maduro's release, saying that the country “will never again be a slave or colony of any empire.” Maduro, meanwhile, slept in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he had been transferred after his capture.

The attack has returned the world to an era that many thought was long over, of direct US military involvement in the affairs of Latin American countries. And it's playing out very differently from what you might have seen on TikTok.

WIRED asked Julio Juárez, a psychological researcher at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) and academic secretary of the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Sciences and Humanities (CEIICH), to analyze how the practice of verifying claims with sources has collapsed in the current digital world.

“The time that traditional media needed to verify information has been devoured by the speed of social media platforms. From the first reports of the attack on Venezuela, social media operated as a massive amplifier that not only transmitted different perspectives but also constructed reality,"" says Juárez. ""It is the sign of an era where digital communication has primacy: It defines what happens and why. Donald Trump's narrative was not random; it was an exercise in legitimization that polarized public opinion. Today, citizens face the challenge of exercising critical judgment in an environment that's designed to provoke immediate reactions, not nuanced reflection.”

On his Truth Social account, Trump announced early in the morning after the military strike that the US had successfully carried out a “large-scale attack on Venezuela.” Maduro had been captured and taken out of the country by helicopter along with his wife, Cilia Flores. Both were transported by a military aircraft to a US ship, which took them to Guantanamo, where they then boarded a plane that took them to New York.

Historia Para Tontos (History for Dummies), a Spanish-language Instagram account that has disseminated its takes on history through the use of maps and satire, summarized the geopolitical tension of early 2026 in a viral video. In the clip, while an optimistic Mexico celebrates the arrival of the new year, an imperial US boasts: “I just bombed Venezuela and captured Maduro for the sake of world security.” The punchline is a critique of American exceptionalism, as the character continues, “And the world is me.”

Comments quickly followed. “Where was the concern for international law when Maduro violated our human and civil rights year after year for more than a decade? Where were those laws when they starved us, killed our students for protesting peacefully, and let political prisoners die? Where were YOU, Mexico, during those 25 years when we were crying out for help? Did you raise your voice to defend our sovereignty when Maduro stole the elections last year? Were you outraged to learn that Cuba, China, Iran, and Russia were stealing our oil and natural resources? Stupid international laws have watched us bleed to death for almost three decades. Do us a favor and keep quiet and look the other way. Thank you.🥰 Sincerely, Venezuela,” wrote Dayani López in one reply.

In an interview with WIRED, sociologist Rafael Uzcategui, codirector of the Laboratorio de Paz in Caracas, says: “I'm bothered by the misunderstanding and biased narratives that people, for ideological reasons, continue to impose from outside, when it is now very easy to obtain accurate information about the situation in Venezuela. We've made a great effort to work with international human rights institutions, whose reports have provided an important diagnosis, which is public and easily accessible, of the deterioration of the situation. We believed that the evidence would be sufficient to raise awareness among the international community, especially those who claim to be humanitarians and protectors of human rights. Given this double standard, I would prefer them to be more sincere and say, ‘human rights violations only occur when it's our opponents who commit them.'”

Tecayahuatzin Mancilla, the voice behind Historia Para Tontos and a graduate with a degree in international relations from the Aragón Faculty of Higher Studies at UNAM, spoke to WIRED about the video he posted. “It focuses more on issues of international law and the historical reality of Latin America through US interventions, especially in the 20th century,” he explained. “The fact that there is no international arrest warrant against the dictator Maduro calls into question the legitimacy of the action by the United States. What I wanted to expose is precisely how the United States violates international law whenever it's in their interest to do so; we've seen it in the Middle East and we are seeing it again in Latin America after a hiatus of some 32 years.”

“What's so funny? It's infuriating to see the US invade a neighboring country, but it's even more infuriating that Venezuelans themselves are applauding it,” said another comment on the video. Opinions were clearly divided in this polarized conversation.

“Digital blackouts within Venezuela reveal a very specific oppressive agenda, which follows a pattern of persecution and human rights violations,” explains one Venezuelan citizen who preferred to remain anonymous. “Social media content—even seemingly harmless content, such as comedic sketches or cartoons—manages to convey what is happening in Venezuela from an alternative perspective. This narrative makes its way through an algorithm that attempts to depoliticize content,” she says. “On the other hand, historical memory is constructed by the media outlets that survive in Venezuela and that manage to continue to report on the situation, putting themselves at risk with virtually no resources. In the case of the Alianza Rebelde—a collective of media organizations focused on investigative reporting and which includes El Pitazo, Runrunes, and TalCual—they are making a truly important effort to disseminate information.”

“But we all weave the narrative collectively. It is constructed by voices from the diaspora, not only those from within the country. That is why we must be increasingly aware of the narrative we want to construct for the future, and think about how to ensure that this narrative is not limited to ephemeral social media, but that it instead endures. To do this, we need to have uncomfortable conversations about how we imagine the future of the country.”

“I've spoken with many Venezuelan friends, and something they all told me was: ‘We don't agree with bombing our country, but some of us see it as the only way to remove a dictator from power,'” says Mancilla. “Many say that legal, political, and electoral avenues had been tried without success; only direct intervention managed to overthrow him. Obviously, as a Mexican viewing this all from the outside, I don't share that pain because I didn't experience it … But there are also Venezuelans who support the regime and denounce this intervention as a violation of their sovereignty. There is a lot of polarization, and both opinions are valid because everyone has their own ideology, perspective, and experiences.”

“There's a mixture of celebration and euphoria, echoing Trump's triumphalist logic: ‘I freed them,' ‘I made a courageous decision,' ‘It was a flawless military operation,'” Juárez says. “It's very propagandistic, which suits him very well in the current context of the United States as he's facing a midterm election; it serves to send a signal to the region and the world.”

“The big challenge is the quality of content, as there is a lot of noise, misinformation, and banal commentary. However, we trust that users have the ability to consume and share content from reliable sources,” says Uzcátegui, codirector of Laboratorio de Paz. “Political discussion is completely banned in Venezuela. Even private spaces for political conversation have almost completely disappeared due to fear. We know that people continue to consume content, but they are careful not to leave a digital trail—no retweets or likes, for example. Social media is the last place where people can get information about the real situation.”

“The number of trustworthy spaces has been drastically reduced,” he says. “In Venezuela's case, WhatsApp chats are where information is most widely shared, as was seen in the 2024 presidential elections. The challenge now is to feed these archipelagos, these places that people have retreated to due to fears of persecution, with quality content.”

The great challenge for these networks that have emerged as the new public square is assuring order, Juárez affirms. “How do you organize this conversation? Not only distinguishing accurate from false information, but dealing with information bubbles, memes of Maduro as a DJ, and everything from humorous comments to hardline political propaganda. Who brings order to all that?” he asks. “I think traditional media still has a fundamental role to play. They are the most qualified to, at a minimum, organize the conversation. They tell us not what to think, but instead say: ‘Look, this happened, these are the implications, this is what people are talking about, and this is why we need to be careful about this other thing.' Someone has to take charge of organizing the conversation because if you go to one's timeline on TikTok, X, or Instagram, you'll find chaos. We've gone from hard news to unfiltered hate speech,” he says.

For Mancilla, there is a lot of misinformation echoing around social media. “It has recently caused a breakdown in dialogue. I notice that people are sometimes afraid of dialogue because they are afraid of being wrong. They get stuck on one idea. There is no longer anywhere that you can say, ‘I understand your point, listen to mine. That has been lost on social media; everything is framed in black and white. There are no nuances,” he says. “One person feels backed by 10,000 others and believes they are right, closing themselves off to any other ideas. We all have ideals, but we should be open to listening to each other, even when we disagree. That's the goal of dialogue. In my international relations program, we were told that dialogue is complementary and it's very good when different sides disagree, because it means there is a good debate. There were no winners, just shared ideas. Social media no longer allows for that sort of openness.”

For Juárez, the main factor behind digital disruption is disintermediation. Basically, that each of us is now our own media outlet. “That's what these platforms have sold us: You choose what to be informed about and you stay inside a bubble. You seek out information that confirms what you already knew or thought. If you think what happened in Venezuela was good, you will look for information that supports that, and vice versa. It creates an environment where we only hear what we want to hear.”

According to the Digital News Report 2025, the migration to digital platforms—especially by younger generations—is becoming increasingly evident: 16 percent of those surveyed reported turning to TikTok frequently for news. The figure for WhatsApp was 19 percent, Facebook 36 percent, and YouTube 30 percent.

Polarization doesn't need a malicious algorithm to disrupt public conversation; it is an inevitable consequence of the basic design of social platforms. By emulating environments which emphasize certain forms of connection and dialogue, a persistent loop emerges where emotional content is the most visible and, eventually, it shapes the very architecture of the network. It is not a question of users actively seeking conflict or platforms being designed with any malicious intent, but rather the result of a rewarding emotional reaction over measured analysis.

For Petter Törnberg, who worked on the study, “this toxicity is an unintended consequence of the structure of posts and followers. The act of sharing content is often impulsive and deeply partisan; users react to anger or scandal, propagating a narrative that, in turn, shapes their own digital environment. This feedback loop between emotional action and network structure creates an ecosystem where toxicity becomes the organic norm. Ultimately, the mere existence of basic functions such as forwarding and liking seems to be enough to generate these negative results, turning networks into echo chambers that feed on our own reactive psychology.”

“I believe that digital platforms can continue to be a space for resistance and solutions. But in order to avoid becoming echo chambers, there must be a genuine intention to engage in dialogue. And that doesn't always happen when we are going through a very difficult time,"" explains an anonymous Venezuelan source who spoke to WIRED. “When our emotional wounds override reason, it's very difficult to understand the perspectives of others. For this to be possible, first the wound has to be identified and understood, and sometimes we won't be able to find the equanimity to engage in a dialogue. However, that dialogue must inevitably occur.”

“We are now experiencing a great deal of polarization among Venezuelans inside and outside the country because of this event, which I personally consider to be a violent act of foreign intervention. I can understand the joy of those who celebrate Nicolás Maduro's imprisonment as a moment of justice. But at the same time, I am against foreign intervention, against Donald Trump, and against them taking our resources from us,” this Venezuelan source explains. “We have done everything; we have made every effort possible. We are in this situation because we are cornered and vulnerable to US imperialism, but also from Russia and China. Power has led us to this situation of extreme vulnerability. Digital platforms, however, can be spaces of resistance.”

Due to an information overload, our attention span, which is a finite resource, is stretched too thin, explains Juárez: “There comes a point where we shut down and say, ‘That's it, this is what I think.' We generally invest as little psychological energy as possible and use shortcuts to reach our conclusions: I saw the video, I saw the quote, I saw the tweet, and that's it; I'm done. We simplify because simplification serves as an antidote to saturation. When we are drowning in information, we feel disoriented and anxious. The level of that anxiety depends on our proximity to an event. That desire to embrace a certain viewpoint wins out when what we need is to weigh the many real implications of a situation.”

“My main concern is that we have lost the ability to discern between what is false and what is true. We are willing to accept prefabricated stories. If we lose that ability as citizens, we also lose our agency,"" Juárez says. “What we are seeing in Venezuela is not the final episode in a story, it is the beginning of a dynamic that will not stop here.”

9/10

Perhaps the most anticipated new camera of 2025, Sony's new A7V mirrorless camera just squeaked onto the scene before the end of the year. The A7 series is Sony's all-around camera. It lacks the resolution of the A7R cameras and the video focus of the A7S cameras, but in some ways offering enough of the best of those to make the plain A7 the best choice for most people.

The A7V is no different and is one of the best hybrid still and video cameras I've tested, offering excellent dynamic range, crazy-fast shooting capabilities, and plenty of resolution for everything short of billboard-size prints.

First, background and context. The Sony A7 series was my intro to ""serious"" digital photography. I skipped the whole digital SLR stage, sticking with film for an absurdly long time and carrying a Micro Four Thirds mirrorless for digital shots. That all changed with the original Sony A7. I bought one and never looked back. Well, that's not strictly true, I did look back and start shooting film again, but I've never purchased any other digital camera. I upgraded to the A7II, then the A7RII, and I have shot with every A7 and A7R now except the A7III.

All that to give some context to this statement: The new A7V is the best all-around camera Sony has ever made. It has 95 percent of what the top-of-the-line A1II offers, for half the price.

Let's start with the new sensor. The A7V uses a fully backside illuminated, partially stacked 33 megapixel CMOS sensor. The partially stacked bit is new from the A7IV, and it means faster readouts, which translates to higher burst rates and less rolling shutter. The same partially stacked tech is also in the Nikon Z6 III, but the Sony A7V offers 33 megapixels to the Z6 III's 24.

The new sensor is paired with the new Bionz XR2 processor, which means the A7V has the most sophisticated autofocus system in the A7 lineup, with subject recognition for six types of subjects (human, animal, bird, insect, car, train, and plane), as well as an extra auto mode that you can configure. More useful in my testing than the strict tracking capabilities is the human face and eye recognition, which has been hugely improved over previous A7 models.

Once you lock on to a subject, the A7V is eerily good at tracking them through all kinds of situations, including in a crowd of other people. It can even re-find them quickly after they disappear from view. This is useful for photography but really comes into its own when shooting video.

To go along with this, there's a new feature called AI Smart Reframe (because it's 2026 and nothing shall be released without AI in front of it). First, let's back up and talk video specs for a second. The A7V is limited to 4K, where some competitors can do up to 6K. But the good news is that that 4K comes downsampled from the full 7K sensor (with no binning). That makes for sharper video than you'll get from a straight 4K sensor, but it also enables the new feature.

Smart Reframe works by first locking on to a subject, and then zooming and panning around the sensor to keep the subject centered. There are limits—the camera can't pan itself—but for filming yourself, it's actually very good and allows you to move in such a way that gives the illusion of having someone behind the camera, making it very handy for solo vlogs.

To round out the video specs, the 4K can be had at up to 60 frames per second with the full sensor capture, and there's 4K 120 fps with a 1.5X APS-C crop.

The A7V gains the pre-burst capture feature from the A9 III when using the electronic shutter. This allows you to capture images for up to one second in the interval between initiating the AF and pressing the shutter. If you've ever used this feature on a GoPro, the A7V's is very similar. It's great for wildlife photography, among other things. The classic example is a bird on a branch. If you want to capture the bird taking off, even with 30-fps RAW capture, you have to press the shutter button in time to capture the moment the bird lifts off. With pre-burst capture, you're taking pictures before you fully press the shutter, which means you get the image of the bird lifting off that happened in that split millisecond before you actually got the shutter pressed.

Also on the electronic shutter front, there is less distortion when using it. It's still not quite to the point where you can shoot fully electronic, but it's good enough that turning it on for burst mode and getting the max capture speeds out of the chip isn't a huge trade-off.

Those are most of the headline new specs, but for me there are three fairly minor upgrades that make the A7V so much nicer than its predecessors. The first is the rear screen. It's bright and sharp and one of the first screens I've used where I actually came to trust it well enough that I was comfortable shooting from the hip or lower. Changing your angle to the scene is a big part of composition, so anything that helps with this is a huge win to me. The A7V's rear screen makes this so much easier, and it flips and rotates just about every way you could imagine, so you can shoot from any angle and still compose on the screen.

The second big upgrade is in ISO. I am one of those people who will shoot up to 25,000 ISO if I need to to maintain my shutter speed and aperture where I want them. Maybe this is an old-guy film-shooter thing, but changing ISO still seems like a miracle to me, and it's my favorite thing about digital photography—when it works. With the A7V, I was completely comfortable pushing ISO as high as 32,000. With the noise-reduction algorithms in postproduction software these days, the images still look great even at these insane ISOs. And yes, I try to keep ISO down when I can, but it's nice to know that I can go that high if I need to to get the shot.

The third upgrade is not so much an upgrade as a change for the better. Sony's color science has improved dramatically, especially with skin tones, which are much truer to life across the range of skin tones in this world. Auto white balance is also significantly better, though I am still a fan of shooting in good old sunlight white balance 95 percent of the time.

Finally, a bonus thing I loved. I've always wanted to get better at bird photography, but that generally requires expensive lenses and extensive time in the field. It still requires both of those things, but with 33 MP to crop into, and the pre-burst capture, and 33 images-per-second RAW capture ... even someone like me, with next to no wildlife photography skills and only a 200mm lens, can get some pretty decent images, which was fun to experiment with.

Rating: 9/10

The one thing that still sucks about the A7V and has sucked about every Sony camera I've ever used, and it's only getting worse: the menu system. They are disorganized, confusing, and difficult to navigate. The only thing that saves you here is the number of programmable hardware buttons, which allow you to control things the way you want to without having to dive into the menus. Sony, seriously, hire a UX designer and fix this. Even better, steal Leica's menu designer.

Is the A7V worth the upgrade? Yes, if you're coming from a camera that's below the A7IV. If you already have the A7IV, it's less compelling. The new features are impressive on a specs table, but whether you need them depends on what you shoot.

If you're a wildlife or sports photographer, it's worth the upgrade to get the pre-capture and higher burst rates. If what you shoot doesn't benefit from those features—say you mostly shoot travel images, landscape, street—the A7V is a less-compelling prospect. It's incredibly nice for all those scenarios, but if you already have the A7IV, it might not be worth the money to upgrade for a bunch of new features you won't use.

Google today announced a new open standard, called the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) for AI agent-based shopping, at the National Retail Federation (NRF) conference.

The standard, developed with companies like Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target, and Walmart, lets agents work across different parts of customer buying processes, including discovery and post-purchase support. The core idea is that the standard could facilitate these various parts of the process instead of requiring connections with different agents.

Google said that it also works with other agentic protocols, such as Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) — which Google announced last year — Agent2Agent (A2A), and Model Context Protocol (MCP). The company specified that Agents and Businesses can pick and choose specific extensions of the protocol that suits their needs.

The company said that it will soon use UCP for eligible Google product listings in AI mode in search and the Gemini apps to let shoppers check out directly from U.S.-based retailers while researching a product. Users will be able to pay using Google Pay and pass on the shipping information saved in the Google Wallet. Google said that it will soon support PayPal as a payment option.

“This is one of the really exciting parts about agentic,” said Shopify CEO and founder Tobi Lutke. “It's really good at finding people who have specific interests and finding the product that is just perfect for them. Like, I would have never searched for this product, but somehow it found me right on the other side. This kind of serendipity is where the best of commerce happens.”

Notably, Shopify also unveiled a similar integration with Microsoft Copilot for shopping today to let customers check out easily within the conversational flow.

In another consumer-facing change, Google said it will now allow brands to offer a special discount to users while they are looking for a product recommendation when using the AI mode. For instance, if you are searching for a rug using a query like “I'm looking for a modern, stylish rug for a high-traffic dining room. I host a lot of dinner parties, so I want something that is easy to clean,” brands can set up their campaign in a way to offer you a discount at that moment. 

The company is also giving users new data attributes within the Merchant Center to have sellers feature their items better within AI search surfaces. Companies like PayPal and OpenAI are also working on having sellers be more discoverable in AI chatbot results. Startups like the prompting company are also working with merchants to have their products surface within AI answers.

Google is now also allowing merchants to integrate a branded AI-powered Business Agent within Google Search to answer customer questions. The company noted that merchants like Lowe's, Michael's, Poshmark, and Reebok are already using this product. Competitors like Meta and Shopify have been exploring AI-powered tools for businesses for customer support and outreach.

The search giant also announced Gemini Enterprise for Customer Experience (CX), a suite to handle shopping and customer service for retailers and restaurants. 

Companies like Google, Amazon, Walmart, and OpenAI have been releasing new standards and products to infuse AI into every bit of shopping, both on the consumer and merchant side. Earlier in the month, Adobe noted that traffic driven to seller sites by generative AI grew by 693.4% during the holiday season, though the report didn't specify how much of this traffic translated into sales. 

The story has been updated to reflect that retailers can use AI agents inside Google Search

Officials from Indonesia and Malaysia have said they are temporarily blocking access to xAI's chatbot Grok.

These are the most aggressive moves so far from government officials responding to a flood of sexualized, AI-generated imagery — often depicting real women and minors, and sometimes depicting violence — posted by Grok in response to requests from users on the social network X. (X and xAI are part of the same company.)

In a statement shared Saturday with the Guardian and other publications, Indonesia's communications and digital minister Meutya Hafid said, “The government views the practice of non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space.”

The ministry has also reportedly summoned X officials to discuss the issue.

The New York Times said the Malaysian government announced a similar ban on Sunday.

Varied governmental responses over the past week include an order from India's IT ministry for xAI to take action to prevent Grok from generating obscene content, as well as an order from the European Commission for the company to retain all documents related to Grok, potentially setting the stage for an investigation.

In the United Kingdom, the communications regulator Ofcom has said that it will “undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.” Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in an interview Ofcom has his “full support to take action.”

And while in the United States, the Trump administration appears to be staying silent on the issue (xAI CEO Elon Musk is a major Trump donor and led the administration's controversial Department of Government Efficiency last year), Democratic senators have called on Apple and Google to remove X from their app stores.

xAI initially responded by posting a seemingly first-person apology to the Grok account, acknowledging that a post “violated ethical standards and potentially US laws” around child sexual abuse material. It later restricted the AI image-generation feature to paying subscribers on X, though that restriction did not appear to affect the Grok app itself, which still allowed anyone to generate images.

In response to a post wondering why the U.K. government wasn't taking action against other AI image generation tools, Musk wrote, “They want any excuse for censorship.”

This post has been updated to reflect Malaysia's ban on Grok.

Wing, the Alphabet-owned company that delivers groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and hot lattes, is expanding its partnership with Walmart for the second time in less than a year. 

The two companies announced on Sunday plans to bring the on-demand drone delivery service to an additional 150 Walmart stores. The rollout, which builds off existing services at stores in Dallas-Fort Worth and Atlanta, will occur throughout this year and into 2027, Wing's new chief business officer Heather Rivera told TechCrunch. 

The expansion suggests customers are using Wing's drone delivery service enough to warrant growth. Rivera said its top 25% customers are using the service three times a week. Some of the most commonly ordered items are eggs, ground beef, fresh tomatoes, avocados, limes, lunchables, and snacks such as Takis.

The 150-store expansion announcement follows plans shared in June 2025 to launch in Houston, Orlando, Tampa, and Charlotte. Rivera said Wing will launch in Houston on January 15. Once the expansion is complete, Wing will operate from more than 270 Walmart stores, including Los Angeles, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Miami and serve about 10% of the U.S. population.

The announcement places the former Google X project firmly in the commercial enterprise category. And while Wing does have a partnership with DoorDash, its primary path to commercial operations has been, and still is, through Walmart.

The companies first partnered in 2023, launching a pilot program to test on-demand drone delivery at two stores in the Dallas metro area that reached about 60,000 homes. The program later grew to 18 Walmart Supercenters in Dallas-Fort Worth and more recently spread to stores in Atlanta.

Wing will continue to evolve its technology and operations, according to Rivera; the company recently completed the first commercial flights for its larger aircraft that can carry a five-pound payload, for instance. But in general, she said Wing is focused on co-locating its service at Walmart sites and integrating into their operations.

Rivera said Wing will likely try a couple of different approaches to scaling its operations like clustering store openings. It's an approach Wing used last year when it launched six stores together in Atlanta. Rivera would not share if its operations are profitable or when they might be. But Rivera did note she was brought in to scale the business. 

“And so that is what I'm here to do, and excited about,” she said, later noting that “volume is definitely powering our flywheel.” In other words, scaling to as many stores in as many markets as possible is critical for its business economics.

The nuclear industry is in the mist of a renaissance. Old plants are being refurbished, and investors are showering startups with cash. In the last several weeks of 2025 alone, nuclear startups raised $1.1 billion, largely on investor optimism that smaller nuclear reactors will succeed where the broader industry has recently stumbled.

Traditional nuclear reactors are massive pieces of infrastructure. The newest reactors built in the U.S. — Vogtle 3 and 4 in Georgia —  contain tens of thousands of tons of concrete, are powered by fuel assemblies 14 feet tall, and generate over 1 gigawatt of electricity each. But they were also eight years late and more than $20 billion over budget.

The fresh crop of nuclear startups hopes that by shrinking the reactor, they'll be able to sidestep both problems. Need more power? Just add more reactors. Smaller reactors, they argue, can be built using mass production techniques, and as companies produce more parts, they should get better at making them, which should drive down costs.

The magnitude of that benefit is something experts are still researching, but today's nuclear startups are depending on it being greater than zero.

But manufacturing isn't easy. Just look at Tesla's experience: The company struggled mightily to profitably produce the Model 3 in large numbers — and it had the benefit of being in the automotive industry, where the U.S. still has significant expertise. U.S. nuclear startups don't have that advantage.

“I have a number of friends who work in supply chain for nuclear, and they can rattle off like five to ten materials that we just don't make in the United States,” Milo Werner, general partner at DCVC, told TechCrunch. “We have to buy them overseas. We've forgotten how to make them.”

Werner knows a thing or two about manufacturing. Before becoming an investor, she worked at Tesla leading new product introduction, and before that, she did the same at FitBit, launching four factories in China for the wearables company. Today, in addition to investing at DCVC, Werner has co-founded the NextGen Industry Group, which works to advance the adoption of new technologies in the manufacturing sector.

When companies of any size want to manufacture something, they face two main challenges, Werner said. One is capital, which is often the biggest constraint since factories aren't cheap. Fortunately for the nuclear industry, that shouldn't pose much of a problem. “They're awash in capital right now,” she said.

But the nuclear industry isn't immune from the other challenge all manufacturers face, which is a lack of human capital. “We haven't really built any industrial facilities in 40 years in the United States,” Werner said. As a result, we've lost the muscle memory. “It's like we've been sitting on the couch watching TV for 10 years and then getting up and trying to run a marathon the next day. It's not good.”

After decades of offshoring, the U.S. lacks people experienced with both factory construction and operations. “There are for sure some people in the United States who have been doing this, but we don't have the quantum of people that we need for everybody to have a full staff of seasoned manufacturing people.” She not just talking about machine operators, but everyone from factory floor supervisors all the way up to CFOs and board members.

The good news is that Werner sees a lot of startups, nuclear and otherwise, building early versions of their products in close proximity to their technical team. “That is pulling manufacturing in closer to the United States because it allows them to have that cycle of improvement.”

To reap the benefits of mass manufacturing, it's helpful for startups of all stripes to start small and scale up. “Really leaning into modularity is very important for investors,” she said. The modular approach helps companies start producing small volumes early on so they can collect data on the manufacturing process. Ideally, that data will show improvement over time, which can put investors at ease. 

The benefits of mass manufacturing don't happen overnight. Companies will often forecast cost reductions that can result from learning through manufacturing, but it might take longer than they expect. “Often it takes years, like a decade, to get there,” Werner said.

I find it wild that the BBC never mentioned the most glaring underbelly of this:New Brunswicks most significant employer for the past 100 years is Irving Oil & Irving Paper and Irving Forestry. They are different arms of a privately held family-run business, run by the descendants of the original founder (whose records are not as public as a traded company), in charge of the main industries of the province. They owned every newspaper in the province, and are known to be adversarial to any community paper, starting new papers just to drive out of business the small upstarts they don't own -- I've seen it play out in my community. People are literally afraid to criticize this family publicly, because they fund SO MUCH of the nonprofit sector. If you are trying to get a project off the ground, you can't look sideways at them or your project will be buried. And their papers certainly won't speak kindly of your criticism.And most glaringly, one of their ex-Vice Presidents was premier of the province during this time.So there is an extra level of concern that some locals have about the optics of the province shutting down the research.The Irving family is highly manipulative of political affairs, and imho have held the province back for decades (e.g. influencing what schools get funded/built, to create the working stock that support their businesses, etc)

The only common factor between these patients is Dr. Marrero.  It is notable that he is not the only physician who works in that clinic, but is the only one diagnosing this condition.  The most likely cause is weak diagnostic skills for challenging patients.Unfortunately, a majority of these patients likely have Functional Neurologic Disorder https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/conversion-di... , which is a horrible condition that accounts for a plurality of cases seen by most neurologists.  This phantom diagnosis will probably make recovery almost impossible for those people.  Acceptance of that diagnosis is the number 1 positive indicator for recovery.Source: I live in the canadian maritimes, and know many neurologists.

That'll definitely pause the rapidly progressing dementia and loss of muscle control in patients in their 20s.When doctors have no idea what something is and aren't willing to keep trying diagnostics and interventions, it's always “hey maybe get some more cardio and go easy on the peanut butter cups”.

For the longest time all my data said exercise more. That was expected since I literally didn't move all the way to a cardiac ward. Then all of a sudden it shifted to ‘exercise less, drink less coffee and sleep much more.'I understand why doctors fall into that blind spot. It was perfect advice for me for a long time and took a lot of failure (and remarkably bad coping mechanisms) for me to figure out.

- a casual diagnosis: your problem is caused by C- a syndrome: you have this collection of symptoms which often appear together, we don't know what causes it, we may have some treatments that can help.The difference between these two is often not communicated well, but they are valid diagnostic categories.There is a bigger problem with the third one:- we have done some  investigation and don't think further investigation is worth doing.This may be a correct judgment, or it may not. But it is not a property of the patient. Essentialising it to the patient is incorrect and potentially dangerous.

Tick Bourne diseases in Australia receive short shrift because ""they have never been seen here"" but there is no domestic testing regime, it's expensive, and treatment (long term antibiotics) run counter to general views on risk/reward issues.I'm not a health professional. I have a lot of respect for public health and epidemiology, the corner cases interest me. For ME, covid provided ""evidence"" which public health could use. Maybe for the NB thing something similar will emerge.

Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease is a prion disease [0] for which there is no definitive diagnosis in vivo. A confident diagnosis can be made only after examining brain tissue under a microscope.Prions are an unusual type of mis-folded protein that induce other proteins to take on a similar mis-folded shape when they come into contact with them. The mis-folded shape of the prion itself is what causes the mis-folding in adjacent proteins. It's a chemical-bonding thing at the molecular level. It's the shape of the prion that causes other proteins to take on a similar shape and become prions, etc.Some prion diseases occur spontaneously (when a protein takes on a mis-folded configuration due to mis-transcription or random energetic impulses) and some are transmitted, typically by eating some part of an animal that contains prions, which then end up in your own body, inducing proteins in your body to take on prion configurations.Prion diseases are the only known transmissible diseases that do not involve the replication of a pathogen's genetic material in a host cell. The only known prion diseases affect nervous tissues, and in humans the only known prion diseases affect brain tissues.I'm not an expert on prion diseases, but I've had a bit of a fascination with them since having to report on a bunch of USDA surveillance lectures on mad-cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE) and to summarize a bunch of symposia on prion diseases in a previous life. The symptoms reported in the article sound very much like a  prion disease, and the tests for CJD indicate that the doctors in the region suspect as much.But we simply don't have good tests for prion diseases in vivo. And prion diseases are not well understood in general, so it wouldn't be surprising that a new one would present as something of a mystery.It is also the case that I know very little about New Brunswick, but I will mention that prion diseases in humans are thought to be far more commonly acquired than spontaneous. The most common cause of acquisition is  eating animals with endemic prion diseases; this is most often nervous tissue of venison, but rarely nervous tissue of cattle infected with BSE, which is present in Canada more than anywhere else (by a small margin).It is also possible (but not likely) that a prion disease can arise de novo.0. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion_disease

I don't think that that's quite right. Over the past 15 years, only 3 cases have been reported in Canadian cattle [0], while Canada has over 12 million cattle at any given moment [1]. This organization claims that Taiwan, Greece, Ecuador, and Russia are all higher-risk [2].You could certainly argue that cases in animals could be under-reported, but human cases are much harder to hide, and only a total of 2 cases have ever been reported [3]. Canadians eat a lot of beef, so this suggests that the reported numbers for cattle are probably accurate, otherwise the human numbers would be much larger.However, a different neurological condition (Multiple sclerosis) is more common in Canada than anywhere else in the world [4], which might have some connection with the disease discussed in the article (but this is just a wild guess).[0]: https://inspection.canada.ca/en/animal-health/terrestrial-an...[1]: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=321001...[2]: https://www.woah.org/en/disease/bovine-spongiform-encephalop...[3]: https://health-infobase.canada.ca/diseases/cjd/dashboard.htm...[4]: https://globalnews.ca/news/4191203/multiple-sclerosis-canada...

There is a theory that spontaneous CJD can be spread environmentally. Apparently particles of sufficiently small size (10 nm) can pass from the nasal cavity directly into the brain via the olfactory nerve. And there was a cluster of CJD victims who were rose gardeners. Rose gardening commonly use Bone and Blood meal to feed the roses, and is typically made from cattle unfit for consumption-ie downer cows/BSE. I may have read about it in The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance Book by Laurie Garrett.

> some are transmitted, typically by eating some part of an animal that contains prions, which then end up in your own body, inducing proteins in your body to take on prion configurations.I wonder about this part. I thought consumed protein gets broken down into amino acids and new proteins are created later. Do prion proteins bypass this step?

But transmission of prions by ingestion is thought to be quite rare, as that mechanism suggests. Transmission by any means seems to be quite rare, even heritable transmission (e.g., vCJD). So that's why it seems unlikely that whatever is happening in New Brunswick is CVD.But if it's not some minor mass hysteria, then maybe prions.

At one point I checked into the ER with a resting heart rate around 200 BPM, and on some days my smartwatch couldn't even detect a pulse because it was racing so fast.I eventually recovered-though I still avoid wearing smart devices because seeing my heart rate triggers anxiety-but the whole period ended without a root cause and with me just being put on heartrate reducers for a while.I really feel for anyone dealing with ""mystery"" medical conditions. It's a tough place to be.

The fact that the investigation was disbanded simply because the patients had symptoms that can be tied to existing diseases is utterly asinine. As if there's no reason to investigate why so many people in such a small area have similar conditions, or even to investigate whether or not the demographics of the supposed cluster are out of the ordinary in the first place. Even if there was no related cause at all, such an investigation could be used to determine that Dr. Marrero was the cause of a problem and stop him from doing harm. But instead the result was that no satisfactory conclusion was reached for the majority of people, and the patients continue to suffer.These people need help and they are being failed by their doctors, their administrative officials and their representatives all at the same time.

One patient, whose brother, ironically, was a physician (and one skeptical of Morgellons as anything other than delusional parasitosis), seemed earnest, if intense, in describing how Morgellons had destroyed his quality of life... but then he started describing how he felt like he was able to inadvertently affect electronic devices, especially RF-based ones, because the Morgellons ""fibers"" in his extremities caused some kind of interference. At this point, he sounded squarely cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.However, one could very well imagine an infectious disease, with or without a dermatological component, causing delusional parasitosis. Maybe they have some virus or something that makes them think they have these ""fibers?"" Or a parasite? Toxoplasma gondii is known to affect inhibition. UTIs in the elderly are notorious for making them crazy.

I once had a woman and her husband visiting to inquire about buying a house I owned in Northern Groningen, pretty much as far away from anything as you could possibly get in this crowded country. They arrived in a taxi that was blanked for the day (it turned out the man was a cab driver) and after looking the place over and liking it visibly the woman said 'oh, we really like it, but there is one more thing, I am allergic to electromagnetic radiation so let me verify that' (eye roll by the man at this point). She went to the car and came back with a box with a dial on it that she had bought online (a pretty basic field strength meter, set to the most sensitive part of the range) and started walking around muttering to herself and waving the box around like a modern day dowser.After a while of this she came to me and said she was really sorry but she had to drop her interest because the house was absolutely infested with EM fields. In Amsterdam, where they lived, they had turned their whole apartment into a cage of Faraday with copper mesh nailed against every surface (it turned out they lived right opposite the KPN microwave tower next to the RAI so maybe she even had a point, that thing featured multiple RF links beaming 100's of Watts on tight beam links between other such towers, at some point in the past these carried our long distance phone calls before fiber came along).I asked if I could see her box for a second and pointed it at the sun: the needle pegged instantly and she was most surprised, so I explained that what she is measuring is real, but so faint that the chances of any kind of interaction with her body are most likely delusional.Here the conversation abruptly ended...As for TFA: prions, the agents responsible for CJD are remarkably resilient and annoying and can make it through the foodchain across the digestive barrier and into the brain and even a single one of them can cause CJD.https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease-cjd/

I appreciate your comment pointing to the importance of carefully evaluating individuals manifesting new onset delusional ideation or other ""mental"" disturbance. It might be associated with an obscure condition, but likely enough it's the result of common maladies.

Except what's more likely is that it's just psychological - which doesn't mean it doesn't have physiological treatments, it's just going to be for the psyche issue though.Put it another way: it's well recognized eating disorders exist. But they're psychological disorders: they respond to psychological interventions and treatments, and are curable, but can also ""spread"" in viral like ways - i.e. an eating disorder can be induced by environmental (peer group) factors.We don't generally posit that a virus spreads eating disorders, nor has any evidence of one been identified. And so in the same way, there's no reason to think Morgellons should have any underlying pathological cause that's any different, since none has been identified but we are aware of a number of psychological self-harm disorders (which can be amplified or spread sociologically but also just be unusual presentations of other conditions).

The article ends in a heart breaking way. The one woman is applying for MAID. I wonder if she had better care if she could have been properly diagnosed and treated. Instead, she is going to try to end her life.I think there's a real indictment here about how liberal Canada's MAID program is which the article glosses over.

I just checked, and Instagram's password reset flow allows requesting a reset using an email address, a phone number, or even the username [1]. The username is public information, so triggering password reset emails is relatively easy. At scale you would need IP rotation and some basic automation, but it is not particularly hard to generate a large volume of reset emails and create confusion.From an attacker's perspective, this does not grant access to accounts or sensitive data. It mainly causes users to receive unexpected reset emails and possibly panic or change their passwords. That aligns more with nuisance or malice than with a meaningful breach.I do not have definitive proof, but based on this behavior it seems plausible that the reported wave of reset emails could be explained without any large scale data leak.[1] https://www.instagram.com/accounts/password/reset/ (screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/4x5HPLx)

Yeah the source is terrible. I'd expect at least some sort of explanation on how they arrived at that conclusion, eg.

I've got an Instagram burner I literally never use. Never clicked weird links, never logged in anywhere sketchy, so a phishing compromise makes zero sense.

I've long-viewed password managers are mandatory. Every site get its own 20+ character randomly generated password. I don't care if the hash gets leaked. It's not getting cracked. For years this has been 1Password. Initially it was LastPass but 1Password is just more slick.The annoyance is all the arbitrary rules sites create about you have to use special characters or you can't or they have different, non-overlapping requirements on password length or the absolute worst is forced password rotation.I don't generally try and get non-tech friends and family use password managers however because it's still kinda clunky to use and generate. Passkeys are kinda better I guess? But they're far from universal and I don't expect them ever to be.Anyway, this kind of leak from Meta kinda surprises me. Leaking information that ties a physical address to an email address? That's a massive breach and not normally one you expect form a company employing thousands of engineers.I will say this: IG operates as its own domain within Meta and AFAIK they still use a completely separate code base in Python/Django. Facebook proper is in Hack (almost entirely) and has excellent tooling and systems to detect weak endpoints and PII leaks of this sort such that leaky endpoints (or however this information leaked; I didn't see any details in the article) really just don't happen.This has long been a point of friction within Meta engineerings. It's defensible to say it's not worth rewriting but IG are constantly playing catch up with what the rest of the company gets for ""free"". How many billion+ dollar settlements does it take before this equation changes?And yes I believe that leaking physical addresses is going to cost th ecompany more than a billion dollars. It may get people killed. That's how serious this is.

Personally I found this with running. It never became a consistent habit and something I looked forward to until I stopped thinking about where, when and how fast I was running and just did whatever I felt like. This realisation came after many years of trying and failing to stick to any kind of cardio exercise, and now a couple of years later I have a few half marathons under my belt and am training for my first marathon later this year. I attribute this entirely to the mindset change I described.

$218 cost of parts is about $130 cheaper than buying a similar desktop DIMM retail kit in the US.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A few weeks ago, we covered Russian enthusiasts' proposition of assembling their own DDR5 RAM using procured modules and PCBs to cut costs. At the time, it was just an idea put forth by a local modder, but now he's back with a finished build that successfully runs at 6400 MT/s. A single 32GB stick of desktop DDR5 memory with proper XMP support — one that doesn't even look homemade.

Modder VIK-on acquired the actual RAM chips from a couple of SK Hynix-branded 16GB laptop SO-DIMM sticks, priced at 8,000 Rubles (~$100) each, a bit cheaper than their desktop counterparts at the moment. The PCB was sourced from China for around 600 Rubles (~$7.50), while an aftermarket heatsink cost 415 Rubles (~$5.23) from AliExpress. From there, the process was as easy as just putting together the parts like Lego.

This is where we should probably interject and inform that soldering ICs is not a piece of cake, especially if reballing is involved. You need proper BGA reworking stations and a lot of skill to not mess this up. It might seem simple, but it's one of those delicate maneuvers that require ample experience, which VIK-on is brimming with.

After the new stick was ready, it was flashed with custom firmware from an Adata retail kit, allowing the memory to gain 6400 MT/s XMP support that any motherboard will be able to detect in BIOS. The entire project cost 17,015 Rubles, or about $218. That's quite a bit cheaper than a retail 32GB offering currently, which we found listed for at least $350 on Newegg right now. Prices are even rougher in Russia.

In the States, even if we don't take the 6400 MT/s speed into account, the cheapest 32GB stick goes for about $278, and that's an ugly, CL46 Dell OEM SKU. The RAM modules VIK-on used can be swapped with lower-cost parts, which the modder says he's exploring. For instance, instead of targeting 16GB laptop memory, 8GB sticks should be even cheaper.

At that point, one might even consider just using the SO-DIMM sticks as is with a desktop adapter that would add noticeable latency, but offer more convenience. This mod maintains signal integrity and also represents resilience. It's all about ingenuity in these trying times, and hacks like these will only increase in frequency (no pun intended) till markets normalize.

After a tumultuous spell at Arsenal, U.S. women's national team fullback Jenna Nighswonger has joined Aston Villa on loan.

The loan will run through the end of the season, with the Birmingham club also having an option to buy the 25-year-old.

Nighswonger has made just six appearances for the Gunners after arriving from Gotham FC in January 2025, playing only once this season.

Despite the lack of minutes since joining the reigning Women's Champions League winners, Aston Villa is excited about the prospect of Nighswonger joining its project.

""Everyone at Aston Villa is extremely excited to welcome Jenna to the club,"" said Director of Women's Football Marisa Ewers.

""We have been tracking her for some time and are delighted that she has bought into our exciting project.

""This signing forms part of our growing ambitions as we continue to build an exciting and competitive squad, and we believe Jenna will add real quality to the group and support our goals moving forward.""

Currently, the Villans sit in sixth place in the WSL standings, accumulating 16 points across 12 matches.

U.S. men's national team forward Ricardo Pepi is expected to undergo surgery on a broken arm on Sunday, an injury he suffered while playing for PSV Eindhoven on Saturday.

U.S. men's national team forward Ricardo Pepi is expected to undergo surgery on a broken arm on Sunday, an injury he suffered while playing for PSV Eindhoven on Saturday.

That could put in jeopardy Pepi's availability for the World Cup this summer.

It is not known for how long Pepi will be sidelined.

Pepi, 23, was injured while scoring PSV's second goal in 5-1 victory over Excelsior in the Dutch Eredivisie league play. He landed awkwardly, stayed on the field for a while before he was helped to the sidelines.

“It didn't look good right away, and at such a moment you would prefer to look the other way,” PSV head coach Peter Bosz reportedly said.

Pepi, who has scored 13 times in 34 international appearances, is contention for a spot on the U.S. team. He has found the net 11 times in 22 matches for PSV this season.

“Last January Ricardo was already out due to his knee injury,” Bosz said. “It won't last that long now, but unfortunately we lost him again. Pepi was on a good run, had a strong training camp and was all the way back. He became more confident and was in that good flow again.

“All signs were green for a strong second half of the season, so this is incredibly disappointing. First and foremost for him and obviously for us as well.”

Front Row Soccer editor Michael Lewis has covered 13 World Cups (eight men, five women), seven Olympics and 28 MLS Cups. He has written about New York City FC, New York Cosmos, the New York Red Bulls and both U.S. national teams and has penned a soccer history column for the Guardian.com. Lewis, who has been honored by the Press Club of Long Island and National Soccer Coaches Association of America, is the former editor of BigAppleSoccer.com.

U.S. men's national team striker Ricardo Pepi left Saturday's 5–1 PSV Eindhoven win over Excelsior Rotterdam with a fractured forearm and will undergo surgery, with his recovery expected to take two months. 

The 23-year-old attacker suffered the injury while scoring his side's second goal of the match in the victory, falling awkwardly to the ground on the goal line after barrelling the ball into the net. It marked his 13th goal of the season, before he was helped off in visible pain. 

While the injury comes at a poor time, considering his strong form with the Dutch Eredivisie leaders, he is not expected to miss the 2026 World Cup on home soil, which the USMNT kicks off on June 12 against Paraguay in Los Angeles.

However, he is now poised to miss the March friendlies against Belgium and Portugal, leaving only the May friendlies as preparation games for the tournament. Previously, USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino said the roster for that camp will not include more players than the final roster, leaving Pepi with little time to impress and earn a starting role. 

“It didn't look good right away and at such a moment you would prefer to look the other way,” said manager Peter Bosz, mentioning Pepi's injury history, which included a serious knee injury in January of the 2024–25 campaign, sidelining him for six months.

“Pepi was on a good run, had a strong training camp and was all the way back. He became more confident and was in that good flow again. All signs were green for a strong second half of the season, so this is incredibly disappointing. First and foremost for him and obviously for us as well.”

Pepi's injury puts him on a growing list of injured USMNT World Cup hopefuls, which also includes AFC Bournemouth midfielder Tyler Adams, who will miss the March friendlies.

Pepi's injury is a certain blow to Pochettino's attacking options when it comes to the most in-form players. Still, the USMNT has several strikers and offensive players it can turn to in March and potentially further. 

Up top, AS Monaco's Folarin Balogun scored his eighth goal of 2025–26 in a Coupe de France win against US Orléans and has the inside track to be the USMNT starter in the summer. At the same time, Josh Sargent and Patrick Agyemang have found form in the English Championship, with eight and six goals, respectively, across all competitions.

Following the March friendlies, the USMNT will take on Senegal and Germany in May and June to wrap up World Cup preparations, with Pepi hoping to be back in form and within those plans.

United States striker Ricardo Pepi suffered an ugly injury while playing for PSV Eindhoven.

During PSV's 5-1 win over Excelsior in the Dutch Eredivisie on Saturday, Pepi broke his forearm and will be sidelined for two months, the club announced.

Pepi, 23, suffered the injury after landing awkwardly while scoring his club's second goal midway through the first half.

According to ESPN, the club said that Pepi was taken to the hospital and is set to undergo surgery on Sunday.

“It didn't look good right away, and at such a moment you would prefer to look the other way,” PSV head coach Peter Bosz said, per ESPN.

Pepi's injury comes just five months before the U.S. Men's National Team kicks off its World Cup campaign against Paraguay, with the striker's availability now in question for the team's last friendlies against Belgium and Portugal at the end of March — right before head coach Mauricio Pochettino will name his roster for the tournament.

During his time with PSV this season, Pepi has scored 11 goals in 22 appearances and has been a steady presence for the club after suffering a knee injury in January 2025 which sidelined him for the second half of last season.

“Last January Ricardo was already out due to his knee injury,” Bosz added. “It won't last that long now, but unfortunately we lost him again. Pepi was on a good run, had a strong training camp and was all the way back. He became more confident and was in that good flow again.

“All signs were green for a strong second half of the season, so this is incredibly disappointing. First and foremost for him and obviously for us as well.”

For the USMNT, Pepe has scored 13 goals across 34 matches and was on the roster for U.S.' wins over Paraguay and Uruguay in November.

Magic of

the FA Cup

Macclesfield goalscorer Paul Dawson celebrates at the full-time whistle Michael Regan

At the end of Macclesfield's stunning 2-1 win against Crystal Palace in the third round of the FA Cup, their captain and player of the match, Paul Dawson, hoofed the ball away. Anywhere would do — and anywhere did.

The whistle went shortly after the midfielder, wrapped in a headbandage from a collision in the seventh minute, made contact with the ball.

The scoreline will forever read: Macclesfield 2-1 Crystal Palace. The sixth-tier National League North side, placed 117 positions below their Premier League opposition, produced the biggest FA Cup upset of all time.

The last time a non-league side knocked out the FA Cup holders was Palace themselves 117 years ago when, in the first round of the 1908-09 edition, they defeated Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Macclesfield's shock victory on Saturday was the first time in the competition's 155-year history that a sixth-tier side had beaten a top-flight one. It will go down as the greatest day in the club's history. And the fans at Moss Rose in the north-west of England could barely believe their eyes.

Paula Parks is a lifelong fan who attended the game with her husband, Colin, and their two sons, Mason, 10, and Dylan, 13. They celebrated Dawson's opening goal while still expecting to lose the game.

“It's just something you can't write. It's something we didn't even expect,” Parks said. “I've had butterflies, I've been crying. It's just absolutely fantastic. It felt like we were on top of the game rather than the underdogs.”

Asked where this day ranks in her life, Parks laughed, saying: “Not even the birth of my children or my wedding that I waited so long for (come close). This has got to be the top of it all, definitely.”

When supporters invaded the artificial pitch to celebrate at full time, Dawson was lifted into the air. It looked like a recreation of those iconic images of former England captain Bobby Moore after winning the World Cup in 1966. And fittingly, Macclesfield had just beaten a team with two players on the pitch, in Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton, who will likely be at this summer's World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico with England.

Dawson's orange armband was bright, but his wide smile was even brighter. On Tuesday, he had been shovelling snow off the pitch to ensure their sixth-tier match against Radcliffe went ahead. On Friday, he had been working packing boxes of candles and diffusers for Chloe Jade Home, a family-run business based in Cheshire. After work, he turned into ‘Postman Pat' as he hand-delivered new tracksuits to his team-mates.

Manager John Rooney, the younger brother of the former England and Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney, had to tell Dawson to climb down from a tractor shovelling snow on Tuesday and get some rest before the 2-1 win that night.

There was no resting on Saturday afternoon for any of Macclesfield's part-time players, who only train twice a week. They put in a tireless, gutsy display. Dawson, who sent Macclesfield into dreamland with that 1-0 lead at the break, was at the centre of it all.

“He (John Rooney) told me last week I'm two stone overweight and my best foot is my head,” Dawson, who scored a header, laughed as he spoke to the BBC at full time.

On Friday, as Dawson was boxing up those candles, centre-back Sam Heathcote was teaching PE at Stamford Park Primary School in Altrincham, just as he has done for the past five years. Heathcote was the player fixing Dawson's bandage right before he powered that header past Palace goalkeeper Walter Benitez. “I'll take the assist for that,” he said.

An assembly was held at his school on Friday in which his pupils wished him luck. He said the older kids understood it more and, like him, are used to watching the Palace players on television.

“I didn't expect to be going in on Monday having won, but it'll be really nice. I'll have a smile on my face for a long time,” Heathcote said.

Macclesfield owner Rob Smethurst will be the same. “I've lost my voice already, I have been screaming that much,” he told the BBC at half-time. “I might find myself in Ibiza by the end of the evening.”

Smethurst never expected Macclesfield to be leading against Premier League opposition at half-time in a cup game, let alone defeating them – but he also never expected to be the owner of a football club that five years ago had ceased to exist.

In September 2020, Macclesfield Town, as they were then known, were expelled from the National League after being liquidated. Unpaid debts of £500,000 ($670,000 at current exchange rates) sunk the club founded in the former mill town in 1874. Fans thought their club was gone forever until Smethurst came to the rescue — something he himself has little memory of.

It was four days of drinking, which Smethurst said led him to make a drunken decision to buy Macclesfield's stadium on the property website Rightmove. Smethurst might not remember making the business move, but he committed himself to it all the same. He spent the next few years investing heavily in the phoenix club, which was reborn as Macclesfield FC.

Former Wales international Robbie Savage was one of the people brought on board as a part-owner. Savage later became the director of football and there was a BBC documentary titled ‘Macclesfield: From The Ashes' that followed their journey, starting in the ninth tier in 2021. After three promotions in four years, including one with Savage as manager for the 2024-25 season, the town's beating heart has been restored.

With Savage moving on to manage Forest Green Rovers in the National League last summer, it was Rooney, then a Macclesfield midfielder, who Smethurst asked to take the reins. Six months into the job, Rooney, whose big brother was moved to tears on national television at full time, had to deal with an unforeseen tragedy in the team.

On December 16, Macclesfield striker Ethan McLeod was killed in a car accident while driving home from a game against Bedford Town. He was 21 years old.

Rooney, who shared a close bond with the former Wolves academy player, had to call each member of the squad to break the news to them.

“It is never, ever going to get easier,” Rooney said, dedicating the win to McLeod, whose parents were in attendance. “We spoke about him being here with us, I didn't want to say too much before the game to the lads because I didn't want to put a bit of extra pressure on them.”

After the match, McLeod's parents were waiting to embrace Rooney in his office. “That's something that's really special to me, knowing they were here with us. I'm sure Ethan was definitely looking down on us today.”

Rooney said the heartbreaking and unexpected loss of McLeod, who he brought to Macclesfield in July, completely tore through the club. This was just the fourth game the team have played since losing him and his No 20 shirt has been officially retired.

“I was thinking about it when the final whistle went, Ethan was here,” goalscorer Isaac Buckley-Ricketts told TNT Sports. Bedlam ensued after his backheeled flick crept across the line to make it 2-0 in the 61st minute. It was a goal Palace manager Oliver Glasner labelled “slapstick”.

Palace turned up as the FA Cup holders, wearing a golden kit with a special badge on the sleeve reserved for winners. They even played the game with a Mitre ball only the competition's winners are allowed to use.

“This gives us a responsibility to show our standards,” Glasner said about those details in the build-up to the game. “It doesn't mean we have to win it again, but it's to show our standards. I don't feel pressure, but responsibility.”

Glasner said that he expected his team to score five or six past the non-league side. Instead, they laboured and created little to trouble Max Dearnley in the Macclesfield goal, except for Yeremy Pino's consolation free kick in the 90th minute.

“That's the David against Goliath story,” Glasner said. “Everything (I could say to) try to explain the performance or find some excuses would be completely wrong. I have no words for this performance today and it's not just losing, it's almost creating no chances in the attack. This was really hard to watch.”

While Glasner said the Palace dressing room atmosphere was one of “every kind of emotion beside happiness”, the scenes in the Macclesfield one were mixed.

There was sadness and celebration as the parents of McLeod poignantly made their way around hugging every one of their son's team-mates and congratulating them on the win. McLeod's space in the dressing room lay empty, with a photo of him there in tribute.

Macclesfield celebrated the win in memory of McLeod, whose presence they all say was felt throughout the day. They belted out ‘Someone Like You' by Adele, now an FA Cup tradition, and sprayed champagne at each other. And Smethurst has promised a trip to Ibiza — not this weekend, but at some point in the future.

Now Macclesfield will enter Monday's fourth-round draw again as the lowest-ranked side in the competition. But after their convincing and hearty win over Palace, nobody will feel relieved to draw them. And their name will be drawn — they all made sure of that.","{'href': 'https://www.nytimes.com', 'title': 'The New York Times'}","soccer"

This will be unlike any other World Cup, but it won't be in Montreal. The city withdrew funding from its host bid over rising costs.

When 3,500 soccer fans swelled into the street outside Pub Burgundy Lion for its outdoor showing of the men's European Championship final between England and Spain, the pub's co-owner Toby Lyle had a problem.

Just minutes into the 2024 match, Lyle realized the satellite feed playing on a screen outside was delayed by about a minute behind the pub's broadcast on its TVs indoors – more than enough time for a cheer to steal a moment.

Quickly, he and his team moved to shut the pub's doors and windows, such that any roars or reactionary twists and turns from inside could give anything away.

It worked out.

As England's young Cole Palmer slotted a left-footed goal from outside the box, making it one apiece, Lyle was able to enjoy the moment twice. Flush in anticipation, he slipped outside and watched, a minute later, the thousands of fans erupt.

The British-style pub has been one of Montreal's unofficial soccer headquarters for nearly two decades. It has hosted prime ministers and mayors and even swatted off run-ins with Quebec's language watchdog. On big matchdays, like in the Euros, Lyle said fans line up as early as 6 a.m. Alcohol, however, cannot be served until 8 a.m.

“We have to explain it every time,” Lyle said. “Get your orders in. We'll start pouring at 7:45, and at eight on the dot, we drop it in front of you.”

It's that kind of fervour around what is, by audience and reach, the world's biggest sport that helps explain why Montreal's exit from bidding to host the sport's biggest competition, the 2026 FIFA World Cup, still rankles for Lyle.

“I think it's a crying shame,” he said.

The FIFA World Cup is coming to North America over June and July. It's the first World Cup to be jointly staged by Canada, the United States and Mexico. It will stretch across the continent, from Vancouver to Miami, Toronto to Mexico City.

And it will be unlike any other World Cup: 48 national teams instead of 32, 104 matches packed into 39 days, spread across three countries and multiple time zones.

Sixteen host cities were selected by FIFA. Toronto will stage six matches, Vancouver seven.

Lyle said some of his pals in Toronto are already seeing hotel prices surge north of $1,000 a night.

“This can be an unbelievable influx of cash,” he said.

But for Montreal, which had initially flirted with a bid that would have made it the only French-speaking city in contention, the effort fell through in 2021 after Quebec withdrew its financial support.

Caroline Proulx, the Quebec tourism minister at the time, said the province's share alone had doubled in less than three years, from $50 million to $103 million.

Montreal soon after withdrew its bid.

Moshe Lander, a sports economist, said Montreal made the right call.

“There's this myth that hosting these things makes money,” he said. “They don't.”

The city's experience with the 1976 Olympics looms over Montreal. That took three decades to pay off the debt it accumulated.

FIFA requires that World Cup matches have stadium seating of at least 40,000. In Montreal, that's a problem. Saputo Stadium has capacity for roughly half that. This means the only viable option was the Olympic Stadium. But the Big O is undergoing major refurbishments that have spiralled into costing hundreds of millions (and is still ongoing).

There's another problem with the Olympic Stadium: It wasn't designed with soccer in mind, meaning it would likely add even more costs to make adjustments, Lander said.

“And that's just Step 1,” Lander said. “Then you have security, transportation, policing. FIFA is far more demanding than the Olympics.”

Lander also questioned the potential benefits: How much of the promised tourism windfall will actually reach ordinary workers? The $1,000 a night a fan may pay to stay in a fancy hotel room will more likely enrich the shareholders than the bartenders or cleaners, he said.

The World Cup bid was already in motion when Valérie Plante's administration took office in 2017, said former Plante adviser Jimmy Zoubris.

The file, he said in an interview, was “sitting on the shelf.”

“And we said, ‘Yes, let's go for it.'”

And Plante was all for it, too. She said at the time that hosting would be “fabulous” for Montreal's international prestige.

At first, the structure appeared workable. It was a three-layer bid split between Ottawa, Quebec and Montreal, he said.

Zoubris said officials realized that FIFA's stadium requirements narrowed Montreal's options to Olympic Stadium, itself plagued by longstanding structural problems, or having to build a new stadium entirely.

As more detailed projections arrived, including the security burden, costs climbed further, he said.

“We started realizing this was going to cost quite a bit of money,” Zoubris said.

Then Quebec pulled out, and, crucially, the federal government said it was not willing to cover the remaining costs, Zoubris said. That meant Montreal would have to absorb Quebec's share.

At the time, the city was trying to get a grip on the budget, Zoubris added. So city officials started looking at options other than just hosting games.

One idea was hosting training camps, as a way to stay partially involved. But security demands would have tied up Montreal police and emergency services for nearly a month, Zoubris said. FIFA also wouldn't tell them which teams might train in the city, let alone whether the top players would follow their team.

“OK,” Zoubris recalled, saying the city went back to FIFA: “What do we get in return?”

FIFA's answer, he said: “Nothing.”

“Well, well, wait a second. If we're going to invest this type of money to have a camp here, can we have a couple of open camps? Can the players come to city hall, meet the fans?”

In the end, stadium uncertainty, unknown teams and escalating costs proved too much.

“Too many ‘ifs',” Zoubris concluded.

Toronto pushed ahead anyway, and Vancouver joined in. Toronto now estimates hosting will cost around $400 million, though that could increase. Vancouver's bill, too, ballooned. The boost to the Canadian economy is expected at more than a billion dollars, according to both cities.

Public opinion is less certain. About 70 per cent of Canadians believe hosting the World Cup is only worthwhile if the revenues it generates meet or exceed costs, according to a survey by Angus Reid Institute. One in five said it is not worth hosting at all.

Outrage also flared around the world recently when ticket prices were released, with fans accusing the sport's global governing body of a “monumental betrayal.”

FIFA has since slashed the price of some tickets to as low as $60 rather than highs upwards of $4,000, according to ESPN. FIFA said demand for tickets remains strong.

Last month, Prime Minister Mark Carney took the stage alongside Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and U.S. President Donald Trump for the tournament's draw, arriving amid geopolitical shifts and with Canada embroiled in an ongoing trade war with the U.S.

Trump even revived an old argument during the draw: North America should ditch the term “soccer” and call the sport “football,” as it is known elsewhere in the world. He even hinted that American football should be renamed altogether.

Politics aside, the World Cup will still deliver benefits for Montreal pubs, economist Lander said. Kickoff times will more likely suit local hours as it's being held in North America. Places like the Burgundy Lion are expected to be packed, he said.

Still, Lyle points to other cities facing economic challenges that found a way to host it.

“There's definitely a disconnect between the provincial government and the more immigrant, cosmopolitan part of Montreal,” he said. “The World Cup is the biggest sporting event on the planet, and we had a chance to be part of it.”

That chance, he added, is unlikely to return.

“Not in our lifetimes.”

As for Trump's football-versus-soccer debate, Lyle says he has a distinction.

“When I'm talking about the Canadian national team, I call it soccer,” he said. “When I'm talking about England, I call it football.”

So should American football be renamed?

“Oh my goodness,” Lyle said. “I can't comment on that.”

Australia have sent scouts across the US, Canada and Mexico to see which cities have the best facilities, hotels and general vibes to suit the team

Home is where the heart is, or at least where there is a good brew and a comfy bed. And with the 2026 World Cup six months away, key Socceroo figures have spent several weeks deep in a process that often flies under the radar but could be a secret ingredient in their quest to do something special: finding their home away from home for the global footballing showpiece.

Alongside the rest of the qualified nations, Australia submitted their preferred options for a North American base to Fifa earlier this week, with the governing body expected to assign base camps using a criterion of geography and world rankings by the end of January. Drawn to play games on the west coast, this means that Australia has 16 regionalised camps in the official Fifa brochure to consider. But they'll also sit behind host nations the United States and Canada, as well as higher-ranked Switzerland, Belgium and Iran in the pecking order.

Generally, all nations are led by similar principles when it comes to finding a base: the quality of the hotel and training facilities, the travel logistics, and the trade-offs between the two. For example, going off the brochure, the Socceroos could look to base themselves in the idyllic surroundings of Southern California, or nearby Tijuana, but this would be accompanied by at least a three-hour flight to their games in Vancouver and Seattle. Bases in Phoenix or Tucson would offer world-class facilities off the beaten track, but would also be buffeted by the fierce Arizonan heat.

An out-of-the-way home such as Boise or Salt Lake City would offer serenity and just a short flight to games, but would bring the challenge of a different time zone. Options in San Jose and Oakland wouldn't require a flight for the Socceroos' third game in San Francisco, but like the Californian options are in the public eye – and likely in high demand. Vancouver, Seattle and Tacoma are also well located, but with Canada already swooping in on the British Columbia base, they will also be hot properties.

“I prefer being in a smaller city [when] away,” says assistant coach Hayden Foxe. “We would prefer more privacy, especially when it comes to the base camp, where we can just put our minds on the job we need to do. You need some moments away where you can then relax and switch off for a certain period. And the quieter places, the more relaxed places you're able to do that, [compared with] something helter-skelter, where everything's going on and it can be distracting.”

For the detail-obsessed Tony Popovic, some locations are clearly going to line up with his preferences more than others. And that goes for other coaches too. South Korea's Hong Myung-bo, for instance, whose side will play their group stage games in Mexico, has emphasised the need to find a base that will allow high-altitude adaptation, while Scotland boss, Steve Clarke, wants a training camp somewhere “hot, sticky and humid” before heading to the north-east. France want to be based in New York but would need to negotiate access to the training facilities of one of its two MLS sides, according to L'Equipe, and though England had earmarked the somewhat central Kansas City as their preferred landing spot, they now risk losing that site to the Netherlands.

Initially anticipating heading east or centrally, Socceroos and Football Australia staff spent December crisscrossing the west coast, with everything from training pitches and hotels right down to small details being exhaustively pored over. Quality of sleep and diet are two of Popovic's most strident expectations, elite performance demanding elite preparation. This meant that things as small as the quality of the pillows in potential lodgings were looked at, as well as the what produce would be available to team chef, Vini Capovilla.

With the Socceroos potentially six weeks or more in their base, creature comforts and the need to maintain good vibes are included, too. And coffee. The team flew in their own barista and beans for Qatar, and that the players are supplied with a list of quality roasters when they travel to a new city shows just how important caffeine is to morale. The heightened security and demands of a World Cup will prevent the same level of wanderingthey're allowed on the road – Harry Souttar and Riley McGree bought cowboy hats in Dallas in 2023 – and staff are aware of the need to find a base where the squad can be at ease and minimise cabin fever.

“The process is a lot,” Foxe says. “You have restrictions, what you can do, what hotels you can go to, what training facilities you can go to, what the budget of the team is, and where the players would prefer. Is it a bigger city or a smaller city? Is it altitude? What's the time difference? How far is it to fly? What's the culture of that city? Which one would suit you, as Australians?

“There's of lot of different details, and there's a lot of groundwork. There's a lot of travel, there's a lot of looking, there's a lot of meetings. We get everything crossed.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

3 Trending Rentals in Georgia That People Book on Repeat (And We See Why)

Attending a World Cup match is a lifelong dream for many soccer fans. If you fall into this category, you're likely excited about the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup. This event will be special, as three countries (Canada, Mexico, and the United States) will host it, providing people a greater chance of catching at least one match. In the U.S., matches will happen across eleven cities, including beautiful Atlanta.

The Georgian capital will witness seven matches that will be played at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium between June 15 and July 7, 2026. Fans hoping to go to any of these matches should book accommodations as soon as possible, since many hotels and home rentals are already sold out for that time period. Sure, you'll probably find something somewhere in the city even if you book late, but anything that's close to the stadium likely won't have availability. Instead of dealing with traffic, parking, and overpriced Ubers, check out these four Airbnbs that are perfect for World Cup fans. They're all within walking distance of the stadium, and still have most or all of the Atlanta match dates open for booking.

World Cup match tickets are very expensive. For Atlanta, they cost between $1,450 and $2,250, leaving little space left in many fans' budgets for accommodations. If this is the case for you, and you're traveling alone or with one other person, consider this affordable one-bedroom apartment that costs $471 per night. That's a pretty good price, especially since it's close enough to the stadium that you'll be able to reach it on foot. Although the apartment is within a larger house, it has a separate private entrance. Don't expect a five-star experience. You won't have a kitchen or much space for hanging out, but you'll be safe and comfortable, which is what really matters. Take this as an opportunity to spend less time at the apartment and more time exploring cool attractions like the Atlanta Beltline urban trail, the Georgia Aquarium, or the expansive Piedmont Park.

If you're coming in a group of up to five people, this two-bedroom house is a great accommodation option. The stadium is around 0.5 miles, or a ten-minute walk away. Can't leave Fido behind? That's no issue at all, as pets are welcome at the house with prior approval. You'll have a full kitchen and other basic essentials to make your trip a bit easier. The property isn't overly fancy, yet it has great reviews (4.89 stars from 189 reviews), and only costs $695 per night. Its only issue might be that there are only two beds, so the fifth person will have to sleep on the sofa.

Find 5 Bucket-List-Level Views in Georgia Without Needing to Be an Expert Hiker

Soccer fans looking to actually spend time at their Airbnb will want a cozy place like this three-bedroom house with a backyard. The space holds six guests, has two bathrooms, and offers a fully-equipped kitchen that will help you reduce meal expenses during the trip.

Rather than spending time in traffic, you can plan a BBQ in the communal fire pit that's shared with neighbors, or chill in the backyard until it's time to head over to the stadium. Just be aware that the yard space is not fenced in, so it's not completely private. At about $1,173 per night for the World Cup dates, this is the most expensive of our recommended rentals. The high price is to be expected, given that Atlanta is one of 2026's hottest destinations.

Groups of friends coming together to catch the FIFA World Cup matches in Atlanta can stay in this four-bedroom house that fits eight guests. With five beds and three full bathrooms, the rental is ideal for large groups who want to avoid fights over who gets to shower first.

Reports from around the world point to Kansas City being a hot base camp choice among World Cup powerhouses. 

On Friday, Daily Mail UK reported England has Kansas City high on its list of preferred base camps. 

It follows a report by TyC Sports out of Buenos Aires, that Argentina would like to set up camp in KC for the World Cup.

If the reports come to fruition, Kansas City could be the host to two of the best teams in the world. With the teams would come dozens of media members chronicling the teams' experiences in Kansas City to readers around the world. In addition, thousands of fans are expected to stay close to their favorite teams, meaning KC could see an even higher number of visitors. 

Pam Kramer with KC2026 said they're optimistic to fill all three of their base camps, and hoping to get multiple Pot 1 teams. 

""It's possible to get more than one Pot 1 team,"" Kramer said. ""I think we are better positioned to do that than any other host city, because of our facilities and our location and the way that we are unified and presenting ourselves when they visit.""

Kramer said FIFA pairs teams with base camps based on the country's preferences, location of the team's World Cup matches and world rank. 

""If there is more than one Pot 1 team that wants a location then they look at who is playing in Kansas City, those teams have priority since they want to minimize travel,"" Kramer said. ""Then if there is more of those teams then it would go to rank order.""

Argentina is second and England is fourth in the FIFA Men's World Rankings. 

Other Pot 1 teams have visited the Kansas City metro. In December, KMBC9 reported Portugal and Germany, along with England and Argentina, had visited Rock Chalk Park.

Arsenal hire new throw-in coach who worked with Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/mikel-arteta-s-secret-weapon-arsenal-hire-new-throw-in-coach-who-worked-with-jurgen-klopp-at-liverpool/blt1335c7b25f66efc2","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 10:36:00 GMT","

Arsenal have hired former Liverpool throw-in coach Thomas Gronnemark as the club aim to strengthen their bid to win the Premier League title. The Gunners have considerable set-piece prowess, and have now recruited another expert in the field. 

Per the Standard, Arsenal have recruited Gronnemark as they aim to end a Premier League trophy drought that stretches back to 2004. The Gunners are one of the most dangerous teams from set-pieces in England, scoring 12 goals from dead-ball situations. They currently sit six points clear of Manchester City at the top of the table, and Arteta is clearly seeking to maximise any potential marginal gains, with Gronnemark regarded as one of the world's foremost experts when it comes to throw-ins. 

Gronnemark spent five years in the backroom team of Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool, joining the club in 2018, the season in which the Reds won the Champions League. He was previously an athlete in his native Denmark, and actually held the world record for the longest throw-in. His sport of choice, however, was bobsleigh, and he represented his country for four years. His role at Liverpool was his first in England, and he is said to be particularly adept at teaching teams how to retain possession and build attacks from throw-in situations. 

Arteta has previously explained that he became aware of how set-pieces could be vital to a team's success, saying: ""Ten years ago. I wasn't here, but 10 years ago, I said 'it is a massive thing to do that' and I started to have a vision, try to implement a method and try to be surrounded by the best people to deliver that.""

Gronnemark spoke about the importance of throw-ins when explaining why he was recruited by Klopp at Anfield. 

Speaking in 2024, he said: ""He (Klopp) called me and said 'Liverpool have had a great season, but we were so bad at throw-ins'.

""He'd been reading about me in the German newspaper Bild and that's the reason he called me.

""When I came, data showed that Liverpool were 18th in the Premier League for throw-ins under pressure. In my first season, we improved from 45.4% to 68.4% and went from 18th to number one.

""People might think it's only throw-ins, but there's approximately 40-60 throw-ins in a match and they use up 20 minutes. It's a gigantic thing in football. People have been neglecting this for many years.""

He added:  ""I was totally in shock when Jurgen called me.

""I was visiting a chocolate shop with my family; I saw the +44 and thought it was an English guy trying to sell me pens. I listened to the voicemail and it was a message from Jurgen. I tried to call him back, but he didn't pick up.

""My heart was just pounding... I took the call on my way home in the car, where I drove directly into a grass field when he called. He told me that he was sitting in a beach chair, reading the German newspaper Bild while on vacation in Tenerife, and he came across an article about me... he had never heard of a throw-in coach before.""

First-team stars convinced Red Devils captain is set to leave Old Trafford","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/bruno-fernandes-quit-man-utd-first-team-stars-convinced-red-devils-captain-leave-old-trafford/bltfd8b02e9ceae92a6","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 08:26:47 GMT","

Bruno Fernandes' Manchester United team-mates 'fear' the Portuguese has had enough of the turmoil going on at Old Trafford and will quit the Red Devils for pastures new after the World Cup this summer. The 31-year-old previously claimed he was ""hurt"" and ""sad"" that the club were willing to sell him last year and team-mates reportedly would not blame him if he were to move on at the end of the season.

Reported by The Sun, team-mates believe that Fernandes will depart Old Trafford in 2026 and put an end to a seven-year stay with the Red Devils amidst a belief that he has ‘had enough of the shambles' at Old Trafford.

The 31-year-old Portuguese has been United's best player ever since he joined the club in January 2020 and his current deal ends in June 2027, meaning that this summer represents one of the club's final opportunities to sell the playmaker and make a return on the initial £47million ($62.9m) they paid Sporting Lisbon for his services.

The United skipper admitted in November that former boss Ruben Amorim persuaded him to stay last summer despite the club's wishes for him to go. With Amorim now sacked and a new cloud of uncertainty hanging over the club's managerial situation, Fernandes is reportedly ready to call it a day at Old Trafford and move on to pastures new, according to sources.

A source told The Sun: “Some of the squad think Bruno has had enough and, to be honest, they don't blame him.

“He always gives 100 per cent and has been the club's best player since he joined. But they think that he feels let down under the new ownership model and Amorim leaving has not helped. He isn't a likely candidate for a big-money move to Saudi because he's a football purist. But no one can doubt from the moment he signed for Manchester United, he has given his all.

“No one wants him to leave — but his team-mates would understand if he did.”

Part of Fernandes' desire to leave is believed to be linked with the Red Devils' willingness to let him go last summer, and the after-effects of a situation which “hurt” him deeply.

The Portuguese told Canal 11 in his home nation in a bombshell interview publicised in December: “From the club's side, it felt a bit like, ‘if you leave, it's not so bad for us.' It hurts me a bit.

“More than hurting, it makes me sad because I'm a player who has nothing to criticise. I'm always available, I always play, good or bad. I give my all. But it gets to a point where, for them, money is more important than anything.

“The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head. I told the directors that, but I think they didn't have the courage to make that decision, because the manager wanted me. If I had said I wanted to leave, they would have let me go.

“Lately I feel like I'm on thin ice. In England, when a player starts approaching 30, they start thinking they need a makeover. It's like the furniture. The issue of loyalty isn't viewed the same way it used to be.

“I could have left in the last transfer window. I would have earned much more money. I was going to leave a season ago – I won't say where – but I would have won many trophies that season. I decided to stay because of family reasons, but also because I genuinely love the club. The conversation with the manager also made me stay.”

Fernandes is reported to have a £57m ($76m) release clause in his contract which becomes active to overseas clubs next summer.

While the player has claimed that he will not think about his future until after the World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico, team-mates reportedly already believe he has made his mind up.

Fernandes recently returned from three matches on the side-lines with a hamstring injury and has bagged 103 goals and 94 assists during his time at United, five and eight already this season, respectively. He would undoubtedly be a massive miss if he ultimately were to depart in 2026.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Portugal reveal World Cup plan as Roberto Martinez talks past benching of CR7 and benefits of USMNT friendly","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/cristiano-ronaldo-competition-portugal-world-cup-plan-roberto-martinez-benching-cr7-benefits-usmnt-friendly/bltc0da54e913460a0d","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:50:40 GMT","

Cristiano Ronaldo will face added competition for places at the 2026 World Cup, Portugal boss Roberto Martinez has revealed. Evergreen 40-year-old CR7 is heading to that tournament, with another birthday being passed along the way, but is not expected to play every minute of every game - despite being captain of his country. Martinez is planning to take three strikers with him to the United States, Canada and Mexico.

One of those will be Ronaldo, as long as the Al-Nassr frontman steers clear of injury. Another spot will be filled by Paris Saint-Germain star Goncalo Ramos - with it him who stepped in for Ronaldo when an iconic compatriot was benched at the 2022 World Cup.

CR7 is reluctant to take any backwards steps, or fill a support role, but must accept that he needs to be managed carefully in the latter stages of his record-shattering career. With that in mind, and sweltering temperatures being predicted at a major international tournament this summer, Martinez is eager to ensure that he is not left short in an important area of the field.

He has told the Lusa news agency: “The door to the national team is always open, but the competitiveness makes it very difficult to get in. But, at the moment, we think we need a third striker and that this will be an important position for the World Cup.”

Martinez added when asked about predecessor Fernando Santos' decision to rotate Ronaldo out of his plans at the last World Cup: “What happens around Cristiano is a historical aspect. He's a world football icon, but that doesn't condition or limit our work. Cristiano is very calm and very focused on the day-to-day, and that's a simple formula. When Cristiano Ronaldo is doing well, it's very important for the national team.”

Portugal should be full of confidence after winning the 2025 UEFA Nations League and securing automatic qualification for another World Cup. They have pre-tournament friendlies in place, with two of those taking them to Mexico and the U.S. in March.

Martinez said of how important those fixtures will be: “We have several profiles and the March stage will be very important in that regard.

“This World Cup will be complex and demanding for the European teams. Therefore, this training camp will be very important, first for playing at altitude in Mexico, and then in an indoor stadium against the USA. We thought we should try this before the World Cup, and for us it's the perfect preparation.”

Martinez has previously overseen quests for global glory with Belgium and believes he will have Portugal well prepared for the many challenges that they face. The 52-year-old said: “This will be my third World Cup, and I've learned that nobody arrives as a champion team. You need to grow during the first three games and do everything to ensure our players are comfortable throughout the tournament.

“We don't have a history in World Cups, and that's part of our psychological preparation. We need to go step by step and make the players believe that we can truly win the World Cup.”

Martinez's contract is due to expire when the 2026 finals end, but he is giving little thought to his long-term future. He said: “That's not my concern right now. My focus is on the World Cup. I'm very happy with the work we're doing and with the support from the federation. We're all in this together for the next challenge.

“The goal is the 2026 World Cup, and then we'll talk about the future. I love Portugal and I love working with the national team. My job and my focus are on making history so that these achievements will be talked about for the next 15, 20 years.”

Portugal have been placed in Group K at the 2026 World Cup, which will be staged across Houston and Miami. They will open against the winners of the intercontinental play-off (Jamaica, New Caledonia or Democratic Republic of Congo) before going on to face Uzbekistan and Colombia.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Arsenal player ratings vs Portsmouth: Hat-trick hero Gabriel Martinelli gets Gunners into FA Cup fourth round as 'Set-Piece FC' flex their muscles to survive scare","https://www.goal.com/en-qa/lists/arsenal-player-ratings-hat-trick-hero-gabriel-martinelli-gets-gunners-into-fa-cup-fourth-round/bltad868f05c64a19ef","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:57:32 GMT","

Arsenal earned a safe passage into the fourth round of the FA Cup for the first time since 2022-23 with a 4-1 win over Portsmouth on Sunday. Gabriel Martinelli scored an all-important hat-trick, while Andre Dozzell scored an own goal, as the Gunners maintained their push for a first piece of silverware since winning the same competition six years ago.

Hoping to follow in the footsteps of Wrexham and Macclesfield by causing another seismic shock in football's oldest competition, Portsmouth broke the deadlock after just three minutes when Colby Bishop pounced on Kepa Arrizabalaga's weak save to score the fifth FA Cup goal of his career. However, the hosts' lead only lasted five minutes as Arsenal's set-piece prowess came to the fore once again, although Christian Norgaard was denied what he thought was a first goal for the club as Portsmouth's Dozzell was adjudged to have bundled Eberechi Eze's corner into his own net.

The record 14-time FA Cup winners eventually went in front from another corner - this time Noni Madueke's in-swinger was headed home by Martinelli, who bounced back from the criticism he received in Thursday's Premier League draw with Liverpool after shoving the stricken Conor Bradley.

Pushing to open up a two-goal buffer before half-time, Martinelli hit the post when it looked easier to score, before Madueke won the visitors a penalty after drawing a foul from former Arsenal youth player Zak Swanson. However, the winger was far too casual with his stuttered run-up, curling the ball past the post after initially sending Portsmouth goalkeeper Josef Bursik the wrong way.

Looking to call upon the spirit which has seen them lose just one of their last five games in England's second tier, Portsmouth came close to making it 2-2 when Conor Chaplin found himself free at the back post, but his driven effort was well blocked by Arsenal defender Ben White. And that missed opportunity soon proved costly for John Mousinho's side as some clever thinking from Myles Lewis-Skelly saw the left-back slip a quick free-kick into the path of Gabriel Jesus, whose stunning, low cross was converted at the far post by Martinelli after 53 minutes.

Aiming to stave off the threat of a late comeback from Portsmouth, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta soon brought on experienced duo Jurrien Timber and Martin Odegaard, while Kai Havertz also made a first appearance since suffering a serious injury at the start of the season. And the north Londoners soon made it a hat-trick of goals from corners as Madueke and Martinelli combined once again - the latter heading home for his third of the afternoon with just 18 minutes of normal time left to play.

GOAL rates Arsenal's players from Fratton Park...

Kepa Arrizabalaga (5/10):

Returning to duty as Arsenal's goalkeeper for domestic cup competitions, the Spaniard will be disappointed with his role in Portsmouth's opener, palming the ball straight into the path of Bishop. However, he was able to put that mistake behind him, going on to make four saves as the hosts failed to find a second.

Ben White (7/10):

Making his first appearance in 2026, the defender thought he set up Martinelli with the scoreline 1-2, only for his team-mate to strike the post from close range. He then made a terrific block to deny Portsmouth's Chaplin in the early stages of the second half.

Christian Norgaard (6/10):

Operating as an emergency centre-back, the Dane failed to track Bishop on two occasions as Portsmouth took an early lead. However, he was able to recover by playing a significant role in helping Arsenal draw level just five minutes later - though he wasn't awarded the goal.

Gabriel Magalhaes (5/10):

While the Gunners' defensive lynchpin was generally composed throughout, he surprisingly won just 13 per cent (1/8) of his aerial duels.

Myles Lewis-Skelly (7/10):

Replacing the injured Hincapie at left-back, the England international showed great instincts to play a quick free-kick into Jesus, who teed up Martinelli for Arsenal's third.

Ethan Nwaneri (5/10):

Handed his first start since early November, the midfielder - on his FA Cup debut - was unable to seize the opportunity to shine, failing to create a single chance in almost 70 minutes of play.

Mikel Merino (8/10):

Often deployed as a striker this season, the stand-in captain was handed a midfield shift on the south coast and he excelled, particularly with his passing from deep.

Eberechi Eze (6/10):

Returning to the FA Cup for the first time since scoring the winner in last season's final, the midfielder curled in the corner which brought about Arsenal's leveller, in an otherwise quiet display.

Noni Madueke (7/10):

It was a mixed bag from the winger, who lost possession in the build up to Portsmouth's opener before making amends with the assist for Arsenal's second. He then won a first-half penalty for his side after a brilliant burst of pace, only to miss the target with the resulting spot-kick. The 23-year-old went on to record his second assist of the afternoon - once again setting up Martinelli with a brilliant in-swinging corner.

Gabriel Jesus (7/10):

Looking to build on his recent goal against Aston Villa in the league, the striker was much more lively after the interval, registering the assist for Martinelli's second with a superb cross.

Gabriel Martinelli (9/10):

After causing a stir in Thursday's clash with Liverpool, the forward rose highest at the near post to head Arsenal in front after 25 minutes. After passing up the chance to bag another in the first half, hitting the post with the goal gaping, he eventually scored his second when he met Jesus' teasing cross before the hour mark. The 24-year-old then completed his hat-trick with a late header from yet another corner.

Kai Havertz (6/10):

Making his long-awaited return from injury, the forward picked up some clever positions as Arsenal romped to victory in the second half.

Jurrien Timber (6/10):

Replacing White at right-back, the ex-Ajax man never put a foot wrong, completing 100% (24/24) of his attempted passes.

Martin Odegaard (6/10):

Alongside Timber and Havertz, the midfielder was calmness personified on the ball as Portsmouth were completely shut out of the final 20 minutes of action.

Marli Salmon (N/A):

With Arsenal home and hosed, the 16-year-old was introduced in the dying embers of the game.

Martin Zubimendi (N/A):

A late, late substitute for Arsenal.

Mikel Arteta (7/10):

Making 10 changes to the side that drew with Liverpool in midweek, the Arsenal boss will be absolutely delighted with the performances of impressive duo White and Martinelli. However, the Spaniard will be equally disappointed with Nwaneri and Eze, with the pair struggling to sparkle in midfield.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

USMNT star Tim Weah has explained why he is embracing an “us against the world mentality” at Marseille. The United States international, who began his professional career with Paris Saint-Germain, returned to France in the summer of 2025. He is now turning out alongside ex-Manchester United star Mason Greenwood and enjoys filling the role of villains in Ligue 1.

Marseille boast a passionate fan base, with Stade Velodrome left rocking when the team are playing well, but divide opinion across the rest of France. They boast little support among neutrals, but make no apologies for who and what they are.

Weah has slotted seamlessly into that fold. The 25-year-old winger is happy to operate in a “bubble” and knows that he can always call upon full backing from those in the stands and those playing by his side.

It was that united front which convinced Weah that Marseille would be his best port of call when seeing exit doors open up at Serie A giants Juventus. He spent two seasons in Italy, having joined the Bianconeri from Lille in 2023.

Weah has told Le Dauphine Libere of life on the Mediterranean coast: “I put myself in my own bubble… but it's also a thrill, an honour. Playing in a stadium full for every match, with the shouts of the fans, is special. There aren't many similar stadiums in the world.

“I really want to succeed here. In France, all the other clubs, all the other fans are against OM. We are opposed everywhere and I like this aspect of being alone against everyone.”

While Marseille fans pride themselves on being unique and a law unto themselves, they can be found well outside the south of France. Weah has found that out during his travels around the country.

He added on spending time back in the French capital, where he graduated out of the academy system at PSG: “It's funny, I run into more OM supporters than PSG supporters in Paris. Every time I go back up there to see friends, I meet OM fans. That's also what shocked me. It's incredible. We're everywhere!”

Weah joined Marseille on an initial season-long loan agreement. That deal includes an obligation to buy that is set to be triggered. A €14.4 million (£13m/$17m) fee will change hands, with his full transfer package potentially landing Juve close to €20m (£17m/$23m) if certain performance-related add-ons are met.

Weah was linked with a move to the Premier League when Juve opened themselves up to offers. He is said to have shunned interest from Nottingham Forest while waiting on rival bids. That decision is being justified, with Weah confident that he made the right career call.

He said when retracing steps to France: “There were other clubs, but as soon as they [Marseille] called me, there was only one club. For me, it's perfect. There's competition. We know the stadium and the fans.”

Weah was asked to put his versatility to good use with Juve, as he filled a wing-back role at times, but has been pushed further forward by Marseille. He has taken his tally of senior international caps to 47.

He added on his favoured position, with there a willingness on his part to play wherever he is required: “I don't have a favourite position when I arrive at a new club. The coach sees me as a utility player. All I want is to win.”

Weah has registered two goals for Marseille through 21 appearances. His first strike for new employers was recorded in the iconic surroundings of Santiago Bernabeu during a Champions League clash with Real Madrid.

He has continued to impress alongside Greenwood and Co, with the expectation being that he will form part of the USMNT's plans when they take in a home World Cup this summer - with head coach Mauricio Pochettino able to select a number of players that are plying their trade at the highest level in Europe.

West Ham defender Konstantinos Mavropanos had to be stretchered from the field after suffering a worrying head injury in the Hammers' FA Cup third-round clash with Queens Park Rangers. The former Arsenal centre-half formed part of a nasty collision late in the first half, leading to him requiring lengthy treatment on the field and urgent medical attention off it.

The 28-year-old was left in a heap on the turf after competing for the ball in a crowded penalty area. There were 39 minutes on the clock when he appeared to be shoved by QPR goalkeeper Joe Walsh.

As Mavropanos crumpled to the deck, through no real fault of his own, his head collided with a defender's knee on the way down. It immediately became clear that the Greece international had suffered more than a minor bump.

Hammers physios were quick to join him on the field, with further assistance being sought in the form of a stretcher. Mavropanos was placed into a neck brace before being carefully carried down the tunnel at the London Stadium.

It is claimed that Mavropanos was conscious when leaving the pitch, with concussion protocols now having to be followed. He was replaced at the time by West Ham's new signing Pablo Felipe.

Both sets of fans applauded him off the field, with it obvious that the powerful defender was in some discomfort. With it taking a while for medics to ready Mavropanos for his removal, nine minutes of stoppage time were added to the end of the first half.

QPR sent a message of support to a stricken rival on social media when posting: “Into added time after lengthy treatment for West Ham's Mavropanos. We wish him well.” It was during those extra minutes that Crysencio Summerville opened the scoring and fired West Ham in front.

That effort was cancelled out in the 65th minute when Richard Kone netted for the visitors, with more problems at the back being endured by a West Ham side that find themselves languishing in the Premier League relegation zone. The tie eventually went into extra time, and West Ham regained the lead in the 98th minute via a Valentin Castellanos header.

Mavropanos has figured in 14 top-flight fixtures for the Hammers this season, but has been unable to prevent them from shipping goals at an alarming rate. It remains to be seen when he will be available for selection again.

He moved to east London in the summer of 2023 for £19 million ($25m), having previously taken in eight appearances for Arsenal. He will be eager to ensure that West Ham do not slip into the Championship.

Pressure has been mounting on manager Nuno Espirito Santo, with uncomfortable questions being asked of his future. Extra-time against QPR is the last thing that he needed, with the Hammers set to be back in Premier League action on January 17 when taking in a trip to Tottenham.

Hubert Hurkacz capped an emotional injury comeback and erased two years of United Cup final heartbreak when he spearheaded Poland's tight championship victory over Switzerland at the mixed teams event in Sydney Sunday night.

Playing his first tournament in seventh months following knee surgery, the former World No. 6 needed a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 win over Stan Wawrinka to keep his team alive after Iga Swiatek's earlier 3-6, 6-0, 6-3 loss to Belinda Bencic, who finished the tournament with a 5-0 singles record. 

With the title on the line, Jan Zielinski was again large and in charge as he partnered Katarzyna Kawa to their fifth mixed doubles win, 6-4, 6-3, over the previously undefeated Jakub Paul and Bencic, who was trying to finish the tournament with a perfect 10-0 record in match play. Bencic was named United Cup Finals Most Valuable Player.

It was an emotional night for 40-year-old Swiss captain Wawrinka, who was hoping to begin his farewell season with an unexpected United Cup title. A courageous Wawrinka played four three-set matches throughout the event but ultimately walked away with just one victory in his five singles appearances. 

“I'm kind of speechless. It's really incredible,” Hurkcaz said. “Obviously personally, but also a massive day for Poland, for Polish tennis. We showed how strong we are as a Polish country in tennis. To win that trophy, it tastes incredible. After we came very close two times. 

“Just so grateful to the whole team, everyone supporting each other, just being together and enjoying the competition.”

“Finally, we made it, third time lucky,” Swiatek said during the trophy ceremony. “I really felt it was a team effort this year. Hubi, what a comeback after so many months. You played amazing. You inspired us all with determination. I feel you improved every part of our game. Our doubles team, wow! You just beat everyone. It was amazing.”

“This moment is so bittersweet,” Bencic said. “We can be so proud of ourselves and we really deserve to celebrate this. It was truly one of the best weeks of my life.""

Hurkacz dropped 18 aces on Wawrinka and saved eight of the nine break points he faced, highlighting the lone chink in the 40-year-old's armour this week. Although he claimed a critical break en route to winning the second set, the three-time Grand Slam champion converted just two of 23 break point opportunities across his five singles matches. 

Hurkacz won four of his five singles matches this week – including two Top 10 victories over Alexander Zverev and Taylor Fritz – in his first appearance since June last year. 

The 28-year-old found redemption after two heartbreaking near misses in the past two United Cup finals. In 2024 he held two championship points before falling to Zverev. Last year Fritz denied him in a third-set tie-break. 

“He's definitely an inspiration. I was growing up watching him play, compete and win so much,” Hurkacz said after beating Wawrinka. “Obviously his game style is really powerful. The shots that he can pull off sometimes, you can really admire them even when you are on the other side of the net. 

“It's a bit annoying sometimes when they come up with [those shots]. Good times for him, bad times for me, but it's a pleasure to compete against him.”



In the first match of the day Bencic's continued her unbeaten run with a 3-6, 6-0, 6-3 comeback win over Swiatek.

“It's always a challenge playing against her and every time I play her, I look for ways to improve and make her life a bit more difficult,” Bencic said on court. “I think the difference today was I played very freely, I was really enjoying myself out on the court and I was just really going for it.”

Bencic won 12 of the final 15 games, earning her second victory over the World No. 2. The first set seemed the tie's first match was going to belong to Swiatek, but the pendulum quickly shifted the momentum into Bencic's favor.

Swiatek started strong early, holding serve in the opening game with four straight points followed by the match's first break and another hold. With Swiatek up 3-0, Bencic settled into the match, winning two consecutive games of her own, cutting the deficit to 3-2 after a backhand winner on the third break point.

The World No. 2 eventually closed out the set, winning three of the next four games, including two breaks of Bencic's serve. Winning the set 6-3, Swiatek hit a crosscourt backhand winner that the Swiss could not reach.

The second set, however, would feature Bencic domination. Bencic started the second set winning nine consecutive points, and in the third game, she saved two break points. The following game, she'd earn the crucial break on the third chance and finished the set in 33 minutes.

“To be honest, I felt I was in the match from the very first point,” Bencic said. “I thought I was going great and I was 0-3 down. I was ‘OK, what do I have to do.' I think I just tried to keep the level and just wait for some chances.”

After three consecutive games with service holds to begin the third, Bencic notched the turning point. With a powerful forehand to set up break point, she took advantage of the crucial point, returning Swiatek's serve with a convincing backhand winner. Swiatek fought to the last point, holding two games of serve and saving two match points with a pair of aces. But as Swiatek — who had an uncharacteristic 36 unforced errors her opponent's 10 — trailed 5-3, Bencic earned triple match point, and her backhand winner into the open court sealed the deal.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Scouting Report: Davidovich Fokina leads Adelaide field, Shelton & Ruud in Auckland","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/adelaide-auckland-2026-scouting-report","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 05:45:34 GMT","

 The hard-court action continues either side of the Tasman Sea this week, when Adelaide and Auckland are the host cities for an ATP 250 doubleheader. 

 Alejandro Davidovich Fokina is the top seed at the Adelaide International, where Tommy Paul, Stefanos Tsitsipas and hometown favourite Thanasi Kokkinakis also compete. In Auckland, Ben Shelton and Casper Ruud headline the draw at the ASB Classic. 

 ATPTour.com looks at five things to watch at each event. 



 FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN ADELAIDE 
1) Can Foki thrive as a top seed?: Currently at a career-high No. 14 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Davidovich Fokina will compete as the top seed at an ATP Tour event for the first time in Adelaide. The 26-year-old Spaniard will look to bounce back from his opening-round exit in Brisbane when he takes on Tristan Schoolkate or Rinky Hijikata in his Adelaide opener. 

 2) Tsitsipas aims to stay perfect: The Greek former World No. 3 Tsitsipas was in a positive mood last week in Perth, where he went 3-0 in singles across Greece's United Cup campaign. Prior to Perth, the 12-time ATP Tour champion had not played a tour-level match since September due to a back injury, but he will step on court full of confidence for his Adelaide opener against a qualifier.

 3) Paul chases first win of the year: Like Tsitsipas, Tommy Paul ended his 2025 season early due to injury. The American did not play after the US Open after rupturing a tendon in his left foot, but returned to action last week in Brisbane, where he fell to Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in a deciding-set tie-break. A two-time semi-finalist in Adelaide, this year's second seed will play Reilly Opelka or home hope Alexei Popyrin first. 

 4) Kokkinakis' comeback: Hometown favourite Kokkinakis will play his first singles match in 12 months when he steps on court to face Sebastian Korda in Adelaide. The 29-year-old had an unprecedented operation on his pec after he competed at the 2025 Australian Open. Having played doubles last week in Brisbane with Nick Kyrgios, Kokkinakis makes his singles return at the venue where he lifted his maiden ATP Tour trophy in 2022. 

 5) Cash/Glasspool lead doubles field: The team that won Year-End ATP Doubles No. 1 presented by PIF honours in 2025 has picked up where it left off this season. Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool reached the final in Brisbane to start their season, and the British duo will now head to Adelaide to compete as the top seeds. Their rivals in the draw include Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten. 



 FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN AUCKLAND 
1)	Shelton seeks fast start: As he has done for the three previous seasons, Shelton begins his season in Auckland. The 23-year-old American, who is currently No. 8 in the PIF ATP Rankings, will be playing his first tour-level event since making his Nitto ATP Finals debut in November. Shelton's first opponent in New Zealand will be Francisco Comesana or Valentin Royer. 

 2) Ruud, Mensik compete: Ruud started his year with a statement victory against Top 10 star Alex de Minaur at the United Cup in Sydney, and the Norwegian will hope to reproduce that form as the second seed in Auckland. However, his rivals in the draw include third seed Jakub Mensik, who prevailed in straight sets when the pair faced off in Sydney. 

 3) Monfils begins his final season: The 39-year-old Gael Monfils has announced 2026 will be his last year as a pro tennis player, and the Frenchman will be keen to showcase his world-class talent whenever possible across the season. That mission begins in Auckland, where he lifted his 13th ATP Tour crown a year ago. Alejandro Tabilo and Roberto Bautista Agut are the other former champions in the draw. 

 4) Norrie's home comforts: British star Cameron Norrie grew up in Auckland and returns to the ASB Classic hoping this will be the year he can get over the line to claim the title. Norrie reached the championship match in 2019 (l. to Sandgren) and 2023 (l. to Gasquet). The fifth seed opens his 2026 title bid against qualifier Hugo Gaston. 

 5) Bhambri/Goransson top seeds: Yuki Bhambri and Andre Goransson headline the doubles draw in Auckland. Their rivals in the draw include Brisbane champions Francisco Cabral and Lucas Miedler, and five-time ATP Tour champion duo Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul.

 Francisco Cabral and Lucas Miedler have quickly picked up where they left off in 2025. 

 The Portuguese-Austrian duo on Sunday downed top seeds Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool 6-3, 3-6, 10-8 at the Brisbane International presented by ANZ to claim their second consecutive ATP Tour crown. Cabral and Miedler, who finished last season by lifting an ATP 250 trophy in Athens, secured the title with an 84-minute victory in Queensland. 

 “I think after the preseason we just kept doing what we did before,” said Miedler. “We had a great run before the break as well, and obviously we worked well in the offseason. The first tournament is never easy, but we just tried to focus on our strengths and it got better from match to match. I think today was a really great level from all four guys and we are just happy to have the win here.” 

Starting the new season with a bang 🏆

Lucas Miedler and Francisco Cabral defeat No. 1 seeds Cash/Glasspool 6-3, 3-6, [10-8] to win their first @BrisbaneTennis doubles title.#BrisbaneTennis pic.twitter.com/Tv6GRsys78

 Third seeds Cabral and Miedler converted both break points they earned according to Infosys ATP Stats, en route to victory against the 2025 Year-End ATP Doubles No. 1 presented by PIF-winning duo of Cash and Glasspool. It was their fourth ATP 250 title together since they first debuted as a team last April in Marrakech. 

 “Of course we want to keep working, keep winning matches and keep playing better at the bigger tournaments,” said Cabral. “It's going to be our first year playing all the Masters 1000s and having a little bit higher expectations at the Grand Slams, so we hope to perform there and hopefully at the end of the year we will try to be in Turin for the first time.”

Musetti/Sonego triumph in Hong Kong
Lorenzo Musetti bounced back from singles final disappointment on Sunday at the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open, where he teamed with fellow Italian Lorenzo Sonego to down Karen Khachanov and Andrey Rublev 6-4, 2-6, 10-1.

Musetti lost to Alexander Bublik in singles but returned to court an hour later and left with a smile on his face following an entertaining doubles final at the ATP 250. Musetti and Sonego found their best level in the Match Tie-break to earn the crown. The triumph marked Musetti's first doubles ATP Tour title, while Sonego is now a three-time champion.

Alexander Bublik stands on the brink a career milestone. Should the 28-year-old win the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open on Sunday, Bublik will make his Top 10 debut in the PIF ATP Rankings.



The unpredictable and entertaining Bublik has been one of the most in-form players since May of last season. Last March, Bublik was as low as No. 82 in the PIF ATP Rankings, but a dramatic turnaround followed. Bublik reached his first major quarter-final at Roland Garros and triumphed in Halle, Gstaad, Kitzbühel and Hangzhou.



“I always say that wins don't make me go through the roof and losses don't put me to the ground,” Bublik said after winning his eighth career title in Hangzhou last September. “I try to stay stable. I enjoy what I do. I'm happy that I'm able to travel, play tournaments and stay healthy, and the wins are coming… That's beautiful.”

Holding 2,980 points in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, Bublik trails No. 10 Jack Draper by 10 points. If Bublik wins the Hong Kong championship match, he will add another 85 points to leapfrog the Briton.



Aiming to become the first Kazakhstani man to crack the Top 10, Bublik has long been fuelled by a style that is as captivating as it is unconventional. He can hammer a serve and then follow it with a feathered drop shot. He can appear almost unserious, only to lock in when it matters most. 



Bublik is undoubtedly one of the Tour's most entertaining figures — and he is equally as dangerous. Last year in Halle, Bublik stunned then-World No. 1 Jannik Sinner just two weeks after the Italian beat him at Roland Garros. 



With it being the opening week of the 2026 season, Bublik would become the first player this year to make his Top 10 debut. Last season, four players cracked the Top 10 for the first time: Jack Draper, Lorenzo Musetti, Tommy Paul, and Ben Shelton.



Fittingly, Musetti will stand across the net from Bublik in Sunday's final at the ATP 250 in Hong Kong. The Italian has already earned a milestone of his own this week, sealing his Top 5 debut. Musetti, 23, will be the third Italian in PIF ATP Rankings history to crack the Top 5, joining former No. 4 Adriano Panatta (1976) and Jannik Sinner (2024), who is World No. 2. This will mark the first time that two Italian men are in the Top 5 of the PIF ATP Rankings at the same time.

After two straight final losses, Poland captured its first United Cup title Sunday in Sydney, overcoming Iga Swiatek's loss to Belinda Bencic as Katarzyna Kawa and Jan Zielinski sealed the comeback in mixed doubles.

SYDNEY, Australia -- Poland finally broke through at the United Cup on Sunday evening, capturing its first championship after falling in the 2024 and 2025 finals with a 2-1 victory over Switzerland at Ken Rosewall Arena.

After Iga Swiatek's loss to Belinda Bencic in the opening match of the tie, Hubert Hurkacz leveled the final before Katarzyna Kawa and Jan Zielinski clinched the title in mixed doubles. It marked the duo's third straight deciding victory of the week and denied Switzerland in its first appearance in the United Cup final.

Kawa and Zielinski finished a perfect 5-0 in mixed doubles during the tournament, closing the championship tie with a 6-4, 6-3 win over the previously unbeaten pairing of Bencic and Jakub Paul. In the opening set, Kawa delivered a pivotal volley at the net on set point at 5-4 during a deciding point that shifted the match in Poland's favor.

""I think it always pays off when you're brave on the important points, especially in doubles,"" Kawa said to reporters. ""It was like instinct decision. I just went for it. Yeah, I'm really happy that we sealed this set and we were able to get this match won.""

The mixed-doubles loss was Bencic's only defeat of the tournament. She finished with a 9-1 overall record and earned the event's most valuable player award.

Bencic went 5-0 in singles, highlighted by Top 10 victories over No. 2 Iga Swiatek and No. 8 Jasmine Paolini, and collected 500 ranking points for her performance.

Bencic won 12 of the final 15 games against Swiatek, earning her second career victory over the World No. 2 on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz. The first set seemed the tie's first match was going to belong to Swiatek, but the pendulum quickly shifted the momentum into the World No. 11's favor.

“It's always a challenge playing against her and every time I play her, I look for ways to improve and make her life a bit more difficult,” said Bencic, who defeated Swiatek for the first time in over four years. “I think the difference today was I played very freely, I was really enjoying myself out on the court and I was just really going for it.”

Swiatek started strong early, holding serve in the opening game with four straight points followed by the match's first break and another hold. With Swiatek up 3-0, Bencic did settle into the match, winning two consecutive games of her own, cutting the deficit to 3-2 after a backhand winner on the third break point. The six-time Grand Slam champion eventually closed out the set, winning three of the next four games.

The second set, however, would be a Bencic domination with to force a deciding third set. Bencic started the second set winning nine consecutive points, and in the third game, she saved two break points. The following game, she'd get the crucial break on the third chance and finished the set in 33 minutes.

“To be honest, I felt I was in the match from the very first point,” Bencic said. “I thought I was going great and I was 0-3 down. I was ‘OK, what do I have to do.' I think I just tried to keep the level and just wait for some chances.”

After three consecutive games with service holds to begin the third, Bencic notched the turning point. With a powerful forehand to set up break point, she took advantage of the crucial point, returning Swiatek's serve with a convincing backhand winner. Following a service hold, Bencic put herself within two games of the win, leading 4-1, and capitalized.

Swiatek fought to the last point, holding two games of serve and saving two match points with a pair of aces, but Bencic's backhand winner on the third match point sealed the win.

Under pressure with the tie on the line, Hurkacz struck 18 aces against Stan Wawrinka and saved eight of the nine break points he faced. Although Wawrinka earned a crucial break on his way to winning the second set, the three-time Grand Slam champion converted just two of 23 break-point chances across his five singles matches at the event.

Hurkacz went 4-1 in singles during the tournament, capping a successful return from a seven-month injury layoff following knee surgery.

The 28-year-old former World No. 6 also erased lingering United Cup disappointment. In the 2024 final, he held two championship points before losing to Alexander Zverev, and last year he fell to Taylor Fritz in a third-set tiebreak. This time, Hurkacz delivered the point Poland needed to set up the championship-winning mixed-doubles match.

After two straight final losses, Poland captured its first United Cup title Sunday in Sydney, overcoming Iga Swiatek's loss to Belinda Bencic as Katarzyna Kawa and Jan Zielinski sealed the comeback in mixed doubles.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

The best battles of the 2025 F1 season

Here are the 11 Team Principals preparing to lead their respective outfits into the 2026 F1 season.

With just weeks to go until the 2026 season begins, the Team Principal of each F1 squad will be busy preparing for the 24-race calendar ahead. Here is the lowdown on the 11 team bosses who will be heading their respective outfits' charges into the campaign…

Andrea Stella's promotion to Team Principal of McLaren in December 2022 came after a long career in the sport, which saw him first join Ferrari as a test team performance engineer in 2000. He later worked with Michael Schumacher on the race team from 2002 onwards, a championship-winning era for the squad.

The Italian transitioned to the role of race engineer for Kimi Raikkonen in 2009 before taking on the same position alongside Fernando Alonso for five years. Stella moved with the Spaniard to McLaren in 2015, becoming Head of Race Operations.

From there he was promoted to Performance Director in 2018 and then Executive Director, Racing in 2019. Since taking on the Team Principal role in December 2022, Stella and McLaren have been on an upward trajectory which has seen them claim back-to-back Teams' Championships in 2024 and 2025, as well as taking the Drivers' crown with Lando Norris last season.

Now the longest-serving current Team Principal on the grid, Toto Wolff has been at the helm of Mercedes since 2013. Following a brief racing career, Wolff switched his focus to the worlds of business and investments early on.

In 2009, the Austrian invested in the Williams F1 team and later became an Executive Director of the squad. He then became a Managing Partner at Mercedes in 2013, as well as acquiring a 30% stake in the outfit.

Wolff – who also acts as CEO of the team – headed the Silver Arrows during a hugely successful period in the years the followed, with the squad claiming both the Drivers' and Teams' Championships between 2014 and 2020 as well as earning the Teams' crown in 2021. After climbing back up to P2 in 2025, Mercedes will be hoping to reach the very top again in 2026.

For the first time in the team's history, Red Bull will start a season with a name other than Christian Horner as their Team Principal following the exit of the Briton last July, with Laurent Mekies since stepping into the role.

Mekies' F1 journey began as an engine race engineer for Arrows in 2001 before joining Minardi in 2002, while he became Chief Engineer when the outfit transitioned into Toro Rosso in 2006 and later Head of Vehicle Performance. The Frenchman joined the FIA in 2014, taking on the roles of Safety Director and later F1 Deputy Race Director before being appointed Sporting Director at Ferrari in 2018.

After progressing to Racing Director in 2021, Mekies parted ways with the Scuderia midway through 2023 as he prepared to move to the then-called AlphaTauri outfit as Team Principal in 2024. This was a role he remained in until getting the call-up to replace Horner at Red Bull midway through 2025, where he led the team through a resurgence in the second half of that campaign.

Over at Ferrari, Fred Vasseur will act as Team Principal for a fourth season in 2026, the Frenchman having taken on the role at the start of the 2023 campaign.

Prior to arriving into Formula 1, Vasseur experienced success through running his own teams in the junior categories, having co-founded the championship-winning ART Grand Prix outfit with Nicolas Todt. He later became Team Principal of the Renault F1 team in 2016 before heading the Sauber/Alfa Romeo outfit between 2017 and 2022.

During his time at Ferrari, Vasseur has been involved in one of the biggest driver moves in the sport's history following the signing of Lewis Hamilton for 2025.

Another person who took the reigns at their team in 2023 is James Vowles, Team Principal of Williams. The Briton's F1 career began as an engineer with BAR back in 2001, where he went on to progress through the ranks during the outfit's guises as Honda, Brawn GP and Mercedes.

Vowles acted as Chief Strategist during Brawn GP's championship-winning campaign in 2009, while he went on to experience further success across Mercedes' run of titles between 2014 and 2021, having been promoted to Motorsport Strategy Director in 2019.

Since joining Williams at the start of 2023, Vowles has led the Grove-based outfit through their continued mission to return to the top, claiming a ‘best of the race' fifth place in the 2025 Teams' Championship.

The Red Bull reshuffle midway through 2025 saw Alan Permane move to the role of Team Principal at Racing Bulls, marking the latest step in a lengthy career in the sport for the Briton.

After completing an electronic engineering apprenticeship, Permane joined the then-called Benetton team in 1989. He would subsequently remain with the Enstone-based outfit through to 2023 across their various guises, progressing through the engineering ranks with roles including Race Engineer and ultimately Sporting Director.

Amid organisational changes during the 2023 season, Permane exited the team before returning to F1 with Racing Bulls – then known as RB – for the 2024 campaign in the position of Racing Director. His promotion to Team Principal followed in 2025 in the wake of Mekies' departure to Red Bull.

A name that needs little introduction, Adrian Newey has carved out a reputation as one of the sport's most famed and successful designers, with his creations for the likes of Williams, McLaren and Red Bull winning numerous championships.

Following his stints with the two former teams, Newey joined Red Bull in 2006 for what would be his longest partnership with a squad, remaining with the Milton Keynes-based outfit until the news of his impending exit was announced in May 2024.

Amid months of speculation over his next move, it was later confirmed that Newey would take on the role of Managing Technical Partner at Aston Martin in 2025 – and, amid an organisational restructure, it has since been announced that the Briton will also act as Team Principal of the outfit in 2026.

Ayao Komatsu enters into his third season as Team Principal of Haas in 2026, having worked his way up following his arrival in F1 as an engineer for the BAR outfit back in 2003.

Komatsu went on to join Renault in 2006 as a performance engineer and subsequently a race engineer, working with drivers including Vitaly Petrov and Romain Grosjean. Like Grosjean, the Japanese engineer left for the newly-formed Haas team in 2016.

After acting as Trackside Engineering Director for several years, Komatsu was promoted to the role of Team Principal following the exit of Guenther Steiner at the start of 2024, a season in which the outfit recovered to P7 in the championship.

Over at Audi, Jonathan Wheatley continues on as Team Principal following his arrival at the team – under its former guise as Kick Sauber – in April 2025.

Starting out as a junior mechanic for Benetton in 1991, Wheatley rose to the role of Chief Mechanic during his time with the Enstone-based outfit, which was brought to an end when he joined Red Bull in 2006.

Taking on the position of Sporting Director, the Briton was a part of the squad across numerous championship victories before his exit was announced in August 2024 as he prepared to become Team Principal of Kick Sauber in 2025. Wheatley will now lead the team into their first campaign as Audi following the manufacturer's takeover of the outfit.

Following the exit of former Alpine Team Principal Oliver Oakes in May 2025, Executive Advisor Flavio Briatore took over the duties previously covered by Oakes, while Steve Nielsen was later hired as Managing Director to oversee the day-to-day running of the team.

Reporting to Briatore, Nielsen has vast experience in the sport, having spent a large part of his earlier career with the Enstone-based outfit before going on to hold positions for commercial rights holder F1 and the FIA.

Briatore, meanwhile, returned to Formula 1 in his current role with Alpine in 2024. The Italian previously experienced championship success at the outfit during their Benetton days in the early 1990s, as well as winning further titles with Fernando Alonso when the squad became Renault in the 2000s.

Cadillac will make their F1 debut in 2026 as they became the 11th team on the grid – but they have an experienced name leading their charge, with Graeme Lowdon having been recruited as the squad's Team Principal.

Lowdon has knowledge of setting up a new outfit, having previously brought Virgin Racing into the sport in 2010. He continued to run the team through its subsequent guise as Marussia before exiting prior to the squad's final season in 2016.

After working on various other projects – including acting as part of Zhou Guanyu's management team – the Briton's position with Cadillac was announced in December 2024, with his time since spent preparing for the American squad's maiden Formula 1 campaign.

The best battles of the 2025 F1 season

As Yuki Tsunoda finds himself without a race seat in 2026, F1.com relives the comeback stories of the drivers who returned to the grid after previously losing their spot.

When the drivers assemble for the first race of the season in 2026, one face that won't be on the grid is Yuki Tsunoda, with the Japanese driver having been replaced at Red Bull by Isack Hadjar.

While Tsunoda moves to the role of test and reserve driver for the Milton Keynes-based squad, boss Laurent Mekies has voiced his belief that the 25-year-old could potentially find another opportunity in the future.

Tsunoda would not be the first driver to make a return after losing their seat, with the following names having all bounced back in similar situations…

Perhaps one of the best examples for Tsunoda would be courtesy of Alex Albon, a driver who also found himself being demoted to a test and reserve position at Red Bull.

After making his F1 debut for the then-named Toro Rosso sister outfit in 2019, the Thai driver was promoted to the main team midway through the season in a direct swap with Pierre Gasly.

While Albon did enough to keep his spot alongside Max Verstappen into 2020, Red Bull decided to make a change at the end of the campaign and brought in Sergio Perez (more on whom later) to replace him, with Albon remaining in the fold in the test and reserve role.

The now 29-year-old later admitted that his struggles in 2020 left him mentally “destroyed”, but this did not stop him from using his year on the sidelines to good effect, building his network and finding himself a seat on the grid at Williams in 2022.

It was a move that paid off for Albon, who appeared to flourish as he became something of a team leader at the Grove-based outfit, with the team since continuing their steps forward and working their way up to a ‘best of the rest' P5 in 2025.

While some in this list were still trying to make a name for themselves when they dropped off the grid, a slightly different example comes courtesy of Alain Prost, who was already a three-time World Champion when he joined Ferrari in 1990.

While his first campaign with the team saw him controversially miss out on a fourth title to rival Ayrton Senna, relations between Prost and the Scuderia soured in 1991 and the Frenchman was publicly critical of the outfit following their drop in competitiveness.

As a result, Prost was axed by Ferrari before the season was over – and, with no time left to find another suitable seat for 1992, he was forced to take a sabbatical.

It would not be the last that F1 had seen of the man known as ‘the Professor', though, as he returned at the wheel of a Williams in 1993. The move was an inspired one; the FW15C proved to be a dominant force and took Prost to a historic fourth championship.

This would ultimately be the final act of the French driver's time in Formula 1, bringing the curtain down on an illustrious career.

In terms of making the most of every opportunity after losing a seat, Nico Hulkenberg is a glowing example.

At the end of 2019 – his ninth season in F1 – the experienced Hulkenberg found himself out of a job when he was dropped by Renault, who would instead bring in Esteban Ocon (another name to appear later) in 2020.

It transpired that it would not be long until the German appeared on the grid again, however. Amid a shortened season in 2020 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, Hulkenberg made two eye-catching substitute appearances for Racing Point when Sergio Perez and Lance Stroll each contracted the virus.

When the team became known as Aston Martin in 2021, the super-sub was kept on as a reserve driver – and while his services were not required during that year, he again stepped in for two races in 2022 in place of Sebastian Vettel, who had tested positive for COVID-19.

All of this was enough to keep Hulkenberg on the radar of the teams, and he was subsequently signed up by Haas to make his full-time comeback in 2023. The 38-year-old has since gone from strength to strength, with his 2025 switch to Kick Sauber – soon to be known as Audi – delivering a long-awaited maiden podium at Silverstone.

Long before the era of ‘Hulkenback', another driver to make the most of being a stand-in was Mika Salo.

After making his debut for Lotus at the end of the 1994 season, Salo went on to race for Tyrrell and Arrows in the years that followed before the latter opted to change their line-up for 1999, leaving the Finn without a seat.

When BAR's Ricardo Zonta was sidelined with an injury, Salo stepped in across three races – and an even bigger call-up followed after Michael Schumacher broke his leg in a crash at the British Grand Prix, with Ferrari bringing Salo in to replace the German from the next round onwards in Austria.

Eddie Irvine was now heading the Scuderia's charge as he battled McLaren's Mika Hakkinen for the World Championship and, when Salo found himself in the lead of the German Grand Prix – in only his second outing for the team – the sub moved aside for Irvine. His P2 finish still marked his maiden podium in F1.

Another rostrum followed in front of the squad's home crowd at Monza and, while Irvine just missed out on the Drivers' crown, Salo's contributions helped Ferrari to seal the Teams' Championship. This also put the Finnish racer in the shop window and led to a full-time comeback in 2000 with Sauber.

Fast-forward to the modern era, and Salo's fellow Finn Valtteri Bottas has also fashioned a return to the grid after previously finding himself without a seat.

Following a four-year stint with Williams, Bottas joined Mercedes in 2017 following the sudden retirement of Nico Rosberg and went on to become a 10-time race winner in his five seasons with the squad.

After being replaced by George Russell for 2022, the now 36-year-old raced for the Alfa Romeo/Kick Sauber outfit across the next three campaigns before losing his place at the future Audi outfit at the end of 2024.

This saw Bottas return to the Mercedes fold as a reserve driver, meaning that he remained a visible presence in the paddock whilst keeping an eye out for opportunities to return, having stated that he was “not done” with Formula 1 yet following his last race for Kick Sauber.

It was later confirmed in the summer of 2025 that Bottas will be back in 2026 as part of Cadillac's line-up for their maiden campaign in F1, where he will form an experienced pairing with Sergio Perez. Speaking of…

The Cadillac line-up will feature not one but two comeback drivers, as Perez joins Bottas for the American outfit's debut.

Perez enjoyed a long F1 career that started back in 2011 with Sauber, going on to drive for McLaren and Force India – and scoring his first-ever victory with the latter in 2020 – before replacing Alex Albon at Red Bull in 2021.

The collaboration was initially a successful one as Perez partnered with Max Verstappen, helping the outfit to clinch the Teams' Championship in 2022 and 2023 as well as collecting a further five Grand Prix wins.

A good start to 2024 resulted in the Mexican being handed a contract extension through to the end of 2026 – but the rest of his season unravelled, leading to Perez and Red Bull parting ways at the close of the campaign.

While the 35-year-old opted to take a breather from the sport and spend time with his family in 2025, his desire to return to the grid remained and he will now embark on his 15th season in the sport with the Cadillac team in 2026.

Like Perez, Felipe Massa became a veteran of the sport across 15 campaigns – but it is perhaps easy to forget that his F1 career hit an early obstacle when he lost his seat following his rookie year.

Off the back of winning the Euro Formula 3000 Championship in 2001, Massa made the step up to Formula 1 with Sauber in 2002 and scored points on three occasions. It was ultimately decided that he would be replaced in 2003, however, by Heinz-Harald Frentzen, with the Brazilian instead taking up a test driver role for Ferrari.

Following a year on the sidelines, Massa bounced back by rejoining Sauber in 2004. His next season at the squad in 2005 saw him outscore new team mate Jacques Villeneuve, and the youngster impressed enough to earn a seat at Ferrari in 2006 alongside Michael Schumacher.

From there the driver from Sao Paulo experienced plenty of success in the years that followed, collecting a total of 11 wins and 15 pole positions with the Scuderia before moving to Williams in 2014.

While he had announced that he would retire at the end of 2016, Massa later stayed on for an additional year following Valtteri Bottas' exit to Mercedes after the retirement of Nico Rosberg, bringing the Brazilian's total number of Grands Prix up to 269.

Several drivers in this list have found their opportunity to return to the grid following a year spent in a reserve role – and Esteban Ocon is another name to add to that group.

Having joined the Mercedes Junior Team in 2015, Ocon soon found his way to Formula 1 after replacing Ryo Haryanto at the Manor outfit midway through 2016, before going on to join Force India to begin his first full-time campaign in 2017.

The Frenchman's promising ascent would soon come to a halt, however. After the team's financial troubles in 2018 saw them purchased by a consortium of investors led by Lawrence Stroll, Ocon was replaced at the end of the season by Lance Stroll.

Finding himself without a seat for 2019, the now 29-year-old took on a reserve driver position at Mercedes, embedding himself within the championship-winning squad whilst keen to get back on the grid in 2020, having said at the time: “I think in one year, the changes are not massive. If you miss two years, it's a big step.”

Ocon ultimately got his wish as, after just the one year away, he secured a race seat with Renault, going on to score his maiden F1 victory with the team – now known as Alpine – in 2021 as well as making three additional visits to the podium in the seasons that followed. The French racer has since joined Haas, for whom he'll embark on a second campaign in 2026.

Remember what Ocon said about the potential challenge of making a comeback following more than a year away? This may be something Romain Grosjean would have something to say about, having made his own return following a 24-month gap.

When Renault dropped Nelson Piquet Jr with seven rounds to spare in 2009, the outfit called up reserve Grosjean to replace him for the rest of the season. The Frenchman struggled to match new team mate Fernando Alonso during his debut appearance, finishing the race at Valencia down in 15th.

After ending his brief stint with no points, Grosjean was not retained by Renault for 2010 and switched focus to other categories of motorsport. This also saw him return to Formula 2 – then known as GP2 – where he won the 2011 championship.

It was also during this year that Grosjean participated in two FP1 outings for Renault, and his full-time comeback followed for the newly-rebranded Lotus squad in 2012. The driver from Geneva collected 10 podiums across his four seasons with the team, including a career-best P2 finish at the 2013 United States Grand Prix.

Grosjean then switched to Haas in 2016, where he remained until the end of 2020. And while his last F1 appearance saw him experience a shocking fiery crash in Bahrain, the Frenchman recently enjoyed an emotional one-off return at the wheel of his former team's challenger during a 2025 Testing of Previous Car (TPC) event.

One of Grosjean's team mates during his time in F1 was Kevin Magnussen, a man who made not one but two comebacks in his career.

A former member of the McLaren Young Driver Programme, Magnussen was handed his Formula 1 debut in 2014 as he stepped up at the Woking-based outfit to replace the ousted Sergio Perez. Things could barely have gone better in his maiden race, with a second place making him one of the few drivers to take a podium in their first Grand Prix.

While he scored points on 11 further occasions, it was not enough to keep Magnussen in the seat for 2015 and he was demoted to a test and reserve role. The Dane did not stay away for long, however, and returned to the grid with Renault in 2016.

Magnussen went on to race for Haas between 2017 and 2020, but was left without a seat for 2021 when the American outfit opted for the all-new line-up of Nikita Mazepin and Mick Schumacher. The Danish driver's attentions then switched to other categories – until a late call-up to rejoin the team came just weeks before the 2022 season following the exit of Mazepin.

A lack of preparation time did not prevent Magnussen from impressing on his return, scoring points with a P5 finish in his first race back while another highlight came later in the year when he clinched a surprise pole position in Sao Paulo. The 33-year-old's second stint with Haas subsequently came to an end at the close of 2024, meaning that his focus has returned to competing in the likes of the World Endurance Championship.

Given Audi's decades of success in global motorsport, it's hard to believe that 2026 marks the famous German marque's first foray into Formula 1. Having announced plans to become a power unit supplier back in 2022, their hunger to compete quickly grew – resulting in the acquisition of the Sauber team, now the first-ever Audi works squad.

Ex-Ferrari team chief Mattia Binotto heads up the project, while former Red Bull stalwart Jonathan Wheatley is Team Principal. As for driving prowess, that comes from the tried-and-tested mix of youth and experience that is Gabriel Bortoleto and Nico Hulkenberg…

2025

Present Audi R26 Concept as a preview of the colour scheme and design of the brand's first Formula 1 car. Revolut announced as team's title sponsor for 2026 entry.

2024

Expand Formula 1 commitment with 100 percent takeover of Sauber and installation of former Ferrari team boss Mattia Binotto as head of F1 project. Jonathan Wheatley to exit Red Bull to become Team Principal.

2022

Audi – part of the Volkswagen Group – announce they will become an F1 engine supplier when new power unit regulations come into force in 2026. Reach agreement for Sauber team to become Audi works squad for that season.

The best battles of the 2025 F1 season

As 18-year-old Arvid Lindblad prepares to share the grid with 44-year-old Fernando Alonso, F1.com looks back at other drivers from different eras who have raced together.

When rookie Arvid Lindblad joins the F1 grid in 2026, the 18-year-old will find himself going up against some veterans of the sport – with the most experienced being Fernando Alonso, who, at 44, is 26 years Lindblad's senior.

The age gap, whilst significant, does not mark the first time that two drivers from different eras have raced together in Formula 1; indeed, there have been several occasions over the years where some illustrious names have competed against new kids on the block – who, in numerous instances, later became successes themselves.

Let's take a look through the history books at just some of those contrasting pairings from days gone by…

Given that his lengthy career in F1 has so far seen him start 425 Grands Prix – more than any other driver – there are many names from different generations that Fernando Alonso has raced against.

Perhaps one of the most interesting examples, though, is the fact that the early days of his time in the sport saw him share the grid with Jos Verstappen – the father of one of his current competitors, Max Verstappen.

When Alonso made his debut for Minardi in 2001, Verstappen Senior was in his seventh campaign in Formula 1 and second with the Arrows team, having previously raced for Benetton, Simtek, Footwork, Tyrrell and Stewart since his maiden outing in 1994.

Both Alonso and Verstappen found themselves off the grid in 2002, before making their returns in 2003 with Renault and Minardi respectively. It would prove to be the start of big things for future two-time World Champion Alonso, who scored his first victory that season in Hungary, while it marked Verstappen's final campaign in F1 – 12 years before his son's debut.

Alonso was not the only rookie of note to arrive in 2001, with a certain Kimi Raikkonen also lining up on the grid for the first time after earning a seat with the Sauber team.

At the other end of the experience spectrum, Jean Alesi was entering into his 13th F1 campaign as he prepared for a second season with the Prost outfit – and hoping for better after finishing 2000 with no points.

The team's car proved more competitive in 2001 and brought Alesi three points finishes, before the Frenchman switched to Jordan for the final five races. Raikkonen, meanwhile, was catching the eye with some impressive performances during his maiden season.

At the finale in Japan, the two drivers' paths crossed – quite literally – when both crashed out on the opening lap. With Alesi having opted to retire, it marked a lowkey ending to the one-time race winner's career – but it was just the start for Raikkonen, who would go on to join McLaren in 2002.

In another instance of a star of the future embarking on their debut just as a famed name entered their last run, Michael Schumacher's memorable arrival into Formula 1 saw him subsequently become team mate to Nelson Piquet during the latter's final races.

After an extensive career in the sport that had started back in 1978 – and had delivered three World Championships during the 1980s – Piquet was driving for Benetton in 1991 when a rookie by the name of Schumacher was drafted in at Jordan to replace Bertrand Gachot for the Belgian Grand Prix.

While Schumacher's race lasted just a few metres due to a clutch issue on the Jordan 191, his strong form through the weekend was enough for Benetton to sign him up with immediate effect, the German taking the place of Roberto Moreno who in turn moved to Jordan.

Going up against Piquet did not seem to faze Schumacher, who outqualified the Brazilian at four of their five weekends together. Piquet decided to retire at the close of the campaign, while the rest is history for Schumacher, who became one of the sport's all-time greats with a record seven World Championships to his name.

Like Schumacher, Nico Hulkenberg had the benchmark of an experienced driver from Brazil to set himself against during his early days in F1, with the German partnering Rubens Barrichello at Williams in 2010.

Off the back of winning the F2 championship (then known as GP2) on his debut in 2009, a then 22-year-old Hulkenberg made the step up to Formula 1 in the year that followed. He went on to score points on seven occasions, including at Interlagos where he memorably scored his first – and to date only – pole position.

This was ultimately not enough to beat his highly experienced team mate, however, as Barrichello – in his 18th campaign in Formula 1 – scored just over double the amount of points achieved by the rookie.

While Barrichello remained with the team into 2011 for what would prove to be his last season in F1, Hulkenberg did not keep his seat and joined Force India as a reserve driver. But the man later known for his ‘Hulkenback' era would go on to become a veteran of the sport himself, with the 38-year-old about to start his 13th full-time campaign in Formula 1.

There have been plenty of notable driver debuts over the course of F1's history – but Eddie Irvine's first race in 1993 remains particularly infamous after he sparked the fury of three-time World Champion Ayrton Senna.

Irvine made his maiden appearance for the Jordan team at the penultimate round of the 1993 season in Japan, finishing the event in a respectable P6. Senna, meanwhile, claimed what would prove to be the second to last of his 41 wins.

Despite his victory, Senna was furious about an earlier incident involving Irvine. When the race leader came to lap the Northern Irishman – who was in a close battle with Damon Hill – Irvine subsequently unlapped himself to continue the fight, leading to Senna heading to the Jordan hospitality after the Grand Prix to confront the rookie.

That heated discussion resulted in the Brazilian throwing a punch at Irvine, landing the McLaren driver a suspended two-race ban. The pair ultimately did not share the track for long, with Senna tragically losing his life at Imola in 1994, but their off-track clash has etched itself into F1 lore.

Like the aforementioned Alonso and Hulkenberg, Lewis Hamilton is now one of the most experienced drivers currently on the grid. Unlike his veteran competitors, though, Hamilton did not have the opportunity to race alongside Michael Schumacher during his debut campaign, with the German having retired at the end of 2006.

Hamilton did, however, share the grid with another Schumacher – that being Michael's brother, Ralf – when he arrived in Formula 1 with McLaren in 2007, a campaign that would prove to be the last for the younger Schumacher.

An unforgettable championship battle unfolded during the season, one in which Hamilton – who scored six pole positions and four wins – and team mate Alonso each just missed out on the title by one point to Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen.

While Hamilton's rookie year had been an incredibly impressive one, the campaign did not go so well for Schumacher. In his 11th season – and third with Toyota – the experienced driver ended the championship down in 16th place. Though it marked the end of the German's F1 career, it was incidentally not the last time that Hamilton raced a Schumacher, with Michael returning between 2010 and 2012 while his son Mick also competed in 2021 and 2022.

In terms of iconic World Champions from the sport's past, Juan Manuel Fangio and Graham Hill are definitely two names on that list – and while the latter's extensive stint in F1 would see him race right through until 1975, his debut season actually coincided with the last of Fangio's comparatively short career.

After finishing second to Giuseppe ‘Nino' Farina in the first-ever Formula 1 championship in 1950, Fangio took the title in 1951 and went on to collect four more during the decade, a record that was not surpassed until Michael Schumacher became World Champion for a sixth time in 2003.

His illustrious run came to an end in 1958, where he competed in two Grands Prix before retiring from the sport. The last of those appearances came at the Circuit de Reims-Gueux in France, an event that marked the only occasion where he raced alongside the rookie Hill.

Fangio took fourth place, while Hill – making just his fourth start in a Formula 1 championship race – retired due to an issue with his Lotus. Greater things were to come for the Briton, however, who went on to take 14 victories, 13 pole positions and two World Championships across his career, while he and son Damon remain one of only two father-son pairings to both win titles.

At Friday's Astra Awards, Stone picked up a Timeless Award and dropped a 9-minute speech: “You know why you like Taylor Swift? Because she's decent. Be decent. That is what it means to be timeless.”


							By 

	Chris Gardner



	When Sharon Stone walked up on stage inside the Sofitel hotel Friday night to accept a career achievement honor during the Astra Awards, she immediately turned her attention to “the kids” who questioned who she was and why she was at their table.


	“Someone came over and said, ‘Who are you and why are you sitting here?'” the veteran star explained before quoting herself from the clips reel that just played. “As she said, ‘Fuck you.'”




	Though she said it with a smile, that should give you an idea of how the next nine minutes of Stone's acceptance speech went. It was a “fuck”-filled address that covered everything from Basic Instinct to Taylor Swift and seemed designed to inspire actors and artists to go after their dreams, be a “decent person” and get to work.

	“Fame without awareness, success without purpose is pointless,” Stone said at the top of her remarks after calling out her tablemates. “It's really interesting because I wasn't the first person they offered Basic Instinct to but I was the person who got her manager to break into the office and get her the script. And I was the person who was prepared because I had that script for eight months and I was the person who got her manager to call every single fucking day because I wanted that part. And when you want something as an artist, you should go and get it because you know what's meant for you and you know where you can fit and where you can make a change with your art.”

	











	Then Stone turned her attention to the present day to offer a rather pointed message about activism.


	“There's a lot of talk right now about what we think is right and what we think is wrong and how we feel about everything and how upsetting all these things can be. Fuck off. All of your hot air doesn't mean anything, but all of your gifts and all of your opportunities mean everything. Shut the front door and get to work. Do something with what you have. Use your talent and become a purpose. The only thing that matters in this life is what you do with what you've got.”


	Stone dedicated a chunk of her remarks to retelling the story of how she got out of the “port town in northwestern Pennsylvania” where she grew up, a place she described as being filled with drugs, hookers and lots of Amish residents. 


	“I went on to demonstrate what different lives could look like and what different lives could feel like because I felt a lot growing up in that environment,” she said of her career as an actress. “I felt a lot about the Amish people that I grew up with, the people who taught me how to raise a house, raise the sides, and then have a party when we put the roof on.”

	











	Stone then made a big statement — more of a direct suggestion, actually — about actors who make more money than the people they work with on sets. 


	“Everybody thinks that what we do is all sunglasses and flashbulbs but it isn't. It's a lot of seasons of strikes and illnesses and no jobs and how the fuck am I going to pay my bills? That's what it really is to be an artist. What is it to be timeless? It is not a bunch of people pushing buttons on social media. It isn't. It is when you are on the road and you meet people and you are kind to them and you see them and you talk to them. It is when you make more money than your crew and you realize that you should not be eating off the craft service table because you are not carrying cable. You are not hauling electric. You are not dragging shit through the rain and snow. What you should be doing is be putting better food on that craft service table because you make more money.”


	She said stars should clean up their trailers, hang up their clothes and “put your fucking trash out at the end of the day.” And then on their days off, they should go to the hospital and “do something decent.” Then came the Swift mention. 


	“You know why you like Taylor Swift? Because she's decent. Be decent. That is what it means to be timeless. Be a decent person.”

Saturday's award winners praised immigrants, promoted fighting the power and singled out creative human beings over ChatGPT, generative AI and that fictional photorealistic actress.  


							By 

	Chris Gardner



	Leave it to the indie film crowd to add some spice to the weekend.


	During an awards season in which many boldfaced names have been playing it safe when it comes to weighing in on hot button cultural and political issues — not counting Guillermo del Toro who shouted “fuck AI” at New York's Gotham Awards — the handful of boldfaced names who made it to the podium at Saturday's Spirit Awards brunch did not shy away from sharing their passionate takes.




	But first, official business: Film Independent brought its typically beachside act to the London West Hollywood to host Spirit Award nominees for an airy rooftop brunch. (For years, Santa Monica hosted the brunch at Casa Del Mar and the Spirit Awards in a tent on the beach.) Aside from serving up avocado toast, tacos and Lavazza espresso martinis, the org doled out $75,000 in grants to emerging artists. Hannah Einbinder and Natasha Rothwell teamed to announce the winners in front of a starry crowd that included Ethan Hawke, Zoey Deutch, Joel Edgerton, Dylan O'Brien, Stephen Graham, Erin Doherty, Rebecca Hall, Kyle Marvin, Jane Levy and Tig Notaro, and the team from Come See Me in the Good Light.

	“What's up freaks,” the Hacks Emmy Award-winning star said in greeting the crowd. “How are we feeling? Are we on a frequency all together as one?” Rothwell certainly was. After exchanging compliments, she said to Einbinder, “I'm going to touch myself later and think about you.”

	











	Film Independent acting president was thinking about the rollercoaster that was 2025. “Last year we endured quite a moment and we are just so grateful that we were able to navigate the many things happening in the world and even within the industry with all of you. We're emerging now with greater energy, with greater purpose. And we are very excited to be in the brighter days ahead that we knew were waiting for us.”


	It was a bright day for Tony Yang who won the first prize of the afternoon, the Producers Award sponsored for the first time by Producers United. Finalists for the honor, which comes with a $25,000 unrestricted grant, included Emma Hannaway and Luca Intili.


	“Being a producer to me has always meant creating the best possible environment for everyone around me to succeed, for the people around me to feel the most creative, most free to do their best work. And the key word here is people — not ChatGPT, not generative AI, not Tilly Norwood,” Yang said in his acceptance speech. “It is the real people here and the real independent filmmakers in this room that inspire me and continue to inspire audiences with their works of art. There's no greater community than ours that harnesses the power of storytelling into its most vulnerable, raw and authentic form.”


	Yang's comments prompted Rothwell, when she returned to the podium to present the next award, to say, “We are going to keep things moving but before we do, I just gotta say fuck Tilly Norwood.” She received loud cheers for the proclamation. 

	











	Up next came Rajee Samarasinghe, director of Your Touch Makes Others Invisible, who received the Truer Than Fiction Award presented to a first-time director of nonfiction features “who has not received significant recognition.” It comes with a $25,000 unrestricted grant, and Samarasinghe bested Tony Benna for André is an Idiot and Brittany Shyne for Seeds.


	He also came with a timely statement tied to his movie. “It's a film about enforced disappearances and state violence in my home country of Sri Lanka. I really want to dedicate this to the women who shared their testimonies in the film and demonstrated such courage,” Samarasinghe said. “We live in a moment where abuses of power are so commonplace and it's so important to keep fighting this power and to stand with those who are most vulnerable.”


	The last award of the afternoon — the Someone to Watch Award with an unrestricted $25,000 grant — went to Tatti Ribeiro, director of Valentina. Her fellow nominees included Neo Sora for Happyend and Annapurna Sriram for Fucktoys. Ribeiro revealed she didn't write a speech because “my movie's not out yet,” but she still managed to find an exclamation point for her remarks. “Thank God for immigrants. That's all.”


	But there was more. Rothwell and Einbinder (who posted a strongly worded statement on Instagram denouncing ICE in the wake of the killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis by stating “none of us are safe”) then led the crowd in a champagne toast. “We didn't imbibe before this, so you guys are ahead of us,” Rothwell said as Einbinder added, “I have a little bit of a Benadryl allergy and a microdose in my system, I won't lie.”

	











	The Spirit Awards will be hosted by Saturday Night Live alum Ego Nwodim on Feb. 15. It will be a milestone occasion as the 41st annual show moves from its longtime home on Santa Monica Beach into the heart of Hollywood at the Palladium. The show is set to stream live on YouTube on both the Film Independent and IMDb channels. Spirit Awards are supported by premier sponsor Lavazza Coffee, principal sponsor IMDbPro and official sponsor FIJI Water with support this year from Pepsi, accessibility partner Easterseals Disability Services and official hotels London West Hollywood and W Hollywood.

New entries are Paramount's horror 'Primate' ($11.3 million in ticket sales) and Lionsgate's 'Greenland 2: Migration' ($8 million in ticket sales).


							By 

	Mia Galuppo


Senior Entertainment Reporter


Avatar: Fire and Ash will continue its box office streak over this early January weekend, landing at No. 1 for the fourth weekend in a row with $21.3 million from 3,700 theaters. 


Avatar currently stands at $342.6 million domestically. While not performing as well as the first two Avatar films, Fire and Ash has easily cleared the global $1 billion mark after three weekends in cinemas, and after this weekend, its global total is set to land at $1.23 billion.




	The James Cameron franchise installment is coming in well ahead of the weekend's two new releases: Paramount horror Primate and Lionsgate's Greenland 2: Migration.

	













	For its part, Primate is vying for the No. 2 spot, opening at 2,964 venues and $11.3 million in ticket sales for its opening weekend. Johannes Roberts, known for horror thrillers like 47 Meters Down, directs the horror film about a domesticated chimpanzee that turns on the family that raised him (and some unwitting houseguests) after becoming rabid. Oscar winner Troy Kotsur stars in the $20 million-plus budget movie, along with Johnny Sequoyah and Jessica Alexander. Overseas, the movie landed $2.1 million for a global total $13.4 million.







	Running close behind Primate is Amanda Seyfried and Sydney Sweeney starring success story The Housemaid with $11.2 million in estimated weekend ticket sales. The Paul Feig-directed thriller, which already has a planned sequel, has a $93 million total in North America and $150 million worldwide.

	











	In fourth place is the animated juggernaut Zooptopia 2, which earned $10.1 million in its seventh weekend of release and now has a global gross of $1.65 billion to date. The film is Walt Disney Animation's top-grossing movie.


Greenland 2, a sequel to the 2020 disaster movie, is the weekend's other new entry and is coming in at No. 5 with $8.5 million from 2,710 locations. Lionsgate has the domestic rights to the Gerard Butler-starrer from director Ric Roman Waugh that takes place after the events of the first film, when a comet wreaked havoc on Earth. In the follow-up, the central family must leave their Greenland bunker in search of a new home in post-apocalyptic Europe.


	Outside of Avatar 3, notable holdovers at the multiplex include Timothee Chalamet's awards season frontrunner Marty Supreme, which earned $7.3 million over the weekend, dropping 38 percent. The Josh Safdie-directed ping pong epic, which has a budget of $70 million, has now passed that figure at the domestic box office. Also in the awards conversation is Park Chan-wook's No Other Choice, which generated $1.3 million from 147 screens over the weekend. That film, in its third week of limited release, has a cume of $3.6 million.


	Elsewhere, Sony's adventure comedy Anaconda passed a milestone, earning over $100 million at the global box office. The Jack Black and Paul Rudd-starrer made $5.1 million in North America and now has a global total of $110.1 million.


Jan 11, 8:50 a.m. Updated with the full weekend box office estimates.

	At only 34 years old, Jiménez had already become one of the biggest names in Colombian popular music, or “música popular,” a genre that blends traditional Mexican ranchera music with Colombian roots. In 2024, he reached a major milestone in his career by selling out Bogotá's Movistar Arena not once, but three times, drawing more than 40,000 fans in total.

	











	On the Billboard charts, Jiménez reached No. 16 on the Regional Mexican Airplay ranking with “Tu Amante” in 2021. The song also earned him his first and only entry on the all-genre Latin Airplay chart, peaking at No. 48 that same year.




	This was a historic achievement for both Jiménez and the genre, as no other Colombian popular music artist had ever reached that milestone. Popular music in Colombia has its roots in the country's coffee-growing region, which includes Caldas (where Jiménez was born), Quindío, Risaralda and Tolima.


	The genre, which dates back to more than 50 years ago, was originally known as “música de carrilera” or “cantina music.” It was heavily influenced by Mexican regional music and gained traction in small towns and local bars, thanks to pioneers like Darío Gómez, Luis Alberto Posada and El Charrito Negro.


	According to Jiménez, Darío Gómez was especially instrumental in shaping the genre, even though many doubted his vision when he first introduced the fusion in the '70s. 


	Jiménez had lofty ambitions for his brand of music, and in 2024, he was part of a panel of música popular artists at Billboard Latin Music Week. Last year he fulfilled another dream: selling out Bogotá's El Campín Stadium, becoming the first Colombian regional artist to do so.


	He had been gearing up for a second show at El Campín, scheduled for March 28. Jiménez is survived by his wife and three children. 


This story will be updated as more details become available.

Was heard about Weir's death just an hour before taking the stage Saturday night.


													By
												

	Gary Graff



News of Bob Weir‘s death on Saturday (Jan. 10) landed particularly heavy with Don Was, the Grammy Award-winning producer and Blue Note Records president who was also Weir's bandmate in Wolf Bros since 2018. Weir, co-founder of the Grateful Dead, died at age 78 after battling cancer.Like Weir with Ratdog when Jerry Garcia died during August of 1995, Was got the news as he was preparing to go on stage with his own band, the Pan-Detroit Ensemble, at the Blue Llama Jazz Club in Ann Arbor, Mich. He received a call about an hour before the first of two shows and, choking back tears, broke the news to most in the audience before the band started to play.“All I thought about was the night Jerry died and he played,” Was told Billboard after the show. “He just said that the way you deal with grief is good music and lifting people's spirits, and I know that's what he would've wanted tonight.”


	Sharing the same memory with the crowd beforehand, Was noted that, “If [Weir] were here right now, he would say, ‘Get out there and f—ing play!' So we're gonna play the show… and we're just gonna give it as much soul as we can give it. I know that's what he would have wanted.”

	











	Was was introduced to Weir during the '90s by Ratdog bassist Rob Wasserman, a mutual friend. They remained in contact, and in 2018 Weir called Was to say that “he had a dream that Wasserman [who passed away in 2016] came to him and said I'm supposed to take Rob's place. [Weir] got the name Wolf Bros and he said he wants to start a trio with me and Jay [Lane, on drums], and, of course.”“He's been a good friend. I knew he wasn't well, and I just assumed he was gonna be all right. I was planning on playing more shows, even though I knew he was sick, because he always pulls it off. He was fearless musically and fearless in this fight for his life. That's what I learned from him — give it everything, and push it one step further,” said Was.Was appeared on the Wolf Bros' two live albums and served as music director for the Grateful Dead's 2024 Kennedy Center Honors ceremony and the band's MusiCares Persons of the Year gala in January 2025. He also introduced Weir and Mickey Hart to John Mayer, which led to the formation of Dead & Company. He'd been in recent contact with Weir as well: “I texted with him maybe a month ago. It was about what we were gonna do this year. It was about playing. I thought there was a good chance he was gonna get better — and if anyone could, it would be him.”Was and Pan-Detroit — who are at the beginning of an 11-week run of shows — have been celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Dead's Blues for Allah album since last October, playing it in its entirety or in segments during the band's shows. 




	“I know [Weir] dug what we were doing with these songs,” Was said on Saturday. 


	The group switched the night's set list to start with the album's opening track, “The Music Never Stopped,” which Was called “one of the best songs [Weir] ever wrote … In the last few years we talked about the music going on when [the Grateful Dead members] were all gone, and he was very adamant about wanting it to continue. Even though he's left us … His music and his legacy will [go on].”Before Saturday's second show Was also posted a social media message reading: “I can't believe that Bobby's gone – it seemed like he'd outlast all of us. Playing with him in the Wolf Bros over the past 7 years has been one of the most meaningful and rewarding experiences of my life. Night after night, he taught us how to approach music with fearlessness and unbridled soul – pushing us beyond what we thought was musically possible. Every show was a transcendent adventure into the unknown. Every note he played and every word he sang was designed to bring comfort and joy to our audiences. The music he helped create over the last 60 years will continue to be felt for generations. As he sang in one of my favorite Dead songs: the music will never stop. It was an honor to play in his band and to be his friend. Heartfelt condolences go out to Natascha, Monet and Chloe and to all of the fans who considered him to be next of kin. We'll miss him forever.”Also hit hard by the news was Pan-Detroit saxophonist Dave McMurray, who was part of Was (Not Was) and records for Blue Note, including two Deadicated albums of Dead covers. Weir guested on a rendition of “Loner” from the first, and McMurray made guest appearances with the Wolfpack horn section that often accompanied the Wolf Bros.“I've been talking about him the last few days, just my experiences with them, 'cause we've been playing these [Blues For Allah] songs and he's the man that did all that music,” McMurray told Billboard. “I was so lucky I got to be around him, and he was so cool and so great to play with. I saw (the news) on Instagram and it's just freaked out. It doesn't seem real.”

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


Avatar: Fire and Ash is still the rage around the world with a global weekend of $86.9M, $65.6M of that minted in its fourth weekend abroad in 52 material territories taking the 20th Century Studios pic's foreign haul to $888M and global $1.23 billion. The trilogy's running cume is $6.5B. 


	That global take is down 52% off the holiday holdover frame last weekend with holds including Brazil (-24%), Australia (-31%), Spain (-41%) and UK (-41%).  The pic bowed as the No. 1 MPA title in Hong Kong this weekend with $900K (with previews cume stands at $2.3M). As we told you previously, the James Cameron movie remains 2025's second best MPA title in China with $149M behind Zootopia 2. 














	Among highlights, are that stateside ($21M), the threequel is the first domestic release to rank No. 1 for four weekends in a row since 2023's Barbie. 


			Watch on Deadline		







	After China, the next top territories for the Cameron 3D sci-fi epic is France ($91.7M), Germany ($73.7M), Korea ($48.5M), UK ($48M) and Mexico ($36.5M).


	Of the global take for the threequel, Disney can thank Imax for $12.2M this past weekend ($7M foreign, $1.7M China, and $3.5M domestic). The large format exhibitor's running total on the threequel stands at $159M ($48.5M domestic), the big picture corp's seventh highest grossing title ever. Overall, Imax theaters rep 13% of the pic's worldwide take. 


Zootopia 2 in full release in all markets raked in $40.9M global ($30.8M from 52 material territories, $10.1M domestic) for a running total of $1.276B worldwide, with $1.655B from foreign alone. That latter figure makes the sequel the No. 6 MPA international release of all-time, and the No. 1 MPA animated international release of all-time and No. 1 MPA international release of 2025 (as we previously told you). 

	











	Overall global weekend seven saw a -52% overall decline, with holds in key markets including Brazil (+9%), Australia (-2%), Japan (-41%), Mexico (-41%), and UK (-45%). The sequel remains the No. 1 pic in Japan and China for the weekend and No. 2 in Germany, Austria, Sweden, Switzerland, Czechia, Georgia, Qatar, Slovakia, South Africa, Uzbekistan, Australia, Korea (non-local), Singapore, Taiwan (non-local), Thailand, Hong Kong (non-local), Indonesia, Vietnam, and across all of Latin America (except Brazil and Mexico).


	China counts $611M in cume, followed by Japan $76.7M, France at $69.4M, Korea at $54.6M and Germany at $43.6M. 


	When it comes to movies funded by foreign sales, collecting exact weekend data takes time, so we'll have further updates for you later this AM or tomorrow. In the meantime, we know that Lionsgate's The Housemaid cleaned up another $25.5M from 66 territories this weekend for a running global take of $192.5M ($98.3M foreign). The Housemaid was the No. 1 in UK this weekend where it has taken in an estimated $23.7M to date. 


	As we told you, Anaconda slither past $100M this past weekend, global is now (updated) $110.1M with 63 international markets grossing $7.7 million from 11,900+ screens for an overseas total of $55.8M through today. Top market cumes: Australia ($8.1 million), UK ($6.4 million), Mexico ($4.7 million), Germany ($3.3 million), Brazil ($3.1 million).


	Universal International/Focus Features' Hamnet was great in the UK with $4.2M ($4.8M global weekend), making it the highest opening weekend for this year's awards contenders above One Battle After Another, Sinners and more than double Marty Supreme. The film has also topped the openings of A Complete Unknown, Little Women, The Favourite, Belfast, Poor Things and more than double Conclave. That's also the highest post Covid opening for a January release in the awards corridor in the UK, the 5th biggest January opening for a drama in the last decade, and second biggest drama opening since the start of 2025 behind only Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale. The Chloe Zhao movie is also Jessie Buckley's highest opening weekend in a leading role while Chloe Zhao and Paul Mescal will see Hamnet as their second highest respective openings behind Eternals ($7.3M unadjusted for inflation and currency swings) and Gladiator II ($11.4M). 


Song Sung Blue brought in $2.8M abroad in 52 territories, led by openings in Spain, Italy and Germany for a global weekend of $5.8M. Global stands at $40.7M for the Universal International/Focus Features Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson musical, $9.5M of that from offshore. 


	Germany counted $396K at 371 screens for a No. 10 debut, which included $163K previews. Business was impacted by winter storm “Elli”, which prompted official warnings to “stay home” with school closures and event cancellations. Spain grossed $98K at 196 screens, a No. 12 opening. Italy was $82K at 192 for a No. 12 opening in a soft market which was overall -34% from last weekend, we're told.  Australia posted $1.2M, for a solid -26% dip in weekend 2 ranking No. 5. The pic's $3.9M cume is above that of  A Complete Unknown at the same point. The second weekend for the Craig Brewer directed movie in the UK & Ireland saw $600K for a No. 8 rank and running cume of $2.5M, above The Holdovers, Manchester By The Sea and The Iron Claw at the same point.

	











	Paramount's Primate was limited in its overseas launch with only $2.1M this weekend, $925K of that from Mexico putting its global debut frame at $13.4M. Mexico booked the Johannes Roberts movie at 865 locations. Peru made $220K at 48 sites, Colombia $110K at 195, Argentina $106K at 160 sites, Israel $104K at 30, Central America was $80K from 22 theaters, Chile was $70K at 75 locations, while Hungary was $52K at 45 locations. All those figures included previews. The chimp crawls into France on Jan. 21, Australia on Jan. 22; Germany, Italy, Brazil and Korea on Jan. 29; UK on Jan. 30 and Spain on Feb. 6.

Grateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir has died at the age of 78.

A family statement posted to the Instagram account of the band's founding member on Saturday said he died “surrounded by loved ones.”

“It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,” the statement read, accompanied by a photo of the musician onstage.

“He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.”

The lengthy statement labeled Weir a “guitarist, vocalist, storyteller, and founding member of the Grateful Dead and said he will “forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music.” 

“His work did more than fill rooms with music; it was warm sunlight that filled the soul, building a community, a language, and a feeling of family that generations of fans carry with them,” it continued. 

The statement noted that Weir was diagnosed with cancer in July, beginning treatment “only weeks before returning to his hometown stage for a three-night celebration of 60 years of music at Golden Gate Park.” 

“An artist choosing, even then, to keep going by his own design,” the statement read.

The statement closed with the hope that Weir's legacy will “live on through future generations of Dead Heads.

“And so we send him off the way he sent so many of us on our way: with a farewell that isn't an ending, but a blessing. A reward for a life worth livin.'” 

“His loving family, Natascha, Monet, and Chloe, request privacy during this difficult time and offer their gratitude for the outpouring of love, support, and remembrance,” the family wrote.

“May we honor him not only in sorrow, but in how bravely we continue with open hearts, steady steps, and the music leading us home. Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings.”

A rep for the band did not immediately return Page Six's request for comment. 

Weir's death follows the deaths of founding members Phil Lesh in 2024, Jerry Garcia in 1995, and Ron “Pigpen” McKernan in 1973 — Weir leaves behind percussionist Mickey Hart, 82, and original drummer Bill Kreutzmann, 79.

The animal rights activist and vegetarian was 16 years old when he hooked up with Garcia in a Palo Alto, Calif., music store to play together, with the duo eventually forming a group that would ultimately include Hart, Kreutzmann and Lesh, and McKernan.

He received the 2016 Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2016 Americana Honors & Awards in Nashville, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. 

Weir married Natasha Münter in 1999, and the duo shared two grown daughters.

Per his daughter Chloe on Instagram, Bob Weir, guitarist, vocalist, and co-founder of the Grateful Dead, has passed away at age 78. “It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,” she wrote. “He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.” Chloe said that her father's “final months reflected the same spirit that defined his life. Diagnosed in July, he began treatment only weeks before returning to his hometown stage for a three-night celebration of 60 years of music at Golden Gate Park. Those performances, emotional, soulful, and full of light, were not farewells, but gifts. Another act of resilience.”

Born on the Bay in October 1947, Weir began playing guitar at age 13 after failing to figure out the piano and trumpet. His dyslexia got him kicked out of every school he attended, until he wound up at Fountain Valley in Colorado, where he'd meet future Grateful Dead lyricist John Perry Barlow. When Weir was 16, he and a buddy caught a whiff of banjo music in a Palo Alto back alley on New Year's Eve. They followed the trail all the way to Dana Morgan's Music Store, where a 21-year-old music teacher named Jerry Garcia was picking. He and Weir spent the night jamming together and struck up a group together, which Weir likened to the Beatles if they were a jug band. “What we saw them doing was impossibly attractive,” he said. “I couldn't think of anything else more worth doing.” They called themselves Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions and then, later, the Warlocks. Eventually they sorted the name out: the Grateful Dead.

Weir played rhythm guitar and sang lead on many Dead tunes. He ran point on a few of my favorites, like “Playing in the Band,” “Estimated Prophet,” and “Sugar Magnolia,” one of the best songs in the English language. Weir's guitar playing wasn't strong at first, but by the time drummer Mickey Hart left the band temporarily in 1971, he was one of the best around. His voicings were clearer than ever. “I found myself astonished, delighted, and excited beyond measure at what Bobby was doing,” bassist Phil Lesh, who later called Weir's style “quirky, whimsical, and goofy,” commented. He would tinker with slide guitar in the ‘70s, picking up ideas from hard bop pianist McCoy Tyner and gospel players like Rev. Gary Davis. Weir was also a catalyst in a couple other bands, including Kingfish, RatDog, Scraping the Children, Further, Bobby and the Midnites, the Bob Weir Band, and, most notably (alongside Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, and John Mayer), Dead & Company. Weir made his solo record, Ace, in 1972, and his last solo record, Blue Mountain, in 2016. 

Weir marks the third Dead member to die since 2024, joining the late Phil Lesh and Donna Jean Godchaux-MacKay across the bridge. May the four winds blow you safely home, Bob. Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings. Read Chloe's full statement below.

Oscar-nominated actress Dyan Cannon made a rare public appearance, with photos emerging of her walking in Beverly Hills wearing sunglasses and a bright cable-knit cardigan. Photos obtained by Daily Mail show her exiting her car. The photos have been shared just days after Cannon celebrated her 89th birthday on January 4. 

Take a look at her now! 

Cannon is celebrated for her work in “Heaven Can Wait” and “Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice,” both of which earned her Oscar nominations for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. She had a brilliant career that spanned decades and is remembered as a talented and beautiful star. 

Cannon may not often be photographed by paparazzi, but she does occasionally attend events and posts regularly on social media. On December 13, 2025, she posed for a photo on Instagram alongside her friend Patrick Foley. She looks gorgeous and incredibly youthful. At the time, she was 88.

“My wonderful Patrick and I attended a screening of the Springsteen movie… Brilliantly acted produced and directed… “ she wrote in the caption. “I had no idea that Bruce struggled with such depression, but God bless him. He's evidently conquered it, and is merrily on his way. Great music.! #Bruce lSpringsteen #bruce Springsteen movie #PatrickFoley.” 

Also during the Christmas season, Cannon shared a video on Instagram of herself playing the conga drums and sent her followers festive greetings. “Just saying HELLO, my friends… I'm enjoying my congas and on my way to see the #Lakers play I hope you're all having a wonderful evening filled with LIFE and #LOVE and #JOY,” Cannon captioned the video. 

Fans praised the actress. “You r so awesome! Miss seeing you! Happy holiday!!!!” a comment reads. “My name is Dyan- because of you,” another fan wrote.

Cannon was married twice, first to Old Hollywood star Cary Grant, who was over 30 years her senior, and later to film producer Stanley Fimberg. She reflected on being single and how her mindset has changed since she was younger in an interview with Fox News Digital. 

“It took me a long time to learn how to be happy by myself because I really thought I was incomplete without a man in my life,” she said. “I was raised to think that you marry, you have children, and that's what makes a happy life. And in my case, it wasn't. But I've learned how to be happy alone. There's great freedom in that because then you don't settle for the broken set of dishes. You're not with somebody just because you're lonely. You're not with someone just because you're afraid to be alone.”

She revealed she was open to dating but also had many friends.

Colombian music star Yeison Jimenez has passed away following a plane crash that claimed six lives, just hours before he was set to take the stage. As per a report in the US Sun, Jimenez, 34, was traveling with members of his team to a concert in Medellín when the aircraft went down shortly after takeoff and caught fire. 

Authorities later confirmed that no one on the board survived the devastating crash.

The crash occurred just after 4 p.m. local time on Saturday. Colombia's Civil Aviation Authority confirmed the deaths of the pilot, co-pilot, and four passengers, including Jimenez.

“Following the arrival of emergency services and the National Police at the crash site, the deaths of all six occupants of the aircraft have been confirmed,” the agency said in a statement, as published by US Sun. “Among the victims is the renowned popular music artist Yeison Jimenez.” 

The plane belonged to Jimenez's company, YJ Company SAS.

In the hours leading up to the flight, Jimenez and members of his team were photographed at a shop near the airport, where the singer happily posed for selfies with staff. 

ABC7 reports that the team was en route to Medellín for a scheduled performance.

Before boarding the aircraft, Jimenez shared a poignant post on Instagram. “Always humble, because what God gives you he can also take away,” he wrote, as reported by the US Sun.

Weisman Mora, his longtime photographer, shared a final video capturing the group together inside the plane as it taxied down the runway. He, too, was among the victims.

In addition to Jimenez and his photographer, the other victims of the crash were identified as pilot Hernando Torres, Juan Manuel Rodriguez, Oscar Marin, and Jefferson Osorio.

Jimenez began performing at just seven years old and later emerged as one of the most distinctive voices in Colombia's “musica popular,” a folk-influenced genre that traces its roots to the 1930s and 1940s.

Across his career, he released eight albums and penned more than 70 songs, leaving a lasting mark by helping the genre evolve for younger audiences.

In earlier interviews, Jimenez also spoke candidly about aviation. 

As per the US Sun, during a podcast appearance, he shared that he had experienced recurring dreams about dying in a plane crash.

Tributes poured in following the news of his death. Jimenez's stepdaughter, Camila Jimenez, whom he adopted after forming a family with his partner, Sonia Restrepo, shared a message on Instagram.

“I love you dad. You don't know how much it hurts me to see your videos and for you not to be here,” she wrote.

Fans echoed the grief online. One wrote, “Never thought I'd see a post like this so soon. How does this all hurt, much comfort to his family, praying for you”.

Another fan wrote: “You will always be the best. R.I.P. A news that is hard to believe. It hurts too much. God of strength to families. 🤍🕊️💔🧸 You leave a big void @yeison_jimenez 🤍😭”

A third one chimed in and wrote: “😢💔😭how I wish this was a lie💔what a great pain😭a great one is gone🙌my favorite singer forever🕊”

The regional government of Boyacá also released a statement naming all six victims.

“We regret the tragic accident that claimed the life of the well-known singer Yeison Jimenez, one of the most representative figures of Colombian popular music,” the statement read. 

“United in prayer we stand in solidarity.”

Jimenez is survived by his family, his children, and a devoted fan base that helped elevate him into one of Colombia's most influential contemporary artists.

So sad. Prayers for his family..

Actor Thomas Kent Carter — known professionally as T.K. Carter — sadly passed away on Friday, January 9, at the age of 69. Carter was found dead at his home in Duarte, California. Although no cause of death has been confirmed publicly, there is no foul play suspected.

One of Carter's most well known roles was playing Michael “Mike” Fulton in 24 episodes of season 2 of the NBC sitcom “Punky Brewster” from 1985 until 1986. Fulton was a “hip” and caring teacher who formed a bond with the eponymous Penelope “Punky” Brewster, played by Soleil Moon Frye.

Frye has recently taken to social media to pay a heartfelt tribute to Carter following his tragic passing.

Soleil Moon Frye took to her Instagram account to share her tribute to T.K. Carter with her 363,000 followers.

The post contained three photographs of Frye sharing the screen with Carter in “Punky Brewster.”

The caption on the post read: “One of our giants became an angel and may that angel surround us with his beautiful wings. TK Carter thank you, for your love, your kindness and your beautiful heart: always and forever beyond 🕊️💜@mrcarteryall @cheriejohnson1975 @amifosterdefries @caseyellison76 Love love love you Xx.”

It was a beautifully worded post that tagged several of Frye and Carter's fellow “Punky Brewster” stars: notably Cherie Johnson, Ami Foster, and Casey Ellison.

Soleil Moon Frye's followers replied in their droves with tributary words of shock, sympathy, and respect regarding T.K. Carter's passing.

One such person was actor Seth Green, who commented with a lengthy response about what Carter meant to him. Green wrote, “Aw man. Love him. After the Challenger exploded there was a special episode that discussed it. His character was so passionate about man's need to continue exploring space- it help me vocalize what I was feeling about the tragedy. Such a great actor.”

Another follower wrote, “No!!!!! I just started watching Punky again on peacock because it was my favorite show forever and ever, and I also told my kids today how much I loved that awesome teacher… to come here and find out he is now gone? I am heartbroken.”

Someone else said, “His role on the show was always so special to me as a little boy watching, and now at 44, I am reminded again by his impact. You both were two inspirations for me. May he rest in light! ❤️”

Finally, one user noted, “He was one of my favorite on the show. I am so sorry to hear this Soleil 😢.”

Carter's other credits include roles on television and in movies. His small screen credits include the sitcom “Just Our Luck,” the sitcom “The Sinbad Show,” and the teen sitcom “Good Morning.” His big screen credits include 1978's adventure comedy “Corvette Summer,” 1982's sci-fi horror remake “The Thing,” and 1996's live-action animated comedy “Space Jam” (per IMDb).

He will be missed. May he rest in eternal peace.

Ann-Margret is reflecting on one of the most emotionally demanding performances of her career — and the lasting impact it had on her off-screen.

In a recent interview with Interview Magazine, the 84-year-old entertainer opened up about portraying Blanche DuBois in the 1984 TV adaptation of Tennessee Williams' classic play “A Streetcar Named Desire.” Ann-Margret said the experience was difficult, describing the character as one she had to play with complete emotional honesty.

“Playing Blanche DuBois was a rough one,” she told the outlet. “I knew it had to be as honest as I could be, and that was it. I did the very best I could.”

Williams' Pulitzer Prize-winning play, first staged in 1947, remains one of the most celebrated works in American theater. Blanche, the tragic heroine at the center of the story, is frequently portrayed as a woman shaped by loss and trauma, gradually losing her grip on stability as her world closes in.

Ann-Margret said she was aware of the responsibility that came with taking on the part — and she also addressed long-standing reports that Williams had wanted her to play Blanche years before the TV film was ultimately produced.

Asked about rumors that the playwright pursued her for the role about a decade before the movie was made, Ann-Margret confirmed it meant a great deal to her.

“I was thrilled that he liked my work and he wanted me to do it,” she said. “I was thrilled! My goodness, Tennessee Williams. I admired him so much.”

Although Williams died in February 1983 — one year before the movie premiered — Ann-Margret said his interest in her work remained a meaningful part of the story behind her casting.

Ann-Margret also confirmed reports that she had trouble letting go of the role once filming wrapped. While discussing the emotional weight of the performance, she recalled the final day of filming, when director John Erman stepped in with a reminder she needed in the moment.

She said Erman told her it was “just a movie,” after people noticed she was crying when she was alone.

“Oh, yeah, because people saw me crying when I was all alone,” she told Interview Magazine. “And that's when he came in and said that, because I had gotten to such a point that I was always sad, so that's when he came in.”

She added that it took time to fully step away from the emotional mindset she carried while playing Blanche.

She confirmed it took her “a while” to “get out of that mindset as Blanche DuBois.”

In the same Interview Magazine conversation, Ann-Margret also shared a memory from her early career involving late Hollywood legend Bette Davis.

Ann-Margret said her first film role left a lasting impression thanks to the two-time Oscar winner, who she worked with on the 1961 movie “Pocketful of Miracles.” Though Davis had a reputation for being tough,

Ann-Margret said she experienced a supportive side of the star on set.

“I played her daughter and I really felt like it,” Ann-Margret told the magazine.

She recalled one specific moment that stayed with her: Davis reportedly stopped production to ensure Ann-Margret looked her best before a close-up scene.

“I was about to have a close-up,” she said. “I didn't know [about] close-shot, medium-shot, you know. She was there and she, at one point, stopped all the filming and said, ‘Ann-Margret, this is your close-up, I want you to look as good as you possibly can. Makeup! Hair!'”

After the crew touched her up, Ann-Margret said Davis gave the OK to continue.

“The makeup person and hair person came and when they finished she looked and said, ‘Okay, now we can go on,'” Ann-Margret continued. “Oh, she was lookin' out for me.”

When Sara Bareilles took the stage to speak at the Luckman Club at Soho House West Hollywood on Friday, she was surrounded by an audience that understood the unique challenges and joys of writing music. The intimate room was filled with members of the Alliance for Women Film Composers, which hosted the event in partnership with IndieWire. All of them were eager to hear the Grammy winner and Tony nominee discuss “Salt Then Sour Then Sweet,” the song she wrote with Brandi Carlile for “Come See Me in the Good Light” that landed on the Oscar shortlist for Best Original Song.

 










Bareilles was joined by AWFC co-president Allyson Newman for a wide-ranging conversation about Bareilles' involvement in IndieWire Honoree Ryan White's Apple documentary about the late poet and activist Andrea Gibson and Bareilles' approach to her entire artistic career. 






“I got introduced to a lot of their video sort of blogs around the cancer diagnosis and I couldn't get over how much humor and buoyancy they were able to weave into such a dark diagnosis,” Bareilles said of her first encounters with Gibson. “I thought that was a part of why I think they're a miracle worker.”

 










Bareilles explained that she wasn't always attached as a songwriter. She simply believed in the producing team's vision of telling Gibson's story and joined as an investor and executive producer. Getting the opportunity to turn Gibson's poetry into song lyrics was just an added bonus. 

“They were trying to make this film in a different way and not go to big studios and not go to big movie houses,” she said. “They wanted it to stay very bespoke. They wanted it to be people who really loved Andrea and understood the mission. And so I said yes. And it has like tumbled forward into so many beautiful unforeseen gifts. One of them being making a song with Andrea's unfinished poems and Brandi Carlile that is now featured in the film.”

While Bareilles' involvement as a songwriter might have started out of necessity, she made it clear that she and fellow producer Carlile were eager for the chance to adapt Gibson's unfinished work. 

“The original conceit for the film was that the director Ryan White and Andrea had spoken about Andrea composing a new original poem just for the film. And when they got to the end of the film, it sort of felt to them like their poetry quotient was sort of met and the poem wasn't finished. And so Andrea had just sort of like collected a couple of pages of couplets, a few stanzas. There was a lot, thematically, it was a lot about their love of Meg, their partner,” she said. “Brandi and I, both being on the executive producing team were like, ‘Put me in, coach.' I would love to sit with those unfinished poetry, with that unfinished poetry and see if there's a song to be made there. And so after the first time I watched the film, I was stunned. I don't know how many of you have seen the film. I highly, highly, highly recommend it. And I had nothing to do with why the film is so beautiful. It's just the magic of these people.”

 










Teaming up with another equally established songwriter, and working with lyrics written by someone else, was a new challenge for Bareilles. But the circumstances led to a unique creative process that was richer because all three women were involved.  

“I have never collaborated quite in this way before, so I write lyrics. And so working from a page of some of the most beautiful and quirky and interesting perspectives… I just like to say, ‘Keep the Novocaine out of my wisdom teeth. I want to feel it all.' I would never write that line myself, but as soon as I see it on the page, I'm like, ‘That's fucking actually brilliant,'” she said. “And that's one of the things I love about Andrea's work and I bought all their books and highly recommend for the writers out there. There's just a lot of inspiration to be taken, a lot of medicine from their work. And yeah, this collaboration was really unique and it was a really joyful one and I loved getting to celebrate our differences in making something together. That felt really beautiful.”

Bareilles didn't shy away from the fact that “Come See Me in the Good Light” deals with dark subject matter, but Gibson made it clear that she never wanted her documentary to exclusively be a film about death. She wanted it to be a story about her love for her partner, Meg, and Bareilles was happy to oblige — even if it meant going back on her famous promise to never write a love song for someone who asked for one. 

 










“The only direction that Andrea gave is that they didn't want people to leave and hear a sad song,” she said. “They wanted something uplifting and they really wanted something that was about how much they loved Meg. So it felt like, great, we're going to write a love song for Meg. That's perfect. And I am aware of the, I'm not going to write you a love song. And yes, I did. I did write the love song. Pun very much intended.”

The artist Margaret Belew sent a letter to her husband describing the total immersion and creative agony she felt around her latest painting. She told him about the hours she had devoted; the strange mind games she played to maintain a sense of objective distance; the ultimate, inevitable loss of all perspective. Things were looking good as she neared completion, and her words hinted at an incoming wave of hard-earned fulfillment. But one line rings a little louder than the rest: “I wish you were here to see it.”

By the early 1980s, Adrian Belew was in demand as a touring guitarist, the kind of work that keeps you perpetually employed and inspired but also in transit. Wiry and smirking and virtuosic, he made his name keeping up with the hairpin idiosyncrasy of Frank Zappa during his most commercially successful era, the alien glow of David Bowie on his fantastic late-'70s voyages, and the Talking Heads as they became a nervy, flickering signpost for the sound of the young decade. Always serving the music and never repeating himself, Belew was enjoying an improbable ascent for a guy who once deferred his musical ambition to play drums in a lounge act at the Holiday Inn because at least he knew the checks would come on time.

Back in those days, the Kentucky-born musician would trudge back home after his shifts, numbed by the repetitive work, and listen to the mind-expanding sound of King Crimson to remind himself what real art could do. A lot of people joined Belew in this activity during the formative progressive rock band's brief existence. From the paranoid Mellotron orchestras of their 1969 debut, In the Court of the Crimson King, to the hard-edged nightmares of their swan song, 1974's Red, Robert Fripp led Crimson not as a rock band but as “a way of doing things,” ensuring that no two records would follow the same path and allowing him to swap bandmates, shift genres, and ultimately, abandon the project just as it appeared on the verge of a major breakthrough.

This is partially why, for the first time since his days at the Holiday Inn, Belew felt a tinge of insecurity when called to front a new band with Fripp in 1981. “I thought everything I was doing was a load of crap,” he explained. “I couldn't write songs and I began to feel maybe I wasn't a singer.” As described in Margaret's letter, these crises of confidence are part of any artist's journey toward self-gratification. But since his pioneering work with Crimson, Fripp had taken interest in some new influences that were esoteric even for him—particularly Indonesian gamelan music, where emphasis falls on the collective as a group of musicians perform the same melodies at the same time on percussion instruments.

By this point, Fripp was well-known for his cerebral nature. He was the intimidating, discerning professor, the kind who even the kids he flunked had to respect. (One interviewer noted how Fripp would request their word count so that he could parse out his answers accordingly.) But this new direction arrived from his own creative crisis. Since ending King Crimson in fall 1974, he had been through a number of transformations: retiring from the industry, studying at J. G. Bennett's International Academy for Continuous Education, getting really into “Fourth Way” mystic philosopher George Gurdjieff, and eventually returning to music with a heightened focus.

This journey led to some of the objectively coolest music of the era—like his work with Peter Gabriel and Brian Eno—and some of the objectively least cool—like the League of Crafty Guitarists, in which a bunch of guitar students, dressed exactly like him, tested out his picking exercises in unison while perched in cult-like formation. (It's worth watching.) Now based in New York, Fripp was energized by the younger music scenes rising around him—the same ones driving his peers in prog rock to obsolescence by comparison—and felt a need to shift his approach.

“I simply woke up at 8 o'clock and jumped out of bed because, when one has these little flashes, you can't sit about with them,” he would later reflect on the epiphany that drove what he referred to as his “drive to 1981.” The revelation was this: I don't play music. Music plays me. It sounds like a hippie mantra. But consider it from the perspective of the begrudging founder of a progressive rock institution who would settle for nothing less than total reinvention with each record. “We're so busy rushing around the streets with all of this, we fail to notice that our friend music is knocking on the door,” he explained.

The group of musicians Fripp assembled in 1981 were meant to launch his next big creative project. There was drummer Bill Bruford, the only remaining member from previous iterations of Crimson. On bass he invited Tony Levin, a natural-born collaborator as proficient in melodic soft-rock as wonky jazz fusion. And then there was Belew, enlisted to help bring Fripp's new guitar sound to life, picking together in intricate rhythmic patterns, like the trick where someone lays their hand on the table and stabs a knife between their fingers at increasingly rapid speeds. (Imagine two people doing this simultaneously, their hands interlinked.)

At first, the band was called Discipline to reflect Fripp's larger philosophical motivation. A note on the back cover of the finished album reads, “Discipline is never an end in itself; only a means to an end.” But as the band gathered material, it became clear this group was another steady evolution of Fripp's most famous collective. Though it was just a name, it was a loaded decision: Since they'd been away, prog had garnered new connotations as music for fusty old British dudes, a backlash that Fripp had foreseen. As more visceral, streamlined genres attracted the youth, he was quick to assert that he had always felt more of a kinship with the new generation. By releasing new music as King Crimson, he gave himself a chance to, once again, redefine the parameters of his work.

The triumph of Discipline is on how many criteria it succeeds. Like Genesis on Duke, the members of King Crimson had upgraded their equipment for a new era, assuring that, not only could no one else play like them, few could even identify the instruments. Bruford played primarily on electronic drums, and Levin introduced an instrument called the Chapman Stick, a 10-string slab of wood that allowed his playing to sound like flamenco guitar filtered through chorus pedals. This hyperactive rhythm section allowed Belew and Fripp to expand the definition of lead guitarists. At various points, Belew mimics the sounds of seagulls and elephants; Fripp finds a balance between new age serenity and proto-prog metal riffage.

Unlike Genesis on Duke, King Crimson could not write anything resembling pop music—a challenge they would continue to present themselves throughout the decade—but they did embrace new ways of making their music pop. Like Yes on 90125, they embraced the decade's sense of overstimulation and hyperactivity with aid from producer Rhett Davies. Sometimes this meant sampling a conversation about crime on the streets—a slice of studio vérité in “Thela Hun Ginjeet” captures Belew exasperatedly telling his bandmates about being mugged—and other times it's baked into the songwriting itself: “Frame by Frame” is an oblong, polyrhythmic kind of anthem, as intricately composed as anything from the band's early days while also sounding like it could somehow fit in an episode of Miami Vice.

The clearest inspiration is Talking Heads: strained and neurotic and pulsing as if trying to rush through a more traditional set of music while the fire alarm is going off. Belew would carve out his own idiom within this framework, but you can hear him exploring the template to find his voice. The opening “Elephant Talk” is remarkable for the music alone: Levin's woozy Chapman riff could lead a funk song if transposed to a major key. The way Fripp filters his solo through a synthesizer could make you think your record is warped. And to lead the song, Belew goes letter-by-letter listing synonyms for “conversation,” momentarily recusing himself from the task of writing intelligent lyrics and acknowledging the tedium with a grin that bursts through his delivery. (“These are words with a D this time,” he nudges, in case we didn't notice.)

It sounds like music-nerd humor—and it is. But it marks an important update for this era of King Crimson. They could laugh at themselves. Gone were the days of elaborate concepts, old-timey characters, and aspirations toward modern classical composition. Credit perhaps goes to Belew's fellowship with Zappa, or Fripp's growing resistance to being pegged as some humorless tyrant. “You know, I spend more time thinking about dessert than I do thinking about the ramifications of the industry,” he reminded a journalist at Creem. “Chocolate cake at Un Deux Trois, actually, is currently on my mind.”

If there was room for dessert, so too was there room for romance, and one of the first songs completed for Discipline is also its most beautiful. Fripp had shared with Belew a new chord progression—a little bluesy, a little Beatlesy, first used in his solo song called “North Star” from his guest-filled 1981 solo album Exposure. He enlisted Daryl Hall to lead that version of the rendition, who accompanied its lazy groove with a kind of fragmented lullaby. Belew heard something more pained: He took inspiration from his Japanese-to-English translation book—the title is “Matte Kudesai,” or “Please Wait”—and closed his eyes to serenade a lover somewhere far away. “She sleeps in a chair,” he sings, “in her sad America.”

“Matte Kudesai” was the first single from Discipline, which makes sense: It is maybe the only Crimson song that could be played at a wedding, and it's the closest thing to the era's analogous ballads from fellow prog bands trying to evolve gracefully. Even within Crimson, it marked a kind of breakthrough: the moment when Belew regained his confidence writing songs, contributing guitar parts, and leading a band. As he glides over the scenery, high up on the fretboard with a slide to summon a beachside caw, he finds a way to guide his bandmates to new territory: sounds like a vacation, feels like home.

“Matte Kudesai” was not a hit, and Discipline did not do for Crimson what Duke or 90125 did for Genesis or Yes. Maybe it could have if more of the record followed in this spirit, with its otherworldly tenderness and openness to singalong melody. Instead, Discipline is restless and uneasy, pushing the boundaries of what a Crimson song can be. The instrumental closers, “The Sheltering Sky” and “Discipline,” remain dazzling for their intensity: the former with its sci-fi ambience and churning Bruford rhythms, the latter by transporting the heaviness of Red to a pristine studio environment that still feels futuristic. (There is a reason why the following decade's rock bands, from Nirvana to Tool, would cite Crimson as a crucial influence.)

But the greatest breakthrough of Discipline was a creative one. Did it live up to Fripp's vision of a band played by its music? In a sense. His ambition was to craft records in which it was impossible to distinguish which musician played which part, what instrument conjured what sound. This was partially what drew him to gamelan: “The natural product of our particular culture is the star system,” he said in 1982. “You couldn't conceivably have stars within gamelan.” In response to the “so-called industrial capitalist culture” Fripp saw around him, he posited this new iteration of Crimson as a kind of utopia: Everyone had a crucial role in the songwriting, everyone got paid equally, and no one member led the band. Even more than the studio records from this lineup—there would be two more, 1982's Beat and 1984's Three of a Perfect Pair, with slightly diminishing returns—I hear this approach in the live recordings, when this material really came alive and performing it became second nature.

It makes sense—Discipline, after all, is only a means to an end. This is perhaps why, when it came time for Belew to add a spoken-word vocal part to a mind-bendingly complicated rhythmic instrumental, his thoughts turned to a letter his wife had sent him on the road. Every artist knows the struggle of maintaining a healthy balance between your work, your ego, and your ambition. Everyone aspires to the level of confidence that quiets the fear of failure, impervious to what an audience might think. By writing a song that—even if you just want to tap your foot to it—refuses to go with the flow, shifting between moods and volumes and rhythmic patterns, the band shows us what a work in progress feels like, with no end in sight.

The defining quality of “Indiscipline” is that it never finds resolution. It creeps and lurches and lashes out; it begs for your attention and retreats just as soon as you start following its logic. To fit the words of Margaret's letter to music, Belew removed all references that would identify the subject (“Most people think it's about a Rubik Cube or whatever that thing is called,” he joked at the time) and added his own Byrne-esque fits of neurosis to break up the narrative: “I repeat myself when under stress,” he says, calmly, four-and-a-half times. And then there's that line about wishing you were here to see it, which leaps from his throat like a cry for help.

On a recent tour where Belew and Levin regrouped to perform Crimson's '80s material under the name Beat—with Steve Vai filling in for Fripp and Tool's Danny Carey filling in for Bruford—the clearest takeaway was how much this music belongs to Belew, despite Fripp's intention for a leaderless collective. All this time later, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone delivering such wildly complicated material so fluidly, and with such a big smile on his face. In concert, the band extends “Indiscipline” to roughly double the length of the studio version, and the words that once existed between two married artists coming to terms with their processes become a communal experience, delivered not just by the beaming virtuoso on stage but also among an audience of thousands, who at some point in the preceding decades, heard a part of themselves in its knotted, confusing twist of emotions. Together they brace themselves for the final line, which for all the preceding tantrums and spirals, could not be misinterpreted or challenged. “I like it,” Belew shouts, and the audience applauds.

Billy Strings paid tribute to Bob Weir following news of the Grateful Dead guitarist's death Saturday at the age of 78.


	“We are all completely devastated  but I also can't help but feel like he is at total peace and more magical now than he ever was. I've never knew a person so in tune with the cosmos. Who was so mystical and smart and mysterious, alluring and radiant,” Strings wrote on social media.


	“He was a star wrangler .. a celestial skysage who traded fear for wonder. Now he is riding the northern lights and skipping barefoot between the constellations… We took a while to try to understand the news and then told some beautiful stories about our times with him.. but eventually we decided to pick ourselves up and got back to recording our music because that's what he would have wanted us to do. As he said ‘There's work to be done.'” 


	Strings collaborated with Weir onstage on a number of occasions over the past half-decade, including most recently — and finally — at the Dead 60 shows in San Francisco in August 2025, where Strings served as opening act before joining Dead & Company for “Wharf Rat.”

	“I'll always cherish the memories I have of Bob .. of hanging out in his hotel room and him showing me his record collection and mobile recording rig. Sitting there listening to kind of blue in silence. Soaking in the frequencies. Of him busting into ‘when I paint my masterpiece' at my wedding.. and in an instant he turned the place into a joyous musical celebration. It was the greatest gift anyone could have given us,” Strings wrote.

	











	“He was always ready to ‘Kick up a fuss' He always had boundless time and knowledge to share with everyone and was truly one of the kindest people I've ever known. The world is a better place because of him. I'm extremely grateful to have crossed paths with him in this life.”


	Strings joins the chorus of celebrities, musicians, politicians, and many more who honored Weir following news of his death.

	When Bob Weir gave his final public performance last August in Golden Gate Park with Dead & Company, Trey Anastasio set the stage. The Phish frontman opened the show, one of three gigs commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Grateful Dead. Following Weir's death at 78, Anastasio remembered his friend and musical colleague in a lengthy tribute.


	“This one really hurts. I really loved him. He was a sweet, kind, gentle friend, and I never believed this would happen so soon,” Anastasio wrote on Instagram, going on to reference the Dead's goodbye shows in 2015, Fare Thee Well.“I knew Bobby for many years, but it was in the lead-up to Fare Thee Well that we really became close,” Anastasio recalled. “I went out to his beach house, and we spent three nights there alone, just the two of us: playing guitar, cooking scrambled eggs, listening to records, working out, talking, and walking on the beach. We went out to dinner together, and he let me drive his new car.”


	At Weir's house, they talked in depth about the Grateful Dead member's formative years. “He told me how he was still in high school when the first acid test happened. When it was over, the sun came out, and he had to do his math homework as he raced back to school on the train. He said after the second or third acid test, he looked down at his homework and said, ‘Nah.' And that was it,” Anastasio wrote. “The rest of his life was on the road, in the Grateful Dead and other bands.”

	“The more I got to know Bobby, the more I liked him,” he added. “I learned so much from him. He talked to me about all the loss around the Grateful Dead, so many friends who had died. He said that John Belushi was backstage at a Dead show the night before he died, looking very grey and unhealthy, and Bobby told him he might want to think about slowing down. I believe that all of that loss gave him a unique and beautiful perspective on life. Rest in peace, Bobby. Thank you for all the gifts you brought into the world, and for all the love you gave to so many of us.”Anastasio is one of many musicians and public figures paying tribute to Weir. Don Felder, Micah Nelson, Bravo personality Andy Cohen, and Don Was, Weir's bandmate in the Wolf Bros, all shared their tributes online.

	











	“The music he helped create over the last 60 years will continue to be felt for generations,” Was wrote. “As he sang in one of my favorite Dead songs: ‘the music will never stop.'”

Bob Weir was the everyman at the heart of the Grateful Dead, the one who kept the band's feet on the ground through their farthest-reaching explorations. In the first 30 years of the band's existence, he was an indispensable foil to Jerry Garcia; he was right there in the instrumental mix, rolling with every extended jam, and when it was his turn to sing lead, his songs became standards. After Garcia's death in 1995, Weir took a key role in keeping the band's flame alive, performing their material for new audiences right up through the summer of 2025 with his own projects and with Dead and Co. Here are 11 of the songs we'll remember him for.


This song initially appeared as part three of a four-part suite on the Dead's second album, 1968's Anthem of the Sun. But while the rest of that sprawling psychedelic vision faded from view soon enough, Weir's chapter — a rare cowrite with drummer Bill Kreutzmann — stayed a beloved element in their set for many years to come. The line “the heat came round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day” was based on a true story: “I was arrested for throwing a water balloon at a cop,” Weir recalled in Blair Jackson and David Gans' 2015 oral history of the Dead, This Is All a Dream We Dreamed. “He was conducting an illegal search on a car belonging to a friend of mine, directly below 710 Ashbury…. I thought this was an illegal search, and it incensed me. Besides, we were having a water balloon fight inside the house at the time.” —Simon Vozick-Levinson


	The Grateful Dead wrote the loping “Truckin'” as a group, but Bob Weir claimed the lead vocals, which meant he got to sing one of the defining lyrics of the 20th century: “What a long, strange trip it's been.”  His rhythm guitar anchors the song's gloriously shaggy, could-only-be-the-Dead groove, which ambles along like a Robert Crumb character come to musical life. (Which is appropriate, since the chorus borrows from a Crumb cartoon that was, in turn, inspired by a Blind Boy Fuller lyric.) —Brian Hiatt


	The Dead performed “Sugar Magnolia” more than 600 times, and with good reason. Co-written with longtime Dead lyricist Robert Hunter, it's a sunny tribute that Weir penned for his girlfriend Frankie, whom he lived with in the early Seventies. (“Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double/Pays my ticket when I speed” — man, this woman was a saint.) The American Beauty highlight became a joyous anthem for Deadheads, usually the most euphoric moment of any show, and sometimes with a trippy “Sunshine Daydream” coda tacked on (the longer, the jammier, the better). The song also has a memorable moment in Runaway Bride, when Julia Roberts nearly marries the Deadhead, but doesn't — a mistake on her part. —Angie Martoccio


	Robert Hunter's lyrics imagine a kind of ur-hippie mystic who leaves the straight world behind: “Standing on a tower, world at my command/You just keep on turning while I'm playing in the band.” Weir's honest vocals saved those words from sounding egotistical — the way he sings it, he's on an genuine, open-eyed journey. And the music he composed for “Playing in the Band” proved remarkably flexible, as the instrumental break in the middle of the song became the home of some of the Dead's farthest-traveling jams onstage in the decades after its initial release in 1971. —S.V.L.


	Legend has it that John Phillips wrote this rollicking cowboy yarn in a drunken haze circa 1963, so wasted he didn't even remember composing it. It's been covered by many, including both Judy Collins and Joni Mitchell, but the definitive rendition belongs to Weir, who made it the single most-performed song of the Dead's 30-year career. He really made you believe he'd been there in that saloon, sweating bullets at that fateful card game. And he sold the savage twist in the song's closing lines like no one else could. —S.V.L.


	The U.S. blues of a long-haired American kid on the road, trying to hitch a ride, feeling like a stranger in his own country. Weir sings about standing out on the highway with his thumb out, on a cold night, after leaving a broken romance in St. Louis. His only company is the headlights of all the cars and trucks and buses that pass by without picking him up. “Black-Throated Wind” was a highlight of his 1972 solo debut, Ace, with a typically thorny Weir melody and a tale inspired by John Perry Barlow's experience on a road trip through the South. The Dead played this constantly in 1972, gave it up after 1974, but revived it in 1990 with heavily reworked words. It never sounded windier or lonelier than the definitive 8/2/7/72 version in Veneta, Oregon, in the 100-degree sunshine. —Rob Sheffield


	The mournful “Looks Like Rain,” cowritten with Barlow, found Weir saying goodbye to a lover who just left him early one morning. “Run me around and make me hurt again and again,” he sings, “But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letters of your name.” With a country-tinged chord progression that jerks around like a gentle panic attack, all while Jerry Garcia's steel guitar keens and whines around Weir's voice and Keith Godchaux's piano plods heavenward, the song was an emotional peak for Weir on Ace. —Kory Grow


	The lilting loveliness of this Dead mainstay belies the lyrics, which push it into murder-ballad territory: “Jack Straw from Wichita cut his buddy down,” Weir sings. (The song, never released on a studio album, featured just Weir on lead vocals early on, but he soon started sharing with Jerry Garcia.) Weir wrote the song with Hunter after catching an adaptation of Of Mice and Men on TV. “Hunter had this lyric,” Weir told Uncut. “I grabbed it, and we came with a little sketch of heartland Americana, a ballad about two ne'er-do-wells.” —B.H.


	Among the Dead's best-known guitar melodies is the opening to “Cassidy,” a song Weir wrote with John Barlow that made its debut in the early Seventies. Both a reference to the death of Neil Cassady, a noted figure in the Beat generation, and to birth, it features reflective, spiritual lyrics — “Flight of the seabirds/Scattered like lost words” — through a bright, lifting groove. “Cassidy” was a staple of Weir's sets in side projects like RatDog and Dead & Company, and its hymn-like characteristics have made the song a multi-generational fan favorite. Its final missive feels all the more relevant today: “Fare thee well now/Let your life proceed by its own design/Nothing to tell now/Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine.” —Shirley Halperin


	“My time coming any day,” Weir growls on this apocalyptic reggae stomp, which he wrote with Barlow. Garcia's bubbling, envelope-filter guitar effect made this Terrapin Station gem groove even harder, a perfect ingredient any time it hit the stage — which happened often. The Dead's 1977 shows are legendary for a reason, and “Estimated Prophet” is an essential part of them, from Cornell University's Barton Hall to San Francisco's Winterland. And when Weir sings “Californiaaaaa!” on the chorus, all that's left is pure euphoria. —A.M.


	“I may be goin' to hell in a bucket, babe,” Weir sings on this riotous single from 1987's In the Dark, “but at least I'm enjoyin' the ride.” The song has an easygoing, circular chord progression, custom-made for bluesy jammy solos, and John Barlow's lyrics, which were far from progressive, made for a whimsical video that found Weir rolling around zebra-patterned sheets while arguing with a woman he's trying to set up with a biker and another scene in which he's riding in the back seat of a convertible with a flute of champagne and a goose in a choker. Weir enjoyed the ride, and the song became a set-list staple. —K.G.

Bob Weir, the singer, songwriter, guitarist and co-founder of the Grateful Dead, died today at age 78. Weir helped shape the Dead's 60-year legacy as the leaders of psych-rock, and became known as a restless musician who toured solo and with several side bands well into his 70s. 

Weir was born in San Francisco and started playing guitar when he was 13. As a teenager, he encountered Jerry Garcia, after hearing him play the banjo. They co-founded the Dead as the Warlocks, soon changing the name to the Grateful Dead. In addition to his improvisational approach to guitar, Weir contributed as a writer on some of the band's most enduring songs, including “Truckin',” “Sugar Magnolia,” “Cassidy,” and more. 

Weir helped lead the band through the fruitful creative decades in the Seventies and Eighties. He started playing with Kingfish on the side in the mid-Seventies, and later started the Bob Weir Band and released two albums with Bobby and the Midnites. In the mid-Nineties, after Garcia's death, Weir continually honored his bandmate with some of their classic material at shows and performances over the decades. In 2015, he formed Dead & Company, a band kept their music alive among younger generations.

“The interesting thing is, I've never made plans,” he told Rolling Stone in 2025. “And I'm not about to, because I'm too damn busy doing other stuff, trying to get the sound right, trying to get the right chords, trying to get the right words, trying to get all that stuff together for the storytelling. And really, making plans seems like a waste of time. Because nothing ever works out like you expected it to, no matter who you are. So why bother?”

Below, we celebrate Weir's life and legacy in photos.

Bob Weir in a candid portrait in 1965 in San Francisco, where he was born. The singer, writer, and guitarist co-founded the Grateful Dead after meeting Jerry Garcia when he was just 16.

Members of the Grateful Dead and friends were busted at their 710 Ashbury home by narcotics police on Oct. 2, 1967 for possession of marijuana. Ron “Pig Pen” McKernan (not seen in photo) and Weir, right front, were among the band members arrested. They were released after six hours in jail.

Garcia, Weir, and Bill Kreutzmann perform onstage at the Tivoli Concert Hall in April 1972 in Copenhagen, Denmark. 

When Matthew Kelly co-founded Kingfish in 1973, his longtime friend Weir joined in, touring with the band members on their first two albums. 

Garcia, Weir, and Phil Lesh perform at Winterland in California on Dec. 30, 1976. The band had briefly stopped touring in the early Seventies, but did record the live double album Steal Your Face, which dropped that year.
 

Mickey Hart, Donna Jean Godchaux, Bob Weir, Jerry Garcia and Bill Kreutzmann perform at Winterland Arena in San Francisco, California on June 9, 1977. 

Weir and Lesh perform at Kaiser Auditorium in Oakland on Dec. 30, 1979. They'd kicked off that year by playing Madison Square Garden for the first time, leading a two-night run at the famed arena.

Weir performs at the Greek Theater in Berkeley in 1981. The Eighties were a huge decade for the Dead, with their biggest hit “Touch of Grey” released in 1987.

Weir poses for a portrait with all of his band members, including Lesh, Hart, Garcia, Bill Kreutzmann, and Brent Mydland.

Weir performs alongside saxophonist Clarence Clemons at an Earth Day celebration in 1990 at Crissy Field in San Francisco, California, reflecting the Dead's longtime activism and commitment to environmental issues.

Vince Welnick, Weir, and Garcia kicked off a 1993 game between the Florida Marlins and the San Francisco Giants by singing the national anthem at Candlestick Park. The three of them sang a cappella, surprisng fans.

Most of the Grateful Dead made it to their induction Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction, but Garcia skipped the festivities since he disliked the organization. Here, Weir and his band members pose with a cut-out of Garcia.

The Grateful Dead speaks during an outdoor press conference at the U.S. Festival at Glen Helen Regional Park in San Bernardino, California, September 5, 1982. The three-day event included Fleetwood Mac, Jimmy Buffett, and Jackson Browne on the line-up.

Weir, Lesh, Hart, and Hornsby formed The Other Ones in 1998. Here, they perform at Irvine Meadows. 

Weir and James Taylor unite to play the Bridge School Benefit, an annual concert organized by Neil Young, at the Shoreline Amphitheater on Oct. 27, 2002. 

Weir played at the first edition of Bonnarool in June 2002, joining Lesh and Friends during a set that included Grateful Dead favorites ike “Franklin's Tower,” “Jack Straw,” and “Sugar Magnolia.”

Weir returned to Bonnaroo to perform with Warren Haynes and Gov't Mule.

The band got together in 2015 for Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead, a series of concerts that celebrated their decades-long history together. The performances took place at Santa Clara's Levi Stadium in June 2015, and later at Chicago's Soldier Field in July 2015. 

The Fare Thee Well shows weren't the end. Weir kept playing with Dead & Company, a band that introduced the Dead to younger generations, and they launched a seven-week tour in June 2016.

	The music world was busy mourning David Bowie on the 10-year anniversary of his death on Saturday when the devastating word hit that we lost another icon of almost indescribable significance to rock history: Bob Weir. 


	“He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could,” the Weir family wrote in a public statement. “Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.”


	The road was Weir's home from the moment the Grateful Dead formed in 1965 all the way through last summer. His projects outside the Grateful Dead included RatDog, Furthur, Bob Weir and Wolf Bros, and Dead & Company. At almost any given time, he had shows on the books with at least one of them.


	“The interesting thing is, I've never made plans,” he told Rolling Stone‘s Angie Martoccio last March. “And I'm not about to, because I'm too damn busy doing other stuff, trying to get the sound right, trying to get the right chords, trying to get the right words, trying to get all that stuff together for the storytelling. And really, making plans seems like a waste of time. Because nothing ever works out like you expected it to, no matter who you are. So why bother?”

	Dead & Co. wrapped up a farewell tour in July 2023, but they continued to play residencies at Sphere in Las Vegas throughout 2024 and 2025. And they came together one last time in August 2025 for three shows in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park to celebrate the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary. Throughout the three evenings, they were joined by Billy Strings, Trey Anastasio, Grahame Lesh, and Sturgill Simpson.

	











	These were joyous concerts filled with Deadheads from around the globe, but Weir was holding a secret: He was diagnosed with cancer weeks earlier, and had just started treatment. “Those performances, emotional, soulful, and full of light, were not farewells, but gifts,” the Weir family wrote. “Another act of resilience. An artist choosing, even then, to keep going by his own design.”

	The final night wrapped up with “Touch of Grey,” perhaps the most famous tune in the Dead songbook. Weir sang lead, and the band stretched it out for nearly eight minutes. At the end, Weir took a group bow with the full band, waved to the crowd, and then took a special bow with Mickey Hart, the only other original member of the Dead in Dead & Co., before they walked off together. It was his final live appearance. 


	“There is no final curtain here, not really,” wrote the Weir family. “Only the sense of someone setting off again. He often spoke of a three-hundred-year legacy, determined to ensure the songbook would endure long after him. May that dream live on through future generations of Dead Heads. And so we send him off the way he sent so many of us on our way: with a farewell that isn't an ending, but a blessing. A reward for a life worth livin'.”


	It's way too early to seriously contemplate the future of Dead & Co., but it's somewhat hard to imagine them continuing outside of a tribute concert to Weir. He was the heart and soul of the group.

	That said, Weir himself once said he hoped to see the band outlive him. “I had a little flash while we were playing one night,” Weir told Rolling Stone‘s David Fricke in 2016. “It was toward the end of the tour. I don't remember what city it was in. We were getting into the second set, setting up a tune. We were all playing, but the tune hadn't begun yet. We were all feeling out the groove, just playing with it. Suddenly I was 20 feet behind my own head, looking at this and kind of happy with the way the song was shaping up. I started looking around, and it was 20 years later. John's hair had turned gray. Oteil's had turned white. I looked back at the drummers, and it was a couple of new guys. I looked back at myself, the back of my head, and it was a new guy. It changed my entire perception of what it is we're up to.”


	The members of Dead & Co. will ultimately make the call. And no matter what happens, Grateful Dead music will continue to live on concert stages for decades and decades to come. They are responsible for a significant chapter of the Great American Songbook.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q='unidentified+flying+objects'","The Pentagon's Secret Videos: Are UFOs Finally “Official”?","https://vocal.media/fyi/the-pentagon-s-secret-videos-are-uf-os-finally-official","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 17:45:08 GMT","

For decades, the idea of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) was relegated to the fringes of late-night talk shows and sci-fi conventions. Believers suspected the military was hiding the truth, while the ""powers that be"" remained silent.

But recently, the silence was broken. The US military declassified a series of videos that have forced the world to stop laughing and start looking at the sky. We aren't just talking about grainy photos anymore; we're talking about high-tech sensor data and bewildered fighter pilots.

The spark that reignited the fire came from three specific unclassified clips. In December 2017 and March 2018, the world saw what Navy pilots saw: mysterious aircraft accelerating at speeds that shouldn't be physically possible.

One of the most famous videos features a US Navy F/A-18 Hornet flying at 25,000 feet. The jet was equipped with a Raytheon Advanced Targeting Forward-Looking Infrared (ATFLIR) sensor. The footage shows an oblong, ""Tic Tac"" shaped object keeping pace with the jet at Mach 0.61.

As the pilots try to get an ""auto-track"" lock, their shock is audible. The object zooms across the screen with no visible wings, no tail, and, most importantly, no exhaust plume. In the world of aviation, if you're moving that fast and staying that hot, you should be leaving a trail. This thing didn't.

While the videos are new to us, the stories behind them go back years. Take the 2004 encounter with the USS Nimitz carrier group off the coast of San Diego.

The USS Princeton detected multiple unidentified aircraft operating in the area for two weeks. The data was terrifying: these objects were descending from 60,000 feet to 50 feet in seconds at supersonic speeds. To put that in perspective, no known human aircraft can survive the G-forces required to make that move. When F-18s were sent to intercept, the white, 45-foot-long objects simply ""blinked"" away, outrunning the fastest jets in our arsenal.

It turns out the government was interested, even if they said they weren't. Between 2007 and 2012, the Pentagon ran a $22 million program called the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program (AATIP).

Even weirder? A private contractor involved in the study, Bigelow Aerospace, reportedly stored mysterious metal alloys recovered from unidentified objects in a warehouse in Las Vegas. These materials remain uncategorized, leaving us to wonder: if they aren't from here, where are they from?

The big question remains: What are we looking at?

Organizations like ""To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science"" are pushing for more transparency, but the answers usually fall into two camps:

With a US intelligence budget of $50 billion, many are asking why we aren't spending more to figure out what is flying in our restricted airspace. Pilots often hesitate to report these sightings for fear of sounding ""crazy"" to their superiors, which means there could be hundreds of encounters we've never heard about.

Death is the ultimate mystery. No matter how much we accumulate in life, cars, houses, and money, we all eventually face that final destination. For most of us, the idea of ""the end"" is just a wall of blackness. But throughout history, people have gone to extreme lengths to peek behind the curtain.

While EEG research might help you figure out extrasensory perception, we won't be betting on it. However, if you want to read EEG data and use an ESP32, [Cerelog-ESP-EEG] might be the right project for you. The commercial project is an 8-channel biosensing board suitable for EEG, EMG, ECG, and brain-computer interface studies. However, the company says, “We love the hacker community! We explicitly grant permission for Personal & Educational Use.” We love you too.

They do require you to agree not to sell boards you are building, and they give you schematics, but no PC board layout. That's understandable, although we'd guess that achieving good results will require understanding how to lay out highly sensitive circuits.



What you do get is the schematic and the firmware source. They note that you may have to modify the firmware if you want to switch modes, change gain, or enable haptic feedback, among other things. At the application layer, the device is compatible with Lab Streaming Layer, and there is a fork of OpenBCI (brain control interface) that understands how to talk to the board.

Even if you don't want to directly clone the device, there's a ton of information here if you are interested in EEG or any other small signal acquisition. We've seen a number of interfaces like this, but we are still waiting to see a killer application.

This is Hackaday.  What ESP would we be thinking about besides ESP32?

ESP8266?

That was exactly what I was thinking I would find in the article when I clicked in the somehow clickbait-y title. And it is even worse given that I have worked as a researcher and work now in a private company in biosignal related hardware… haha

Popped into the comments wondering if I had missed something…  They must have copied the title from some new age holistic blog

Ah, using tech to let me sense things my Mark I Human Body can't.  Got it.

Isn't calling our current revision “Mark I” a little disrespectful towards older variants?
Homo erectus and neanderthals (among others) would like to have a word with you.

Its technically open, and you can technically read the schematics but someone should really take the time to clean up the schematics.
They're barely readable in fact

January 11, 2026, 9:25 AM

BERLIN (AP) — Erich von Däniken, the Swiss author whose bestselling books about the extraterrestrial origins of ancient civilizations brought him fame among paranormal enthusiasts and scorn from the scientific community, has died. He was 90.

Von Däniken's representatives announced on his website on Sunday that he had died the previous day in a hospital in central Switzerland.

Von Däniken rose to prominence in 1968 with the publication of his first book “Chariots of the Gods,” in which he claimed that the Mayans and ancient Egyptians were visited by alien astronauts and instructed in advanced technology that allowed them to build giant pyramids.

The book fueled a growing interest in unexplained phenomena at a time when thanks to conventional science man was about to take its first steps on the Moon.

“Chariots of the Gods” was followed by more than two dozen similar books, spawning a literary niche in which fact and fantasy were mixed together against all historical and scientific evidence.

Public broadcaster SRF reported that altogether almost 70 million copies of his books were sold in more than 30 languages, making him one of the most widely read Swiss authors.

While von Däniken managed to shrug off his many critics, the former hotel waiter had a troubled relationship with money throughout his life and frequently came close to financial ruin.

Born in 1935, the son of a clothing manufacturer in the northern Swiss town of Schaffhausen, von Däniken is said to have rebelled against his father's strict Catholicism and the priests who instructed him at boarding school by developing his own alternatives to the biblical account of the origins of life.

After leaving school in 1954, von Däniken worked as a waiter and barkeeper for several years, during which he was repeatedly accused of fraud and served a couple of short stints in prison.

In 1964, he was appointed manager of a hotel in the exclusive resort town of Davos and began writing his first book. Its publication and rapid commercial success were quickly followed by accusations of tax dodging and financial impropriety, for which he again spent time behind bars.

By the time he left prison, “Chariots of the Gods” was earning von Däniken a fortune and a second book “Gods from Outer Space” was ready for publication, allowing him to commit himself to his paranormal passion and travel the world in search of new mysteries to uncover.

Throughout the 1970s von Däniken undertook countless field trips to Egypt, India, and above all Latin America, whose ancient cultures held a particular fascination for the amateur archaeologist.

He lectured widely and set up societies devoted to promoting his theories, later pioneering the use of video and multimedia to reach out to ever-larger audiences hungry for a different account of history.

No amount of criticism dissuaded him and his fans from believing that Earth has been visited repeatedly by beings from Outer Space, and will be again in the future.

In 1991 von Däniken gained the damning accolade of being the first recipient of the “Ig Nobel” prize for literature — for raising the public awareness of science through questionable experiments or claims.

Even when confronted with fabricated evidence in a British television documentary — supposedly ancient pots were shown to be almost new — von Däniken insisted that, minor discrepancies aside, his theories were essentially sound.

In 1985 von Däniken wrote “Neue Erinnerungen an die Zukunft” — “New Memories of the Future” — ostensibly to address his many critics: “I have admitted (my mistakes), but not one of the foundations of my theories has yet been brought down.”

Although his popularity was waning in the English-speaking world by the 1980s, von Däniken's books and films influenced a wave of semi-serious archaeological documentaries and numerous popular television shows, including “The X-Files,” which featured two FBI agents tasked with solving paranormal mysteries.

His last major venture, a theme park based on his books, failed after just a few years due to lack of interest. The “Mystery Park” still stands, its man-made pyramids and otherworldly domes rotting as tourists prefer to explore the charms of the nearby town of Interlaken and the imposing Swiss Alps that surround it.

Erich von Däniken is survived by his wife of 65 years, Elisabeth Skaja, Cornelia and two grandchildren.

For 15 seasons, ""Supernatural"" stayed true to its initial premise: two demon-hunting brothers, Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles), who road trip across America to uncover hidden ghosts, ghouls, and monsters lurking in the shadows. Things got complicated with the appearance of angels, multiple descents into Hell, and the meta introduction of in-universe fangirls, but this basic premise was more or less true from the first episode to the last. However, there was one storyline that could have wrecked the entire series; one we're thankful that the show passed on.

A core element of ""Supernatural"" is that the Winchesters battle monsters while the rest of society is completely unaware of their existence. This is where Andrew Dabb — who was named co-showrunner after Jeremy Carver left, alongside Robert Singer — and the writers' room had the idea to radically change everything. ""One story line we always talked about, which we never did was basically Sam and Dean go public,"" Dabb explained to TV Insider several years after the series finale. ""They're like, 'Look, we're putting out a PSA. Monsters are real. If you see something, something shows up in your town, it's a monster. We can't be everywhere. We're just going to get the word out there.'""

While this idea of having Sam and Dean put out a ""Ghostbusters""-style infomercial to warn humanity that demons are real and can hurt you makes sense on paper, Dabb admits that changing the show in this way would be impossible to reverse. ""It would've kind of blown up the show in a very odd way,"" he explained, adding that the Winchesters probably ought to send out a PSA for the sake of those they fight to save.

""The nice thing about running for 15 years is something that gets scrapped in Season 4 looks great in Season 11,"" Dabb noted. This makes sense when you consider the era in which a storyline like this would have been explored. This revelation would have occurred in a finale at some point in one of the final few seasons, with the following episodes allowing Sam and Dean to serve as a kind of mentor figure to a new generation of demon hunters. Talk about a game-changing episode of ""Supernatural.""

Despite the creative potential, Dabb admits it would have been ""a little logistically difficult"" to go down that path. The revelation would have forced Sam and Dean to the spotlight as overnight celebrities, and that alone would have changed the show's dynamic. ""Which, again, I think sounds interesting in theory, but I actually think would've destroyed the show,"" Dabb elaborated. ""It would not have been any good, which is one of the reasons we didn't do it.""

The decision not to move forward with this potential storyline really is for the best. Part of the show's enduring appeal —and the reason why it is considered the best CW show of all time — is because of Sam and Dean's underdog charm. Throughout the entire series, they constantly bite off more than they can chew, facing the most evil beings in existence. Making them in-world celebrities (more so than they already were at times) and putting them in international crosshairs would have only taken them out of the shadows where they already thrive.

In 2019, Marvel Studios President Feige welcomed Mahershala Ali to the MCU by announcing a new Blade movie at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con. The news ended the studio's Hall H panel, and we later learned that the long-awaited reboot had been dated for November 3, 2023.

It then moved to September 6, 2024, and later slid further down the calendar to February 14, 2025. For a time, it had a November 7, 2025, release date, but was inevitably removed from Marvel Studios' schedule altogether and taken back to the drawing board for the umpteenth time.

Previously, Bassam Tariq and Yann Demange were attached as directors to the movie. Stacy Osei-Kuffour, Beau DeMayo, Michael Starrbury, Nic Pizzolatto, Michael Green, and Eric Pearson have also worked on different versions of the script. 

Ali and Mia Goth remain attached to star in Blade, with the former actually making his official MCU debut with a voice cameo in Eternals' post-credits scene. In that, the Daywalker could be heard warning Dane Whitman about the dangers of the Ebony Blade.

Now, The Cosmic Circus' Alex Perez has shared some of what he's heard about Marvel Studios' original plans for Blade. Taking to X, he wrote, ""Regarding the plot for the supernatural storyline, the whole point of 'Blade' is to tell the story of Blade and the history behind Ebony Blade, so a title with two meanings.""

""And it would have provided some deep lore regarding the supernatural nature of the MCU, vampires, Lilith, the Underworld and more, leading into the Midnight Sons movie,"" he added. 

Marvel Studios abandoned plans for a Blade movie set in the 1920s, while another version was reportedly set to co-star Kit Harington. Whether any of these ideas make it into the next iteration—and whether the movie itself even happens—is now in the ""TBD"" category.

Perez has also shared an update on She-Hulk's status for Avengers: Doomsday. Tatiana Maslany previously called on her Instagram followers to cancel their Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN subscriptions in response to Disney's decision to suspend late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. 

It's since been reported that the actress no longer wishes to work with Disney, a potentially major problem for the MCU. Apparently, as of now, ""She-Hulk is not in Avengers: Doomsday."" However, Perez does point out that she could ""appear in Secret Wars or appear in Doomsday once the reshoots are underway, which are expected to add some characters unable to appear in principal photography.""

While She-Hulk: Attorney at Law received a mixed response from fans, it looked like the plan might be to make Jennifer Walters a major part of the MCU moving forward (in the comics, she's spent more time fighting alongside The Avengers than her cousin, Bruce Banner).

Unless a recast happens, that no longer seems likely, despite She-Hulk appearing in leaked concept art from the next Avengers movies. This wouldn't be the first time Marvel Studios has replaced a Hulk, though, as Mark Ruffalo took over from Ed Norton in 2012.

Avengers: Doomsday is set to be released on December 18, with Avengers: Secret Wars scheduled to arrive on December 17, 2027.

Let's face it most of the trepidation from Eagles Nation heading into the post-season comes down to the lasting memory of that second half against the Buffalo Bills a few weeks ago, a second half that saw the Philadelphia Eagles offense completely stop after taking a 13-0 lead into the locker room at the half.  It was a second half that saw the Eagles pass for -2 yards and Jalen Hurts go 0-7.  It was the second time this season that the reigning Super Bowl MVP went an entire half without completing a pass.  Is that bad? Well, it's not good.  The Birds won both of those games as winning despite themselves has come to be their identity.  While it was painful to watch that second half in Orchard Park I also found it interesting that the Eagles' offense showed none of the creativity and nuance they had in the previous two games, wins over the Raiders and Commanders.  I also found it curious that in the first half of that Buffalo game Hurts went 13-20 for 110 yards, 1 TD and no interceptions with a QB rating of 95.8.  In that game, a 13-12 win, the Eagles ran 30 offensive plays with Hurts under center, the most of any game this season, but only two of those happened in the second half.  It's one thing to play conservatively to try to protect a lead and another to go completely brain dead.

What: Wildcard Game Round 1 

Eagles (11-6, 5-3 Home) vs (49ers 12-5, 7-2 Away)

Where: Lincoln Financial Field – Philadelphia, PA

When: 4:30 pm

Betting Lines: Eagles -6, Over/Under 44.5

Moneyline: Eagles -105, 49ers -115

TV: FOX

What's at stake:  Eagles win:  They will play the Bears in Chicago next weekend

                                  49ers win:  They will play the Rams in L.A. next weekend

In the 24-0 win over Las Vegas Birds offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo called five designed quarterback runs for Hurts, totaling 39 yards and he called four designed runs the following week in a 29-18 win in Washington totaling 40 yards.  Against the Bills there were no called designed runs for QB1 which gave me a little pause.  Since that game I have heard this notion from sports talk radio, random Birds fans, and other green-bleeding faithful followers across the Delaware Valley that the Eagles might be holding back the offensive playbook, just showing enough to get by, albeit it winning ugly, only to unleash the “beast” when the post-season commences today at Lincoln Financial Field against the San Francisco 49ers, 4:30 pm kick-off.

While I'm not a big proponent of conspiracy theories and don't believe head coach Nick Sirianni is waiting to unveil his super-secret offense today at 4:30, others disagree with me.

Long time Eagle fan Josh Kotzen told me this the other day:

“I think that the first half two weeks ago, is who they are…It feels like they played the whole season like the preseason. I think they kept a lot of their good sh#t off of tape.”

Another life-long Birds fan who allowed me to quote him anonymously, who I ran into at my gym believes the Birds played 16 games this year with this philosophy:

“Do what you have to do, win as ugly as you have to win to get to the playoffs, which is the only season that matters and then show who you are.”

Still another I heard on sports talk radio 94.1 WIP this past week believes  this:

“I think it is intentional. I think they showed flashes of who they are during the halves and quarters of games that they lit it up. Then I think they knew they could do it and to protect against injury, keep what works off any game film.”

But those beliefs have been quickly dismissed by some NFL execs and dignitaries:

“No, they aren't holding anything back,” a veteran front office personnel executive to Senior NFL writer Matt Lombardo of Between The Hashmarks. “The quarterback just struggles with accuracy, and the running back had half the season he did last year. 

“You have to remember that Saquon helps Jalen Hurts tremendously. He did last year, but wasn't able to this season.”

https://mattlombardonfl.substack.com/p/anvils-and-opportunities-facing-hard

Well, I'm not sure what statistics that excecutive is looking at but Hurts has a career completion percentage of 64.4% and of course that number jumps to 66.8% in the playoffs.  He also owns a 6-3 career playoff resume with a Super Bowl ring and two title game appearrances in the past three seasons.  

In fairness to the running game the Eagles' offensive line was beleagured by injuries, rarely opening the holes that helped spring Barkley and the ground game run all over their opponents last season and was so fundamentally foundational to Philly's success in 2024.

Barkley, last year's rushing king surpassed 100 rushing yards only twice this season, after smashing the century mark 14 times, including three times in last year's playoff run to the Super Bowl. 

Mike Tanier of The Between The Hashmarks Podcast pointed out this past week even more alarming trends about the Eagles' offense this past season.

Tanier fingered offensive coordinator Kevin Petullo and Sirianni for never even trying to establish Barkley as a threat out of the backfield, attempting the fewest screen passes of any team in the league and no team called fewer designed rollouts for its quarterback than the Eagles.  Hurts could also be found at the bottom of the list of starting quarterbacks for targeting the slot receiver.

And what would be a possible reason or theory for that?

“I've heard concerns about Hurts,” a longtime NFL scout told Between The Hashmarks. “Especially in the intermediate passing game and him being scared to make risky throws.” 

In fairness to QB1 that's whisper down the hearsay lane so take it with a grain of salt (whatever that means).

Against a defense like the 49ers, with a secondary that ranks 24th in the league, giving up an eye popping 232.4 yards per game and 10 passing touchdowns this past season, the Birds may not have to rely on the run. 

When it comes down to it speculation is just noise that gets eliminated once the ball is kicked off.  I prefer to deal in facts and the fact is that Hurts' ability to rise to the occasion in clutch moments is well documented – 10 fourth-quarter comebacks, 13 game-winning drives, a Super Bowl ring, and two Super Bowl appearances, and the only play to pass for 10 post-season touchdowns and rush for 10 post-season touchdowns.

It's undeniably an unquantifiable advantage that roughly 13 other playoff teams would love to have leading them in their postseason journey. 

Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio and the Eagles' defense should be stingy enough to hold serve against San Francisco, but that might be Philadelphia's crutch in these playoffs until they face more complete teams in the weeks ahead should they get past the 49ers

For Eagles Nation it would be nice to beleive that at this point in the season, the idea that what the Eagles have shown offensively all year isn't the full playbook, that Nick Sirianni and Kevin Patullo have been waiting for the post-season for the offensive reveal..

But if that's not the case then the Eagles will be operating within the same narrow margins they've played with all year and it's those those narrow margins that may decide how far this run goes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","Ancient Greek Statue of Woman Using ""Laptop"" Sparks Conspiracy Theories","https://greekreporter.com/2026/01/10/ancient-greek-statue-woman-laptop/","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 04:11:36 GMT","

A recurring conspiracy theory which has gone viral claims that an ancient Greek statue supposedly depicting a woman “using a laptop” is “proof” of time travel. The statue once marked a grave and was created around 100 BC.

Many inventions beyond their time are associated with the ancient Greek civilization, but the laptop was certainly not one of them…until now.

Of course, historians have dismissed the theory as nonsense and provided more grounded explanations, suggesting that the object in the statue may be a box or wax tablet.

The statue that spurred on the conspiracy theory is called the “Grave Naiskos Of An Enthroned Woman With An Attendant” and is on display at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, California.

The ancient Greek statue portrays a seated woman with a slave standing in front of her, holding a slim folding container. The woman, who appears to be the mistress, touches the top of the container with her fingers while looking up towards the upper part of it with her stone eyes.

However, various conspiracy theorists believe that the container depicted is actually a laptop, complete with USB ports on the side of the device.

In one viral YouTube video, an uploader claims that the ancient Greek statue “depicts an astonishing object that bears a striking resemblance to a modern laptop or some handheld device”.

“When I look at the sculpture I can't help but think about the Oracle of Delphi, which was supposed to allow the priests to connect with the gods to retrieve advanced information,” continued the video's upload.

They dismissed more feasible explanations, arguing that the container's base is too shallow to be a jewellry box.

This is not the first time the conspiracy theory has popped up. In 2016, the Daily Mail published an article questioning whether the funerary statue was indeed proof that a time traveler had brought back a laptop to ancient Greece.

Back in 2016, archaeologist Kristina Killgrove wrote in Forbes debunking the theory that the ancient Greeks had somehow come across advanced computer technology.

“It's a typical funeral marker, depicting the deceased individual in a vibrant way, often, in the case of women, in a household scene,” explained Killgrove. “These stelai were carved in relief, and were almost always painted, although the painting doesn't survive in most cases.”

“In this stele, a woman reclines on a chair and reaches to touch the lid of an object that is held by a girl whose hairstyle and clothes indicate she is a slave. This is a rather typical trope in funeral stelai, the image of a wealthy adult woman reaching to a servant, and may have reflected her family's desire for her to retain her status into the afterlife,” continued Killgrove.

Killgrove suggested a variety of more tangible explanations for what the object held by the woman in the statue may have been, including a wax tablet or some kind of jewellery box or other container.

Rather than being USB ports, the holes on the side of the container may have originally been used to hold wooden items that have long since rotted away.

It is also possible that the holes were made during efforts to rework or copy the sculpture. Other parts of the stele are missing, so this is certainly a plausible explanation.

      In this EXCLUSIVE in-studio deep dive, Ty Roberts on Total Disclosure Podcast sits down with Samuel Chong, the man responsible for translating The Thiaoouba Prophecy—a controversial and provocative book that emerged from Australia in the late 1980s, during the same era Bob Lazar first went public with claims of non-human intelligence, advanced craft, and human interaction with extraterrestrial technology. Originally written by Michel Desmarquet, a landscaper with no formal academic or scientific background, The Thiaoouba Prophecy presents an extraordinary narrative: direct contact with an advanced extraterrestrial civilization and revelations that challenge religion, history, science, and humanity's understanding of its own origins.
    


      When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever reported, Redditors have shared a variety of cases that stand out for their credibility, documentation, and the sheer number of witnesses involved. Here are some of the most frequently mentioned and highly regarded sightings:
    


Location: Ruwa, Zimbabwe
    


Details: Over 60 schoolchildren witnessed a craft landing in their schoolyard and several beings emerging from it. The incident was investigated by a well-known psychologist, and a documentary on YouTube provides more details. ""The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. Surprised it hasn't been mentioned. 60 plus children apparently witnessed a craft landing in the schoolyard and a few beings came out.""



Location: Alaska, USA
    


Details: A JAL cargo flight crew, including the pilot and co-pilot, observed a massive UFO for over 30 minutes. The object was also tracked by ground radar. The pilot's career was significantly impacted by his decision to speak out about the incident. ""JAL Flight 1628... What the pilot and co-pilot saw that day was also being tracked by ground radar as well.""



Location: Suffolk, England
    


Details: US Air Force personnel stationed at RAF Woodbridge and RAF Bentwaters reported multiple nights of strange lights and a craft landing in Rendlesham Forest. The incident involved direct interaction with the object and detailed military testimonies. ""Rendelsham Forest or Shag Harbour. When it comes to Rendelsham, I am confident in thinking a crew of military men as they were would not have mistaken a light house for a UFO.""



Location: Phoenix, Arizona, USA
    


Details: Thousands of people, including the then-governor of Arizona, witnessed a massive V-shaped formation of lights moving silently across the night sky. The event was widely reported and remains one of the most famous mass UFO sightings. ""Phoenix lights...""



Location: Off the coast of California, USA
    


Details: US Navy pilots, including Commander David Fravor, encountered a Tic Tac-shaped object that displayed incredible speed and maneuverability. The incident was captured on FLIR video and corroborated by multiple witnesses and radar data. ""For me, it's the eyewitness testimony of David Fraver, the fighter pilot who described his interactions with the 'tic tac' ufo off the coast of California during his training runs.""



Location: Tehran, Iran
    


Details: Iranian Air Force pilots were scrambled to intercept a UFO that was also tracked by radar. The pilots reported instrumentation failures and communications blackouts when approaching the object. ""1976 Tehran UFO incident: Nothing beats this one. Military personals, radars and civilian plane encountered the UFO.""

            Ukraine battled Sunday to restore power to tens of thousands of people left without heating in bitterly cold temperatures after a week of intense Russian attacks that have brought the country's energy infrastructure to its knees.
    


            In Kyiv, heating was restored to about 85% of apartment buildings a day after the entire city lost power, heat and water on Saturday. But more than 1,000 buildings remained without heating, the city's mayor Vitali Klitschko said. with daytime temperatures down to –10C (14F).
    


            Ukraine's Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said Russia had targeted energy infrastructure every day for the past week as temperatures plummeted.
    


            “The enemy deliberately targeted heat-generating facilities with ballistic missiles. The situation was further complicated by difficult weather conditions and a significant drop in temperature,” she said in a statement.
    


            “We understand that the lack of light and heat is a difficult test, especially in the cold. Therefore, our key task is to restore basic living conditions for people as quickly as possible.”
    


            Mobile shelters have been set up in the capital, offering spaces where locals can warm up, recharge their phones and other devices and drink warm tea, according to the state emergency service.
    


            Nonetheless, residents spoke of the huge challenges of living without power in the depths of winter.
    


            Halyna Turchyn had managed to source gas cannisters so she could cook for the first time since losing power. “Today, we will cook something to eat, because we haven't cooked anything for two days,” she told CNN in her kitchen in Kyiv.
    


            Galina Turchin, a 71-year-old retiree, had wrapped herself in layers of jumpers to try to stay warm in her apartment, where one window had recently been shattered by debris from a Russian drone and was covered only by a plastic sheet.
    


            “We hope they will give us heat. If not power, then at least heat,” she told Reuters, adding that she had not cooked food for two days and eaten only leftovers from her kitchen.
    


            Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure since launching its full-scale invasion in 2022, using waves of missiles and drones to cripple power generation in an apparent effort to erode morale and hit the economy.
    


            On average, Kyiv residents had no electricity for 9.5 hours a day in December as the energy system struggled to cope with winter demand. Elevators in apartment blocks stopped working, trapping elderly residents in their homes, and people have become used to the loud hum of generators.
    


            “This was one of the most massive attacks on the capital's energy infrastructure, occurring precisely during a period of deteriorating weather conditions,” said Oleksiy Kuleba, deputy prime minister for restoration of Ukraine, on Sunday.
    


            This week's strikes came as the conflict grinds through its fourth winter, plunging cities into prolonged energy blackouts while temperatures dip well below freezing and are forecast to drop further.
    


            On Saturday, Ukraine's national electricity grid operator, Ukrenergo, ordered an emergency power cut to be implemented in Kyiv and the surrounding region to repair the heavily damaged system.
    


            Russian strikes overnight on Saturday into Sunday knocked out power in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions. By Sunday morning, more than 13,000 people in Zaporizhzhia were without supply, according to Ukraine's energy ministry.
    


            Power to nearly 700,000 consumers was lost over the past seven days before it was eventually restored, Svyrydenko said. While power supplies were brought back in Kyiv in “record time,” she warned that the situation would be precarious for a while.
    


            Homes where power has been restored are still subject to scheduled power blackouts, which in Kyiv currently last for around eight hours.
    


            Klitschko has warned that the energy supply system in Ukraine's capital remains “very difficult” despite restoration works.
    


            Some villages on the outskirts of the capital have been without electricity for four days and people have taken to the streets to block roads in protest.
    


            “Before the strike, it was good, normal warmth,” one man, Serhii Przhistovskiy, told CNN. “Until they turn the heating back on, I'll have to sleep in my clothes.”

MOSCOW, January 11. /TASS/. The Kiev regime is reeling from setbacks on the battlefield and is lashing out at civilians in Russia's regions, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova declared in a statement.

She highlighted that on January 10, a coordinated attack involving 33 fixed-wing drones targeted the Kursk, Bryansk, and Belgorod regions, with the primary strike devastating residential areas in Voronezh. ""Such deliberate acts of killing reveal the desperation of the Kiev regime, which, despite clear military failures, seeks to vent its fury on innocent civilians in Russia's territories,"" Zakharova asserted. ""All those responsible for this and other crimes will inevitably face justice.""

Zakharova also confirmed that one young woman was killed, and at least three other people were injured in the attack. ""The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly condemns these acts of terrorism. Their hallmark was the cynical targeting of numerous civilian objects,"" she emphasized. ""Over ten apartment buildings and an equal number of private homes were damaged. A gymnasium and several administrative buildings also suffered destruction.""

She further called on international organizations to provide an impartial assessment of the terrorist assault carried out by the Ukrainian military against civilians in Russia's regions. ""Silence or indifference to the Kiev regime's barbarity effectively makes the international community complicit in its heinous crimes,"" Zakharova warned.

Concluding her statement, Zakharova condemned the attack as yet another in a series of inhumane acts, stating, ""The Kiev regime has once again revealed its Nazi-like brutality through this bloody crime."".","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

The U.S.-made short-range Tempest surface-to-air missile system has entered combat in Ukraine, according to video footage recently released by the Air Force. 

Ukraine's Air Force Command Center published video that shows the Tempest system repelling an attack in a New Year's post, without announcing or identifying the new weapon. The Ukrainian analyst group Vodohrai later reported that the footage depicts the Tempest in action. 

The video shows a Tempest missile intercepting a Russian drone during an overnight aerial attack. 

The U.S. defense company V2X debuted the Tempest platform at the 2025 Association of the United States Army (AUSA) exhibition in October, but the system's transfer to Ukraine was not publicly announced. 

The Tempest surface-to-air missile system is designed to engage drones, helicopters, and low-flying aircraft in all weather conditions.

While V2X did not specify the type of interceptor missile during the AUSA exhibition, the Tempest likely uses the radar-guided AGM-114L Hellfire Longbow. Hellfire missiles typically carry a 9 kg (20-pound) warhead, powerful enough to destroy drones and minimize collateral damage from falling debris. 

Ukraine has relied on Western-supplied air defense systems to counter Russian aerial attacks throughout the full-scale war. Complexes such as the Patriot, IRIS-T, NASAMS, and SAMP/T systems are capable of intercepting cruise and ballistic missiles, while e German-made Gepard and Skynex systems are primarily used to counter drones.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Morocco boosts military ties with Israel despite tensions","https://www.dw.com/en/morocco-boosts-military-ties-with-israel-despite-tensions/a-75450725","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 10:35:28 GMT","

Five years after the Abraham Accords, Morocco and Israel are strengthening ties diplomatically, economically and militarily. The relationship has given Morocco strategic leverage in its Western Sahara dispute.

It has been just over five years since Israel and Morocco established diplomatic relations on the basis of the US-brokered normalization agreements, the Abraham Accords.

By signing the deal, Morocco effectively abandoned the conditions of the Arab Peace Initiative formulated by Saudi Arabia in 2002. That initiative had proposed a comprehensive peace treaty between Israel and the entire Arab world, albeit conditional on several requirements, such as Israel's withdrawal from the territories occupied since the Six-Day War in June 1967, as well as the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.

Along with the United Arab Emirates, Sudan and Bahrain, Morocco has cultivated normal diplomatic relations with Israel for half a decade, a process initiated by the first Trump administration. 

Now, both countries are taking things a step further: at their third Joint Military Committee meeting in Tel Aviv earlier in January, they signed a joint military ""work plan"" for 2026.

Recent talks have focused on strategic discussions, IDF unit visits, and coordination on shared security objectives, according to a statement by the Israeli army on X.


According to Steven Höfner, head of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation's office in Morocco, the meeting focused on future technologies in addition to further technological deliveries from Israel to Morocco. ""Both partners now want to develop not only drones but also joint air defense systems, including joint satellite technology,"" he told DW, adding that ""this is a significant step forward in terms of quality.""

Morocco has been one of the world's biggest arms importers for years. In the global ranking by the internationally recognized research institute SIPRI for 2024, the country ranks 31st, although total imports have fallen by a good quarter in recent years. Particularly noteworthy: between 2020 and 2024, Israel was Morocco's third-largest arms supplier after the US and France.

According to SIPRI, Morocco mainly imports armored vehicles, missiles, air defense systems, and military aircraft. While American and French deliveries mainly fall into these categories, Israel primarily supplies air defense and unmanned systems. At least 51% of the defense missiles supplied to Morocco are reportedly coming from Israel. In addition, Morocco is massively expanding its drone production with Israeli support.

The cooperation between Morocco and Israel also has regional implications, says Simon Wolfgang Fuchs, an Islamic scholar at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He refers to the ongoing tensions between Morocco and Algeria, which are fueled by Morocco's claim on the Western Sahara region.

""Morocco consistently pursues the goal of asserting its claim  to sovereignty over Western Sahara in its foreign policy,"" Fuchs told DW.

The Abraham Accords have dealt Rabat an important success in this regard. ""The fact that Israel recognized this sovereignty, in addition to the US and several Western European countries, was an important success for Morocco,"" he said.

However, this has angered Algier, which supports the independence-seeking Polisario people in the Western Sahara.

Moreover, increased ties between Morocco and Israel also carry another significance, Fuchs points out. ""Through imports from Israel, Morocco has also greatly modernized its military and is now clearly superior to the Algerian army,"" he said.  

However, there are also reports that Algeria possesses Russian weapons that are intended to give the country a continued advantage over Morocco, including Iskander missiles and multi-role fighter jets.

Five years ago, the new ties were met with relatively little resistance in Moroccan society, Steven Höfner said. In part, this was due to Morocco's long-standing unofficial, intensive relations with Israel. ""This is due to the fact that many Israelis have Moroccan roots,"" he told DW.

It is also due to the fact that Morocco, unlike other Arab states in the 1950s and 1960s, never conducted a large-scale systematic expulsion of Jews. ""As a result, relations between the two societies have always been less strained than elsewhere in the Arab world,"" says Höfner.

Nevertheless, there have been repeated large-scale protests in Morocco against Israel's war in Gaza and notable levels of solidarity with the Palestinians among the general population. The ruling royal family has had to take these factors into account, he said.

The war in Gaza also left its mark on another level, Fuchs points out. ""There were high expectations for Israeli tourists in Rabat but these expectations were not fulfilled,"" he notes. Since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and the ensuing two-year war in Gaza, direct flights between the two countries have been suspended.

But still, Israel has significant economic interests in Morocco, Fuchs said. For example, in the agricultural sector. ""Israeli irrigation techniques are in high demand in Morocco, as well as methods for growing crops even in extremely dry areas,"" he told DW, adding that these are attractive business opportunities for Israeli companies.

Moreover, Israel is interested in Morocco's phosphate deposits, which could play an important role in fertilizer production for Israeli agriculture.

			Delcy Rodriguez faces impossible task of working with White House while keeping her political allies onside

Sitting at the head of a vast wooden table in the Miraflores Palace, Delcy Rodríguez used her first cabinet meeting as interim president to urge Venezuelans to “come together”.

The day before, US forces had seized Nicolás Maduro from his compound and bundled him into a helicopter. An image of her recently toppled predecessor loomed behind her, flanked by portraits of Hugo Chávez, the founder of the regime, and Simón Bolívar, the nation's liberator.

Now all of them are in the past. Ms Rodríguez's thoughts would have been about the present: specifically the two men sitting on either side of her.

On her right was Gen Vladimir Padrino López, the defence minister, whose support was vital to securing her succession after the fall of Mr Maduro.

Seated on her left, grim-faced, was Diosdado Cabello, the interior minister, who has his own power base in the security services and the Colectivos militias, which act as a vital cog in the machinery of state repression.

The trio, along with Mr Maduro, make up the “Four Families” who have ruled over Venezuela since the death of Chavez in 2013.

That Mafia-esque alliance is now on the verge of fracturing. Ms Rodriguez has been given a seemingly impossible task of trying to placate Donald Trump while keeping onside the rivals who could bring her down.

One analyst compares the job to walking a tightrope.

She is known as a savvy political operator, but one false step will send her into the abyss. And Venezuela will descend into chaos.

Ms Rodríguez's ascent has been decades in the making, but she could hardly have claimed the Venezuelan presidency under more perilous circumstances.

She was briefly a minister under Chávez, with whom she reportedly had a tense relationship. But her political career took off under Mr Maduro, for whom she served as minister for the economy, foreign affairs, and most recently, vice-president.

When the time came to replace Mr Maduro, the CIA concluded Ms Rodríguez was a pragmatic operator who was best placed to guarantee Venezuela's stability.

Patrick Duddy, a former US ambassador to Venezuela, said the new president had always appeared a “loyal, adamant supporter of the regime” but could be open to co-operating with the US.

“She is politically adept, otherwise she would not have survived politically for as long as she has, nor have risen as high as she has,” he told The Telegraph.

Whether or not the rumours are true that, in a moment of cold-blooded political calculus, she delivered Mr Maduro, her mentor, to the Americans, she now has to balance Mr Trump's demands with those of powerful rivals.

Recommended

The US president seemed to endorse her in the hours after Mr Maduro's toppling, declaring she would do what was necessary to “make Venezuela great again”.

There was a sting in the tail in a subsequent interview, when he threatened her with a fate worse than Mr Maduro if she refused to co-operate. Many onlookers took his comment as a threat against her life.

Mr Trump, according to Politico, has issued a series of demands that include expelling Iranian and Cuban operatives from Venezuelan soil, blocking the export of oil to US adversaries, and clamping down on drug trafficking.

Ms Rodríguez has tried to play it both ways. She condemned the “kidnapping” of her predecessor and pledged that her country would never become a “colony”, then later proposed a “balanced and respectful” economic partnership with the US.

A promise to send up to 50 million barrels of oil to the US on Wednesday seems also to have mollified Mr Trump, for now.

But Ms Rodríguez's path to co-operation with the US and staving off rivals is fraught with danger, and it is widely acknowledged that she, while notionally the leader of Venezuela, is weaker than Gen Padrino and Mr Cabello.

Joaquín Ortega, a Venezuelan teacher of political theory who has met some of the country's most powerful figures, said: “The four families were working together in the Maduro regime.

“But the real firepower lies with Cabello – national police, security services and also the Colectivos – and Padrino, [who has] the army.”

The ministers have their hands on the levers of state power because they are the “guys with the guns”, according to Ian Vásquez, the vice-president of international studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in the US.

He said: “She's in, if not, an extremely difficult position, an impossible position, because she's in a position of having to please the US government and the rest of the Chavista regime.” And Mr Cabello and Gen Padrino already have “blood on their hands”.

It is far from clear whether there is any single red line that could bring down the new president, but a perception that she is turning Venezuela into a vassal state for the US would be hugely damaging.

Roxanna Vigil, a fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations, a US foreign policy think tank, believes Ms Rodríguez's days are numbered and that a power struggle will break out in the regime.

“Anything she does to appease the Trump administration will be seen as capitulation… anything she does to appease the hard-liners will potentially trigger the wrath of Trump,” she said.

Ms Rodríguez risks her allies moving against her if she bends to US demands for elections in Venezuela, which would almost certainly end the regime's grip on power.

Mr Trump said in a Fox News interview on Thursday that elections in Venezuela would “eventually” take place, but not before the rebuilding of Venezuela's oil sector, a process that is estimated to take years.

And in a country like Venezuela, where officials are greased by bribes and kickbacks to turn a blind eye on the smuggling of everything from drugs to flour, any move to dismantle that patronage system could be destabilising.

Mr Cabello, a former army captain, attended military academy alongside Chávez, and was eventually imprisoned with him when they mounted a failed coup in 1992.

When Chávez finally rose to power, so did Mr Cabello, and the 62-year-old has been at the nexus of Venezuelan power for decades, where he has earned a reputation as a brutal enforcer.

He will not want to give that up.

Mr Cabello, who has emerged as something of a celebrity, relishes his reputation as a skull-cracker. He hosts the programme Bringing Down the Hammer on state TV, in which he holds forth against political enemies while brandishing a spiked club.

Now the interior minister, he controls an unholy union of the police, security services and paramilitary forces known as the Colectivos.

A former US official based in Venezuela said it was Mr Cabello who ruled the country's streets with an iron fist since the fall of Mr Maduro. Protests have been quashed, and loyalists are going door-to-door to root out those celebrating the fall of the former leader.

The interior minister is the figure who “poses the greatest threat” to Ms Rodriguez, the official added.

Mr Ortega, who has met Mr Cabello, described him as a “gentlemanly guy, always smiling” with a TV host's comedic flair. But he has a “dark side”. The spiked club is not just for show.

While Mr Cabello usually dons a tracksuit and baseball cap, Vladimir Padrino López, Venezuela's defence minister and highest-ranked military officer, is rarely seen in public wearing anything other than full military regalia.

Some suggest he has already shown himself to be trigger-happy, having been linked in media reports to an attempted coup against Mr Maduro in 2019.

Yet in public, he has presented himself as a steadfast defender of the regime and Venezuelan sovereignty.

He regularly denounces what he calls American imperialism, claiming – as Mr Trump assembled an armada in the Caribbean last year – that the US was “one of the most genocidal empires in human history”.

As if all that was not enough, Ms Rodríguez also needs to be conscious of Cuba's presence in Venezuela.

Cuba is often seen as the junior partner in the alliance because it is poorer and smaller. But drifting into the US's orbit could have repercussions.

In exchange for Venezuelan oil, Cuba sends intelligence agents and troops – many of whom were killed in the assault on Mr Maduro's compound by US special forces on Saturday – to shore up Caracas's military and security services.

“Venezuela is still full of Cuban agents, and Cuba does not want to let Venezuela go,” said Mr Vásquez, suggesting Havana's intelligence services could launch an attempt on Ms Rodriguez's life.

However, the Venezuelan president has two factors in her favour. One is that, so far, she is ruling with the US, although this is likely to prove both a blessing and a curse.

The second is that she has a power base of her own. Jorge Rodríguez, her “Machiavellian” older brother who was Chávez's vice-president, served in Mr Maduro's government and is currently president of the national assembly, Venezuela's legislative branch of government.

He is also, according to the former US official, “hands-down one of the most evil people I've met in my entire life”.

The official said that Mr Rodriguez, a trained psychiatrist, was a “schemer and manipulator” who played “mind-games”, adding: “There's a little more lipstick on Delcy. She comes across as a bit more worldly and urbane.”

Together, they make a “ruthless” pair.

Their early lives were blighted by tragedy when their father was tortured to death by the security services for leading a plot to kidnap an American executive in the 1970s.

His death meant their widowed mother drove them to “be the best, conquer power and avenge the death of their father”, as one friend told a Spanish newspaper. According to rumour, the ransom obtained from that kidnapping paid for the Rodríguez siblings' education.

The Rodríguezes are “like two brains in one … working together as one human being,” said Mr Ortega. “They are so smart and so Machiavellian.”

The new Venezuelan president will need every ounce of that cunning to navigate the political minefield she now finds herself in, where supposed allies have pinned a target on her back.

Even then, that may not be enough. Mr Ortega quotes Chairman Mao: “Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.” Scheming and subtlety may have got her the top job, but there's no guarantee it will keep her there.

Activists say the death toll in the crackdown on nationwide protests in Iran spiked Sunday to at least 538 people. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency also warns the toll is likely to go up. And with the internet down in Iran and phone lines cut off, gauging the demonstrations from abroad has grown more difficult as AP's Jon Gambrell explains.

Protests challenging Iran's theocracy have reached the two-week mark, with demonstrators flooding the streets in Tehran and Mashhad. Activists say at least 116 people have died, and 2,600 have been detained. U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed support for the protesters, hinting at possible military action. Iran's parliament speaker warned the U.S. and Israel could be targets if the U.S. strikes Iran.

Protests sweeping across Iran neared the two-week mark Saturday, with the country's government acknowledging the ongoing demonstrations despite an intensifying crackdown as the Islamic Republic remains cut off from the rest of the world.

Ali Rahmani said the Iranian population was currently “fiercely fighting for its freedom,” a cause his mother Narges Mohammadi had been engaged in “for more than 30 years.”

Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian offered a hardening tone in an interview aired on Sunday after nationwide protests challenging Iran's theocracy saw protesters flood the streets in the country's capital and its second-largest city into Sunday morning, crossing the two-week mark of protests.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A crackdown on nationwide protests in Iran has killed at least 538 people and even more are feared dead, activists said Sunday, while Tehran warned that the U.S. military and Israel would be “legitimate targets” if America uses force to protect demonstrators.

Another over 10,600 people have been detained over the two weeks of protests, said the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which has been accurate in previous rounds of unrest in Iran in recent years. It relies on supporters in Iran crosschecking information. It said of those killed, 490 were protesters and 48 were members of security forces.

With the internet down in Iran and phone lines cut off, gauging the demonstrations from abroad has grown more difficult. The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the toll.

The Iranian government has not offered overall casualty figures for the demonstrations.

Those abroad fear the information blackout is emboldening hard-liners within Iran's security services to launch a bloody crackdown. Protesters flooded the streets in the country's capital and its second-largest city again Sunday morning.

U.S. President Donald Trump has offered support for the protesters, saying on social media that “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!”

Trump and his national security team have been weighing a range of potential responses against Iran including cyberattacks and direct strikes by either U.S. or Israel, according to two people familiar with internal White House discussions who were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The White House, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, has not indicated it has made any decisions. The massive ongoing U.S. military deployment to the Caribbean has created another factor that the Pentagon and Trump's national security planners must consider.

The threat to strike the U.S. military and Israel came during a parliamentary speech by Mohammad Baagher Qalibaf, the hard-liner speaker of the body who has run for the presidency in the past.

He directly threatened Israel, calling it “the occupied territory.”

“In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centers, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets,” Qalibaf said. “We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat.”

Lawmakers rushed the dais in parliament, shouting: “Death to America!”

It remains unclear how serious Iran is about launching a strike, particularly after its air defenses were destroyed during the 12-day war in June with Israel. Any decision to go to war would rest with Iran's 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

The U.S. military has said in the Mideast it is “postured with forces that span the full range of combat capability to defend our forces, our partners and allies and U.S. interests.” Iran targeted U.S. forces at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in June, while the U.S. Navy's Mideast-based 5th Fleet is stationed in the island kingdom of Bahrain.

Israel, meanwhile, is “watching closely” the situation between the U.S. and Iran, said an Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to not being authorized to speak to journalists. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio overnight on topics including Iran, the official added.

“The people of Israel, the entire world, are in awe of the tremendous heroism of the citizens of Iran,” said Netanyahu, a longtime Iran hawk.

At the Vatican, Pope Leo XIV mentioned Iran as a place “where ongoing tensions continue to claim many lives,” adding that “I hope and pray that dialogue and peace may be patiently nurtured in pursuit of the common good of the whole of society.”

Demonstrations were held in some international capitals in support of the protesters. A spokesperson said U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was “shocked” by reports of violence against protesters resulting in “scores of deaths” and called on Iranian authorities to use maximum restraint and restore communications.

Online videos sent out of Iran, likely using Starlink satellite transmitters, purportedly showed demonstrators gathering in northern Tehran's Punak neighborhood. There, it appeared authorities shut off streets, with protesters waving their lit mobile phones. Others banged metal while fireworks went off.

“The pattern of protests in the capital has largely taken the form of scattered, short-lived, and fluid gatherings, an approach shaped in response to the heavy presence of security forces and increased field pressure,” the Human Rights Activists News Agency said. “Reports were received of surveillance drones flying overhead and movements by security forces around protest locations, indicating ongoing monitoring and security control.”

In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city some 725 kilometers (450 miles) northeast of Tehran, footage purported to show protesters confronting security forces. Protests also appeared to happen in Kerman, 800 kilometers (500 miles) southeast of Tehran.

Iranian state television on Sunday morning had correspondents appear on the streets in several cities to show calm areas, with a date stamp shown on screen. Tehran and Mashhad were not included.

Government rhetoric ratcheted up. Ali Larijani, a top security official, accused some demonstrators of “killing people or burning some people, which is very similar to what ISIS does,” referring to the Islamic State group by an acronym.

State TV aired funerals of slain security force members while reporting another six had been killed in Kermanshah. In Fars province, violence killed 13 people, and seven security forces were killed in North Khorasan province, it added. It showed a pickup truck full of bodies in body bags and later a morgue.

Even Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who had been trying to ease anger before the demonstrations exploded in recent days, offered a hardening tone in an interview aired Sunday.

“People have concerns, we should sit with them and if it is our duty, we should resolve their concerns,” Pezeshkian said. “But the higher duty is not to allow a group of rioters to come and destroy the entire society.”

The demonstrations began Dec. 28 over the collapse of the Iranian rial currency, which trades at over 1.4 million to $1, as the country's economy is squeezed by international sanctions in part levied over its nuclear program. The protests intensified and grew into calls directly challenging Iran's theocracy.

DUARTE, Calif. (AP) — Veteran actor T.K. Carter, who appeared in the horror film “The Thing” and “Punky Brewster” on television, has died at the age of 69.

Carter was declared dead Friday evening after deputies responded to a call regarding an unresponsive male in Duarte, California, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

Police did not disclose a cause of death or other details, but said no foul play was suspected.

Thomas Kent “T.K.” Carter was born Dec. 18, 1956, in New York City and was raised in Southern California.

He began his career in stand-up comedy and with acting roles. Carter had been acting for years before a breakthrough role as Nauls the cook in John Carpenter's 1982 horror classic, “The Thing.” He also had a recurring role in the 1980s sitcom “Punky Brewster.” 

Other big-screen roles include “Runaway Train” in 1985, “Ski Patrol” in 1990 and “Space Jam” in 1996. 

“T.K. Carter was a consummate professional and a genuine soul whose talent transcended genres,” his publicist, Tony Freeman, said in a statement. “He brought laughter, truth, and humanity to every role he touched. His legacy will continue to inspire generations of artists and fans alike.”

Tens of thousands of anti-ICE agitators took to the streets of major cities across the country this weekend in a raft of demonstrations largely organized by a coalition of left-wing groups.

The ICE Out for Good coalition called for a ""weekend of action"" starting Saturday, organizing more than 1,000 events nationwide. The coalition was largely organized by Indivisible, the same left-wing group that pushed ""No Kings"" protests against President Donald Trump in 2025.

Protests focus on the death of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis last week. She was killed in a confrontation with ICE agents after federal authorities say she attempted to run over one of the officers.

""Renee Nicole Good was a wife, a mother of three, and a member of her community. She, and the dozens of other sons, daughters, friends, siblings, parents, and community members who have been killed by ICE, should be alive today,"" said Indivisible co-executive director Leah Greenberg.

""This weekend, people across the country are coming together to grieve, honor those we've lost, and demand accountability from a system that has operated with impunity for far too long. ICE's violence is not a statistic, it has names, families, and futures attached to it, and we refuse to look away or stay silent,"" she added.

Protests led to scuffles with police and arrests in several states on Saturday. Austin Police detained at least three anti-ICE agitators as protests escalated there.

Multiple arrests were made after a dispersal order was issued and agitators refused to leave the area as instructed, according to LAPD. Multiple agitators were seen on video being detained just before 7 p.m. local time.

""You must leave the area,"" police wrote in a statement on X.

Members of the Trump administration have reiterated that the ICE operations are targeting criminal illegal aliens. Vice President JD Vance highlighted a list of individuals arrested in Minnesota that includes convicted child rapists and murderers.

Iran threatened to strike U.S. and Israeli military bases in the Middle East, considering them “legitimate targets” if President Donald Trump decides to strike the Islamic Republic amid nationwide protests.

“In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centers, bases, and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets,” Iranian parliament speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said on Sunday. “We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat.”

TRUMP WARNS OF JANUARY GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN OVER OBAMACARE

This isn't the first antagonistic statement Iran has made against the United States in recent days. Last week, the head of Iran's military threatened a preemptive attack over Trump's renewed rhetoric. And Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suggested Trump will be “overthrown” if he intervenes in Iranian affairs.

The Iranian parliament speaker's warning comes as Trump had been briefed on options for striking Iran. He hasn't made a final decision on the matter yet.

Trump has promised to use the U.S. military to come to the aid of Iranian protesters if the country's clerical regime starts killing peaceful demonstrators on a large scale.

“Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before,” he wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday. “The USA stands ready to help!!!”

At least 116 people have been killed since anti-government protests broke out late last month, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. The organization reports at least 2,600 arrests as protests sweep the nation.

Tehran, the capital of Iran, and Masshad, the hometown of Khamenei, are among the cities experiencing protests. More demonstrations are planned for Sunday.

GRAHAM HINTS AT US MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAN REGIME ‘SOON' AS PROTESTS CONTINUE

The regime is using a mass internet blackout as a tactic to crack down on the protests. Despite losing access to communications, Iranians appear to be using Elon Musk's Starlink satellite transmitters to post what is happening inside Iran and to stay in touch with the outside world.

It remains to be seen if Iran follows through on its threats against the U.S. and Israel, but that will be entirely dependent on whether Trump authorizes military force. That outcome is now more likely after the recent military operation in Venezuela.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Sunday said the federal government will surge more law enforcement to Minneapolis after a U.S. citizen was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent on Wednesday. 

""We're sending more officers today and tomorrow; they'll arrive, there'll be hundreds more, in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely,"" Noem said in an appearance on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures."" 

The latest surge comes after Renee Nicole Good, the U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Wednesday. Noem has said, without providing evidence, that Good was engaged in an act of domestic terrorism when she was shot.

""If you look at what the definition of domestic terrorism is, it completely fits the situation on the ground,"" Noem claimed in an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""This officer was hit by her vehicle, she weaponized it, and he defended his life and those colleagues around him and the public."" 

Good, 37, was shot by an ICE agent positioned in front of her car on Wednesday while driving her SUV forward after agents attempted to remove her from her vehicle. The ICE agent has been identified as Jonathan Ross, two sources familiar with the investigation told MS Now.

Videos of the incident surfaced on Wednesday, prompting protests and nationwide scrutiny of the Trump administration's tactics as it carries out its mass deportation agenda. 

The administration and Noem have defended Ross, arguing that Good attempted to run him over with her vehicle, and have pledged to surge additional officers into Minneapolis. The administration had already moved more federal officers to the region amid reports of widespread social services fraud.

Pressed by CNN host Jake Tapper over why she was comfortable labeling Good a domestic terrorist before an investigation into the shooting can play out, Noem said, without proof, ""Everything that I've said has been proven to be factual and the truth.""

Democrats have threatened to impeach Noem over the killing, while noting that an investigation into the incident is underway. On Thursday, state officials with Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension claimed that the FBI is impeding the state-level investigation.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, in a Sunday interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" demanded an impartial investigation of the incident.

""Let's have the investigation in the hands of someone that isn't biased,"" he said. ""Let's not have it exclusively run through the FBI at the federal government or the Department of Justice."" 

""When you've got a federal administration that is so quick to jump on a narrative as opposed to the truth, I think we all need to be speaking out,"" Frey added.

Frey also bristled at Noem's characterization of Good's actions. 

""They were trying to leave the scene; that is not a person that's trying to run an ICE agent over,"" Frey said.

Noem on CNN blamed Frey and other Democrats, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, for the killing, arguing their rhetoric has prompted people to attempt to obstruct ICE. Frey called for ICE to ""Get the f--- out of Minneapolis,"" in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.

""They've extremely politicized and inappropriately talked about the situation on the ground in their city, they've inflamed the public,"" Noem said on CNN Sunday. ""They've encouraged the kind of destruction and violence that we've seen in Minneapolis the last several days.""

Frey, asked on NBC to respond to Noem, said, ""I'm sorry I offended their delicate ears.""

""I dropped an F-bomb, and they killed somebody. I think the 'killing somebody' is the inflammatory element here, not the F-bomb,"" Frey said. 

On NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, White House Border Czar Tom Homan argued that everyone should ""let the investigation play out.""

""I don't know what [the] secretary has that I don't,"" Homan said, though he said he believes what Good did was illegal.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday said no more Venezuelan oil or money will go to Cuba and suggested the Communist-run island should strike a deal with Washington, ramping up pressure on the longtime U.S. nemesis.

Venezuela is Cuba's biggest oil supplier, but no cargoes have departed from Venezuelan ports to the Caribbean country since the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by U.S. forces in early January amid a strict U.S. oil blockade on the OPEC country, shipping data shows.

Meanwhile, Caracas and Washington are progressing on a $2 billion deal to supply up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil to the U.S., with proceeds to be deposited in U.S. Treasury-supervised accounts, a major test of the emerging relationship between Trump and interim President Delcy Rodriguez.

""THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO! I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday.

""Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela,"" Trump added.

Trump did not elaborate on his suggested deal. U.S. officials have hardened their rhetoric against Cuba in recent weeks.

Trump is scheduled to be briefed by senior officials in his administration on Tuesday on specific options to respond to the protests in Iran, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing U.S. officials.

The meeting will be a discussion about possible next steps, including military strikes, deploying secretive cyber weapons against Iranian military and civilian sites, placing more sanctions on Iran's government, and boosting anti-government sources online, the Journal reported.

The White House said it had no comment on the report.

Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to intervene in recent days, posted on social media on Saturday: ""Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!

Reuters could not immediately verify the Journal report.

Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said in a post on X on Sunday that Cuba had the right to import fuel from any suppliers willing to export it. He also denied that Cuba had received financial or other ""material"" compensation in return for security services provided to any country.

Thirty-two members of Cuba's armed forces and intelligence services were killed during the U.S. raid on Venezuela. Cuba said those killed were responsible for ""security and defense"" but did not provide details on the arrangement between the two long-time allies.

Cuba relies on imported crude and fuel, mainly provided by Venezuela, and Mexico in smaller volumes, purchased on the open market to keep its power generators and vehicles running.

As its operational refining capacity dwindled in recent years, Venezuela's supply of crude and fuel to Cuba has fallen. But the South American country is still the largest provider with some 26,500 barrels per day exported last year, according to ship tracking data and internal documents of state-run PDVSA, which covered roughly 50% of Cuba's oil deficit.

Mexico has emerged in recent weeks as a critical alternative oil supplier to the island, but the supply remains small, according to the shipping data.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum last week said her country had not increased supply volumes, but given recent political events in Venezuela, Mexico had turned into an ""important supplier"" of crude to Cuba.

U.S. intelligence has painted a grim picture of Cuba's economic and political situation, but its assessments offer no clear support for Trump's prediction that the island is ""ready to fall,"" Reuters reported on Saturday, citing three people familiar with the confidential assessments.

The CIA's view is that key sectors of the Cuban economy, such as agriculture and tourism, are severely strained by frequent blackouts, trade sanctions and other problems. The potential loss of oil imports and other support from Venezuela, for decades a key ally, could make governing more difficult for President Miguel Diaz Canel.

Mornings are one of the most underestimated aspects of a relationship. For many working couples, they're something to rush through on the way to the day ahead. Alarms go off, phones come out, coffee is gulped down, and before either partner is fully awake, they're already headed into separate days.

But as a psychologist who studies couples, and as a husband, I've seen that the happiest couples use their mornings productively to make sure they leave the house knowing they're on the same team. 

Here's what they do differently that most neglect.

Your partner shouldn't be seen as an obstacle you have to get around in the morning. Even on busy days, happy couples make a point to acknowledge one another before shifting into work mode.

That often means making eye contact when saying ""good morning"" or sharing coffee or tea together without distractions. These moments may seem mundane, but research shows relationships thrive on small ""bids"" for attention that signal recognition and care.

Skipping them entirely can leave partners feeling emotionally invisible before the day has even begun.

Mornings aren't ideal for heavy conversations. Cortisol levels are naturally elevated upon waking, meaning your body is already primed for stress. Trying to tackle nuance or conflict too early can activate that response even more.

The happiest couples understand this intuitively. Before diving into logistics or complaints, they take a moment to sync: sitting quietly together, sharing coffee on the couch, or simply standing side by side while doing their morning routines.

Even a few moments of silent togetherness can regulate the nervous system and make the day feel more manageable.

Rather than full emotional check-ins, happy couples keep morning communication light, but still honest. Each partner shares one sentiment regarding their current feelings:

They're not revolutionary, but they're necessary for giving context to moods and behavior the other will see later on. It's much easier to understand your partner's short temper when you remember that they had a stressful meeting that day.

This could be five minutes of cuddles before getting up, walking the dogs together or cooking breakfast while listening to their song. The point is for it to be simple enough for you to repeat daily without struggle.

Having habits like these — routines or rituals that you can call ""our thing"" — can serve as surprisingly strong reaffirmations of your identity as a couple.

In many relationships, physical affection in the morning gets reduced to a rushed goodbye kiss on the cheek, if that. But happier couples don't budge on this. They use touch intentionally to ground themselves.

Spooning, long hugs, proper kisses or simply just leaning into each other for a moment before leaving — regardless of what suits you, any kind of physical contact like this can activate oxytocin and calm the nervous system, which helps both partners feel steadier as they separate.

Mornings can get messy if one partner is expected to bear the brunt of the household's mental or physical load.

Happy couples reduce this by treating mornings as a shared operation. If there are tasks that have to get done before work, like prepping lunch, feeding pets, or getting the kids ready, they divide them up mindfully and adjust when one partner is struggling. 

It doesn't have to look like perfect fairness every day. Just ensuring that no one's plate is too full goes a long way in protecting goodwill.

Before parting ways, the happiest couples will always offer at least one small yet specific gesture of support:

While they won't change the day's demands, they can make the demands feel easier to manage. More importantly, they show your partner that you're emotionally attuned to the things that matter to them, even if you're physically present.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Bitcoin bear market still in play as power law sees $65K 'do-or-die' price","https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:2d645c6a7094b:0-bitcoin-bear-market-still-in-play-as-power-law-sees-65k-do-or-die-price/","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 14:37:48 GMT","

Bitcoin BTCUSD faces a “do-or-die” price point if 2026 becomes a classic bear market year.

Key points:

Bitcoin four-year price cycles and bear markets remain relevant, the latest power law analysis says.

2026 may see a BTC price support showdown with $65,000 as the key level.

History demands price “catching up” to power-law targets.

Bitcoin bear markets to stay around

New analysis by Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, flags $65,000 as the next key BTC price battleground.

After hugging its power law trendline for much of the current bull market, BTCUSD could now be due for a retest of a lower support line — one currently at $45,000.

“It is following the internet S-curve a lot closer now than the power law curve,” Timmer acknowledged.

Power law attempts to give price a “fair value,” and history shows that trips toward the support line have often accompanied long-term bottoms.

“For now, the line in the sand for Bitcoin is $65k (previous high), and below that $45k. The latter is the power law trendline,” Timmer continued. 

 

The analysis called into question whether or not Bitcoin is still subject to four-year price cycles. For Timmer, halving cycles are impacting price less and less with time, but bear markets will still happen.

Responding, executive David Eng agreed that bear markets are set to remain a feature of Bitcoin as a maturing asset.

“The idea that Bitcoin has ‘graduated' into a no-bear-market S-curve price regime misunderstands how prices form,” he argued.

 

Eng added that Bitcoin now faces longer price cycles and lower overall volatility. 

”Compressed” BTC price needs a rebound

As Cointelegraph reported, four-year cycles became a topic of debate among the Bitcoin community after 2025 finished in the red.

BTCUSD has never ended a post-halving year lower than when it began, and reactions include dropping the cycle theory altogether.

Eng, however, predicts that “compressed” power law readings demand an upward relief rally.

“Bitcoin isn't stalling it's coiling below its long-term growth law, and history says resolution comes by price catching up, not the law giving way,” he told X followers this weekend.

Bitcoin is Compressed Below Its Growth Law, and Compression Always Resolves Upward

Bitcoin still obeys a single power law with extraordinary stability (R² ≈ 0.96) across 15+ years bubbles and crashes are oscillations, not regime changes.

A $23M XRP trade executed across multiple exchanges in 60 seconds signals coordinated institutional positioning rather than speculation.

XRP exchange balances fell to eight-year lows near 1.6B tokens while seven spot ETFs now hold $1.3B in assets.

XRP gained 25% in early January 2026 versus Bitcoin's 5.5%. Historical patterns show it leads altcoin rotations by several weeks.

XRP altcoin season 2026 may have just announced itself. A sudden $23 million XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) trade executed in just 60 seconds has shifted attention across the crypto market. The headline number wasn't what mattered. It was the timing and structure behind it. Large, coordinated volume tends to surface when positioning changes beneath the surface, not when speculation peaks.

That's why this event is being read as an early warning rather than a reaction. As capital begins rotating from Bitcoin into higher-beta assets, XRP often reflects that shift first. This pattern places renewed focus on whether altcoin season is starting in 2026, where leadership emerges quietly before the broader market catches on.

The $23 million XRP volume spike wasn't about the size alone. It was about speed, coordination, and timing. According to analyst Xaif Crypto, the trade hit multiple exchanges simultaneously, indicating systematic execution rather than a one-off bet. That pattern usually comes from algorithms designed to test liquidity and enter positions quickly, even at higher costs. When capital moves this fast, it reflects urgency rather than curiosity.

More telling was when it happened. The burst arrived while XRP was still consolidating below the $2.12 resistance, before price acceleration drew attention. Volume led price, not the other way around—and that sequence rarely belongs to retail traders.

Supporting data reinforced the signal. Exchange balances kept falling toward eight-year lows around 1.6 billion XRP, large wallets continued accumulating, and ETF-linked flows stayed positive even as Bitcoin funds saw outflows. Taken together, the spike looked like the final phase of quiet positioning. It marked conviction forming beneath the surface, not excitement chasing headlines.

XRP often reacts before the rest of the altcoin market because it sits at the first stop beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum on the risk curve. Large investors use it to test whether capital can move into higher-beta assets without disrupting liquidity. That behavior is why XRP is widely treated as a canary crypto signal when market tone shifts.

Its structure supports that role. XRP trades deep order books, carries regulatory clarity following the SEC settlement, and has real transaction flow tied to payments through RippleNet. That combination attracts early rotation when sentiment turns constructive. Smaller tokens don't offer the same balance of scale and stability.

Recent data fits the pattern. XRP outperformed while broader altcoins lagged, with a 25% gain in the first week of January 2026 compared to Bitcoin's 5.5%. Exchange balances kept shrinking, whale activity hit a three-month high with 2,802 transactions over $100,000 on January 7, and institutional positioning tilted toward large-cap alternatives. Historically, this setup leads to broader participation by several weeks.

XRP has a habit of moving before the crowd. Across multiple cycles, its early strength has signaled broader rotation, shaping expectations for altcoin performance in 2026.

In 2017, XRP surged months before altcoins entered full momentum. Volume expanded while price stayed compressed, signaling accumulation rather than hype. As XRP rallied first, Bitcoin dominance slid sharply, and capital rotated outward. By the time retail interest arrived, much of the upside had already been set. That early move framed XRP as a reliable lead indicator rather than a late-cycle trade.

The 2021 cycle followed a similar script. XRP broke out after a long base while most altcoins lagged. Institutional accumulation and brief volume bursts appeared weeks before broader participation. The gap between XRP's move and peak altcoin performance reinforced its role as a precursor, not a follower.

Current conditions resemble those earlier setups. Supply has tightened with exchange balances down 57% from October levels. Volume has accelerated, and XRP is again outperforming the pack. The structure supports a rotation process that begins with large-cap liquidity before spreading wider.

XRP's case for leading the 2026 altcoin rally rests on tightening supply and steady institutional demand. Exchange balances sit near eight-year lows at roughly 1.6 billion XRP, while ETF holdings continue to pull tokens out of circulation. Seven spot XRP ETFs now trade in the United States with combined assets exceeding $1.3 billion and approximately 746 million XRP locked in custody. 

On the demand side, ETF inflows accelerated in early January, with $48 million entering on January 6 alone. The technical structure shows XRP emerging from a multi-year compression that has historically preceded strong expansions. Together, these factors open a realistic path toward the $4 to $5 range if momentum sustains.

That upside still depends on confirmation. Bitcoin dominance needs to stay compressed, and mid-cap altcoins must begin outperforming to show broad rotation. Risks remain clear. Heavy profit-taking near recent highs, slowing ETF inflows, or a sharp Bitcoin breakout could unwind momentum. XRP holding above $2.10 support keeps the signal intact. Losing it would shift this move from leadership to a false start.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","When the oceans died and life changed forever","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260110211202.htm","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 06:16:28 GMT","

Around 445 million years ago, Earth underwent a dramatic transformation that reshaped the future of life. In a remarkably short geological period, massive glaciers spread across the southern supercontinent Gondwana. As ice locked up water, vast shallow seas dried out, triggering an ""icehouse climate"" and radically altering ocean chemistry. The result was catastrophic. Roughly 85% of all marine species vanished, wiping out most life on the planet.

Yet from this devastation emerged an unexpected outcome. According to a new study published in Science Advances, scientists from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) have shown that this event, known as the Late Ordovician Mass Extinction (LOME), set the stage for an explosion of vertebrate diversity. During the chaos, one group gained a lasting advantage and ultimately reshaped life on Earth: jawed vertebrates. ""We have demonstrated that jawed fishes only became dominant because this event happened,"" says senior author Professor Lauren Sallan of the Macroevolution Unit at OIST. ""And fundamentally, we have nuanced our understanding of evolution by drawing a line between the fossil record, ecology, and biogeography.""

Earth Before the Great Die-Off

The Ordovician period, which lasted from about 486 to 443 million years ago, looked nothing like today's world. Gondwana dominated the Southern Hemisphere and was surrounded by warm, shallow seas. With no ice at the poles, the planet experienced a greenhouse climate that supported rich marine ecosystems. Early land was just beginning to host simple plants similar to liverworts, along with many-legged arthropods creeping along coastlines.

The oceans, however, were already bursting with strange and diverse life. Large-eyed, lamprey-like conodonts moved through forests of towering sea sponges. Trilobites scurried across the seafloor among dense clusters of shelled mollusks. Human-sized sea scorpions and enormous nautiloids with pointed shells stretching up to five meters hunted through the water. Among this alien cast were the early ancestors of gnathostomes, or jawed vertebrates, which were still rare and unremarkable at the time.

Two Waves of Extinction

Although scientists still debate what ultimately caused LOME, the fossil record clearly shows a sharp dividing line before and after the event. ""While we don't know the ultimate causes of LOME, we do know that there was a clear before and after the event. The fossil record shows it,"" says Prof. Sallan.

The extinction unfolded in two distinct phases. First, Earth rapidly shifted from a warm greenhouse state to a cold icehouse climate. Glaciers expanded across Gondwana, draining shallow seas and destroying key marine habitats. Several million years later, just as ecosystems began to recover, the climate reversed again. Melting icecaps flooded the oceans with warmer water that was rich in sulfur and low in oxygen, overwhelming species that had adapted to colder conditions.

Survival in Isolated Refuges

During these repeated crises, surviving vertebrates were largely confined to refugia. These were isolated pockets of biodiversity separated by deep ocean barriers that most species could not cross. Within these refuges, jawed vertebrates appear to have held a crucial advantage.

To understand how this played out, the research team assembled an extensive fossil database spanning two centuries of late Ordovician and early Silurian paleontology. ""We pulled together 200 years of late Ordovician and early Silurian paleontology,"" says first author Wahei Hagiwara, a former research intern in the Macroevolution Unit who is now an OIST PhD student. By reconstructing the ecosystems within these refugia, the researchers were able to measure changes in genus-level diversity over time. Their analysis revealed a steady but striking rise in jawed vertebrate diversity following the extinction. ""And the trend is clear - the mass extinction pulses led directly to increased speciation after several millions of years.""

Geography Shapes Evolution

The fossil database also allowed the team to examine where these evolutionary changes occurred. By tracking species distributions before and after the extinction, the researchers were able to study biogeography in unprecedented detail. ""This is the first time that we've been able to quantitatively examine the biogeography before and after a mass extinction event,"" explains Prof. Sallan. Mapping species movements helped identify key refugia that fueled the later diversification of vertebrates.

One example comes from what is now South China. Fossils from this region include the earliest complete remains of jawed fishes closely related to modern sharks. According to Hagiwara, these species remained concentrated in stable refuges for millions of years. Only later did they evolve the ability to cross open oceans and spread into new environments.

Why Jaws Became an Advantage

By combining fossil evidence with data on anatomy, geography, and ecology, the study sheds new light on a long-standing evolutionary question. ""Did jaws evolve in order to create a new ecological niche, or did our ancestors fill an existing niche first, and then diversify?"" asks Prof. Sallan. ""Our study points to the latter.""

As jawed vertebrates were confined to small geographic areas, they encountered ecosystems with many open roles left behind by extinct jawless species and other animals. This abundance of available niches allowed them to rapidly diversify. A comparable pattern can be seen in Darwin's finches on the Galápagos Islands, which adapted to different food sources over time. As their diets diversified, their beaks evolved to match the ecological roles they occupied.

A Reset Rather Than a Clean Slate

While jawed fishes remained isolated in South China, jawless vertebrates continued to thrive elsewhere and dominated the open oceans for another 40 million years. These groups diversified into a wide range of reef fishes, some with alternative mouth structures. Why jawed vertebrates eventually outcompeted them after spreading beyond their refuges is still not fully understood.

What is clear is that LOME did not simply erase life and start anew. Instead, it triggered what the researchers describe as an ecological reset. Early vertebrates moved into roles once filled by conodonts and arthropods, rebuilding familiar ecosystem structures with new species. Similar patterns appear repeatedly throughout the Paleozoic era after other extinction events driven by comparable environmental shifts. The team refers to this recurring pattern as a ""diversity-reset cycle,"" where evolution restores ecosystems by converging on the same functional designs.

Tracing Modern Life to Ancient Survivors

Prof. Sallan summarizes the broader impact of the findings. ""By integrating location, morphology, ecology, and biodiversity, we can finally see how early vertebrate ecosystems rebuilt themselves after major environmental disruptions. This work helps explain why jaws evolved, why jawed vertebrates ultimately prevailed, and why modern marine life traces back to these survivors rather than to earlier forms like conodonts and trilobites. Revealing these long-term patterns and their underlying processes is one of the exciting aspects of evolutionary biology.""

Whereas on Windows, you are expected to download all your software from various websites, ridden with big green download button ads.And as for updates, once again there is no uniform way of finding or installing updates, so your chance of using outdated (and maybe vulnerable) software is higher on Windows.

Why is this a criteria?The following piece of metrical poetry from the Rig Veda, is of high importance to me, a bunch of vedic revivalists and connoisseurs scattered across the descendant cultures, perhaps to Indo-europeanists and comparative mythologists who study this in academic manner, even when translated into English.

    mighty and true, of him the True and Mighty.
    In the Trikadrukas he drank the Soma
    then in its rapture Indra slew the Dragon.

Now perhaps the LLMs can produce something which sounds lot like this, probably even in old Indic if they're trained enough on it.But it will never have the allure of the old indic hymns, because there's no riddle to solve, no real riddle that the machine has hidden in the words. When reading the above hymn, whether in sanskrit or English, whether it's me or an indologist like Jamison or Watkins (who wrote ""How to Kill a Dragon"" on Indo-European poetics), we are trying to imagine the same thing the original writer had imagined.In case of LLM, it's just a sequence of words that sounds cool. It may have no meaning.

Because defining ""good"" as ""made by a human from the human society"" is the easiest way to be able to go on and ""prove"" that ""LLM poetry is not good"" (these are scare quotes). She says she used this definition in ""over thirty years of reading, teaching, and writing poetry"" (this is an actual quote) but I highly doubt she would've found it necessary 30 years ago to define ""good"" as ""made by a human"" with this level of explicitness.Edit: having read the whole FA, the closing sentence makes much more sense (and is also completely at odds with the definition of greatness given earlier):""Operationally, greatness is measured when tastemakers put them in anthologies so that generations of readers can read them, tear out the ones that resonate, and tape them to their refrigerators.""

Cristiano Ronaldo will face added competition for places at the 2026 World Cup, Portugal boss Roberto Martinez has revealed. 

Evergreen 40-year-old CR7 is heading to that tournament, with another birthday being passed along the way, but is not expected to play every minute of every game — despite being captain of his country. Martinez is planning to take three strikers with him to the United States, Canada and Mexico.

One of those will be Ronaldo, as long as the Al-Nassr frontman steers clear of injury. Another spot will be filled by Paris Saint-Germain star Gonçalo Ramos — who stepped in for Ronaldo when his iconic compatriot was benched at the 2022 World Cup.

CR7 is reluctant to take any backwards steps, or fill a support role, but must accept that he needs to be managed carefully in the latter stages of his record-shattering career. With that in mind, and sweltering temperatures being predicted at a major international tournament this summer, Martinez is eager to ensure that he is not left short in an important area of the field.

Martino told the Lusa news agency: ""The door to the national team is always open, but the competitiveness makes it very difficult to get in. But, at the moment, we think we need a third striker and that this will be an important position for the World Cup.""

Martinez added when asked about predecessor Fernando Santos' decision to rotate Ronaldo out of his plans at the last World Cup: ""What happens around Cristiano is a historical aspect. He's a world football icon, but that doesn't condition or limit our work. Cristiano is very calm and very focused on the day-to-day, and that's a simple formula. When Cristiano Ronaldo is doing well, it's very important for the national team.""

Portugal should be full of confidence after winning the 2025 UEFA Nations League and securing automatic qualification for another World Cup. They have pre-tournament friendlies in place, with two of those taking them to Mexico and the USA in March.

Martinez outlined how important those fixtures will be: ""We have several profiles and the March stage will be very important in that regard.

""This World Cup will be complex and demanding for the European teams. Therefore, this training camp will be very important, first for playing at altitude in Mexico, and then in an indoor stadium against the USA. We thought we should try this before the World Cup, and for us it's the perfect preparation.""

Martinez has previously overseen quests for global glory with Belgium and believes he will have Portugal well prepared for the many challenges that they face. He explained the challenges of tournament soccer: ""This will be my third World Cup, and I've learned that nobody arrives as a champion team. You need to grow during the first three games and do everything to ensure our players are comfortable throughout the tournament.

""We don't have a history in World Cups, and that's part of our psychological preparation. We need to go step by step and make the players believe that we can truly win the World Cup.""

Martinez's contract is due to expire when the 2026 finals end, but he is giving little thought to his long-term future. He said: ""That's not my concern right now. My focus is on the World Cup. I'm very happy with the work we're doing and with the support from the federation. We're all in this together for the next challenge.

""The goal is the 2026 World Cup, and then we'll talk about the future. I love Portugal and I love working with the national team. My job and my focus are on making history so that these achievements will be talked about for the next 15, 20 years.""

Portugal have been placed in Group K at the 2026 World Cup, which will be staged between Houston and Miami. They will open against the winners of the intercontinental play-off (Jamaica, New Caledonia or Democratic Republic of Congo) before going on to face Uzbekistan and Colombia.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Bublik clinches Hong Kong crown, set to crack Top 10","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/musetti-bublik-hong-kong-2026-sunday","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 09:26:43 GMT","

Alexander Bublik captured his ninth ATP Tour title and fifth since June on Sunday at the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open where he overcame Lorenzo Musetti.

The second seed soaked up Musetti's variety and used his big baseline game to inflict his own damage on the Italian, earning a 7-6(2), 6-3 victory. Bublik will make his Top 10 debut in the PIF ATP Rankings on Monday following his title run, becoming the first Kazakhstani man to crack the Top 10.

""The only goal for this season was to achieve the Top 10 and in the first week I have won the title and I am into the Top 10,"" Bublik said. ""If you had told me that last April I would never have believed you. But it is a pleasure and I hope to continue in the same way.""

Bublik enjoyed a standout second half of last season, lifting trophies in Halle, Gstaad, Kitzbuhel and Hangzhou. In his first event of the new year, the 28-year-old continued from where he left off, dropping just one set at the ATP 250 in Hong Kong.

Musetti was aiming to capture his first title since he won in Naples in 2022. However, the 23-year-old suffered more final heartbreak and is now 2-7 in tour-level finals, having lost his past seven finals. In contrast, Bublik holds a 9-7 record in title matches, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.



Despite his defeat, Musetti will climb into the Top 5 in the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time on Monday. He is the third Italian to achieve the feat, joining Jannik Sinner and Adriano Panatta.

In a tense first set, Bublik came up with a moment of magic at 2/2 in the tie-break when he fired a backhand winner to lead. He reeled off the next four points to claim the opening set and then recovered from squandering a break advantage in the second set to improve to 3-1 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Musetti.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","‘DJ Kokkinakis' talks time off Tour as he prepares to headline Adelaide's main stage","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/kokkinakis-adelaide-2026-feature","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 07:15:36 GMT","

 Did 12 months away from the ATP Tour give Thanasi Kokkinakis the time he needed to discover his musical side? Well, sort of. 

 “It's funny. I bought some DJ decks pretty early and played those for a month or two,” Kokkinakis told ATPTour.com this week in Adelaide, where he is continuing his comeback after recovering from surgery on his pectoral muscle. “Then I forgot about that and got addicted to PlayStation, which I used to play. 

 “I played a lot of NBA2K. I get pretty competitive there. I get online, get on the headset, and when people talk some rubbish to me, I give a bit back! So that was one way of me trying to be competitive.” 

 From Ugo Humbert's dabbling on the piano to Yannick Noah's pop career and Jannik Sinner's collaboration with renowned tenor Andrea Bocelli, there is plenty of crossover history between the ATP Tour and the world of music. For his part, Kokkinakis does not think he will be making a similar move anytime soon. 

 “I'm a long way off [releasing a track], that's probably post-career, I think!,” joked the 29-year-old. “I learned the basic fundamentals, but then taking a step up, I didn't quite have the focus for it. We'll see. It's harder than I thought.” 

 On Monday, Kokkinakis will step on court at his hometown tournament, the Adelaide International, to compete in a tour-level singles match for the first time since his January 2025 Australian Open exit to Jack Draper. His first-round clash with Sebastian Korda will be a milestone moment for a player who has endured a testing 12 months. 



 Last February, Kokkinakis underwent a radical surgery — rarely if ever carried out on a tennis player — after years of managing damaged tissue in his right pectoral muscle. As the ATP Tour moved on from Australia and carried on around the globe for the rest of the 2025 season, Kokkinakis stayed in Melbourne to embark on a rehab programme that did not guarantee any positive results. 

 “It's definitely tricky. You get itchy feet a little bit, being in the same place,” said the former No. 65 in the PIF ATP Rankings, who won his only tour-level title so far in Adelaide in 2022. “Obviously it's different being home [in Adelaide], which is okay, but if you're in another place for longer, when you're used to only being there for one or max two weeks when you're on Tour, [it's hard]. 

 “I tried to stay busy with a lot of things. I did some commentary, a lot of sponsor stuff, so I was trying to stay active and stay busy. And then also my rehab and trying to get that right. That's a full-time job as much as anything, so I was just trying to get myself back to a point where I could even be in the draw for this tournament and give myself a chance.”

 While being unable to compete was naturally frustrating, Kokkinakis did not completely disengage with the goings-on in tennis across 2025. 

 “[I watched tennis] here and there. I wasn't shying away from it, but I wasn't following it closely all the time,” he said. “I was following basketball a lot. I love my NBA, but if the tennis was on, and it was a match I was interested in, I would watch. But I wasn't watching everything that was going on. 

 “[I spoke to friends on Tour] a little bit. Mainly the Aussies, if they had a good result or something like that, I'd send them a message. Draper actually reached out as well, and obviously he's going through a little bit of a tricky period now as well. So he was nice… But I wasn't messaging people all the time. It was mainly the Aussies.” 



 Kokkinakis is cautiously optimistic as he prepares for his comeback match against Korda, whom he was supposed to meet in the Adelaide quarter-finals a year ago before he withdrew due to his injury. Yet he is also realistic about the risk he chose with his surgery, in which he was given an Achille allograft to try to attach his pectoral muscle to his shoulder. 

 “Just being back and getting to this point is not even something I was sure of,” said Kokkinakis, who made his competitive return in doubles last week at the Brisbane International presented by ANZ, alongside Nick Kyrgios. “Now I don't know if I can get through a match, or get through a couple of matches, I really don't know, because I haven't played. I've done everything training-wise to give myself a chance to be here and that in itself is a win. 

 “Being able to go out on court knowing I've done a bunch of work and now I'm just praying my shoulder is alright, that definitely makes it worth it. Then the next step is going to be how I back up and where I go from here. But [it is good] just being here and even just playing some practice sets, seeing some crowds and hearing cheering, and just being back feeling those nerves and that buzz. Seeing some cameras again on me while I'm actually playing tennis is definitely an adjustment.”

Poland wins first United Cup title with victory over Switzerland","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4432366/united-cup-2026-poland-switzerland-belinda-bencic-conquers-iga-swiatek-to-put-swiss-on-verge-of-united-cup-championship","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 14:42:25 GMT","

After two straight final losses, Poland captured its first United Cup title Sunday in Sydney, overcoming Iga Swiatek's loss to Belinda Bencic as Katarzyna Kawa and Jan Zielinski sealed the comeback in mixed doubles.

SYDNEY, Australia -- Poland finally broke through at the United Cup on Sunday evening, capturing its first championship after falling in the 2024 and 2025 finals with a 2-1 victory over Switzerland at Ken Rosewall Arena.

After Iga Swiatek's loss to Belinda Bencic in the opening match of the tie, Hubert Hurkacz leveled the final before Katarzyna Kawa and Jan Zielinski clinched the title in mixed doubles. It marked the duo's third straight deciding victory of the week and denied Switzerland in its first appearance in the United Cup final.

Kawa and Zielinski finished a perfect 5-0 in mixed doubles during the tournament, closing the championship tie with a 6-4, 6-3 win over the previously unbeaten pairing of Bencic and Jakub Paul. In the opening set, Kawa delivered a pivotal volley at the net on set point at 5-4 during a deciding point that shifted the match in Poland's favor.

""I think it always pays off when you're brave on the important points, especially in doubles,"" Kawa said to reporters. ""It was like instinct decision. I just went for it. Yeah, I'm really happy that we sealed this set and we were able to get this match won.""

The mixed-doubles loss was Bencic's only defeat of the tournament. She finished with a 9-1 overall record and earned the event's most valuable player award.

Bencic went 5-0 in singles, highlighted by Top 10 victories over No. 2 Iga Swiatek and No. 8 Jasmine Paolini, and collected 500 ranking points for her performance.

Bencic won 12 of the final 15 games against Swiatek, earning her second career victory over the World No. 2 on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz. The first set seemed the tie's first match was going to belong to Swiatek, but the pendulum quickly shifted the momentum into the World No. 11's favor.

“It's always a challenge playing against her and every time I play her, I look for ways to improve and make her life a bit more difficult,” said Bencic, who defeated Swiatek for the first time in over four years. “I think the difference today was I played very freely, I was really enjoying myself out on the court and I was just really going for it.”

A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis)

Swiatek started strong early, holding serve in the opening game with four straight points followed by the match's first break and another hold. With Swiatek up 3-0, Bencic did settle into the match, winning two consecutive games of her own, cutting the deficit to 3-2 after a backhand winner on the third break point. The six-time Grand Slam champion eventually closed out the set, winning three of the next four games.

The second set, however, would be a Bencic domination with to force a deciding third set. Bencic started the second set winning nine consecutive points, and in the third game, she saved two break points. The following game, she'd get the crucial break on the third chance and finished the set in 33 minutes.

A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis)

“To be honest, I felt I was in the match from the very first point,” Bencic said. “I thought I was going great and I was 0-3 down. I was ‘OK, what do I have to do.' I think I just tried to keep the level and just wait for some chances.”

After three consecutive games with service holds to begin the third, Bencic notched the turning point. With a powerful forehand to set up break point, she took advantage of the crucial point, returning Swiatek's serve with a convincing backhand winner. Following a service hold, Bencic put herself within two games of the win, leading 4-1, and capitalized.

Swiatek fought to the last point, holding two games of serve and saving two match points with a pair of aces, but Bencic's backhand winner on the third match point sealed the win.

Under pressure with the tie on the line, Hurkacz struck 18 aces against Stan Wawrinka and saved eight of the nine break points he faced. Although Wawrinka earned a crucial break on his way to winning the second set, the three-time Grand Slam champion converted just two of 23 break-point chances across his five singles matches at the event.

Hurkacz went 4-1 in singles during the tournament, capping a successful return from a seven-month injury layoff following knee surgery.

The 28-year-old former World No. 6 also erased lingering United Cup disappointment. In the 2024 final, he held two championship points before losing to Alexander Zverev, and last year he fell to Taylor Fritz in a third-set tiebreak. This time, Hurkacz delivered the point Poland needed to set up the championship-winning mixed-doubles match.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Timothée Chalamet's starring role in Kylie Jenner's life — and why his public ‘I love you' wasn't another marketing ploy","https://pagesix.com/2026/01/11/celebrity-news/timothee-chalamets-starring-role-in-kylie-jenners-life/","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 13:00:00 GMT","

Timothee Chalamet is being tipped to take home a host of trophies this awards season — but his top starring role right now is in Kylie Jenner's life.

Eyebrows were arched when the rapidly rising A-list actor, 30, first started dating the reality-star-turned-cosmetics-mogul, 28, with Hollywood snobs doubting they'd last.

But proving the naysayers wrong, they've been taking things up a notch, with Chalamet declaring his love for Jenner as he accepted an award for his role in “Marty Supreme” at the Critics' Choice Awards last week.

Despite being from one of the US's most colorful and at times dramatic families and growing up under the glare of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” reality TV cameras, Jenner is notoriously guarded about his private life, but sources say the actor is responsible for taking her to a happier place.

“After living and growing up really fast, being with someone like Timmy is a wholesome, welcoming stable relationship,” a music industry insider familiar with Jenner and Chalamet told Page Six. 

And it doesn't hurt that Chalamet is currently on fire, being front runner – and the youngest in his category – nominated for Best Actor at the Golden Globes, for “Marty Supreme” as Marty Mauser, the relentless table tennis hustler determined to become a world champ.

Sources say his too-cool-for-school born-and-raised New Yorker personality have won Los Angeles native Kylie — who is also a make-up mogul worth over $670 million according to Forbes — completely.

“Timmy is a very cool, young kid who is dialed in. Even dating Kylie, he still retains that down-to-earth persona and hasn't forgotten where he's come from. Timmy's the girl next door, but in reverse,” the music industry insider said. 

Chalamet and Jenner's love story first started in January 2023, when they were spotted at a Jean Paul Gaultier fashion show during Paris Couture Week, but it was only in September of that year they made a public appearance, at a Beyonce concert.

Throughout their three years together, skeptics have doubted their relationship because, unlike many in the public eye, they rarely talk about it and rumors of a breakup are regularly circulated. But insiders say they've grown more comfortable parading their PDA and although they are low key about it, their relationship is getting stronger all the time. 

Proving they share a sense of humor and style, the couple stepped out in December for the Los Angeles premiere of his movie “Marty Supreme,” in matching custom Chrome Hearts outfits. Chalamet beamed at cameras  from an orange-hued leather suit and silk shirt, punctuating his monochromatic look with orange boots. Meanwhile, the Kylie Cosmetics mogul complemented him in a matching low cut, floor-length orange gown with cutouts at her waist. 

Then at the Critic's Choice Awards in Santa Monica on Jan. 4 the “Wonka” actor made it clear Jenner is his golden ticket.

He locked lips with the beauty guru moments before making his way to the stage to collect his award for Best Actor for “Marty Supreme.” 

Then, he allotted the final moments of his speech to praise her.

“Lastly, I'll just say thank you to my partner of three years, thank you for our foundation. I love you. I couldn't do this without you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart,” he said as the glossy-eyed mom of two returned the sentiment from the audience, mouthing “I love you” back.

It's anything but lip service for the Kylie Lip Kit creator.

Growing up the youngest of her generation in her famous family; alongside Kourtney, Khloe, Kim, Robert Kardashian Jr. and sister Kendall, Jenner grew up quickly, regularly appearing on national TV by the time she was a teenager.

She continued to grow up fast, getting pregnant during her second serious relationship with rapper Travis Scott, 34, and giving birth to their daughter, Stormi Webster, now 7, when she was 21 in 2018. They had an on-off relationship between 2019 and 2023, and another child together, son Aire Webster in 2022, but ultimately split at the very beginning of 2023, around the same time she was first spotted with Chalamet.

The star has gone from being a shoulder to cry on, to the sunshine in Jenner's life. Key to their bi-coastal relationship, with him based out of New York and she in California, is keeping things private. Little is known about Chalamet's relationship with his beau's children, for example. And they rarely allow themselves to be seen off-duty, outside of red carpet and public events.

Time and again, gossips have been proven wrong, such as rumors of “trouble in paradise” in November, and reports Chalamet had “broken up with Kylie.”

At the Palm Springs Film Festival earlier this month, Jenner posed in an orange sequined Ludovic de Saint Sernin gown to watch Chalamet honored with the Spotlight Actor of the Year award at role Josh Safdie-directed “Marty Supreme.”

Chalamet matched the support, liking her Instagram post and commenting with orange heart emojis.

Their return to the spotlight comes after spending the holidays together with the extended Kardashian-Jenner family, taking part in their annual Christmas “gingerbread house” tradition, with the “Dune” star's moniker etched in icing on the family's gingerbread house.

Sources say that while Jenner enjoys her extended honeymoon phase with Chalamet, she has also maintained a healthy co-parenting rhythm with Scott.

“They are in such a good place. They coparent so well — there's never an issue. They speak every single day and have a fantastic relationship,” a Scott source said.

Meanwhile, another source told Page Six the movie star keeps Jenner grounded.

“Timmy is a New York kid. He's got swag to him. You can tell he's been around the culture.

“Kylie's always been a kind gentle soul. She's [Kylie] got somebody whose got a lot going for him. She's a billionaire — now you got someone whose hot, doing his own thing. Travis is doing his own thing too, but [Timmy] feels safer — he's on screen, easy to get along with,” the source said.

While the couple is more buttoned up in public, Chalamet — who graduated from Manhattan's prestigious LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts — has made his name portraying emotionally rich and vulnerable characters. 

He played the precocious, sexually awakened 17-year-old teen in “Call Me By Your Name,” the womanizing boyfriend in “Lady Bird,” a recovering meth addict in “Beautiful Boy” and appeared as the love interest, Laurie, in “Little Women.” 

And he dazzled audiences last awards season when he transformed into poet and folk singer Bob Dylan in the biopic “A Complete Unknown” in which Chalamet brilliantly matched the nasal-forward, raspy vocal range of the 60's musician. 

Despite his massive fame and success — Chalamet, the entertainment source said, is refreshingly real. Whether he's grabbing pizza in the West Village or sitting courtside with Jenner at a Knick's game.

“They're good for each other because they both have tendencies to get a little brooding and in their own heads about things, and they lighten each other up,” a Jenner source told The Post last year.","{'href': 'https://pagesix.com', 'title': 'Page Six'}","entertainment"

Oliver Lewin, 41, was jailed six years for plotting to bomb phone, TV and radio masts across Britain(Image: PA)

A terror fanatic who vowed to topple the Government has lodged a bid to overturn his conviction, claiming he was the victim of ""police entrapment"".

Oliver Lewin, 41, was jailed six years for plotting to bomb phone, TV and radio masts across Britain. The conspiracy theorist, jailed in 2023, was obsessed with the idea that the country was being controlled by ""Jewish elites"" reporting to Israel.

He also believed that Boris Johnson's then Tory Government was planning genocide using Covid jabs. Now Parole Board documents reveal Lewin has lodged an appeal with the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

A report said he ""disputes his conviction"" stating: ""He has lodged an application with the Criminal Case Review Commission. Mr Lewin believes that he was subject to entrapment by the police.""

Police released images of Lewin carrying out reconnaissance work as he plotted to bring down Boris Johnson's Government(Image: West Midlands Police)

The Parole Board held a public hearing last month, as well as a closed session, with a report finding that Lewin would not be allowed out on parole.

It found Lewin should be kept behind bars because his ""risk to the public would be greater than minimal if he were to be released"".

A prison psychologist told the panel: ""I do not feel we have a full understanding of his risk.""

Lewin thought ""white people across Europe were being systematically killed by the vaccine"" and concluded this ""triggered the emergence of a Chinese communist system in Britain"".

He was found guilty at Birmingham crown court of engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorist acts.

Lewin had spread conspiracy theories online and expressed hostility towards Jewish people during the Covid-19 pandemic.

He had attempted to persuade undercover police officers to target a major transmitter in Sutton Coldfield which serves 4.2 million homes.

A judge said Lewin - who compiled a list of essentials he needed for the attacks - had taken ""at least some preparatory steps""(Image: West Midlands Police)

Lewin, from Coalville, Leics, had told contacts online: ""My idea is to disable vital communications and transport infrastructure to a point that has an impact on the country.""

Police arrested Lewin on August 25, 2021, after determining his real-world plans were accelerating.

He had been conducting reconnaissance of communication masts and sending images with drawings showing where he planned to cut cables.

And he told undercover officers ""chop here, job done"", and had started writing a manual for potential supporters, completing four of the intended 17 chapters.

He attempted to recruit friends to assist him, including one who was 16 or 17 years-old at the time.

When police searched his home following his arrest, officers recovered military-style equipment including a lock knife, camping equipment, camouflage clothing and two air a rifles fitted with telescopic sights.

The parole decision noted that risk is greatest when Lewin is online and alone, and that his offending had been ""internet-based"" when he went looking for conspiracy theories.

If he had been released, the risk management plan would have included restrictions on internet access, mobile phone use and GPS tagging for 12 months at Probation Approved Premises.

At the parole hearing, Lewin, who disputes his conviction and has lodged an application with the Criminal Cases Review Commission, told the panel he now feels ""a healthy amount of respect"" for Jewish people.

The sentencing judge had noted that Lewin believed the Covid vaccine was designed to kill anyone who took it and that the UK government was complicit in a high-level conspiracy originating from Israel.

      The Varginha Case is unique because it involves dozens of independent witnesses, including firefighters, police officers, and doctors. There are hospital records, accounts of the capture of a live creature, secret military transport, deaths of those involved, and documents that support a real operation, not just a sighting.
    


      When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever reported, Redditors have shared a variety of cases that stand out for their credibility, documentation, and the sheer number of witnesses involved. Here are some of the most frequently mentioned and highly regarded sightings:
    


Location: Ruwa, Zimbabwe
    


Details: Over 60 schoolchildren witnessed a craft landing in their schoolyard and several beings emerging from it. The incident was investigated by a well-known psychologist, and a documentary on YouTube provides more details. ""The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. Surprised it hasn't been mentioned. 60 plus children apparently witnessed a craft landing in the schoolyard and a few beings came out.""



Location: Alaska, USA
    


Details: A JAL cargo flight crew, including the pilot and co-pilot, observed a massive UFO for over 30 minutes. The object was also tracked by ground radar. The pilot's career was significantly impacted by his decision to speak out about the incident. ""JAL Flight 1628... What the pilot and co-pilot saw that day was also being tracked by ground radar as well.""



Location: Suffolk, England
    


Details: US Air Force personnel stationed at RAF Woodbridge and RAF Bentwaters reported multiple nights of strange lights and a craft landing in Rendlesham Forest. The incident involved direct interaction with the object and detailed military testimonies. ""Rendelsham Forest or Shag Harbour. When it comes to Rendelsham, I am confident in thinking a crew of military men as they were would not have mistaken a light house for a UFO.""



Location: Phoenix, Arizona, USA
    


Details: Thousands of people, including the then-governor of Arizona, witnessed a massive V-shaped formation of lights moving silently across the night sky. The event was widely reported and remains one of the most famous mass UFO sightings. ""Phoenix lights...""



Location: Off the coast of California, USA
    


Details: US Navy pilots, including Commander David Fravor, encountered a Tic Tac-shaped object that displayed incredible speed and maneuverability. The incident was captured on FLIR video and corroborated by multiple witnesses and radar data. ""For me, it's the eyewitness testimony of David Fraver, the fighter pilot who described his interactions with the 'tic tac' ufo off the coast of California during his training runs.""



Location: Tehran, Iran
    


Details: Iranian Air Force pilots were scrambled to intercept a UFO that was also tracked by radar. The pilots reported instrumentation failures and communications blackouts when approaching the object. ""1976 Tehran UFO incident: Nothing beats this one. Military personals, radars and civilian plane encountered the UFO.""



Location: Los Angeles, California, USA
    


Details: During World War II, the military fired anti-aircraft artillery at a large object in the sky, which was illuminated by searchlights. The event was widely reported by the media and involved numerous civilian witnesses. ""The Battle of Los Angeles where the military had to resort to using AA weapons against a 'weather balloon'.""



Location: Chicago, Illinois, USA
    


Details: Airline employees and witnesses reported a disc-shaped object hovering over Gate C17 at O'Hare International Airport. The FAA initially dismissed the reports but later acknowledged the incident. ""I heard the Chicago O'Hare ufo was pretty legit but all the evidence disappeared.""



Location: Varginha, Minas Gerais, Brazil
    


Details: Multiple witnesses reported seeing a strange creature and a UFO crash. The Brazilian military allegedly captured several creatures and covered up the incident. ""Finally in the 90's what appeared to be a malfunctioning ship was sighted near Varginha, MG.""



Location: McMinnville, Oregon, USA
    


Details: A local farmer and his wife took two photographs of a metallic, disc-shaped object in the sky. The photos have been extensively analyzed and remain a subject of debate. ""Good picks. Please add the McMinnville photos.""



      These sightings represent some of the most compelling and well-documented cases in UFO history, supported by multiple witnesses, radar data, and official investigations. While skepticism is healthy, these incidents have left many convinced that there is something truly inexplicable happening in our skies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","I Was Kidnapped by Idiots","https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/kidnapped-baghdad/685470/","Sun, 11 Jan 2026 12:00:00 GMT","

An academic trip to Iraq unexpectedly turned into an immersive field study on the ways authoritarian regimes use brutality.

Four men searched my mouth for implanted tracking devices. I had told them I didn't have any—that, as far as I knew, such things existed only in movies. They asked if I had fillings, and I confessed that I did. They looked again. “No, you don't,” one of them corrected me, having failed to find any glint of silver. My fillings are white. The men, wearing dark civilian clothes and balaclavas, seemed convinced that these unfamiliar fillings posed a threat to their operational security. That's when I knew that my kidnapping was going to be a little bit different.

I was violently snatched on March 21, 2023, from the outskirts of Baghdad, where I had been conducting fieldwork for my Ph.D. at Princeton University. When my kidnappers delivered me to my cell, they cut the restraints they'd placed around my arms and legs, and lifted the cloth bag off my head. The secret prison where I was brought was run by Kataib Hezbollah, an Iraqi militia backed by Iran.

That was my first day of captivity. Nine hundred and two more followed. I spent the first four and a half months in a prison usually used for holding the militia's Iraqi victims. The militiamen, I later learned, worked for one of Iraq's security agencies, many of which have been extensively penetrated by pro-Iranian paramilitary groups. Even so, my kidnapping was purely opportunistic—I was taken for ransom, not for any political reason.

From the May 2021 issue: A kidnapping gone very wrong

I have researched the Levant for almost two decades under the auspices of several think tanks, conducting fieldwork across the region. The kidnappers knew I was a Russian national affiliated with an American university—which was why they saw me as a lucrative target for kidnap and ransom. What they did not know—and what I was not eager for them to learn—was that although I was born in Russia, I am also an Israeli citizen.

The kidnapping itself was extremely violent, but for the first month of my imprisonment, I was not otherwise physically abused. I was given very little to eat—mostly rice and bread, in one or two meals a day—something that I came to understand was intended to weaken me, to soften me up for interrogation.

An officer who introduced himself as Maher led the interrogations. He wore a balaclava throughout so that I would not be able to identify him. The idea of a Russian doing academic research on Iraq was utterly befuddling to Maher and his colleagues. They felt that as a Russian, I should research Russia alone. Maher promised that if I was able to prove that foreign researchers conducted fieldwork in Russia, then he would be my “greatest defender.” When I started listing some, he looked downcast. He did not become my greatest defender.

The problem I faced was that my interrogations were premised on the idea that legions of foreign spies are roaming the streets of Iraq, and that all foreigners in Iraq are spies: Maher once asked me whether the entire building in a gated area of Baghdad in which I briefly resided was occupied by spies. Compounding my difficulty of proving a negative—that I was the rare foreigner who wasn't a spy—was their incompetence at interrogation. One officer didn't bother to give me a fake name, but I'll call him the Short Pervert because of his constant grabbing of my body and his foul language. The Short Pervert claimed that his organization had recordings and photos proving my espionage work, though he declined to produce any such evidence when I asked for it.

The interrogators kept threatening me with torture, but in those opening weeks, they refrained from acting on the threats—I assume on orders from higher up. Instead, because they were clearly untrained in conducting interrogations that did not involve torture, they fell back on interrogation methods they had probably seen in movies. To intimidate me, Maher would blow smoke in my face, but because he was using an e-cigarette, all I got was a gust of strawberry-smelling vape. It wasn't quite the tough-guy routine he was after. Later, he tried the “good cop, bad cop” routine on me but undermined the effect by playing both characters himself, on alternate days, which just made him seem deranged.

The comic aspect of this all changed when, a month after my capture, the kidnappers opened my phone after forcing me to give them the passcode and discovered that I was Israeli. Now they didn't need to ask me to admit I was a spy; they could torture me to say so.

Authoritarian regimes—and the militias and security agencies that buttress them—rely on instilling fear in their subjects. They rule by enforcing conformity and obedience through terror.

I knew something about this, not solely because of my research but also from my upbringing. I was born in late 1986 in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) as the Soviet Union was sunsetting. Both of my parents were dissidents in the U.S.S.R. My father spent seven years in prison and another two years doing hard labor in Siberia for writing anti-regime flyers from a democratic Marxist point of view. My mother, for her part, was sentenced to three years in a Siberian prison after the KGB ransacked her apartment and found an extensive collection of anti-Soviet jokes that she had diligently collected from her dissident friends during their gatherings. This was the era of samizdat literature, when regime critics copied and shared reading material—essays, polemics, news—that they had diligently typed and retyped on paper, because publication was impossible. A typical satirical jest from my mother's collection: A judge comes out of a Soviet courtroom laughing. A prosecutor asks him, “Why are you laughing?” The judge responds, “I'd tell you, but I just sentenced someone for five years in prison for telling this joke.”

In my own captivity, I recognized what many dissidents, including my mother, realized before me: Humor is a weapon that can be used even by the very weak to undermine the ruling authority, to break its terrorizing effect, to lift one's morale. Repressive regimes fear being mocked because they hate having their incompetence and ignorance exposed. This is why they penalize the circulation of political jokes.

Read: I watched stand-up in Saudi Arabia

Once, when I was singing in my cell to keep my spirits up, a torturer who went by the name Yasser—a corpulent man who gave himself the rank of major—ordered me to lower my voice: “Volume down!” Then he asked in Arabic whether his English usage was correct. He was pleased with himself when I said it was. His need for affirmation was so pathetic that in other circumstances, it would have been touching. Even more pathetic was when Maher, who initially had claimed to be a captain, discovered that Yasser's imaginary rank outranked his own. He immediately corrected himself, insisting that I call him Major Maher.

Even during my time in solitary in the torture facility, I would occasionally replay the interrogation scenes in my head—not to relive the torture but to lighten my mood by recalling my tormentors revealing their bottomless ignorance. These supposed intelligence agents knew little about their proclaimed enemies, Israel and the United States. One of the torturers, a chain-smoker who visited me only twice, insisted that 60 percent of Americans live in poverty and that the U.S. works to make Iraqi girls disobey their fathers and go out of the home without their permission.

Inwardly laughing at them made my situation more bearable, a little less scary. But my captors' lack of professionalism about intelligence work contrasted with an almost medical-level of knowledge of how to torture—an expertise, I can only assume, gained through inflicting horrors on countless Iraqi citizens. They knew how to beat my face without leaving marks on it, by smashing the jaw from below. Maher discoursed on the different methods of torture they used on me, accurately ranking the pain dosed out by each method. Maher could also tell whether my shoulder was dislocated just by briskly touching it.

He bragged in my presence to a colleague that, whereas other operatives would merely hang me from the ceiling with my wrists handcuffed behind my back and then beat my knees so that I couldn't support my weight to relieve the pressure on my shoulder joints and spine, he had started using an even more painful technique. This method, which involved handcuffing my arms crisscrossed behind my back, is known as “the Scorpion” in Iraq. It stops the flow of blood to the palms and causes immense pain in the shoulders that lasts for weeks. (Being strung up by these methods caused two of my discs to herniate and left permanent nerve damage in my hands.)

One day, the torture team presented me with the results of a misguided attempt at open-source intelligence, showing me screenshots from Facebook of foreign visitors to Iraq whom they insisted I knew and could identify. This presented me with a horrible problem: I could not confess my way out of the torture, as I usually would—making up any plausible answer I knew they would accept—because, although I genuinely did not know any of these individuals, the torturers had their names.

From the May 2021 issue: The awful wisdom of a hostage

The militiamen strung me up and their commander, a man I knew as the Colonel, proceeded to whip me all over with a flat plastic pipe. When I passed out from the pain, the men lowered me to the floor, doused me with water, then strung me up again. I fainted again; they repeated the drill. On the third time, through a fog of agony, I thought that if I pretended I was still unconscious, they might leave me lying on the floor longer. But they'd done this so many times, and they knew I was faking.

“Have you rested enough?” Maher asked, mockingly. They yanked the chain again to haul me into the air, placing me in a kneeling position. I could not stabilize myself even on my knees, and was spinning like a dreidel. Although I was close to fainting with dizziness, they could detect that I was conscious.

After these sessions, they would usually give me time to rest in my cell and serve me some food. Then they'd take me back to record the “confession” I'd already made. For that, they would remove my handcuffs, as if I was confessing of my own volition.

I kept telling them that before my departure to the U.S. for graduate school in 2017, I had worked for human-rights organizations in Israel. Surely, they'd realize that I would be just about the last person the Israeli security apparatus would want to recruit. I repeatedly asked them to Google my name so that they could see the articles I'd written and the social-media comments I'd posted that were critical of Israeli-government policies. But they refused to do a search. In any case, they read only Arabic.

I had no interest in “resisting” interrogation under torture—after all, I had nothing real to hide, nothing I would not want to confess. So I freely admitted to whatever they seemed to want to hear: that I worked for the CIA and was a Mossad spy. To be both, of course, was hardly possible, but as these men beat me again and again over the next 14 weeks, I learned their bizarre conspiracy theories—and tried to match my fables to theirs.

The Colonel insisted that Masons and Zionists ran the world. Yet later on, he declared that Israel had been established by Saudi Arabia, Iran's chief regional rival. If Jews were all powerful, why did they need the Saudis to help them establish the “Zionist entity”? All of my torturers believed that the Islamic State was created as a joint operation by Israel, the U.S., and Saudi Arabia to subvert Iraq. One of ISIS's brutalities was to execute homosexuals by throwing them off buildings, but Maher saw no contradiction when he told me that the U.S. used male-only cafés to spread homosexuality in the country.

The torturers insisted that I provide them with an account of my Mossad-CIA training, so I made one up—it gave me something to think about while I lay prostrate in my cell between the torture sessions. Because I had to concoct something I knew nothing about, I ran out of content after two weeks of material, so I decided simply to claim that it took two weeks. Counting on their not knowing any better was a fair assumption. Because they so often betrayed their ignorance, I quickly realized that as long as my confessions matched their distorted view of reality, they would believe anything I confessed to, no matter how fantastical.

They compounded their ignorance with incompetence in basic aspects of tradecraft. Maher told me that his organization had followed my movements around Baghdad by accessing CCTV footage—except that this was contradicted by the Short Pervert, who described tailing me in the street and at a coffee shop, mentioning details that he could not have known otherwise. All of the torturers brought smartphones into the chamber where I would be screaming. Israel's ability to hack smartphones and turn them into listening and recording devices has been widely reported. In addition, my torturers repeatedly provided pieces of information that could prove helpful in identifying them as part of investigations by the FBI and other agencies.

Two years later, in a second prison where I was not subjected to physical abuse and felt confident that I would not be tortured again, I dared to tell an Iranian officer the truth: that all of my confessions had been lies produced under torture. At first, he did not believe me, spitting back, “But how did you know that Mossad training takes two weeks?”

“I knew I could make up anything,” I told him, “since the Mossad has penetrated you, but you have not penetrated the Mossad.” After believing for two years that I was indeed a spy, he appeared to accept the truth.

Their ignorance makes these militiamen quite ineffective at halting their own intelligence breaches. In February 2024, shortly after a Kataib Hezbollah attack killed three U.S. service members in Jordan, the U.S. assassinated the commander responsible in Baghdad. Four years earlier, the U.S. had assassinated the previous commander of Kataib Hezbollah, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, alongside Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian commander in charge of running Iran's proxy militias.

This mix of woeful ignorance and expert brutality may appear odd, but it is a hallmark of regimes that are born of marginalized, typically rural, victims of prior rulers. The downtrodden take power and exact revenge against the previous elites, and mete out violence against every suspected opponent. Such a regime existed in Iraq previously: Under Saddam Hussein, the Baath leadership was drawn largely from the Sunni minority, but the lower ranks of the security agencies, the interrogators and torturers, were recruited from the poor Shia-majority provinces. In Syria, an equivalent system existed under the Assad dynasty, in which rural Alawites (a heterodox sect that emerged from Shiism) dominated the security agencies that policed a Sunni majority. Going further back in history, Maoist China and Khmer Rouge Cambodia followed the same pattern.

Under such regimes, the state uses indiscriminate barbarity to instill constant terror in the population. The purpose is to deter resistance, but the arbitrary nature of the violence can stem from the unreliable information produced by ignorant interrogators: Informers may be settling personal scores; torture victims will, like me, say anything. Security agencies staffed by dumb thugs are typically inept at identifying genuine subversive threats.

As my experience showed, a heavy reliance on physical abuse makes for proficient torturers, not skilled interrogators. Again and again, torture has proved to produce false confessions and bad intelligence. The only knowledge that torture provides is the ultimate confirmation bias: information about the threats facing the regime that is entirely in line with the worldview of the torturers, who characteristically share the regime's generalized paranoia.

From the September 2003 issue: The truth about torture

This principle became my guide to confession. When I adopted conspiracy theories that the torturers believed in—a practice I'd refused during my first month's captivity, before I was tortured—the militiamen were deeply satisfied with the verification. So when I confessed that the 2019 popular revolt against Iraq's corrupt, militia-backed order was a Western plot, Maher was delighted: “And you were saying it's a conspiracy theory!” Just for him, I was planning a detailed confession about spreading homosexuality in Iraq, but I was transferred out of the torture prison before I got a chance to present it.

History suggests that the proficient cruelty of such regimes is unable to compensate for the stupidity and incompetence of their cadres. Their security apparatuses have a distorted view of the threats facing the regime. The Kataib militiamen tried to come up with solutions for their vulnerability, but their countermeasures were laughable. My captors told me that they'd recruited informers in the anti-government protest movement to confirm that its activists are foreign agents (they're not). Their lack of insight into their adversaries' intelligence capability makes these militiamen demonstrably ineffectual at halting intelligence breaches.

In the last facility where I was held—briefly, just before my release on September 9—the men in charge of security were no more adept. They ordered the guards sitting with me not only to hide their faces with medical masks but also to wear medical gloves. I'm no spy, but I don't think latex gloves will do the trick.

Oops, something went wrong

A $23M XRP trade executed across multiple exchanges in 60 seconds signals coordinated institutional positioning rather than speculation.

XRP exchange balances fell to eight-year lows near 1.6B tokens while seven spot ETFs now hold $1.3B in assets.

XRP gained 25% in early January 2026 versus Bitcoin's 5.5%. Historical patterns show it leads altcoin rotations by several weeks.

A recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans' retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here.

XRP altcoin season 2026 may have just announced itself. A sudden $23 million XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) trade executed in just 60 seconds has shifted attention across the crypto market. The headline number wasn't what mattered. It was the timing and structure behind it. Large, coordinated volume tends to surface when positioning changes beneath the surface, not when speculation peaks.

That's why this event is being read as an early warning rather than a reaction. As capital begins rotating from Bitcoin into higher-beta assets, XRP often reflects that shift first. This pattern places renewed focus on whether altcoin season is starting in 2026, where leadership emerges quietly before the broader market catches on.

The $23 million XRP volume spike wasn't about the size alone. It was about speed, coordination, and timing. According to analyst Xaif Crypto, the trade hit multiple exchanges simultaneously, indicating systematic execution rather than a one-off bet. That pattern usually comes from algorithms designed to test liquidity and enter positions quickly, even at higher costs. When capital moves this fast, it reflects urgency rather than curiosity.

More telling was when it happened. The burst arrived while XRP was still consolidating below the $2.12 resistance, before price acceleration drew attention. Volume led price, not the other way around—and that sequence rarely belongs to retail traders.

Supporting data reinforced the signal. Exchange balances kept falling toward eight-year lows around 1.6 billion XRP, large wallets continued accumulating, and ETF-linked flows stayed positive even as Bitcoin funds saw outflows. Taken together, the spike looked like the final phase of quiet positioning. It marked conviction forming beneath the surface, not excitement chasing headlines.

XRP often reacts before the rest of the altcoin market because it sits at the first stop beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum on the risk curve. Large investors use it to test whether capital can move into higher-beta assets without disrupting liquidity. That behavior is why XRP is widely treated as a canary crypto signal when market tone shifts.

Its structure supports that role. XRP trades deep order books, carries regulatory clarity following the SEC settlement, and has real transaction flow tied to payments through RippleNet. That combination attracts early rotation when sentiment turns constructive. Smaller tokens don't offer the same balance of scale and stability.

Recent data fits the pattern. XRP outperformed while broader altcoins lagged, with a 25% gain in the first week of January 2026 compared to Bitcoin's 5.5%. Exchange balances kept shrinking, whale activity hit a three-month high with 2,802 transactions over $100,000 on January 7, and institutional positioning tilted toward large-cap alternatives. Historically, this setup leads to broader participation by several weeks.

XRP has a habit of moving before the crowd. Across multiple cycles, its early strength has signaled broader rotation, shaping expectations for altcoin performance in 2026.

In 2017, XRP surged months before altcoins entered full momentum. Volume expanded while price stayed compressed, signaling accumulation rather than hype. As XRP rallied first, Bitcoin dominance slid sharply, and capital rotated outward. By the time retail interest arrived, much of the upside had already been set. That early move framed XRP as a reliable lead indicator rather than a late-cycle trade.

The 2021 cycle followed a similar script. XRP broke out after a long base while most altcoins lagged. Institutional accumulation and brief volume bursts appeared weeks before broader participation. The gap between XRP's move and peak altcoin performance reinforced its role as a precursor, not a follower.

Current conditions resemble those earlier setups. Supply has tightened with exchange balances down 57% from October levels. Volume has accelerated, and XRP is again outperforming the pack. The structure supports a rotation process that begins with large-cap liquidity before spreading wider.

XRP's case for leading the 2026 altcoin rally rests on tightening supply and steady institutional demand. Exchange balances sit near eight-year lows at roughly 1.6 billion XRP, while ETF holdings continue to pull tokens out of circulation. Seven spot XRP ETFs now trade in the United States with combined assets exceeding $1.3 billion and approximately 746 million XRP locked in custody.

On the demand side, ETF inflows accelerated in early January, with $48 million entering on January 6 alone. The technical structure shows XRP emerging from a multi-year compression that has historically preceded strong expansions. Together, these factors open a realistic path toward the $4 to $5 range if momentum sustains.

That upside still depends on confirmation. Bitcoin dominance needs to stay compressed, and mid-cap altcoins must begin outperforming to show broad rotation. Risks remain clear. Heavy profit-taking near recent highs, slowing ETF inflows, or a sharp Bitcoin breakout could unwind momentum. XRP holding above $2.10 support keeps the signal intact. Losing it would shift this move from leadership to a false start.

Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don't.

And no, it's got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It's much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it's shocking more people don't adopt the habit given how easy it is.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"
