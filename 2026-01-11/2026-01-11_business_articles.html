                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Sunday said the federal government will surge more law enforcement to Minneapolis after a U.S. citizen was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent on Wednesday. "We're sending more officers today and tomorrow; they'll arrive, there'll be hundreds more, in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely," Noem said in an appearance on Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures." The latest surge comes after Renee Nicole Good, the U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Wednesday. Noem has said, without providing evidence, that Good was engaged in an act of domestic terrorism when she was shot. The ICE agent has been identified as Jonathan Ross, two sources familiar with the investigation told MS Now. Videos of the incident surfaced on Wednesday, prompting protests and nationwide scrutiny of the Trump administration's tactics as it carries out its mass deportation agenda. The administration and Noem have defended Ross, arguing that Good attempted to run him over with her vehicle, and have pledged to surge additional officers into Minneapolis. The administration had already moved more federal officers to the region amid reports of widespread social services fraud. Pressed by CNN host Jake Tapper over why she was comfortable labeling Good a domestic terrorist before an investigation into the shooting can play out, Noem said, without proof, "Everything that I've said has been proven to be factual and the truth." Democrats have threatened to impeach Noem over the killing, while noting that an investigation into the incident is underway. On Thursday, state officials with Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension claimed that the FBI is impeding the state-level investigation. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, in a Sunday interview on NBC's "Meet the Press," demanded an impartial investigation of the incident. "Let's have the investigation in the hands of someone that isn't biased," he said. "When you've got a federal administration that is so quick to jump on a narrative as opposed to the truth, I think we all need to be speaking out," Frey added. Frey also bristled at Noem's characterization of Good's actions. "They were trying to leave the scene; that is not a person that's trying to run an ICE agent over," Frey said. Noem on CNN blamed Frey and other Democrats, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, for the killing, arguing their rhetoric has prompted people to attempt to obstruct ICE. "They've extremely politicized and inappropriately talked about the situation on the ground in their city, they've inflamed the public," Noem said on CNN Sunday. "They've encouraged the kind of destruction and violence that we've seen in Minneapolis the last several days." Frey, asked on NBC to respond to Noem, said, "I'm sorry I offended their delicate ears." "I dropped an F-bomb, and they killed somebody. On NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday, White House Border Czar Tom Homan argued that everyone should "let the investigation play out." "I don't know what [the] secretary has that I don't," Homan said, though he said he believes what Good did was illegal. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday said no more Venezuelan oil or money will go to Cuba and suggested the Communist-run island should strike a deal with Washington, ramping up pressure on the longtime U.S. nemesis. Venezuela is Cuba's biggest oil supplier, but no cargoes have departed from Venezuelan ports to the Caribbean country since the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by U.S. forces in early January amid a strict U.S. oil blockade on the OPEC country, shipping data shows. "THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO! I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday. "Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela," Trump added. Trump did not elaborate on his suggested deal. U.S. officials have hardened their rhetoric against Cuba in recent weeks. Trump is scheduled to be briefed by senior officials in his administration on Tuesday on specific options to respond to the protests in Iran, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing U.S. officials. The meeting will be a discussion about possible next steps, including military strikes, deploying secretive cyber weapons against Iranian military and civilian sites, placing more sanctions on Iran's government, and boosting anti-government sources online, the Journal reported. Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to intervene in recent days, posted on social media on Saturday: "Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said in a post on X on Sunday that Cuba had the right to import fuel from any suppliers willing to export it. He also denied that Cuba had received financial or other "material" compensation in return for security services provided to any country. Thirty-two members of Cuba's armed forces and intelligence services were killed during the U.S. raid on Venezuela. Cuba said those killed were responsible for "security and defense" but did not provide details on the arrangement between the two long-time allies. As its operational refining capacity dwindled in recent years, Venezuela's supply of crude and fuel to Cuba has fallen. But the South American country is still the largest provider with some 26,500 barrels per day exported last year, according to ship tracking data and internal documents of state-run PDVSA, which covered roughly 50% of Cuba's oil deficit. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum last week said her country had not increased supply volumes, but given recent political events in Venezuela, Mexico had turned into an "important supplier" of crude to Cuba. U.S. intelligence has painted a grim picture of Cuba's economic and political situation, but its assessments offer no clear support for Trump's prediction that the island is "ready to fall," Reuters reported on Saturday, citing three people familiar with the confidential assessments. The CIA's view is that key sectors of the Cuban economy, such as agriculture and tourism, are severely strained by frequent blackouts, trade sanctions and other problems. The potential loss of oil imports and other support from Venezuela, for decades a key ally, could make governing more difficult for President Miguel Diaz Canel.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Walmart and Google said Sunday that shoppers will soon be able to use Google's artificial intelligence assistant Gemini to more easily discover and buy products from the retail giant and its warehouse club, Sam's Club. Incoming Walmart CEO John Furner and Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that the companies have teamed up on stage at the National Retail Federation's Big Show, an annual industry conference held at New York City's Javits Center. The CEOs did not say when the new feature will launch or share financial terms. With the Google deal, Walmart is boosting its effort to keep up with customers who are using AI chatbots to save time or look for inspiration. Walmart announced a deal with a rival to Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT, in October to allow shoppers to make purchases with "Instant Checkout," a feature that allows them to buy an item without leaving the AI chatbot. OpenAI recently launched that feature with Walmart and it has Instant Checkout deals with other retailers, including Etsy and several Shopify merchants like Skims, Vuori and Spanx. Walmart also has its own AI chatbot, a yellow smiley-faced assistant on its app called Sparky. "The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail," Furner said in a news release. In his remarks on stage, Furner, who will step into Walmart's top role on Feb. 1, said Walmart is "rewriting the retail playbook" and, with AI, it's "trying to close the gap between I want it and I have it." Pichai said that Google is excited to work with Walmart and described the adoption of AI as a "transformative" moment. For Walmart, the evolution of customers' shopping habits — such as searches that start in an AI chatbot rather than its own app or website — is reshaping the retailer's digital strategy. In a statement, David Guggina, Walmart U.S.'s chief ecommerce officer, said agentic AI "helps us meet customers earlier in their shopping journey and in more places." "Over time, these agents will make it easier for customers to find what they need, want and love," he said. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who is retiring and will be succeeded by Furner, has spoken about the sweeping impact of the technology, saying that "it's very clear that AI is going to change literally every job."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As retailers increasingly turn to artificial intelligence tools to lure shoppers and run key parts of their business, Google wants to make sure it's in the center of the action. The company wants UCP to become an industry standard that retailers use for their AI agents and systems across tasks like discovery, buying and "post-purchase-support." Google says the open-source protocol creates a unified system spanning the shopping experience, from searching to payment, so that retailers don't have to build their own tools and connect the various functions. "It's very important to have a standardized way so we can scale these things and everyone can be prepared for all the various steps to happen," Vidhya Srinivasan, vice president of Google ads and commerce, said in an interview. "Businesses can pick and choose what they want so there's flexibility for them." E-commerce has emerged as one of the major battlegrounds in the booming generative AI market, with Google facing off against OpenAI, Perplexity and Amazon, as they all try and get consumers to use their various apps and services to begin their shopping journey. In September, OpenAI announced Instant Checkout, which allows users to buy some products through ChatGPT, taking a fee from transactions it helps orchestrate. Perplexity in May said it's partnering with PayPal to let users buy products, book travel and secure concert tickets directly in its chat without leaving the platform, and in November said it will roll out a free agentic shopping product for U.S. users ahead of the holiday season. And earlier last year, Amazon launched "Shop Direct," a feature that lets consumers browse items from other brands' sites on Amazon. Some of those items include a button labeled "Buy for Me," an AI agent that can purchase products from other websites on a shopper's behalf. Google said UCP was co-developed with companies including Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair and Target. The protocol will soon power a new checkout feature allowing users to buy direct from Google's AI Mode or Gemini App. They can pay via Google Wallet, but Srinivasan said the company plans to include other payment methods like PayPal in the future. Srinivasan said UCP will be compatible with other existing protocols. As part of Sunday's announcements, Google also introduced a feature called Business Agent, allowing shoppers to chat with brands. Google said it's testing "Direct Offers," which will let retailers promote unique discounts, such as 20% off of a product, if a user of the AI Mode chatbot expresses intent to buy something. "Our role in the ecosystem is that of a matchmaker and one way is with ads," Srinivasan said. "It's a really big focus for us to innovate in the space that adds value to both retailers and buyers."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A million bubbles were swirling inside each glass of Champagne poured on New Year's Eve — which seems about like the number of times artificial intelligence bubbles have been mentioned by tech investors, economists and media pundits in recent months. Bubble fears surrounds stocks within the Magnificent 7 — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — as well as Oracle and Softbank and other tech companies' multi-billion-dollar investments in the unrelenting buildout of humungous data centers to power their AI systems. The bubble speculations rage almost daily as breaking news and earnings reports send Mag 7 stock prices rising and falling, leading analysts to constantly update their buy, sell or hold recommendations. That's essentially the 30,000-foot, macroeconomic view of AI from Wall Street's bulls and bears. For a zoomed-in, micro look at the volatility surrounding AI, there may be no better example of adjacent players in the space than Bloom Energy. A one-time privately funded startup darling from Silicon Valley's initial push into renewable energy which grabbed some marquee customers early on (e.g. Google and Walmart), Bloom was often in the red since its founding in 2001. Following its 2018 IPO at a price of $15 per share, it has been an unremarkable stock, trading near that IPO price as recently as last April. But Bloom has skyrocketed roughly 400% over the past year, ignited by its emergence as a standalone, onsite power supplier for electricity-guzzling AI data centers. Bloom is now among the priciest energy stocks, at 125 times forward earnings. Bloom's performance chart for 2025 resembles one depicting the elevation trajectory from flat, mile-high Denver west to 12,000-foot-high Rocky Mountain National Park. The stock price had come back down to Earth lately — from a 52-week high of $147.86 in November on the strength of strong third-quarter earnings and a major deal with utility giant American Electric Power. But it continues to fluctuate in reaction to good and bad news regarding its AI customers, with the latest boost coming on Thursday. The 1.8 GW facility is expected to include 900 MW of Bloom's fuel cells, representing about $3 billion in revenue for the company in coming years, according to an analysis from Morgan Stanley's David Arcaro. Bloom's profitability remains much more modest than its revenue or stock growth. San Jose-based Bloom has installed its proprietary fuel cells — which primarily run on liquid natural gas, but also biogas and hydrogen, resulting in lower emissions — at more than 1,200 facilities covering a swath of industries, including manufacturing, retail, health care, biotech and telecom, since 2008. In July 2024, CoreWeave, a cloud-computing company that has risen over 90% since its 2025 IPO and is often mentioned among AI stock bubble fears, became Bloom's first AI data center partner, joined since by Oracle, Equinix and AEP. At the dizzying rate that data centers are being built in the U.S., there's no end in sight for electricity needed to power them. "Bloom Energy has 1.5 gigawatts of fuel cells deployed globally," said Aman Joshi, the company's chief commercial officer, with more than 400 megawatts devoted to data centers. "Equinix, our flagship customer, has more than 100 megawatts deployed across 20 sites." Bloom is currently producing 1 GW of fuel cell capacity at its lone manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, Joshi said, and "we've publicly announced we are doing 2 gigawatts [by December 2026]." Through 2028, another 280 or so are expected to come online. The sustainability of Bloom's stock price will rely on continued revenue growth and improved profitability, but at a macro level, access to capital to scale up production of fuel cells, and ability to compete with other power providers — all of which are predicated on the continued surge in data center construction. Bloom is expected to report its fourth quarter and full-year earnings for 2025 on Feb. 26. "The bubble AI companies are facing is going to be who has planned logistically to connect their facility to power infrastructure, and maybe even further downstream to fuel infrastructure for that power," said Zachary Krause, an energy analyst at East Daley Analytics who covers the data center industry. "And that's why I don't think Bloom is on the bubble. In addition to the lucrative deals Bloom signed with hyperscalers last year, in October it entered into a $5-billion strategic partnership with Brookfield Asset Management, the world's largest AI infrastructure investor, to deploy Bloom's fuel cell technology, with Bloom CEO KR Sridhar describing the company as "the preferred onsite provider for Brookfield's trillion-dollar infrastructure portfolio" during its October earnings call. The deal creates multiple benefits for Bloom, according to Oppenheimer analysts, including higher sales. The concentration of Bloom fuel cells will provide service efficiencies, the analysts wrote in a research note, while Brookfield can help provide financing for customers looking to lease fuel cells. "We expect all of these dynamics to support above-consensus sales growth and margin expansion," they said. Evercore analysts said that the joint venture confirms Bloom's ability to be an essential player in the energy buildout to support AI. At that time, Bank of America analyst team, who have held a sell rating on Bloom Energy, said they see risk in a Street that is "assuming 5-yr perfection" and viewing these deals as a near-term earnings catalyst rather than as gradual deployments. "A strategic win, yes — but the market is paying today for a decade of delivery," Bank of America analysts wrote in an October research note. "Investors continue to treat Bloom's major customer announcements as additive backlog rather than potential pipelines. Bank of America did raise its price target from $26 to $39 after the most recent earnings though it still rates the stock at a sell. In late December, Bloom received another capital infusion, securing a $600-million multi-currency credit facility with Wells Fargo. It will permit cash withdrawn from the facility to finance capex, including international projects, such as in South Korea, where Bloom has a distribution agreement in place with SK Ecoplant. With those capital resources, plus around $595 million in cash reserves as of September 30, Joshi foresees no financial constraints in scaling up to 2 GW this year. In fact, Bloom has been able to lower costs by about 10% every year, said UBS analyst Manav Gupta, "and they are very confident they can increase from these levels because, until now, the economies of scale have not kicked in." The Fremont production facility can be expanded up to 5 GW of production capacity, he said, although "KR is the kind of person who will not add capacity until he sees the orders," Gupta said. He anticipates that Oracle and AEP will upsize their fuel cell orders in the next few months, and that Google, Microsoft or Meta will soon sign on as new data center customers. (As Bloom's very first customer, Google only used it to power a portion of its headquarters in Mountain View, California.) "Those are the near-term catalysts that I'm looking for," Gupta said. Analysts in general expect Bloom to report an even stronger fourth quarter, ending 2025 with $1.9 billion in sales and forecasting $2.46 billion this year, but volatility is likely to remain part of the stock story. Indeed, Bloom shares have experienced 76 moves greater than 5% over the last year. Thursday and Friday's upturn exemplified the stock's rollercoaster ride, starkly contrasted against last year's low of $15.15 on April 9. Bloom's shares fell 17.3% in November, even as fundamentals remained strong. Gupta dismissed FuelCell Energy as a rival, saying it "is probably 10 or maybe 15 years behind on technology from where Bloom was 10 years ago." Both of those stocks have seen significant losses in share price over the past year. Another 2025 stock boomer, GE Vernova, has LNG turbines that are utilized as backup power sources at data centers, and an 80 GW backlog of orders, which will take the company into 2029 to fulfill, CEO Scott Strazik recently told investors. In the meantime, however, GE Vernova is developing fuel cell technology, different from Bloom's, that it expects to offer data centers in two to three years. Longer-term, industry watchers expect that nuclear reactors — large, traditional facilities and small modular reactors — as well as wind and solar sources, backed up by more efficient storage batteries, will be viable options for powering data centers. There's even talk of building solar-powered data centers in outer space. Those options are years away from being fully developed, though, making Bloom a right-now power solution for data center operators. "They have a good first-mover advantage in gaining entrenchment, where they're going to see a huge spike in use," Krause said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alarms go off, phones come out, coffee is gulped down, and before either partner is fully awake, they're already headed into separate days. But as a psychologist who studies couples, and as a husband, I've seen that the happiest couples use their mornings productively to make sure they leave the house knowing they're on the same team. Your partner shouldn't be seen as an obstacle you have to get around in the morning. Even on busy days, happy couples make a point to acknowledge one another before shifting into work mode. These moments may seem mundane, but research shows relationships thrive on small "bids" for attention that signal recognition and care. Skipping them entirely can leave partners feeling emotionally invisible before the day has even begun. Cortisol levels are naturally elevated upon waking, meaning your body is already primed for stress. Trying to tackle nuance or conflict too early can activate that response even more. Before diving into logistics or complaints, they take a moment to sync: sitting quietly together, sharing coffee on the couch, or simply standing side by side while doing their morning routines. Rather than full emotional check-ins, happy couples keep morning communication light, but still honest. Each partner shares one sentiment regarding their current feelings: It's much easier to understand your partner's short temper when you remember that they had a stressful meeting that day. This could be five minutes of cuddles before getting up, walking the dogs together or cooking breakfast while listening to their song. Having habits like these — routines or rituals that you can call "our thing" — can serve as surprisingly strong reaffirmations of your identity as a couple. In many relationships, physical affection in the morning gets reduced to a rushed goodbye kiss on the cheek, if that. But happier couples don't budge on this. Spooning, long hugs, proper kisses or simply just leaning into each other for a moment before leaving — regardless of what suits you, any kind of physical contact like this can activate oxytocin and calm the nervous system, which helps both partners feel steadier as they separate. Mornings can get messy if one partner is expected to bear the brunt of the household's mental or physical load. Happy couples reduce this by treating mornings as a shared operation. If there are tasks that have to get done before work, like prepping lunch, feeding pets, or getting the kids ready, they divide them up mindfully and adjust when one partner is struggling. It doesn't have to look like perfect fairness every day. Just ensuring that no one's plate is too full goes a long way in protecting goodwill. Before parting ways, the happiest couples will always offer at least one small yet specific gesture of support: More importantly, they show your partner that you're emotionally attuned to the things that matter to them, even if you're physically present.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tehran threatened on Sunday to retaliate against Israel and U.S. military bases in the event of U.S. strikes on Iran, issuing the warning as Israeli sources said Israel was on high alert for the possibility of any U.S. intervention. With Iran's clerical establishment facing the biggest anti-government protests since 2022, U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in recent days, warning Iranian leaders against using force against demonstrators. On Saturday, Trump said the U.S. stands "ready to help." "Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all U.S. bases and ships will be our legitimate target," said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards. Authorities have stepped up efforts to quell the unrest that has spread across Iran since December 28. A U.S.-based rights group, HRANA, reported the death toll stood at 116, mostly protesters but including 37 members of the security forces. Three Israeli sources, who were present for Israeli security consultations over the weekend, said Israel was on a high-alert footing, but did not elaborate on what that meant. An Israeli government spokesperson declined to comment. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Iran retaliated for those U.S. strikes by firing missiles at an American air base in Qatar. The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout imposed by the authorities since Thursday. Internet monitoring watchdog Netblocks reported national connectivity levels remained about 1% of the norm. A social media video posted on Saturday showed large crowds gathered in Tehran's Punak neighbourhood at night, drumming rhythmically on the railings of a bridge or other metal objects in an apparent sign of protest. Iranian state TV broadcast funeral processions in western Iranian cities such as Gachsaran and Yasuj for members of the security forces killed in the protests. State TV reported that 30 members of the security forces would be buried in the central city of Isfahan, and that six security force members were killed by "rioters" in Kermanshah in the west. State TV also reported a mosque was torched by "rioters" in Mashhad, in the northeast, on Saturday night. The Revolutionary Guards on Saturday accused "terrorists" of attacking security facilities. Ahmad-Reza Radan, Iran's police chief, said security forces had stepped up efforts to confront "rioters." Trump, posting on social media on Saturday, said: "Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. In a phone call on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibility of U.S. intervention in Iran, according to an Israeli source who was present for the conversation. A U.S. official confirmed the two men spoke but did not say what topics they discussed. A senior U.S. intelligence official on Saturday described the situation in Iran as an "endurance game". Israel has not signalled a desire to intervene, with tensions between the two arch-foes high over Israeli concerns about Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. In an interview with the Economist published on Friday, Netanyahu said there would be horrible consequences for Iran if it were to attack Israel. Alluding to the protests, he said: "Everything else, I think we should see what is happening inside Iran." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

"I think it's great to scan through all the prediction markets out there, certainly economics and business-related, because it actually will get you thinking about things you might have been missing," he told Business Insider in an interview before the new year. Moses isn't too focused on short opportunities these days, despite being famous for his role in Michael Lewis's now-iconic saga of the housing crash.

"If you're short SoFi and you weren't thinking about the possibility of it being added to the S&P 500, like we just saw happen to Carvana recently, that's something you need to be aware of," Moses said. That's not the only way prediction markets could help investors make smarter decisions. Moses said he thinks there may be circumstances where they can offer a more appealing risk-reward than investors might get from traditional derivatives. "Well, if I own bitcoin, and it's a much cheaper way to bet, if it's an eight cent possibility, so call it twelve to one, I might be getting a better market, or I might want to buy that rather than buying a put option on crypto." And as they grow, expect more prominent players to participate, he said. "I think institutions are going to start using prediction markets more, and as institutions use it, you're going to see a lot more activity," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DETROIT – Outside General Motors' new world headquarters, between the 12-story building and the city's first new skyscraper in more than 30 years, sit two red Chevrolet pickup trucks. The other is a new Silverado EV. The trucks, while part of a temporary holiday display, are symbolic of what's inside the new global offices for the Detroit automaker: its past and present, woven together. GM is occupying four of six office floors of the building and has filled them with artifacts, design nods and "Easter eggs" tied to the Detroit automaker's history. They range from a blueprint of GM's iconic design dome and an early map of its nearby proving grounds to an interior wallpaper of 300 patented technologies and a decorative wall of cassette tapes with songs featuring the automaker's brands as well playful references to executive stalwarts such as CEO Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss. "Leadership asked when we were helping design the space to bring in some Easter eggs and details to represent who we are at GM, you know, honoring our culture and our history and our innovation," Rebecca Waldmeir, GM industrial design architecture and experience manager, told CNBC during a tour of the new headquarters. Other surprises include references to relevant Detroit streets, design influences from GM's famed design campus in suburban Detroit and artwork and sculptures of its products. Aside from the aesthetics, GM officials say the new offices will assist with collaboration and are more relevant to how the company expects its employees to work in a post-pandemic world. "A headquarters really should be, at some level, a beacon for the culture of the company," said David Massaron, GM vice president of infrastructure and corporate citizenship. "When you come in here, it should help people understand who we want to be." GM's new HQ is less than a mile from the RenCen, as it's commonly called, which has been a symbol for the city since, ironically, Ford Motor built the complex but decided not to make it its headquarters in the 1970s. GM purchased the building in 1996 as its third headquarters, all of which have been in the Motor City. The RenCen is Detroit's fortress, a 5.6-million-square-foot complex complete with a more-than-700-foot center tower surrounded by four 500-foot towers and two smaller adjacent ones. For much of its existence, it was surrounded by concrete barriers before a redesign around the turn of the millennium. It has long been something of a physical permutation of GM's historically siloed culture, which Barra has made a priority to change during her roughly 11-year tenure as CEO. "The RenCen was designed in a different era, in a pre-Covid era where everybody went to work five days a week, everybody went to their desk," Massaron said. "Particularly, in a post-pandemic world, you need office space that people want to come to, because we have options." GM's roughly 50,000 U.S. salaried employees are currently required to work in-office Tuesday through Thursday, but the rules are more flexible than before regarding location and remote working. Only four of the offices will be permanently assigned to top GM executives, such as Barra and Reuss, he said. GM declined to disclose how many employees are expected to regularly work at the new headquarters, saying foot traffic will fluctuate based on priorities and workflows. The building complex, known as Hudson's Detroit, is owned by a real estate company of Rocket Companies chairman and billionaire Dan Gilbert, who has been purchasing and renovating properties in Detroit for more than a decade. GM's new headquarters, which remains under construction, comes months after Ford christened a new 2.1-million-square-foot global HQ and product design and development center in nearby Dearborn, Michigan. Ford's new facility includes offices, design and industrial operations and a host of amenities such as a 160,000-square-foot dining area with eight "kitchen concepts," multiple courtyards and other upgrades. GM, for example, has a vast technology and design center that occupies 710 acres in nearby Warren, Michigan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial intelligence could be something of a game changer for recruiters as firms continue to be inundated with job applications, according to one LinkedIn executive. Janine Chamberlin, LinkedIn's U.K. country manager, told CNBC Make It in an interview that AI will be a "critical part of how hiring is done in 2026," as it speeds up processes. AI can help recruiters speed up manual tasks such as going through very high volumes of applications and sifting through resumes and cover letters to find the right skills for a job. "We've heard from 60% of recruiters that AI is helping them to find what they would call a 'hidden gem' talent — so people that they would have, in their manual search, overlooked, but actually AI is surfacing that as a candidate that is a good match for a specific job, because it can look very specifically at those skills so critically important to do it well," Chamberlin said. The job market has been rough for both employers and professionals as widespread layoffs dominate headlines and professionals face intense competition for jobs. In fact, new Linkedin research finds that U.S. applicants per open role have doubled since the spring of 2022. Chamberlin said this is creating an overwhelming cycle in the job market that is difficult for both job seekers and recruiters to handle. On the flip side, there's companies recruiters who are receiving lots of applications. "Companies are finding it hard to filter through these applications quickly enough to find people with the right skill set for the jobs that they're hiring for. And the job seeker on the other side of that is waiting to hear back from companies whilst getting increasingly anxious because they might not be hearing back," Chamberlin said. The anxious job seeker then goes and applies to more roles to increase their chances of getting a job, continuing the cycle. LinkedIn's global research, which surveyed 19,000 respondents globally, including from the U.K, U.S., France, Germany and Australia, found that 80% of workers feel unprepared for the job hunt in 2026 and nearly two-thirds feel that the job search has become more challenging. Chamberlin advised tailoring applications and to avoid mass-applying with generic cover letters, as AI is now often the first to review a job application. It's important to "be targeted" when crafting your resume and cover letter. Chamberlin said that using AI can help make your application more succinct as it can identify where you're not highlighting the skills you need for a particular job. "In an AI-driven job market, clarity is key," she said. "If you can make sure that your skills are highlighted very clearly on your resume, on the cover letter, on your LinkedIn profile, naturally, I think that's what's really going to help you stand out." Finally, Chamberlin suggested prioritizing simple formats and to avoid overly stylistic templates as it can be confusing to read for AI. Learn more about the world of CNBC Make It</p>
