                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was a second half that saw the Eagles pass for -2 yards and Jalen Hurts go 0-7. The Birds won both of those games as winning despite themselves has come to be their identity. I also found it curious that in the first half of that Buffalo game Hurts went 13-20 for 110 yards, 1 TD and no interceptions with a QB rating of 95.8. What's at stake:  Eagles win:  They will play the Bears in Chicago next weekend 49ers win:  They will play the Rams in L.A. next weekend In the 24-0 win over Las Vegas Birds offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo called five designed quarterback runs for Hurts, totaling 39 yards and he called four designed runs the following week in a 29-18 win in Washington totaling 40 yards. Against the Bills there were no called designed runs for QB1 which gave me a little pause. While I'm not a big proponent of conspiracy theories and don't believe head coach Nick Sirianni is waiting to unveil his super-secret offense today at 4:30, others disagree with me. Long time Eagle fan Josh Kotzen told me this the other day: Another life-long Birds fan who allowed me to quote him anonymously, who I ran into at my gym believes the Birds played 16 games this year with this philosophy: But those beliefs have been quickly dismissed by some NFL execs and dignitaries: “No, they aren't holding anything back,” a veteran front office personnel executive to Senior NFL writer Matt Lombardo of Between The Hashmarks. “You have to remember that Saquon helps Jalen Hurts tremendously. He did last year, but wasn't able to this season.” Well, I'm not sure what statistics that excecutive is looking at but Hurts has a career completion percentage of 64.4% and of course that number jumps to 66.8% in the playoffs. Barkley, last year's rushing king surpassed 100 rushing yards only twice this season, after smashing the century mark 14 times, including three times in last year's playoff run to the Super Bowl. And what would be a possible reason or theory for that? “I've heard concerns about Hurts,” a longtime NFL scout told Between The Hashmarks. “Especially in the intermediate passing game and him being scared to make risky throws.” I prefer to deal in facts and the fact is that Hurts' ability to rise to the occasion in clutch moments is well documented – 10 fourth-quarter comebacks, 13 game-winning drives, a Super Bowl ring, and two Super Bowl appearances, and the only play to pass for 10 post-season touchdowns and rush for 10 post-season touchdowns. It's undeniably an unquantifiable advantage that roughly 13 other playoff teams would love to have leading them in their postseason journey. Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio and the Eagles' defense should be stingy enough to hold serve against San Francisco, but that might be Philadelphia's crutch in these playoffs until they face more complete teams in the weeks ahead should they get past the 49ers But if that's not the case then the Eagles will be operating within the same narrow margins they've played with all year and it's those those narrow margins that may decide how far this run goes. He's a long-time presence on both TV and sports radio in the Philadelphia market.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this EXCLUSIVE in-studio deep dive, Ty Roberts on Total Disclosure Podcast sits down with Samuel Chong, the man responsible for translating The Thiaoouba Prophecy—a controversial and provocative book that emerged from Australia in the late 1980s, during the same era Bob Lazar first went public with claims of non-human intelligence, advanced craft, and human interaction with extraterrestrial technology. Originally written by Michel Desmarquet, a landscaper with no formal academic or scientific background, The Thiaoouba Prophecy presents an extraordinary narrative: direct contact with an advanced extraterrestrial civilization and revelations that challenge religion, history, science, and humanity's understanding of its own origins. When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever reported, Redditors have shared a variety of cases that stand out for their credibility, documentation, and the sheer number of witnesses involved. Here are some of the most frequently mentioned and highly regarded sightings: Details: Over 60 schoolchildren witnessed a craft landing in their schoolyard and several beings emerging from it. "The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. Details: A JAL cargo flight crew, including the pilot and co-pilot, observed a massive UFO for over 30 minutes. The object was also tracked by ground radar. "JAL Flight 1628... What the pilot and co-pilot saw that day was also being tracked by ground radar as well." Details: US Air Force personnel stationed at RAF Woodbridge and RAF Bentwaters reported multiple nights of strange lights and a craft landing in Rendlesham Forest. Location: Off the coast of California, USA Details: US Navy pilots, including Commander David Fravor, encountered a Tic Tac-shaped object that displayed incredible speed and maneuverability. Details: Iranian Air Force pilots were scrambled to intercept a UFO that was also tracked by radar. "1976 Tehran UFO incident: Nothing beats this one. Military personals, radars and civilian plane encountered the UFO." Details: During World War II, the military fired anti-aircraft artillery at a large object in the sky, which was illuminated by searchlights. "The Battle of Los Angeles where the military had to resort to using AA weapons against a 'weather balloon'." Details: Airline employees and witnesses reported a disc-shaped object hovering over Gate C17 at O'Hare International Airport. "Finally in the 90's what appeared to be a malfunctioning ship was sighted near Varginha, MG." Details: A local farmer and his wife took two photographs of a metallic, disc-shaped object in the sky. The photos have been extensively analyzed and remain a subject of debate. These sightings represent some of the most compelling and well-documented cases in UFO history, supported by multiple witnesses, radar data, and official investigations. While skepticism is healthy, these incidents have left many convinced that there is something truly inexplicable happening in our skies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For 15 seasons, "Supernatural" stayed true to its initial premise: two demon-hunting brothers, Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles), who road trip across America to uncover hidden ghosts, ghouls, and monsters lurking in the shadows. However, there was one storyline that could have wrecked the entire series; one we're thankful that the show passed on. This is where Andrew Dabb — who was named co-showrunner after Jeremy Carver left, alongside Robert Singer — and the writers' room had the idea to radically change everything. "One story line we always talked about, which we never did was basically Sam and Dean go public," Dabb explained to TV Insider several years after the series finale. We're just going to get the word out there.'" While this idea of having Sam and Dean put out a "Ghostbusters"-style infomercial to warn humanity that demons are real and can hurt you makes sense on paper, Dabb admits that changing the show in this way would be impossible to reverse. "It would've kind of blown up the show in a very odd way," he explained, adding that the Winchesters probably ought to send out a PSA for the sake of those they fight to save. Read more: TV's 30 Best Series Finales Of All Time "The nice thing about running for 15 years is something that gets scrapped in Season 4 looks great in Season 11," Dabb noted. This makes sense when you consider the era in which a storyline like this would have been explored. This revelation would have occurred in a finale at some point in one of the final few seasons, with the following episodes allowing Sam and Dean to serve as a kind of mentor figure to a new generation of demon hunters. Despite the creative potential, Dabb admits it would have been "a little logistically difficult" to go down that path. "Which, again, I think sounds interesting in theory, but I actually think would've destroyed the show," Dabb elaborated. "It would not have been any good, which is one of the reasons we didn't do it." Throughout the entire series, they constantly bite off more than they can chew, facing the most evil beings in existence. Making them in-world celebrities (more so than they already were at times) and putting them in international crosshairs would have only taken them out of the shadows where they already thrive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For a time, it had a November 7, 2025, release date, but was inevitably removed from Marvel Studios' schedule altogether and taken back to the drawing board for the umpteenth time. Previously, Bassam Tariq and Yann Demange were attached as directors to the movie. Stacy Osei-Kuffour, Beau DeMayo, Michael Starrbury, Nic Pizzolatto, Michael Green, and Eric Pearson have also worked on different versions of the script. Ali and Mia Goth remain attached to star in Blade, with the former actually making his official MCU debut with a voice cameo in Eternals' post-credits scene. Now, The Cosmic Circus' Alex Perez has shared some of what he's heard about Marvel Studios' original plans for Blade. Perez has also shared an update on She-Hulk's status for Avengers: Doomsday. Apparently, as of now, "She-Hulk is not in Avengers: Doomsday." However, Perez does point out that she could "appear in Secret Wars or appear in Doomsday once the reshoots are underway, which are expected to add some characters unable to appear in principal photography." Unless a recast happens, that no longer seems likely, despite She-Hulk appearing in leaked concept art from the next Avengers movies. This wouldn't be the first time Marvel Studios has replaced a Hulk, though, as Mark Ruffalo took over from Ed Norton in 2012.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Von Däniken rose to prominence in 1968 with the publication of his first book “Chariots of the Gods,” in which he claimed that the Mayans and ancient Egyptians were visited by alien astronauts and instructed in advanced technology that allowed them to build giant pyramids. The book fueled a growing interest in unexplained phenomena at a time when thanks to conventional science man was about to take its first steps on the Moon. “Chariots of the Gods” was followed by more than two dozen similar books, spawning a literary niche in which fact and fantasy were mixed together against all historical and scientific evidence. Public broadcaster SRF reported that altogether almost 70 million copies of his books were sold in more than 30 languages, making him one of the most widely read Swiss authors. While von Däniken managed to shrug off his many critics, the former hotel waiter had a troubled relationship with money throughout his life and frequently came close to financial ruin. After leaving school in 1954, von Däniken worked as a waiter and barkeeper for several years, during which he was repeatedly accused of fraud and served a couple of short stints in prison. Its publication and rapid commercial success were quickly followed by accusations of tax dodging and financial impropriety, for which he again spent time behind bars. By the time he left prison, “Chariots of the Gods” was earning von Däniken a fortune and a second book “Gods from Outer Space” was ready for publication, allowing him to commit himself to his paranormal passion and travel the world in search of new mysteries to uncover. Throughout the 1970s von Däniken undertook countless field trips to Egypt, India, and above all Latin America, whose ancient cultures held a particular fascination for the amateur archaeologist. No amount of criticism dissuaded him and his fans from believing that Earth has been visited repeatedly by beings from Outer Space, and will be again in the future. Even when confronted with fabricated evidence in a British television documentary — supposedly ancient pots were shown to be almost new — von Däniken insisted that, minor discrepancies aside, his theories were essentially sound. In 1985 von Däniken wrote “Neue Erinnerungen an die Zukunft” — “New Memories of the Future” — ostensibly to address his many critics: “I have admitted (my mistakes), but not one of the foundations of my theories has yet been brought down.” Although his popularity was waning in the English-speaking world by the 1980s, von Däniken's books and films influenced a wave of semi-serious archaeological documentaries and numerous popular television shows, including “The X-Files,” which featured two FBI agents tasked with solving paranormal mysteries. His last major venture, a theme park based on his books, failed after just a few years due to lack of interest. Erich von Däniken is survived by his wife of 65 years, Elisabeth Skaja, Cornelia and two grandchildren. This material may not be published, broadcast, written or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oliver Lewin, 41, was jailed six years for plotting to bomb phone, TV and radio masts across Britain(Image: PA) A terror fanatic who vowed to topple the Government has lodged a bid to overturn his conviction, claiming he was the victim of "police entrapment". Oliver Lewin, 41, was jailed six years for plotting to bomb phone, TV and radio masts across Britain. He also believed that Boris Johnson's then Tory Government was planning genocide using Covid jabs. Now Parole Board documents reveal Lewin has lodged an appeal with the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Mr Lewin believes that he was subject to entrapment by the police." Police released images of Lewin carrying out reconnaissance work as he plotted to bring down Boris Johnson's Government(Image: West Midlands Police) Lewin thought "white people across Europe were being systematically killed by the vaccine" and concluded this "triggered the emergence of a Chinese communist system in Britain". Lewin had spread conspiracy theories online and expressed hostility towards Jewish people during the Covid-19 pandemic. A judge said Lewin - who compiled a list of essentials he needed for the attacks - had taken "at least some preparatory steps"(Image: West Midlands Police) Lewin, from Coalville, Leics, had told contacts online: "My idea is to disable vital communications and transport infrastructure to a point that has an impact on the country." Police arrested Lewin on August 25, 2021, after determining his real-world plans were accelerating. And he told undercover officers "chop here, job done", and had started writing a manual for potential supporters, completing four of the intended 17 chapters. When police searched his home following his arrest, officers recovered military-style equipment including a lock knife, camping equipment, camouflage clothing and two air a rifles fitted with telescopic sights. An air rifle was recovered from Covid conspiracy theorist Lewin after he was arrested during a police operation(Image: West Midlands Police) The parole decision noted that risk is greatest when Lewin is online and alone, and that his offending had been "internet-based" when he went looking for conspiracy theories. If he had been released, the risk management plan would have included restrictions on internet access, mobile phone use and GPS tagging for 12 months at Probation Approved Premises.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The statue once marked a grave and was created around 100 BC. Many inventions beyond their time are associated with the ancient Greek civilization, but the laptop was certainly not one of them…until now. Of course, historians have dismissed the theory as nonsense and provided more grounded explanations, suggesting that the object in the statue may be a box or wax tablet. In one viral YouTube video, an uploader claims that the ancient Greek statue “depicts an astonishing object that bears a striking resemblance to a modern laptop or some handheld device”. They dismissed more feasible explanations, arguing that the container's base is too shallow to be a jewellry box. In 2016, the Daily Mail published an article questioning whether the funerary statue was indeed proof that a time traveler had brought back a laptop to ancient Greece. Back in 2016, archaeologist Kristina Killgrove wrote in Forbes debunking the theory that the ancient Greeks had somehow come across advanced computer technology. “These stelai were carved in relief, and were almost always painted, although the painting doesn't survive in most cases.” This is a rather typical trope in funeral stelai, the image of a wealthy adult woman reaching to a servant, and may have reflected her family's desire for her to retain her status into the afterlife,” continued Killgrove. Killgrove suggested a variety of more tangible explanations for what the object held by the woman in the statue may have been, including a wax tablet or some kind of jewellery box or other container. Rather than being USB ports, the holes on the side of the container may have originally been used to hold wooden items that have long since rotted away. It is also possible that the holes were made during efforts to rework or copy the sculpture. Other parts of the stele are missing, so this is certainly a plausible explanation.
