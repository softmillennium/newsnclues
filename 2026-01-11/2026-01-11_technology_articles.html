                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the last several weeks of 2025 alone, nuclear startups raised $1.1 billion, largely on investor optimism that smaller nuclear reactors will succeed where the broader industry has recently stumbled. But they were also eight years late and more than $20 billion over budget. Smaller reactors, they argue, can be built using mass production techniques, and as companies produce more parts, they should get better at making them, which should drive down costs. The magnitude of that benefit is something experts are still researching, but today's nuclear startups are depending on it being greater than zero. “I have a number of friends who work in supply chain for nuclear, and they can rattle off like five to ten materials that we just don't make in the United States,” Milo Werner, general partner at DCVC, told TechCrunch. Before becoming an investor, she worked at Tesla leading new product introduction, and before that, she did the same at FitBit, launching four factories in China for the wearables company. When companies of any size want to manufacture something, they face two main challenges, Werner said. Fortunately for the nuclear industry, that shouldn't pose much of a problem. But the nuclear industry isn't immune from the other challenge all manufacturers face, which is a lack of human capital. “It's like we've been sitting on the couch watching TV for 10 years and then getting up and trying to run a marathon the next day. After decades of offshoring, the U.S. lacks people experienced with both factory construction and operations. “There are for sure some people in the United States who have been doing this, but we don't have the quantum of people that we need for everybody to have a full staff of seasoned manufacturing people.” She not just talking about machine operators, but everyone from factory floor supervisors all the way up to CFOs and board members. The good news is that Werner sees a lot of startups, nuclear and otherwise, building early versions of their products in close proximity to their technical team. “Really leaning into modularity is very important for investors,” she said. The modular approach helps companies start producing small volumes early on so they can collect data on the manufacturing process. Ideally, that data will show improvement over time, which can put investors at ease. The benefits of mass manufacturing don't happen overnight. Companies will often forecast cost reductions that can result from learning through manufacturing, but it might take longer than they expect. “Often it takes years, like a decade, to get there,” Werner said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I just checked, and Instagram's password reset flow allows requesting a reset using an email address, a phone number, or even the username [1]. At scale you would need IP rotation and some basic automation, but it is not particularly hard to generate a large volume of reset emails and create confusion.From an attacker's perspective, this does not grant access to accounts or sensitive data. It mainly causes users to receive unexpected reset emails and possibly panic or change their passwords. That aligns more with nuisance or malice than with a meaningful breach.I do not have definitive proof, but based on this behavior it seems plausible that the reported wave of reset emails could be explained without any large scale data leak.

Instagram response posted on 11-jan: "We fixed an issue that let an external party request password reset emails for some people. There was no breach of our systems and your Instagram accounts are secure. You can ignore those emails — sorry for any confusion" https://xcancel.com/instagram/status/2010202301886238822?s=2... Got one a day or two ago again actually. "someone on breachforums claims to have it for sale" or "some whistleblower at instagram reported". they got it via phishing or credential stuffing. If my info got out, it likely came from Instagram's side, not mine.What's interesting is the timing pattern. It feels like the creds were getting resold and different people were taking turns running the same list. The emails were in different languages too, which tracks with whoever was firing off the requests.Got another reset attempt a couple days ago. Congrats to the latest buyer: you bought pure schwag. Whatever value was in that list got milked long before it ended up public. It feels like the creds were getting resold and different people were taking turns running the same list.

Initially it was LastPass but 1Password is just more slick.The annoyance is all the arbitrary rules sites create about you have to use special characters or you can't or they have different, non-overlapping requirements on password length or the absolute worst is forced password rotation.I don't generally try and get non-tech friends and family use password managers however because it's still kinda clunky to use and generate. But they're far from universal and I don't expect them ever to be.Anyway, this kind of leak from Meta kinda surprises me. That's a massive breach and not normally one you expect form a company employing thousands of engineers.I will say this: IG operates as its own domain within Meta and AFAIK they still use a completely separate code base in Python/Django.

It's defensible to say it's not worth rewriting but IG are constantly playing catch up with what the rest of the company gets for "free". How many billion+ dollar settlements does it take before this equation changes?And yes I believe that leaking physical addresses is going to cost th ecompany more than a billion dollars.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Officials from Indonesia and Malaysia have said they are temporarily blocking access to xAI's chatbot Grok. These are the most aggressive moves so far from government officials responding to a flood of sexualized, AI-generated imagery — often depicting real women and minors, and sometimes depicting violence — posted by Grok in response to requests from users on the social network X. Varied governmental responses over the past week include an order from India's IT ministry for xAI to take action to prevent Grok from generating obscene content, as well as an order from the European Commission for the company to retain all documents related to Grok, potentially setting the stage for an investigation. In the United Kingdom, the communications regulator Ofcom has said that it will “undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.” Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in an interview Ofcom has his “full support to take action.” xAI initially responded by posting a seemingly first-person apology to the Grok account, acknowledging that a post “violated ethical standards and potentially US laws” around child sexual abuse material. In response to a post wondering why the U.K. government wasn't taking action against other AI image generation tools, Musk wrote, “They want any excuse for censorship.” This post has been updated to reflect Malaysia's ban on Grok.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google today announced a new open standard, called the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) for AI agent-based shopping, at the National Retail Federation (NRF) conference. The standard, developed with companies like Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target, and Walmart, lets agents work across different parts of customer buying processes, including discovery and post-purchase support. Google said that it also works with other agentic protocols, such as Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) — which Google announced last year — Agent2Agent (A2A), and Model Context Protocol (MCP). The company said that it will soon use UCP for eligible Google product listings in AI mode in search and the Gemini apps to let shoppers check out directly from U.S.-based retailers while researching a product. Google said that it will soon support PayPal as a payment option. “This is one of the really exciting parts about agentic,” said Shopify CEO and founder Tobi Lutke. Like, I would have never searched for this product, but somehow it found me right on the other side. Notably, Shopify also unveiled a similar integration with Microsoft Copilot for shopping today to let customers check out easily within the conversational flow. In another consumer-facing change, Google said it will now allow brands to offer a special discount to users while they are looking for a product recommendation when using the AI mode. The company is also giving users new data attributes within the Merchant Center to have sellers feature their items better within AI search surfaces. Companies like PayPal and OpenAI are also working on having sellers be more discoverable in AI chatbot results. Startups like the prompting company are also working with merchants to have their products surface within AI answers. The company noted that merchants like Lowe's, Michael's, Poshmark, and Reebok are already using this product. The search giant also announced Gemini Enterprise for Customer Experience (CX), a suite to handle shopping and customer service for retailers and restaurants.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>$218 cost of parts is about $130 cheaper than buying a similar desktop DIMM retail kit in the US. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A few weeks ago, we covered Russian enthusiasts' proposition of assembling their own DDR5 RAM using procured modules and PCBs to cut costs. At the time, it was just an idea put forth by a local modder, but now he's back with a finished build that successfully runs at 6400 MT/s. A single 32GB stick of desktop DDR5 memory with proper XMP support — one that doesn't even look homemade. Modder VIK-on acquired the actual RAM chips from a couple of SK Hynix-branded 16GB laptop SO-DIMM sticks, priced at 8,000 Rubles (~$100) each, a bit cheaper than their desktop counterparts at the moment. You need proper BGA reworking stations and a lot of skill to not mess this up. After the new stick was ready, it was flashed with custom firmware from an Adata retail kit, allowing the memory to gain 6400 MT/s XMP support that any motherboard will be able to detect in BIOS. For instance, instead of targeting 16GB laptop memory, 8GB sticks should be even cheaper. At that point, one might even consider just using the SO-DIMM sticks as is with a desktop adapter that would add noticeable latency, but offer more convenience. This mod maintains signal integrity and also represents resilience. It's all about ingenuity in these trying times, and hacks like these will only increase in frequency (no pun intended) till markets normalize.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why is this a criteria?The following piece of metrical poetry from the Rig Veda, is of high importance to me, a bunch of vedic revivalists and connoisseurs scattered across the descendant cultures, perhaps to Indo-europeanists and comparative mythologists who study this in academic manner, even when translated into English. Now, verily, will I declare the exploits mighty and true, of him the True and Mighty. Now perhaps the LLMs can produce something which sounds lot like this, probably even in old Indic if they're trained enough on it.But it will never have the allure of the old indic hymns, because there's no riddle to solve, no real riddle that the machine has hidden in the words. When reading the above hymn, whether in sanskrit or English, whether it's me or an indologist like Jamison or Watkins (who wrote "How to Kill a Dragon" on Indo-European poetics), we are trying to imagine the same thing the original writer had imagined.In case of LLM, it's just a sequence of words that sounds cool.

Because defining "good" as "made by a human from the human society" is the easiest way to be able to go on and "prove" that "LLM poetry is not good" (these are scare quotes). She says she used this definition in "over thirty years of reading, teaching, and writing poetry" (this is an actual quote) but I highly doubt she would've found it necessary 30 years ago to define "good" as "made by a human" with this level of explicitness.Edit: having read the whole FA, the closing sentence makes much more sense (and is also completely at odds with the definition of greatness given earlier):"Operationally, greatness is measured when tastemakers put them in anthologies so that generations of readers can read them, tear out the ones that resonate, and tape them to their refrigerators."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Geopolitics are being reduced to videos lasting just a few minutes. Social media has surpassed traditional media, not only in the speed with which it is created and shared, but also in its ability to frame our reality. People have the illusion of knowing what is happening and why within just a few hours—or less—of major world events. The attack included the capture of president Nicolás Maduro, who was transferred to New York to be tried for narcoterrorism conspiracy and other charges. Hours later, US president Donald Trump said he would run the South American country until there was a transition he considered satisfactory. Later, from Caracas, Venezuela's vice president Delcy Rodríguez called for Maduro's release, saying that the country “will never again be a slave or colony of any empire.” Maduro, meanwhile, slept in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he had been transferred after his capture. And it's playing out very differently from what you might have seen on TikTok. WIRED asked Julio Juárez, a psychological researcher at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) and academic secretary of the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Sciences and Humanities (CEIICH), to analyze how the practice of verifying claims with sources has collapsed in the current digital world. From the first reports of the attack on Venezuela, social media operated as a massive amplifier that not only transmitted different perspectives but also constructed reality," says Juárez. Today, citizens face the challenge of exercising critical judgment in an environment that's designed to provoke immediate reactions, not nuanced reflection.” Historia Para Tontos (History for Dummies), a Spanish-language Instagram account that has disseminated its takes on history through the use of maps and satire, summarized the geopolitical tension of early 2026 in a viral video. “Where was the concern for international law when Maduro violated our human and civil rights year after year for more than a decade? Where were those laws when they starved us, killed our students for protesting peacefully, and let political prisoners die? Did you raise your voice to defend our sovereignty when Maduro stole the elections last year? Stupid international laws have watched us bleed to death for almost three decades. Thank you.🥰 Sincerely, Venezuela,” wrote Dayani López in one reply. In an interview with WIRED, sociologist Rafael Uzcategui, codirector of the Laboratorio de Paz in Caracas, says: “I'm bothered by the misunderstanding and biased narratives that people, for ideological reasons, continue to impose from outside, when it is now very easy to obtain accurate information about the situation in Venezuela. We've made a great effort to work with international human rights institutions, whose reports have provided an important diagnosis, which is public and easily accessible, of the deterioration of the situation. We believed that the evidence would be sufficient to raise awareness among the international community, especially those who claim to be humanitarians and protectors of human rights. Given this double standard, I would prefer them to be more sincere and say, ‘human rights violations only occur when it's our opponents who commit them. Tecayahuatzin Mancilla, the voice behind Historia Para Tontos and a graduate with a degree in international relations from the Aragón Faculty of Higher Studies at UNAM, spoke to WIRED about the video he posted. “It focuses more on issues of international law and the historical reality of Latin America through US interventions, especially in the 20th century,” he explained. What I wanted to expose is precisely how the United States violates international law whenever it's in their interest to do so; we've seen it in the Middle East and we are seeing it again in Latin America after a hiatus of some 32 years.” “Digital blackouts within Venezuela reveal a very specific oppressive agenda, which follows a pattern of persecution and human rights violations,” explains one Venezuelan citizen who preferred to remain anonymous. “Social media content—even seemingly harmless content, such as comedic sketches or cartoons—manages to convey what is happening in Venezuela from an alternative perspective. This narrative makes its way through an algorithm that attempts to depoliticize content,” she says. “On the other hand, historical memory is constructed by the media outlets that survive in Venezuela and that manage to continue to report on the situation, putting themselves at risk with virtually no resources. In the case of the Alianza Rebelde—a collective of media organizations focused on investigative reporting and which includes El Pitazo, Runrunes, and TalCual—they are making a truly important effort to disseminate information.” That is why we must be increasingly aware of the narrative we want to construct for the future, and think about how to ensure that this narrative is not limited to ephemeral social media, but that it instead endures. “I've spoken with many Venezuelan friends, and something they all told me was: ‘We don't agree with bombing our country, but some of us see it as the only way to remove a dictator from power,'” says Mancilla. “Many say that legal, political, and electoral avenues had been tried without success; only direct intervention managed to overthrow him. Obviously, as a Mexican viewing this all from the outside, I don't share that pain because I didn't experience it … But there are also Venezuelans who support the regime and denounce this intervention as a violation of their sovereignty. “The big challenge is the quality of content, as there is a lot of noise, misinformation, and banal commentary. However, we trust that users have the ability to consume and share content from reliable sources,” says Uzcátegui, codirector of Laboratorio de Paz. Even private spaces for political conversation have almost completely disappeared due to fear. We know that people continue to consume content, but they are careful not to leave a digital trail—no retweets or likes, for example. “The number of trustworthy spaces has been drastically reduced,” he says. Not only distinguishing accurate from false information, but dealing with information bubbles, memes of Maduro as a DJ, and everything from humorous comments to hardline political propaganda. “I think traditional media still has a fundamental role to play. Someone has to take charge of organizing the conversation because if you go to one's timeline on TikTok, X, or Instagram, you'll find chaos. We've gone from hard news to unfiltered hate speech,” he says. For Mancilla, there is a lot of misinformation echoing around social media. There is no longer anywhere that you can say, ‘I understand your point, listen to mine. That has been lost on social media; everything is framed in black and white. “One person feels backed by 10,000 others and believes they are right, closing themselves off to any other ideas. In my international relations program, we were told that dialogue is complementary and it's very good when different sides disagree, because it means there is a good debate. Social media no longer allows for that sort of openness.” For Juárez, the main factor behind digital disruption is disintermediation. Basically, that each of us is now our own media outlet. “That's what these platforms have sold us: You choose what to be informed about and you stay inside a bubble. If you think what happened in Venezuela was good, you will look for information that supports that, and vice versa. Polarization doesn't need a malicious algorithm to disrupt public conversation; it is an inevitable consequence of the basic design of social platforms. By emulating environments which emphasize certain forms of connection and dialogue, a persistent loop emerges where emotional content is the most visible and, eventually, it shapes the very architecture of the network. It is not a question of users actively seeking conflict or platforms being designed with any malicious intent, but rather the result of a rewarding emotional reaction over measured analysis. For Petter Törnberg, who worked on the study, “this toxicity is an unintended consequence of the structure of posts and followers. The act of sharing content is often impulsive and deeply partisan; users react to anger or scandal, propagating a narrative that, in turn, shapes their own digital environment. This feedback loop between emotional action and network structure creates an ecosystem where toxicity becomes the organic norm. Ultimately, the mere existence of basic functions such as forwarding and liking seems to be enough to generate these negative results, turning networks into echo chambers that feed on our own reactive psychology.” “I believe that digital platforms can continue to be a space for resistance and solutions. And that doesn't always happen when we are going through a very difficult time," explains an anonymous Venezuelan source who spoke to WIRED. “When our emotional wounds override reason, it's very difficult to understand the perspectives of others. We are in this situation because we are cornered and vulnerable to US imperialism, but also from Russia and China. Power has led us to this situation of extreme vulnerability. Due to an information overload, our attention span, which is a finite resource, is stretched too thin, explains Juárez: “There comes a point where we shut down and say, ‘That's it, this is what I think.' We simplify because simplification serves as an antidote to saturation. The level of that anxiety depends on our proximity to an event. That desire to embrace a certain viewpoint wins out when what we need is to weigh the many real implications of a situation.” “What we are seeing in Venezuela is not the final episode in a story, it is the beginning of a dynamic that will not stop here.” Big Interview: Margaret Atwood wants to keep up with the latest doom WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.
