                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Avatar: Fire and Ash is still the rage around the world with a global weekend of $86.9M, $65.6M of that minted in its fourth weekend abroad in 52 material territories taking the 20th Century Studios pic's foreign haul to $888M and global $1.23 billion. That global take is down 52% off the holiday holdover frame last weekend with holds including Brazil (-24%), Australia (-31%), Spain (-41%) and UK (-41%). As we told you previously, the James Cameron movie remains 2025's second best MPA title in China with $149M behind Zootopia 2. Among highlights, are that stateside ($21M), the threequel is the first domestic release to rank No. 1 for four weekends in a row since 2023's Barbie. After China, the next top territories for the Cameron 3D sci-fi epic is France ($91.7M), Germany ($73.7M), Korea ($48.5M), UK ($48M) and Mexico ($36.5M). Of the global take for the threequel, Disney can thank Imax for $12.2M this past weekend ($7M foreign, $1.7M China, and $3.5M domestic). Overall, Imax theaters rep 13% of the pic's worldwide take. Zootopia 2 in full release in all markets raked in $40.9M global ($30.8M from 52 material territories, $10.1M domestic) for a running total of $1.276B worldwide, with $1.655B from foreign alone. 6 MPA international release of all-time, and the No. 1 MPA animated international release of all-time and No. 1 MPA international release of 2025 (as we previously told you). Overall global weekend seven saw a -52% overall decline, with holds in key markets including Brazil (+9%), Australia (-2%), Japan (-41%), Mexico (-41%), and UK (-45%). 2 in Germany, Austria, Sweden, Switzerland, Czechia, Georgia, Qatar, Slovakia, South Africa, Uzbekistan, Australia, Korea (non-local), Singapore, Taiwan (non-local), Thailand, Hong Kong (non-local), Indonesia, Vietnam, and across all of Latin America (except Brazil and Mexico). When it comes to movies funded by foreign sales, collecting exact weekend data takes time, so we'll have further updates for you later this AM or tomorrow. In the meantime, we know that Lionsgate's The Housemaid cleaned up another $25.5M from 66 territories this weekend for a running global take of $192.5M ($98.3M foreign).

Universal International/Focus Features' Hamnet was great in the UK with $4.2M ($4.8M global weekend), making it the highest opening weekend for this year's awards contenders above One Battle After Another, Sinners and more than double Marty Supreme. The Chloe Zhao movie is also Jessie Buckley's highest opening weekend in a leading role while Chloe Zhao and Paul Mescal will see Hamnet as their second highest respective openings behind Eternals ($7.3M unadjusted for inflation and currency swings) and Gladiator II ($11.4M). Global stands at $40.7M for the Universal International/Focus Features Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson musical, $9.5M of that from offshore. Germany counted $396K at 371 screens for a No. Business was impacted by winter storm “Elli”, which prompted official warnings to “stay home” with school closures and event cancellations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ann-Margret is reflecting on one of the most emotionally demanding performances of her career — and the lasting impact it had on her off-screen. In a recent interview with Interview Magazine, the 84-year-old entertainer opened up about portraying Blanche DuBois in the 1984 TV adaptation of Tennessee Williams' classic play “A Streetcar Named Desire.” Ann-Margret said the experience was difficult, describing the character as one she had to play with complete emotional honesty. “Playing Blanche DuBois was a rough one,” she told the outlet. Blanche, the tragic heroine at the center of the story, is frequently portrayed as a woman shaped by loss and trauma, gradually losing her grip on stability as her world closes in. Ann-Margret said she was aware of the responsibility that came with taking on the part — and she also addressed long-standing reports that Williams had wanted her to play Blanche years before the TV film was ultimately produced. Asked about rumors that the playwright pursued her for the role about a decade before the movie was made, Ann-Margret confirmed it meant a great deal to her. Although Williams died in February 1983 — one year before the movie premiered — Ann-Margret said his interest in her work remained a meaningful part of the story behind her casting. Ann-Margret also confirmed reports that she had trouble letting go of the role once filming wrapped. “Oh, yeah, because people saw me crying when I was all alone,” she told Interview Magazine. She added that it took time to fully step away from the emotional mindset she carried while playing Blanche. She confirmed it took her “a while” to “get out of that mindset as Blanche DuBois.” In the same Interview Magazine conversation, Ann-Margret also shared a memory from her early career involving late Hollywood legend Bette Davis. Ann-Margret said her first film role left a lasting impression thanks to the two-time Oscar winner, who she worked with on the 1961 movie “Pocketful of Miracles.” Though Davis had a reputation for being tough, Ann-Margret said she experienced a supportive side of the star on set. She recalled one specific moment that stayed with her: Davis reportedly stopped production to ensure Ann-Margret looked her best before a close-up scene. “I was about to have a close-up,” she said. She was there and she, at one point, stopped all the filming and said, ‘Ann-Margret, this is your close-up, I want you to look as good as you possibly can.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colombian music star Yeison Jimenez has passed away following a plane crash that claimed six lives, just hours before he was set to take the stage. As per a report in the US Sun, Jimenez, 34, was traveling with members of his team to a concert in Medellín when the aircraft went down shortly after takeoff and caught fire. The crash occurred just after 4 p.m. local time on Saturday. Colombia's Civil Aviation Authority confirmed the deaths of the pilot, co-pilot, and four passengers, including Jimenez. ABC7 reports that the team was en route to Medellín for a scheduled performance. Before boarding the aircraft, Jimenez shared a poignant post on Instagram. “Always humble, because what God gives you he can also take away,” he wrote, as reported by the US Sun. In addition to Jimenez and his photographer, the other victims of the crash were identified as pilot Hernando Torres, Juan Manuel Rodriguez, Oscar Marin, and Jefferson Osorio. Jimenez began performing at just seven years old and later emerged as one of the most distinctive voices in Colombia's “musica popular,” a folk-influenced genre that traces its roots to the 1930s and 1940s. Across his career, he released eight albums and penned more than 70 songs, leaving a lasting mark by helping the genre evolve for younger audiences. In earlier interviews, Jimenez also spoke candidly about aviation. As per the US Sun, during a podcast appearance, he shared that he had experienced recurring dreams about dying in a plane crash. Tributes poured in following the news of his death. Jimenez's stepdaughter, Camila Jimenez, whom he adopted after forming a family with his partner, Sonia Restrepo, shared a message on Instagram. You don't know how much it hurts me to see your videos and for you not to be here,” she wrote. One wrote, “Never thought I'd see a post like this so soon. How does this all hurt, much comfort to his family, praying for you”. Another fan wrote: “You will always be the best. A news that is hard to believe. The regional government of Boyacá also released a statement naming all six victims. Jimenez is survived by his family, his children, and a devoted fan base that helped elevate him into one of Colombia's most influential contemporary artists.

When Sara Bareilles took the stage to speak at the Luckman Club at Soho House West Hollywood on Friday, she was surrounded by an audience that understood the unique challenges and joys of writing music. All of them were eager to hear the Grammy winner and Tony nominee discuss “Salt Then Sour Then Sweet,” the song she wrote with Brandi Carlile for “Come See Me in the Good Light” that landed on the Oscar shortlist for Best Original Song. Bareilles was joined by AWFC co-president Allyson Newman for a wide-ranging conversation about Bareilles' involvement in IndieWire Honoree Ryan White's Apple documentary about the late poet and activist Andrea Gibson and Bareilles' approach to her entire artistic career. “I got introduced to a lot of their video sort of blogs around the cancer diagnosis and I couldn't get over how much humor and buoyancy they were able to weave into such a dark diagnosis,” Bareilles said of her first encounters with Gibson. Bareilles explained that she wasn't always attached as a songwriter. She simply believed in the producing team's vision of telling Gibson's story and joined as an investor and executive producer. Getting the opportunity to turn Gibson's poetry into song lyrics was just an added bonus. “They wanted it to stay very bespoke. They wanted it to be people who really loved Andrea and understood the mission. And it has like tumbled forward into so many beautiful unforeseen gifts. One of them being making a song with Andrea's unfinished poems and Brandi Carlile that is now featured in the film.” While Bareilles' involvement as a songwriter might have started out of necessity, she made it clear that she and fellow producer Carlile were eager for the chance to adapt Gibson's unfinished work. And when they got to the end of the film, it sort of felt to them like their poetry quotient was sort of met and the poem wasn't finished. There was a lot, thematically, it was a lot about their love of Meg, their partner,” she said. “Brandi and I, both being on the executive producing team were like, ‘Put me in, coach.' I would love to sit with those unfinished poetry, with that unfinished poetry and see if there's a song to be made there. I don't know how many of you have seen the film. And I had nothing to do with why the film is so beautiful. It's just the magic of these people.” Teaming up with another equally established songwriter, and working with lyrics written by someone else, was a new challenge for Bareilles. But the circumstances led to a unique creative process that was richer because all three women were involved. And so working from a page of some of the most beautiful and quirky and interesting perspectives… I just like to say, ‘Keep the Novocaine out of my wisdom teeth. There's just a lot of inspiration to be taken, a lot of medicine from their work. Bareilles didn't shy away from the fact that “Come See Me in the Good Light” deals with dark subject matter, but Gibson made it clear that she never wanted her documentary to exclusively be a film about death. She wanted it to be a story about her love for her partner, Meg, and Bareilles was happy to oblige — even if it meant going back on her famous promise to never write a love song for someone who asked for one. “The only direction that Andrea gave is that they didn't want people to leave and hear a sad song,” she said. So it felt like, great, we're going to write a love song for Meg. Watch IndieWire and Apple's full conversation with Bareilles in the video above. This event was presented in partnership with Apple.

I've never knew a person so in tune with the cosmos. Strings collaborated with Weir onstage on a number of occasions over the past half-decade, including most recently — and finally — at the Dead 60 shows in San Francisco in August 2025, where Strings served as opening act before joining Dead & Company for “Wharf Rat.” “I'll always cherish the memories I have of Bob .. of hanging out in his hotel room and him showing me his record collection and mobile recording rig. Sitting there listening to kind of blue in silence. Of him busting into ‘when I paint my masterpiece' at my wedding.. and in an instant he turned the place into a joyous musical celebration. It was the greatest gift anyone could have given us,” Strings wrote. “He was always ready to ‘Kick up a fuss' He always had boundless time and knowledge to share with everyone and was truly one of the kindest people I've ever known. The world is a better place because of him. I'm extremely grateful to have crossed paths with him in this life.” Watch Bob Weir Perform 'Touch of Grey' with Dead and Co. at His Final Live Appearance I just know that he has had such a profound impact on so many of us and we will all carry that onward into the horizon until we someday meet again,” Strings wrote. There is joy in knowing he is with some of his old friends again.. singing and laughing and playing beautiful songs.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Timothee Chalamet is being tipped to take home a host of trophies this awards season — but his top starring role right now is in Kylie Jenner's life. But proving the naysayers wrong, they've been taking things up a notch, with Chalamet declaring his love for Jenner as he accepted an award for his role in “Marty Supreme” at the Critics' Choice Awards last week. Despite being from one of the US's most colorful and at times dramatic families and growing up under the glare of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” reality TV cameras, Jenner is notoriously guarded about his private life, but sources say the actor is responsible for taking her to a happier place. “After living and growing up really fast, being with someone like Timmy is a wholesome, welcoming stable relationship,” a music industry insider familiar with Jenner and Chalamet told Page Six. And it doesn't hurt that Chalamet is currently on fire, being front runner – and the youngest in his category – nominated for Best Actor at the Golden Globes, for “Marty Supreme” as Marty Mauser, the relentless table tennis hustler determined to become a world champ. Sources say his too-cool-for-school born-and-raised New Yorker personality have won Los Angeles native Kylie — who is also a make-up mogul worth over $670 million according to Forbes — completely. Chalamet and Jenner's love story first started in January 2023, when they were spotted at a Jean Paul Gaultier fashion show during Paris Couture Week, but it was only in September of that year they made a public appearance, at a Beyonce concert. Throughout their three years together, skeptics have doubted their relationship because, unlike many in the public eye, they rarely talk about it and rumors of a breakup are regularly circulated. But insiders say they've grown more comfortable parading their PDA and although they are low key about it, their relationship is getting stronger all the time. Proving they share a sense of humor and style, the couple stepped out in December for the Los Angeles premiere of his movie “Marty Supreme,” in matching custom Chrome Hearts outfits. Chalamet beamed at cameras  from an orange-hued leather suit and silk shirt, punctuating his monochromatic look with orange boots. Meanwhile, the Kylie Cosmetics mogul complemented him in a matching low cut, floor-length orange gown with cutouts at her waist. He locked lips with the beauty guru moments before making his way to the stage to collect his award for Best Actor for “Marty Supreme.” Then, he allotted the final moments of his speech to praise her. Growing up the youngest of her generation in her famous family; alongside Kourtney, Khloe, Kim, Robert Kardashian Jr. and sister Kendall, Jenner grew up quickly, regularly appearing on national TV by the time she was a teenager. She continued to grow up fast, getting pregnant during her second serious relationship with rapper Travis Scott, 34, and giving birth to their daughter, Stormi Webster, now 7, when she was 21 in 2018. They had an on-off relationship between 2019 and 2023, and another child together, son Aire Webster in 2022, but ultimately split at the very beginning of 2023, around the same time she was first spotted with Chalamet. Key to their bi-coastal relationship, with him based out of New York and she in California, is keeping things private. Little is known about Chalamet's relationship with his beau's children, for example. Time and again, gossips have been proven wrong, such as rumors of “trouble in paradise” in November, and reports Chalamet had “broken up with Kylie.” At the Palm Springs Film Festival earlier this month, Jenner posed in an orange sequined Ludovic de Saint Sernin gown to watch Chalamet honored with the Spotlight Actor of the Year award at role Josh Safdie-directed “Marty Supreme.” Chalamet matched the support, liking her Instagram post and commenting with orange heart emojis. Meanwhile, another source told Page Six the movie star keeps Jenner grounded. She's a billionaire — now you got someone whose hot, doing his own thing. Travis is doing his own thing too, but [Timmy] feels safer — he's on screen, easy to get along with,” the source said. And he dazzled audiences last awards season when he transformed into poet and folk singer Bob Dylan in the biopic “A Complete Unknown” in which Chalamet brilliantly matched the nasal-forward, raspy vocal range of the 60's musician. Despite his massive fame and success — Chalamet, the entertainment source said, is refreshingly real. Whether he's grabbing pizza in the West Village or sitting courtside with Jenner at a Knick's game. “They're good for each other because they both have tendencies to get a little brooding and in their own heads about things, and they lighten each other up,” a Jenner source told The Post last year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Avatar: Fire and Ash will continue its box office streak over this early January weekend, landing at No. 1 for the fourth weekend in a row with $21.3 million from 3,700 theaters. While not performing as well as the first two Avatar films, Fire and Ash has easily cleared the global $1 billion mark after three weekends in cinemas, and after this weekend, its global total is set to land at $1.23 billion. The James Cameron franchise installment is coming in well ahead of the weekend's two new releases: Paramount horror Primate and Lionsgate's Greenland 2: Migration. Johannes Roberts, known for horror thrillers like 47 Meters Down, directs the horror film about a domesticated chimpanzee that turns on the family that raised him (and some unwitting houseguests) after becoming rabid. Oscar winner Troy Kotsur stars in the $20 million-plus budget movie, along with Johnny Sequoyah and Jessica Alexander. Running close behind Primate is Amanda Seyfried and Sydney Sweeney starring success story The Housemaid with $11.2 million in estimated weekend ticket sales. The Paul Feig-directed thriller, which already has a planned sequel, has a $93 million total in North America and $150 million worldwide. In fourth place is the animated juggernaut Zooptopia 2, which earned $10.1 million in its seventh weekend of release and now has a global gross of $1.65 billion to date. The film is Walt Disney Animation's top-grossing movie. Outside of Avatar 3, notable holdovers at the multiplex include Timothee Chalamet's awards season frontrunner Marty Supreme, which earned $7.3 million over the weekend, dropping 38 percent. The Josh Safdie-directed ping pong epic, which has a budget of $70 million, has now passed that figure at the domestic box office. Elsewhere, Sony's adventure comedy Anaconda passed a milestone, earning over $100 million at the global box office. Updated with the full weekend box office estimates.

Bob Weir Remembered by Andy Cohen, Don Felder & More After His Death at 78 Don Was Remembers Bob Weir, His 'Fearless' Friend and Bandmate Gracie Abrams Shares Update on Her Next Album: 'I'm Beyond Ready' Informamos a la opinión pública sobre un accidente aéreo ocurrido en el día de hoy. At only 34 years old, Jiménez had already become one of the biggest names in Colombian popular music, or “música popular,” a genre that blends traditional Mexican ranchera music with Colombian roots. 16 on the Regional Mexican Airplay ranking with “Tu Amante” in 2021. This was a historic achievement for both Jiménez and the genre, as no other Colombian popular music artist had ever reached that milestone. Popular music in Colombia has its roots in the country's coffee-growing region, which includes Caldas (where Jiménez was born), Quindío, Risaralda and Tolima. The genre, which dates back to more than 50 years ago, was originally known as “música de carrilera” or “cantina music.” It was heavily influenced by Mexican regional music and gained traction in small towns and local bars, thanks to pioneers like Darío Gómez, Luis Alberto Posada and El Charrito Negro. Last year he fulfilled another dream: selling out Bogotá's El Campín Stadium, becoming the first Colombian regional artist to do so. Jiménez is survived by his wife and three children.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The music world was busy mourning David Bowie on the 10-year anniversary of his death on Saturday when the devastating word hit that we lost another icon of almost indescribable significance to rock history: Bob Weir. “He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could,” the Weir family wrote in a public statement. “The interesting thing is, I've never made plans,” he told Rolling Stone‘s Angie Martoccio last March. And really, making plans seems like a waste of time. Dead & Co. wrapped up a farewell tour in July 2023, but they continued to play residencies at Sphere in Las Vegas throughout 2024 and 2025. And they came together one last time in August 2025 for three shows in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park to celebrate the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary. Throughout the three evenings, they were joined by Billy Strings, Trey Anastasio, Grahame Lesh, and Sturgill Simpson. These were joyous concerts filled with Deadheads from around the globe, but Weir was holding a secret: He was diagnosed with cancer weeks earlier, and had just started treatment. “Those performances, emotional, soulful, and full of light, were not farewells, but gifts,” the Weir family wrote. An artist choosing, even then, to keep going by his own design.” Weir sang lead, and the band stretched it out for nearly eight minutes. “There is no final curtain here, not really,” wrote the Weir family. He often spoke of a three-hundred-year legacy, determined to ensure the songbook would endure long after him. May that dream live on through future generations of Dead Heads. And so we send him off the way he sent so many of us on our way: with a farewell that isn't an ending, but a blessing. Watch Bob Weir Perform 'Touch of Grey' with Dead and Co. at His Final Live Appearance Trey Anastasio Remembers 'Sweet, Kind, Gentle Friend' Bob Weir “I had a little flash while we were playing one night,” Weir told Rolling Stone‘s David Fricke in 2016. I don't remember what city it was in. We were getting into the second set, setting up a tune. We were all playing, but the tune hadn't begun yet. We were all feeling out the groove, just playing with it. Suddenly I was 20 feet behind my own head, looking at this and kind of happy with the way the song was shaping up. I started looking around, and it was 20 years later. I looked back at the drummers, and it was a couple of new guys. And no matter what happens, Grateful Dead music will continue to live on concert stages for decades and decades to come. They are responsible for a significant chapter of the Great American Songbook.
