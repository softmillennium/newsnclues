                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S.-made short-range Tempest surface-to-air missile system has entered combat in Ukraine, according to video footage recently released by the Air Force. Ukraine's Air Force Command Center published video that shows the Tempest system repelling an attack in a New Year's post, without announcing or identifying the new weapon. The Tempest surface-to-air missile system is designed to engage drones, helicopters, and low-flying aircraft in all weather conditions. Hellfire missiles typically carry a 9 kg (20-pound) warhead, powerful enough to destroy drones and minimize collateral damage from falling debris. Ukraine has relied on Western-supplied air defense systems to counter Russian aerial attacks throughout the full-scale war. Abbey Fenbert is a senior news editor at the Kyiv Independent. She is a freelance writer, editor, and playwright with an MFA from Boston University. Abbey served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Ukraine from 2008-2011. The Tempest surface-to-air missile system is designed to engage drones, helicopters, and low-flying aircraft in all weather conditions. Its transfer to Ukraine was not publicly announced. "I play every day with pain in my heart... My sister sleeps under three blankets because of the cold at home," Ukrainian tennis player Marta Kostiuk said after the final match at the Brisbane tournament. In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur reports on Russia's latest missile and drone attacks on Ukraine, including the use of an Oreshnik ballistic missile near NATO borders. "All such attempts are promptly detected and thwarted," the 7th Corps of the Airborne Assault Forces said on its Telegram channel. Kyiv's energy situation remains challenging and is expected to remain so in the coming days, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Jan. 11. Ukrainian forces launched an overnight attack on an oil depot in Russia's Volgograd Oblast as part of efforts to reduce Moscow's offensive capabilities, Ukraine's General Staff said Jan. 10. Russia, Iran, China and South Africa are participating in the drills, called "Will for Peace 2026," with Brazil, Egypt, Ethiopia and Indonesia joining as observers. Russia's takeover of Crimea did not begin in 2014.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• ICE protests: Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem today stood by the comments she made immediately after the killing of a Minneapolis woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. • Iran intervention: President Donald Trump is weighing a series of potential military options in Iran following deadly protests in the country, two US officials told CNN, as he considers following through on his recent threats to strike the country should they use lethal force against the Iranian people. • Venezuela's oil: Meanwhile, Trump is pressing ahead with his plans for the US to overhaul Venezuela's oil industry after removing Nicolás Maduro from power. Democratic Sen. Tina Smith, of Minnesota, said Immigrations and Customs Enforcement should be “reformed, not abolished,” after an ICE agent fatally shot a woman in her home state, and she added that she's willing to withhold her vote on a key funding bill in Congress over the issue. “Clearly, I see a role in our country for strong border security, but we need to get serious about what is actually happening with this unaccountable agency that is not abiding by any of the laws or the procedures that we would expect to see from professional law enforcement,” she told CNN's Manu Raju on “Inside Politics Sunday.” “It is hard for me to imagine how I could vote to support a budget bill for the Department of Homeland Security, given how the Department of Homeland Security is functioning right now in my community. “I don't see how we can trust the outcome of this probe when they are blocking out state investigators and when the people that are in charge, that are in power in the Trump administration, have already said what they think has happened here,” she said. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem today stood by the comments she made immediately after the shooting death of a Minnesota mother by an ICE officer last week, when she said Renee Good committed an act of domestic terrorism by trying to run over an ICE agent. Pressed on how she could have asserted that there's no ambiguity in the situation or Good's motives before an investigation plays out, Noem said she had spoken to the officers and their supervisors and watched videos before she went to speak at the press conference after the shooting. When confronted on CNN's “State of the Union” with a video of January 6, 2021, rioters, who were pardoned by President Donald Trump, attacking law enforcement, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed that laws are equally enforced under the Trump administration. Anchor Jake Tapper asked Noem if she believes that law enforcement would have been justified in using deadly force against those attacking them on January 6, based on her assessment of the Minneapolis shooting. “That's one thing that President Trump has been so focused on, is making sure that when we're out there, we don't pick and choose which situations are and which laws are enforced and which ones aren't. Every single one of them is being enforced under the Trump administration.” Tapper responded, “I showed you video of people attacking law enforcement officers. Undisputed proof, undisputed evidence, and I just said, ‘President Trump pardoned all of them,' and you said that President Trump is enforcing all the laws equally. Noem responded: “These instances and these investigations all have to be taken and done and done correctly in context of every situation that is happening on the ground,” adding that her department is making sure it is “targeting the worst of the worst, and that we're talking factually about each situation.” Minnesota Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said the federal government is stoking “chaos” with its heavy-handed immigration enforcement efforts in the wake of last week's shooting death of a US citizen. “What we have seen in Minneapolis is ICE agents oftentimes jumping out of their cars. Oftentimes, these people are citizens,” Omar said Sunday on CBS' “Face The Nation.” “What they are doing is creating confusion, chaos, trying to intimidate people from being able to exercise their regular, normal activities that they would,” she added. Omar said it is important for Americans to “create the level of accountability and transparency that we need” when it comes to ICE-involved activities. “Oftentimes these people have documentation of their legal right to be in this country, and we know that DHS has lied repeatedly when it comes to these accounts, so it is even more important for there to be recording from eyewitnesses every single time these actions are taking place,” Omar said. “There is no reason to have over 2,000 people coming into our city and creating the level of terror that they have,” she added. It's “quite likely” that American companies will have an expanded presence in Venezuela but exactly how that's going to work will “unfold over time,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Sunday, despite skepticism in the industry about Venezuela being a viable investment. These comments come after President Donald Trump met with more than a dozen energy executives at the White House Friday as his administration is working to convince the companies to reinvest in Venezuela. Several of the executives expressed reluctance, warning that the industry would first need to secure extensive security and financial guarantees before beginning a yearlong effort to ramp up oil production. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday that they are sending “hundreds more” officers to Minneapolis today and tomorrow. “We're sending more officers today and tomorrow, they'll arrive. There will be hundreds more in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely,” Noem said on Fox New's Sunday Morning Futures. A DHS spokesperson clarified to CNN that Customs and Border Patrol officers will be sent. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for what she called a failure to help and work alongside ICE's efforts, accusing them of putting criminal undocumented immigrants above their constituents. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem today called on officials in Minnesota to “grow up,” following their complaints that federal officials aren't cooperating with state and local officials on investigating the killing of a Minnesota woman by an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agent. They have encouraged the kind of destruction and violence that we have seen in Minneapolis the last several days,” Noem said. “I would encourage them to grow up, get some maturity, act like people who are responsible, who want people to be safe, and the right thing be done.” As for DHS, Noem said, “We do work with locals when they work with us, but on the investigation piece of it, ICE and the Department of Homeland Security have a process and a protocol that we've always followed, and we're doing the same thing in this situation.” “Let the investigation play out,” Homan said pointing to other potential evidence that could emerge. It's going to infuriate people more, which means there's going to be more incidents like this because the hateful rhetoric is not only continuing, it has tripled down and doubled down.” As Homan made the point that people should wait for more details, he was pressed multiple times on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision to say the woman who was shot and killed during the incident was committing an “act of terrorism.” “I'm not going to judge what the secretary says, but if you look at the definition of terrorism it certainly can fall within in that,” Homan said. Homan said people have the right to protest, but he warned protesters: “Don't actively impede and interfere, and certainly don't drive a 4,000-pound vehicle toward an officer.” President Donald Trump is weighing a series of potential military options in Iran following deadly protests in the country, two US officials told CNN, as he considers following through on his recent threats to strike the country should they use lethal force against the Iranian people. Trump was briefed in recent days on different plans for intervention, the officials told CNN, as violence in the country has led to dozens of deaths and arrests. Some of the discussions have also included options that do not involve direct US military force, one of the officials said. “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before,” Trump posted to social media on Saturday. On Friday, Trump told reporters that if Tehran engaged in deadly violence against protestors, the US would “get involved.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke Saturday about the ongoing protests, two sources familiar with the call said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Sunday it is “monitoring developments” in Iran as the country enters its third week of anti-government protests. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey pushed back today on Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's claims surrounding the shooting death of a Minnesota mother by an ICE officer last week. Frey strongly condemned the incident and urged ICE officers to get out of Minneapolis after 37-year-old mother of three Renee Good was shot and killed by a federal officer in Minneapolis Wednesday. In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” moments earlier, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Good had been engaging in domestic terrorism and that Frey needed to tone down his rhetoric around the incident. You know how many shootings we've had so far this year? Two, and one of them was ICE,” Frey told Tapper. Frey doubled down on his assertion that the officer who shot Good was “a federal agent recklessly using power that ended up in somebody dying.” “It should be a neutral, unbiased investigation, where you get the facts,” he said. “And by the way, I shouldn't be the one conducting the investigation, nor should Kristi Noem, but you should have an entity that is able to do it with some common sense and operating in reality.” Democratic Sen. Mark Warner expressed no appetite today to potentially force another government shutdown over demands to place restrictions on ICE after a fatal shooting by an agent in Minneapolis. “I think we went through the longest government shutdown in American history last year. I don't think we need to repeat it,” Warner told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” Warner, who voted against the GOP-led short-term package last fall to reopen government through this month, urged Congress to forge ahead with bipartisan appropriations bills and “keep the government operating.” The Virginia Democrat said “we're starting to see a little bit of splintering” as some lawmakers cross party lines on bipartisan initiatives, like the five Republicans who crossed party lines and backed advancing a resolution to limit President Trump's war powers in Venezuela. “Congress has got to provide some level of check on Donald Trump again,” he said. You've got to consult with Congress, which this president has completely blown off throughout his whole first year,” he told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” Trump suggested in an interview with The New York Times last week that his “morality” was the only thing that could stop him from wielding American military power abroad. The paper also reported this weekend that the president has been briefed on new options for strikes in Iran as unrest mounts amid anti-regime protests. That's not what, I think, we signed up for.” “I want to know what the president talking about. Is he talking about boots on the ground in Iran to take out military facilities?” Warner asked, pointing out that an aircraft typically stationed in the Middle East is currently off the coast of Venezuela. Elsewhere, President Donald Trump said yesterday the US is ready to help the Iranian people — without spelling out what that help might look like — posting a message in solidarity with those standing up to the Iranian regime. “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, today also told the Iranian people that they've caught the president's attention, forecasting that their “long nightmare” would soon be over. “Your bravery and determination to end your oppression has been noticed by @POTUS and all who love freedom,” Graham said on X. That is the clearest signal yet that he, President Trump understands Iran will never be great with the ayatollah and his henchmen in charge. To all who are sacrificing in Iran, God bless. In Minneapolis, snow flurries drifted down as thousands of people gathered in parks, along residential streets and outside federal buildings, chanting Good's name, whose death has become a focal point of national outrage over federal authorities' tactics in US cities while carrying out President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown. “The response to ICE's horrific killing of Renee Nicole Good is loud, peaceful, and inescapable,” coalition member group Indivisible said in a Saturday Facebook post accompanied by images of protests in multiple cities. Officials and residents in the autonomous Danish territory insist it is not for sale.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The biggest surprise of Donald Trump's first year back in office is how quickly America's institutions capitulated to “the bully”, said Michael Steele, a former chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC) turned arch critic. But with the midterm elections for Congress looming, Steele predicts a resounding Democratic victory amid a hunger among voters to hold the president and his allies accountable for threatening democracy. “The only thing that would be surprising is the speed with which institutions collapsed,” he said in a recent phone interview. “I thought that there would be more resistance from lawyers and institutions of higher learning than we've seen. “The administration came out of the gate with an everything-everywhere-all-at-once strategy that overwhelmed institutions and processes in a way that it was easier to collapse and give in than to stand and resist. Trump targeted law firms that opposed his policies or were involved in investigations related to the 2016 election. The threats included revoking security clearances, restricting access to federal buildings and terminating government contracts. Many firms negotiated settlements that involved providing pro bono legal services aligned with Trump's priorities. The White House also hit elite universities with funding freezes totalling more than $5bn in federal grants and contracts, often linked to investigations into alleged antisemitism; diversity, equity and inclusion practices; or perceived liberal biases. In that regard, I'm not surprised by the ultimate outcome but I am surprised at the speed with which we've gotten there. As Trump's first year wore on, there were signs of dissenters finding their footing. Millions of people took to the streets in No Kings protests. Disney reinstated ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel after its decision to suspend him over comments about Charlie Kirk was met with criticism from unions, free speech advocates and some Republicans, as well as millions of cancelled subscriptions. But Steele cautioned that, even if 79-year-old Trump's pace slows in his second year in office, his allies are eager to maintain the moment. “I guess at a certain point an old man will run out of steam, but he's got enough other engines around him in [Steve] Bannon and [Stephen] Miller and [Kash] Patel and the like that they will keep things going. He joined the Republican party in 1976 and became the first Black person elected to statewide office in Maryland, serving as lieutenant governor from 2003 to 2007. Steele was elected chair of the RNC 10 days after Barack Obama was sworn in as the US's first Black president in 2009. He became a pundit then a presenter on MSNBC, recently rebranded MS NOW, where since last May he has co-hosted The Weeknight with Alicia Menendez and Symone Sanders-Townsend. He voted for Democrats Joe Biden in 2020 and Kamala Harris in 2024 but has not quit his party, describing himself as a “Motel 6 Republican” who has to “leave the lights on” in the hope the party will find its way back to its principles. When that day comes, he hopes, the legions of Trump enablers who indulged his autocratic tendencies will face a reckoning. Steele said: “For me the most important conversation Democrats and independents and like-minded Republicans like myself need to be having is: are we prepared to hold every last one of these folks accountable? A lot more Americans are going to align themselves with demanding some level of accountability and wanting that process to unfold. “It's not impeachment of the president, because we've done that twice and failed. With Trump sinking in the polls, Steele believes that Democrats should be looking to pick up a minimum of 30 to 35 seats in November's midterm elections for the House of Representatives. “There are a lot of similar similarities to what I saw on the political landscape in 2010 that will be relevant some 16 years later in 2026 that can give you a very good indicator of how things could play out.” “All of these are very important indicators for Democrats that are signals from the American voter about how they're looking at these things,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Organisers clarify award ‘cannot be revoked, shared or transferred' after Venezuelan opposition leader's comments The organisers of the Nobel peace prize have said it “cannot be revoked, shared or transferred” after Venezuela's opposition leader, María Corina Machado, said she wanted to give her award to Donald Trump. Trump has made no secret of his strongly held desire to be awarded the Nobel peace prize, the winner of which is selected by an independent five-person committee in Oslo. After the US launched airstrikes and a raid in Venezuela that led to the seizure of its leader, Nicolás Maduro, Machado last week told Fox she wanted to “give it to him [Trump] and share it with him” on behalf of the Venezuelan people. Asked whether he would accept the Nobel peace prize from Machado, Trump, who has said he will meet with Machado in Washington this week, said “that would be a great honour”. “The facts are clear and well established,” they said in a statement. “Once a Nobel prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared or transferred to others. None of the awarding committees have ever considered withdrawing a Nobel prize, they said, adding: “In principle, the Norwegian Nobel Committee never comments on what peace prize laureates say or do after they have been awarded the prize.” So far, Trump has held off from backing her to lead the country and has put Washington's support behind Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's deputy. “A lot of people, most people, said it was impossible to achieve what he has just done on Saturday, 3 January,” Machado told Fox.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine battled Sunday to restore power to tens of thousands of people left without heating in bitterly cold temperatures after a week of intense Russian attacks that have brought the country's energy infrastructure to its knees. In Kyiv, heating was restored to about 85% of apartment buildings a day after the entire city lost power, heat and water on Saturday. But more than 1,000 buildings remained without heating, the city's mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Ukraine's Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said Russia had targeted energy infrastructure every day for the past week as temperatures plummeted. “The enemy deliberately targeted heat-generating facilities with ballistic missiles. Mobile shelters have been set up in the capital, offering spaces where locals can warm up, recharge their phones and other devices and drink warm tea, according to the state emergency service. Halyna Turchyn had managed to source gas cannisters so she could cook for the first time since losing power. “Today, we will cook something to eat, because we haven't cooked anything for two days,” she told CNN in her kitchen in Kyiv. Galina Turchin, a 71-year-old retiree, had wrapped herself in layers of jumpers to try to stay warm in her apartment, where one window had recently been shattered by debris from a Russian drone and was covered only by a plastic sheet. If not power, then at least heat,” she told Reuters, adding that she had not cooked food for two days and eaten only leftovers from her kitchen. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure since launching its full-scale invasion in 2022, using waves of missiles and drones to cripple power generation in an apparent effort to erode morale and hit the economy. On average, Kyiv residents had no electricity for 9.5 hours a day in December as the energy system struggled to cope with winter demand. Elevators in apartment blocks stopped working, trapping elderly residents in their homes, and people have become used to the loud hum of generators. This week's strikes came as the conflict grinds through its fourth winter, plunging cities into prolonged energy blackouts while temperatures dip well below freezing and are forecast to drop further. On Saturday, Ukraine's national electricity grid operator, Ukrenergo, ordered an emergency power cut to be implemented in Kyiv and the surrounding region to repair the heavily damaged system. Russian strikes overnight on Saturday into Sunday knocked out power in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions. By Sunday morning, more than 13,000 people in Zaporizhzhia were without supply, according to Ukraine's energy ministry. While power supplies were brought back in Kyiv in “record time,” she warned that the situation would be precarious for a while. Homes where power has been restored are still subject to scheduled power blackouts, which in Kyiv currently last for around eight hours. Klitschko has warned that the energy supply system in Ukraine's capital remains “very difficult” despite restoration works. “Before the strike, it was good, normal warmth,” one man, Serhii Przhistovskiy, told CNN. “Until they turn the heating back on, I'll have to sleep in my clothes.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian forces struck three Russian drilling platforms belonging to Lukoil, one of Russia's largest oil producers, in the Caspian Sea, Ukraine's General Staff reported on Jan. 11. Separately, Ukraine also hit a Russian Buk-M3 anti-aircraft missile system in the occupied parts of Ukraine's Luhansk Oblast and other military assets, according to the statement. The three Lukoil Corporation drilling platforms hit by Ukraine — the V. Filanovsky, Yuri Korchagin, and Valery Graifer platforms — are used for oil and gas extraction. Oil and gas exports cover a major part of Russia's federal budget and play a significant role in sustaining Moscow's war in Ukraine. Ukraine has escalated its campaign against oil facilities inside Russia and Russian-occupied territories throughout 2025, primarily relying on domestically developed drones. Ukraine's Special Operations Forces (SSO) carried out drone strikes on a Russian patrol ship and an oil platform in the Caspian Sea on Dec. 19. Linda is a Ukrainian junior reporter investigating Russia's global influence and disinformation. She has over two years of experience writing news and feature stories for Ukrainian media outlets. The Tempest surface-to-air missile system is designed to engage drones, helicopters, and low-flying aircraft in all weather conditions. Its transfer to Ukraine was not publicly announced. "I play every day with pain in my heart... My sister sleeps under three blankets because of the cold at home," Ukrainian tennis player Marta Kostiuk said after the final match at the Brisbane tournament. In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur reports on Russia's latest missile and drone attacks on Ukraine, including the use of an Oreshnik ballistic missile near NATO borders. "All such attempts are promptly detected and thwarted," the 7th Corps of the Airborne Assault Forces said on its Telegram channel. Kyiv's energy situation remains challenging and is expected to remain so in the coming days, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Jan. 11. Ukraine's air defense and electronic warfare systems intercepted 125 out of 154 Russian drones, while another 22 drones hit 18 locations. Ukrainian forces launched an overnight attack on an oil depot in Russia's Volgograd Oblast as part of efforts to reduce Moscow's offensive capabilities, Ukraine's General Staff said Jan. 10. Russia, Iran, China and South Africa are participating in the drills, called "Will for Peace 2026," with Brazil, Egypt, Ethiopia and Indonesia joining as observers. Russia's takeover of Crimea did not begin in 2014. In the first part of a new documentary, The Kyiv Independent's War Crimes Investigation Unit looks at how Russia began moving to seize the peninsula immediately after Ukraine gained independence in 1991. "We are surging investment into our preparations (...) ensuring that Britain's Armed Forces are ready to deploy, and lead, the multinational force (in) Ukraine, because a secure Ukraine means a secure U.K.," U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Union's potential sanctions against the United States are unlikely to be effective, Andrey Klishas, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Legislation and Statehood in Russia's upper house of parliament, said, commenting on a Sunday Telegraph report. "We are looking forward to the EU's first package of sanctions against the US, which is going to be as ineffective as the 101st package of restrictions on Russia," he wrote on Telegram. The Sunday Telegraph reported earlier, citing sources, that the EU was working on sanctions against American companies over US President Donald Trump's plans to acquire Greenland. Trump stated in March 2025 that the United States would annex Greenland, a self-ruling territory of Denmark. The American leader has repeatedly said that Greenland should become a part of the United States. He threatened to impose high trade duties on Denmark if it did not give up the island. Even during his first term, Trump offered to buy Greenland. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has rejected these ambitions, stressing that Greenland is part of Denmark. In 1951, Washington and Copenhagen, in addition to their allied commitments to NATO, signed the Greenland Defense Treaty. Under it, the United States committed to defending the island from aggression.</p>

DUBAI, January 11. /TASS/. Tehran will carry out strikes against Israel and US military bases in the Middle East if attacked, Mohammad-Bagher Ghalibaf, Iranian parliament speaker, warned.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is not a substitute for seeking medical care. I've spent my career treating children who were just having fun – at birthday parties, the cottage or after-school adventures – when something went sideways and they ended up in the emergency room. We can't (and shouldn't) protect our kids from every bump or bruise, but seeing what I do for work has shaped how I think about acceptable risk. In many cases, it's not reckless play that causes these injuries, but simple physics: A heavier child jumping beside a lighter one can lead to the so-called 'double jump,' resulting in leg injuries, a collision with another child's head or an awkward fall putting the spinal cord at risk. I've treated kids with broken bones, severe concussions or neck fractures after what was supposed to be a fun birthday party at a trampoline park. The risk just isn't worth it to me. And while my kids aren't allowed to jump at busy trampoline parks, I do let them jump solo on completely enclosed backyard trampolines, because I think the risk is significantly lower. Every summer, the ER fills with all-terrain vehicle and off-road dirt bike injuries. As I've written before, helmets save lives, but they can't prevent every outcome when a 300-pound machine flips over or hits a tree. The Canadian Paediatric Society advises that children under 16 shouldn't operate ATVs at all because they lack the size, strength and good judgment to handle them safely. I've seen everything from broken bones and devastating head trauma to ruptured spleens and liver lacerations sustained in ATV or dirt bike accidents. Even with full protective gear, these crashes can be catastrophic. When my kids want that outdoor thrill, I have them stick to biking, frontcountry skiing or camping and hiking with family. They still get to feel capable and adventurous, just not at the controls of something that can lead to serious injury or death. According to SickKids, choking is one of the most preventable injuries and leading causes of death in infants and children – often from small, round foods. The risk isn't only what kids eat, but how. Toddlers and young children frequently move around while snacking, and it takes only a minor trip or fall for food to obstruct the airway. We skip certain foods entirely (popcorn, hard candy or whole grapes) until our kids are old enough to manage them safely, which experts say is around age four. Parents may think sleepovers are low risk but I've seen how easily situations can become unsafe, whether from bullying, exposure to inappropriate content or just being in a setting where a child doesn't yet have the confidence to say no or call for help. That's why I believe sleepover invitations should be considered carefully. As my first child has gotten older, and we've had ongoing conversations about potential risks, listening to discomfort and knowing how to advocate for themselves, we've revisited this rule and they can now attend some sleepovers that we both feel comfortable with. While some parents may find it awkward to approach these conversations, there are resources that can help guide you. In my work, I see how smartphones and social media use contribute to youth mental health crises. Surgeon General has warned that frequent social media use is associated with higher rates of anxiety and depression in adolescents. The Canadian Paediatric Society has raised concerns about the effects of screen use on sleep and emotional well-being, particularly when children have unrestricted or unsupervised access. We recently reintroduced a land line so our kids can talk on the phone. The goal isn't to avoid technology, it's to delay the most high-risk aspects of it until our kids can navigate those spaces with more maturity and support. These decisions aren't about eliminating all risk or shielding my children from the world. Dr. Shazma Mithani is an emergency physician working with adult and pediatric patients in Edmonton. She is also co-host of The Doc Talk Podcast. Australia became the world's first country to ban social media for children under 16 on Wednesday, blocking them from platforms including TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and Facebook. The ban is being closely watched by other countries considering similar age-based measures as concerns grow over the impact of social media on children's health and safety.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Delcy Rodriguez faces impossible task of working with White House while keeping her political allies onside Sitting at the head of a vast wooden table in the Miraflores Palace, Delcy Rodríguez used her first cabinet meeting as interim president to urge Venezuelans to “come together”. The day before, US forces had seized Nicolás Maduro from his compound and bundled him into a helicopter. On her right was Gen Vladimir Padrino López, the defence minister, whose support was vital to securing her succession after the fall of Mr Maduro. That Mafia-esque alliance is now on the verge of fracturing. Ms Rodriguez has been given a seemingly impossible task of trying to placate Donald Trump while keeping onside the rivals who could bring her down. One analyst compares the job to walking a tightrope. She is known as a savvy political operator, but one false step will send her into the abyss. Ms Rodríguez's ascent has been decades in the making, but she could hardly have claimed the Venezuelan presidency under more perilous circumstances. But her political career took off under Mr Maduro, for whom she served as minister for the economy, foreign affairs, and most recently, vice-president. When the time came to replace Mr Maduro, the CIA concluded Ms Rodríguez was a pragmatic operator who was best placed to guarantee Venezuela's stability. Whether or not the rumours are true that, in a moment of cold-blooded political calculus, she delivered Mr Maduro, her mentor, to the Americans, she now has to balance Mr Trump's demands with those of powerful rivals. The US president seemed to endorse her in the hours after Mr Maduro's toppling, declaring she would do what was necessary to “make Venezuela great again”. Many onlookers took his comment as a threat against her life. Mr Trump, according to Politico, has issued a series of demands that include expelling Iranian and Cuban operatives from Venezuelan soil, blocking the export of oil to US adversaries, and clamping down on drug trafficking. Ms Rodríguez has tried to play it both ways. She condemned the “kidnapping” of her predecessor and pledged that her country would never become a “colony”, then later proposed a “balanced and respectful” economic partnership with the US. But Ms Rodríguez's path to co-operation with the US and staving off rivals is fraught with danger, and it is widely acknowledged that she, while notionally the leader of Venezuela, is weaker than Gen Padrino and Mr Cabello. He said: “She's in, if not, an extremely difficult position, an impossible position, because she's in a position of having to please the US government and the rest of the Chavista regime.” And Mr Cabello and Gen Padrino already have “blood on their hands”. It is far from clear whether there is any single red line that could bring down the new president, but a perception that she is turning Venezuela into a vassal state for the US would be hugely damaging. Ms Rodríguez risks her allies moving against her if she bends to US demands for elections in Venezuela, which would almost certainly end the regime's grip on power. Mr Trump said in a Fox News interview on Thursday that elections in Venezuela would “eventually” take place, but not before the rebuilding of Venezuela's oil sector, a process that is estimated to take years. And in a country like Venezuela, where officials are greased by bribes and kickbacks to turn a blind eye on the smuggling of everything from drugs to flour, any move to dismantle that patronage system could be destabilising. Mr Cabello, a former army captain, attended military academy alongside Chávez, and was eventually imprisoned with him when they mounted a failed coup in 1992. When Chávez finally rose to power, so did Mr Cabello, and the 62-year-old has been at the nexus of Venezuelan power for decades, where he has earned a reputation as a brutal enforcer. He hosts the programme Bringing Down the Hammer on state TV, in which he holds forth against political enemies while brandishing a spiked club. A former US official based in Venezuela said it was Mr Cabello who ruled the country's streets with an iron fist since the fall of Mr Maduro. Mr Ortega, who has met Mr Cabello, described him as a “gentlemanly guy, always smiling” with a TV host's comedic flair. While Mr Cabello usually dons a tracksuit and baseball cap, Vladimir Padrino López, Venezuela's defence minister and highest-ranked military officer, is rarely seen in public wearing anything other than full military regalia. Some suggest he has already shown himself to be trigger-happy, having been linked in media reports to an attempted coup against Mr Maduro in 2019. Yet in public, he has presented himself as a steadfast defender of the regime and Venezuelan sovereignty. As if all that was not enough, Ms Rodríguez also needs to be conscious of Cuba's presence in Venezuela. But drifting into the US's orbit could have repercussions. In exchange for Venezuelan oil, Cuba sends intelligence agents and troops – many of whom were killed in the assault on Mr Maduro's compound by US special forces on Saturday – to shore up Caracas's military and security services. “Venezuela is still full of Cuban agents, and Cuba does not want to let Venezuela go,” said Mr Vásquez, suggesting Havana's intelligence services could launch an attempt on Ms Rodriguez's life. However, the Venezuelan president has two factors in her favour. The second is that she has a power base of her own. Jorge Rodríguez, her “Machiavellian” older brother who was Chávez's vice-president, served in Mr Maduro's government and is currently president of the national assembly, Venezuela's legislative branch of government. He is also, according to the former US official, “hands-down one of the most evil people I've met in my entire life”. She comes across as a bit more worldly and urbane.” Their early lives were blighted by tragedy when their father was tortured to death by the security services for leading a plot to kidnap an American executive in the 1970s. His death meant their widowed mother drove them to “be the best, conquer power and avenge the death of their father”, as one friend told a Spanish newspaper. The new Venezuelan president will need every ounce of that cunning to navigate the political minefield she now finds herself in, where supposed allies have pinned a target on her back. Mr Ortega quotes Chairman Mao: “Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.” Scheming and subtlety may have got her the top job, but there's no guarantee it will keep her there.</p>

Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. Amidst national outrage this week over the killing of Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good by a federal agent, members of Minnesota's congressional delegation on Saturday were blocked from full access to a federal immigration detention center in the city — but at least one lawmaker among them warns something much more sinister is now taking place in the state. “Members of Congress have a legal right and constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight where people are being detained. The public deserves to know what is taking place in ICE facilities.” Omar shared a video of herself, along with Reps. Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison, outside the facility as large numbers of masked federal agents in protective gear blocked the driveway entrance. Happening NOW: US Reps Ilhan Omar and Angie Craig are attempting to enter Whipple Fed Building- met with federal agents on other side. Democratic Congresswomen Rep. Ilhan Omar and Rep. Annie Craig had their access to a federal detention facility revoked while touring the building. That's complete nonsense … I informed them they were violating the law. Noting the size and scale of the presence of armed federal agents now deployed in her state, Omar suggested in her interview with MSNOW that the recent Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) operations being conducted serve no purpose other than to harass and terrorize local communities. That militarized presence has only grown since Trump ordered more agents to the city following Wednesday's killing of Good and the protests that have erupted as a result. “What we are seeing right now, not only from the surge of 2,000 federal agents — now we have another 1,000 apparently coming in — it is essentially trying to create this kind of environment where people feel intimidated, threatened, and terrorized.

Since Donald Trump took office, the U.S. government has been more aggressively boosting fossil fuels to exert geopolitical dominance. Meanwhile, oil company shares are soaring, a dividend on the investments of “Big Oil,” the major donor to Trump's election campaign. It is also no coincidence that Nigeria (which the U.S. bombed over Christmas) and Iran and Greenland, which Trump repeatedly threatens, are oil-rich regions, too. The expansion of global renewable energy capacity reached an unprecedented 582 gigawatts (GW) last year. USD 2.4 trillion was invested in the energy transition, a third of which went into renewables. These are historic records, even if they are not enough to achieve the goal set at COP28 in Dubai: tripling the installed capacity of renewable energy worldwide by 2030. Against this backdrop, climate and energy expert Hans-Josef Fell sees the world at a crossroads. Opting for fossil fuels not only leads to planetary catastrophe, but it is also economically misguided, he says. Hans-Josef Fell was a member of the German Bundestag from 1998 to 2013. He was a drafter of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG), a law that came into force in Germany 25 years ago and has been copied by more than 60 countries. EEG promotes renewable energies (wind, solar, hydro, biomass) and guarantees their preferential feed-in to the power grid as well as fixed feed-in tariffs (which provide above-market prices) in order to drive forward expansion and shape the energy transition. Today, Fell is president of the Energy Watch Group, an international network of scientists and parliamentarians researching fossil, nuclear and renewable energy resources, and, together with climate activists such as Bill McKibben, is an advocate for 100 percent renewable energy. In this interview, Fell discusses the widespread rollback of climate policies, how to transition to a zero-emission economy, and how investment in renewable energy is driving China's economic boom. David Goeßmann: While greenhouse gases continue to rise to record levels globally, the U.S. is still the second-largest emitter in absolute terms, but with much higher per capita consumption and historical emissions than China. President Donald Trump has reversed the steps toward energy transition initiated under the Biden administration, attacked all environmental protection measures, and issued thousands of new oil and gas drilling permits while U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are going up again. How do you assess climate protection in the industrialized world? This alarming result is also clear, because as early as 1990, the limit of 350 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that is sustainable for human civilization was exceeded. Today, the atmosphere is already overloaded with almost 430 ppm. An effective climate protection target that could enable the planet, which is already overheated by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius in 2024, to cool down can therefore only be to reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (not to be confused with annual emissions!) This can only be achieved if all emissions are stopped in about two decades and, at the same time, huge amounts of carbon are removed from the atmosphere. The anti-climate measures mentioned above and many others are irresponsibly counterproductive, as they even reward new increased emissions with tax breaks and, with tax subsidies, even promote the expansion of highly climate-damaging natural gas power plants and natural gas infrastructure. At the same time, these tax breaks for climate polluters place a further burden on the already highly indebted national budget, which could lead to crises that we remember all too well from Greece's national bankruptcy crisis in 2010. We see in different industrialized countries that emissions are going down; even in the U.S., the trend since 2005 shows a slight decrease. The EU has a climate goal to be climate neutral by 2050 while the Biden administration at least committed to net zero emissions by mid-century, though Trump revoked that. Since we need to return to 350 ppm in a few decades, climate neutrality in 2045 is far too late and far too weak. In addition to achieving a zero-emission economy, we also need a strong carbon-reducing economy, which can be achieved through reforestation, regenerative agriculture, and marine algae farming. Building an emission-free industry would also boost the economy. However, only China is currently pursuing such a strategy aggressively. If we had that globally, about 60 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions would be stopped. China alone — currently still the largest emitter of greenhouse gases — is on an industrial growth path toward this goal. Investment in clean energy has been growing for years, while production capacities are being expanded. In 2023, investment increased by 40 percent compared to the previous year. This is the key driver of China's economic boom, which has been ongoing for years. Europe, with its half-hearted renewable energy policy, and the U.S. under Trump, with its anti-energy transition agenda, are threatening to go into industrial decline. Those who still insist on subsidizing natural gas, fossil fuel combustion engines, fossil fuel heating systems, and fossil fuel-based industrial production will ultimately lose entire industries to China and end up in the poorhouse. Do you nevertheless see positive developments in the global energy transition? However, this is being driven primarily by China and increasingly also by BRICS countries other than Russia [the BRICS group includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa]. Those who, like the U.S. and the EU, want to protect their own dirty fossil fuel economy from Chinese dominance with tariffs on solar products or electric cars will only lose market share, as we are already seeing clearly today with the German car manufacturers VW, Daimler, and BMW, which are late to the game and still half-hearted in their commitment to e-mobility. You say that an energy transition in most countries can be completed within 10 years. Explain how such a rapid transition could take place. Had these growth rates in solar expansion not been halted in 2012 in the wake of the devastating amendments to the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) by Federal Environment Minister Peter Altmaier, and then in wind energy from 2017 onwards by Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel, Germany could have achieved a full supply of 100 percent green electricity by around 2022 with the corresponding parallel expansion of storage facilities. The increases in natural gas prices as a result of Russian President Vladimir Putin's war against Ukraine would have had little impact on our economy, energy security would have been very high, the average 81 billion euros in import costs for fossil fuels would have fallen dramatically, and emissions would have been significantly lower. Today, we must build on the success story of the EEG from 2000 with its basic principles of fixed feed-in tariffs, whereby a modern EEG should also be geared toward system integration into the electricity grid. Then, with the simultaneous expansion of electric heating, e-vehicles, and industrial production, a full supply of 100 percent green electricity can be achieved by 2030. Who is continuing to put the brakes on this? Fake news is constantly being produced, e.g., that renewable energies are driving up electricity prices or that there is a nuclear renaissance in the world. Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder recently claimed that Germany could support its economy by quickly building small nuclear power plants like those already in operation in Canada. So even a high-ranking politician can lie to the public with impunity. In the broader debate, climate protection is often portrayed as a burden. However, this only applies to the fossil fuel industry, which will of course have to completely cease its business activities involving oil, gas, and coal. Spending on renewable energies is not a cost burden, but rather an investment that creates jobs and tax revenue while reducing the costs of damage to health care due to poor air quality or environmental and climate damage. Climate protection is therefore not a burden, but an improvement in prosperity for everyone, except for businesses in the fossil fuel-polluting economy. Climate activists must finally free themselves from the narratives of fossil fuel industry representatives and demonstrate that climate protection is an essential contribution to the economy, creates new jobs and industries, reduces the costs of disease and environmental damage, relieves private households of high energy costs, and ultimately slows down the galloping national debt. Let us finally stop leaving the debate to the fossil fuel and nuclear climate destroyers, of which the oil and gas industry alone has been making around $2.8 billion in net profits every day for 50 years, ultimately leaving behind more and more poverty, suffering, disease, and a destroyed planet.
