Kyrgyzstan has introduced a national stablecoin and a central bank digital currency with the help of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, as announced by President Sadyr Japarov. 

Kyrgyzstan has introduced a national stablecoin and a central bank digital currency with the help of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, as announced by President Sadyr Japarov.

The country, home to about 7 million people, has aimed to become a cryptocurrency leader in Central Asia.

A stablecoin named A5A7, backed by the Russian rouble, faces sanctions from Western governments for allegedly helping Russia avoid sanctions related to the Ukraine conflict.

Binance's founder, Changpeng Zhao, has become an adviser to the president and confirmed that the stablecoin is on the BNB Chain, with a digital version of the som ready for government payments. Kyrgyzstan is set for snap parliamentary elections on November 30.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>➡️ Khabib and MultiBank are launching a multi-billion-dollar regulated tokenized sports ecosystem. ➡️ Fan participation, athlete branding, and real-world sports assets are moving on-chain. ➡️ The best altcoins to watch in this trend include $MAXI, $SUBBD, and $ATLA. MultiBank Group, one of the world's largest regulated financial derivatives institutions, announced a multi-billion-dollar joint venture with Khabib Nurmagomedov. Now he is entering the blockchain arena in a serious way. The new company, MultiBank Khabib LLC, will operate from Dubai and aims to build the world's first regulated tokenized sports ecosystem. This includes a network of high-end sports facilities, athlete-driven brands like Eagle FC and Gameplan, and the rollout of 30 Khabib-branded gyms worldwide. All of this will connect to a digital layer powered by the MBG token, which serves as the backbone of MultiBank's real-world-asset platform. It's a sports business rebuilt for the digital era, with regulation and global reach baked in. Holders are encouraged to compete through challenges, leaderboard clout, staking pools, fitness-themed social waves and planned partner events funded through the MAXI Fund. This fits perfectly into the larger narrative we're seeing with MultiBank x Khabib: sports identity and digital ownership merging. If you believe culture drives value, $MAXI is one to watch early. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is building a tokenized creator platform that connects influencers and fans through direct access, premium content, AI tools, and real-time engagement. The project has already raised around $1.2M, backed by a combined social footprint of more than 250M followers across its creator network and ambassador partnerships. Creators can tokenize their content, offer gated access tiers, sell exclusive livestreams, and share premium drops. Fans can support directly through staking, tipping, or paid memberships. The AI layer is what makes this model scale: creators can automate chat responses, edit and schedule content, and even approve user-generated AI content that references them. If athletes are building regulated tokenized ecosystems to strengthen fan identity and community, $SUBBD is doing the same for digital creators. Both point toward a future where fans hold economic stakes in the people they support. For those watching the rise of tokenized fandom, $SUBBD is a strong early-stage entry to monitor. Atleta Network ($ATLA) is building a sports-focused blockchain ecosystem designed for athletes, clubs, sponsors, and fans. It provides a smart contract platform, cross-chain connectivity, and storage tools that allow sports organizations to tokenize data, tickets, experiences, and fan engagement mechanics at scale. The network supports high transaction throughput and fast block times, which is important when dealing with real-time fan interactions, sports content drops, gated experiences, or event-based rewards. Atleta represents the fan and community infrastructure side of that shift. As tokenized sports culture expands, $ATLA is one project that could see growing attention. The MultiBank x Khabib venture signals that tokenised fan participation is moving into mainstream sports infrastructure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto watchers are seeing another shift in tone this week as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Avalanche (AVAX) regain traction. Meanwhile, Remittix, a rising payment-focused crypto, is positioning itself around real-world use, testing whether practical innovation can outshine pure speculation. Currently, SHIB is trading at $0.00001009, gaining 2.5% in the last 24 hours and holding a $5.94 billion market cap. Daily trading volumes are up more than 8% to $169.6 million, a sign that retail activity is creeping back into play among its 2.87 million wallet holders. However, its massive circulating supply, which is over 589.5 trillion tokens, continues to cap price mobility. Analysts note that even with improved liquidity, SHIB's structure makes a $1 target virtually impossible under current tokenomics. Unlike Shiba Inu's battle with oversupply, Avalanche (AVAX) is holding firm near its critical support between $18 and $20, a zone that historically triggered several strong rallies. According to VexeCrypto, this range represents a super discount zone, where early accumulation often precedes expansion phases. Among the more established names in the market, Remittix is steadily defining its own space by tackling a real-world challenge which is cross-border payments. As the world leans further into digital finance, that kind of practicality could make Remittix's growth feel less like hype and more like genuine demand.

Communist Party newspaper Study Times argues that digital assets are the new toolbox for wartime financial strategies

Digital currency is emerging as a powerful, disruptive tool in global geopolitics, fundamentally reshaping the financial battlefield in times of conflict, according to a commentary in a key Communist Party publication.

Digital currencies are issued by central banks and pegged to real-world assets such as fiat currencies or commodities as well as cryptocurrencies issued by the private sector, such as bitcoin, which is powered by blockchain technology.

“In multiple global geopolitical conflicts in recent years, digital currencies have begun to enter the realm of military applications, providing fast, secure and anonymous transaction features that lay the foundation for the militarisation of digital assets,” the article said.

The article's author, Xue Zichen, said it was “worth noting” that the 2025 US National Defence Authorisation Act authorised a Pentagon initiative known as the Defence Blockchain Internal Testing Programme, which meant that digital currencies could become a “significant strategic tool for future financial defence”.

While Xue's title was not disclosed, the author seemed to be an active contributor to state media, including party mouthpiece People's Daily.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ether ETH$3,941.22 hovered near $3,946 at 13:57 UTC on Oct. 25 after a high-volume rejection around $4,000 left price coiling below resistance, while analysts outlined five-digit scenarios and on-chain data pointed to larger wallets adding. On the flows side, Santiment said “whales and sharks” holding 100–10,000 ETH have added back roughly one-sixth of the coins they sold between Oct. 5 and Oct. 16, describing that as a sign of improving confidence among larger accounts. Together, the views lean constructive over a multi-year horizon, but they also imply that clearing major resistance levels must come first before momentum can compound. According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, ether ETH$3,941.22 moved from $3,955.91 to $3,937.05 over the prior 24-hour session ending this morning (UTC), a roughly $120 swing (about 3.1% intraday) that finished near the lower end. A smaller burst of 23,884 contracts lifted price toward $3,948, but it faded without follow-through above $3,945, reinforcing the idea that $3,945–$4,000 is the local cap that needs a decisive break. The analyst projections are multi-year and do not depend on a single day's tape, but near-term traction still hinges on converting the high-$3,900s into support. Over the same window, the CoinDesk 5 Index rose from 1,945.13 to 1,953.72 after reversing from an intraday low at 1,922.57 and stalling near 1,961.57, with support firming around 1,920–1,925 after multiple checks. As of 13:57–13:58 UTC on Oct. 25, ETH was $3,946 (up 0.5% over the period). In practical terms, $3,900–$3,920 acted as intraday buy zones, and $3,950–$3,960 capped rebounds ahead of the next attempt at $4,000. On the one-month chart, ETH has rebounded from the mid-October dip and is grinding back toward $4,000, still below early-month highs — a setup that supports the analyst view of a longer road higher, provided resistance gives way and reclaimed levels hold on subsequent retests.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tether's Paolo Ardoino explains how decentralized, open-source AI can outlast its creators, run on any device, and keep technology in people's hands. Artificial intelligence is shaping the next decade of technology, but who will own it? The challenge, he says, is to build an AI that doesn't depend on a handful of companies, servers, or gatekeepers. We sometimes use affiliate links in our content, when clicking on those we might receive a commission at no extra cost to you. Earn $100+ per referral who signs up with your link Ardoino has warned for years about the risks of AI monopolies, where massive data centers and proprietary models give a few corporations control over global intelligence. When asked how Tether balances decentralization with the practical need for central leadership, he said the answer lies in building technology that can live without its creators. “They don't need our data centers, keys, or permission,” Ardoino explained. “That's the best way to help society move toward freedom and stability,” he said. In particular, he cites Isaac Asimov's short story The Last Question as a significant influence. For Ardoino, that story reflects the ultimate goal of distributed, universal intelligence. “We can't have the universe connected to OpenAI data centers,” he added. Instead, he envisions tiny, local, and efficient AI systems that can run on minimal hardware, even “powered by a potato,” as he put it. Ardoino knows this may sound ambitious, even eccentric, but he sees Tether's work as the spark for something far greater: While many tech companies now claim to support open-source AI, Ardoino argues that Tether's model of openness is structural, not superficial. He explains that QVAC's goal is to create a common runtime capable of running AI models across many devices, phones, laptops, and edge computers without reliance on any single cloud infrastructure. “We're compatible with the best open-source language models out there,” Ardoino said. There won't be one answer; we just want to build a shared execution layer.” Today, that's USDT, already used by over 500 million people.” In other words, he sees Tether not just as a payments network for humans, but as the monetary layer for machine-to-machine economies. According to Ardoino, the future of AI will not live in data centers but on simpler devices like phones. “Good smartphones today can already run 60% to 70% of AI use cases,” he said. This shift toward local AI could mean faster, cheaper, and more private computation. And while many companies race for short-term advantage, Ardoino says Tether takes a longer view. “Tether doesn't build to compete tomorrow,” he said. “We build for what the world will look like in ten years.” Ardoino referred to his ideas about the “dark times” and “building for the apocalypse.” These ideas are not as ominous as they sound; they are about preparing society for systemic shocks by reinforcing independence. He described three core principles: resilience, independence, and disintermediation. “That means ensuring people have financial freedom and the ability to communicate. Preventing that, he argues, is how humanity avoids the “apocalypse.” When asked how he envisions the world in ten years, Ardoino paints a hopeful and cautious picture. “The future will have a lot of AI, robots, and uncertainty,” he said. “I want to see AI and robots happen,” he said. “But I want people to own them, not corporations.” Crypto Tether's USA₮ Token Explained: Why Its US Debut and New CEO Could Redefine Stablecoins</p>

The commercial real estate industry, long resistant to digital disruption, is finally embracing blockchain technology in ways that could fundamentally transform how buildings are bought, sold, and financed. Forget Flipping Houses — This $36 Trillion Asset Class Lets You Invest Without Owning Property The blockchain serves as a secure platform and what industry insiders describe as a “great, big virtual filing cabinet” capable of storing billions of records—titles, deeds, cryptocurrency holdings, and mortgage bonds—into perpetuity without risk of loss or manipulation, according to CNBC. This integration promises more efficient, data-driven city management and property operations. Investors are increasingly using crypto as collateral for both residential and commercial property loans, allowing them to acquire real estate while maintaining ownership of digital currencies that often appreciate faster than property values. This strategy addresses a critical pain point: forcing investors to choose between their crypto holdings and real estate investments. Perhaps the most transformative blockchain application is tokenization—converting ownership rights in commercial properties into tradable digital tokens. Industry projections indicate that roughly $4 trillion of real estate will be tokenized by 2035, up from less than $300 billion in 2024. This expansion would open commercial real estate investing to a vastly broader pool of participants who previously lacked the capital for whole-property purchases. See Also: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share. One of the most burdensome aspects of commercial real estate financing is the prepayment penalty—often costing property owners millions when they want to refinance or sell. Blockchain platforms like BV Innovation are attacking this problem with AI-enabled solutions. This innovation enables owners to avoid massive prepayment penalties and instead redirect that capital toward new property investments, while banks gain confidence that existing interest rates apply to quality assets. For an industry where being locked into unfavorable interest rates has historically frozen transactions, this capability could unlock significantly more deal flow.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That, says top investor Neil Patel, is entirely justified. Yet, Patel notes, investors looking beyond Bitcoin might uncover other intriguing opportunities in the crypto universe. Among the contenders, XRP (XRP-UDS) and Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) stand out – though for very different reasons. Dogecoin earned its fame as the original meme coin, while XRP was created to challenge the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border payments. What began in 2013 as an internet joke quickly evolved into a multi-billion-dollar asset. Its cultural status, driven by an enthusiastic online community and high-profile fans like Elon Musk, helped it climb into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market cap north of $29 billion. However, its rallies have mostly been propelled by hype rather than fundamentals. A single tweet or wave of retail enthusiasm can send prices soaring, only for them to tumble just as quickly. Dogecoin's real-world utility remains limited, and its development community is small. As Patel bluntly puts it, “This crypto is nothing more than a tool for speculation. Its mission is to enable fast, low-cost international transactions, using XRP as a bridge currency between fiat systems. Payments settle in seconds, at minimal cost, and Ripple (the company behind XRP) continues to expand partnerships across the global financial ecosystem in pursuit of mainstream adoption. That said, the road ahead isn't free of obstacles. The global payments landscape is dominated by entrenched financial giants that aren't eager to cede ground, and the rapid ascent of stablecoins adds further competition. Even with Ripple launching its own stablecoin (RLUSD), it remains a small player compared to dollar-pegged tokens commanding hundreds of billions in value.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MegaETH—a high-performance Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain targeting sub-millisecond latency and over 100,000 TPS—confirmed the authenticity of its MiCA-compliant whitepaper, officially unveiling detailed tokenomics and utility for its native $MEGA token. This comes ahead of an ongoing public ICO on Sonar by Echo running until October 27, 2025 and a planned Token Generation Event (TGE) in January 2026. Join Tekedia Capital Syndicate and co-invest in great global startups. Register for Tekedia AI Lab: From Technical Design to Deployment. Modest VC/team allocations 24.2% total and a $990M FDV at ICO start make $MEGA attractive, with early trading at ~$0.50 5x ICO price signaling strong market confidence. The ICO's KYC, EU custody requirements, and high minimum bids $2,650 may limit retail participation, though testnet activity and NFT rewards offer alternative entry points. The allocation prioritizes long-term ecosystem growth through staking incentives 53.3%, while limiting early unlocks for insiders. bid $2,650 USD, max $186,282; starts at ~$0.099/token FDV ~$990M; requires KYC and EU custody via OKCoin. $MEGA isn't just a governance token—it's integral to MegaETH's real-time infrastructure, creating demand through staking, auctions, and priority access. Stake $MEGA to earn from the 53.3% pool, unlocked only when KPIs are met (e.g., ecosystem growth, technical benchmarks). This bootstraps activity without inflationary dumps, with rewards claimable per vesting schedules. MegaETH uses a single active sequencer that rotates globally to minimize latency. Operators bid/stake $MEGA in English auctions for time slots, ensuring decentralization and low-cost execution. Apps, market makers, and traders lock $MEGA to bid for “sequencer-adjacent” floorspace, enabling tokenized, tradable low-latency access. An on-chain indexer streams real-time data for millisecond reactions, with fees split between sequencers and the treasury which earns yield on USDm reserves. Vote on protocol upgrades; used for grants via the foundation reserve. Ties into USDm Ethena's yield-bearing stablecoin for predictable fees, where sequencer costs are covered by reserves rather than user gas. This design avoids “fee extraction” models, using yield revenue to subsidize operations and keep user costs near-zero. Register by October 27 via megaeth.com connect wallet, KYC on Sonar, link X/Discord + 3 active wallets. EU buyers need MiCA-licensed custody; expect oversubscription given pre-market hype. Over 210K wallets have interacted; Fluffle NFTs guarantee 5% supply share. Early activity (e.g., via GTE or MegaForge apps) boosts ICO priority and potential retroactive drops. Tying token unlocks to KPIs (e.g., TVL, TPS, decentralization) incentivizes network activity and prevents inflationary oversupply, potentially stabilizing $MEGA's value. $MEGA's role in sequencer bidding, proximity markets, and low-latency access creates organic demand, especially for DeFi, gaming, and AI apps, positioning MegaETH as a high-performance L2. Achieving 100K+ TPS with sub-millisecond latency could set a new standard for L2s, pressuring competitors to innovate or risk obsolescence. Farcaster—a decentralized social protocol built on Optimism and heavily integrated with Coinbase's Base chain—announced the acquisition of Clanker, the leading AI-powered token launchpad on Base. This move integrates Clanker's rapid token deployment tools directly into Farcaster's social graph, enabling seamless, social-driven meme coin and ERC-20 launches right from Farcaster clients like Warpcast. Users tag @clanker in a Farcaster post with a token idea (e.g., name, symbol, description), and the bot deploys an ERC-20 token in seconds—no coding required. Powered viral hits like $ANON anonymous posting tool, bought by Vitalik Buterin, $LUM first AI-to-AI launched token, $BANKR (AI crypto banker), $NOICE, and $BRACKY. Become Base's “Pump.fun equivalent,” with 3,500+ tokens issued and daily fees averaging $70K–$200K in peak periods. Clanker will be “deeply integrated” into Farcaster apps, allowing users to launch and engage with tokens socially (e.g., tagging for instant deploys). No financial terms were disclosed, but it's Farcaster's first major infrastructure buy—following a rejected acquisition bid from Rainbow Wallet in September 2025. Immediate tokenomics updates for $CLANKER independent of Farcaster, which has no native token: Fee Flywheel: 2/3 of all protocol fees will buy and hold $CLANKER, creating ongoing demand. 7% of total supply locked in a one-sided liquidity provider position on Base, enhancing stability though it mimics short-term sell pressure. These changes aim for “responsible and sustainable tokenomics,” per Clanker's team, with fees now accruing directly to holders instead of idling in treasuries. $CLANKER surged 50–100% immediately, hitting $44+ from a $22 base, with 24h volume exceeding $25M. Ecosystem tokens like $FCAST Clanker's first official launch and x402 meta plays $KARUM, $HEU are riding the wave.Community buzz on X highlights this as a “game-changer” for Base:” Farcaster acquisition changed the game… $1M weekly buyback on $50M cap.” Farcaster adds “social context” to launches, competing with Zora while attracting builders/AI agents. Base accelerates “meme manufacturing,” with Clanker's revenue funneled back on-chain. Blurs lines between social, AI, and DeFi—launchpads now have “social DNA.” If fees scale (e.g., $40M annual run-rate), $CLANKER could 10x, but watch for volatility in meme meta.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This move enables Blockchain.com to offer services across the entire EU market. The company joins a growing list of crypto firms, including Kraken, Gate, and Gemini, that are seeking access to the European market through Malta. The MiCA regulation came into full effect in late 2024. This framework allows crypto companies to apply for authorization in one EU member state and operate across the 27-country bloc. Blockchain.com sees this as an opportunity to expand its services, shifting from centralized exchanges to focus on brokerage, institutional infrastructure, and self-custody wallet services. The firm has not yet addressed rumors of a potential U.S. public listing, but it remains open to such a move in the future. Malta's relatively light approach to crypto regulation has raised concerns among some European regulators. In mid-September, markets authorities from France, Austria, and Italy pushed for stronger EU oversight. They called for a more centralized role for the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in supervising the crypto market across member states. A recent ESMA review of Malta's licensing practices highlighted that some risks were not fully assessed during the authorization process. While the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) demonstrated strong cooperation, certain areas were flagged as potential concerns. Critics argue that Malta's regulatory approach, including its history of offering “golden passports” and a lenient stance on gambling, may attract companies seeking more relaxed conditions. The European Banking Authority (EBA) also expressed concerns about “forum shopping.” This practice occurs when crypto companies seek licenses in jurisdictions with more lenient regulations, such as Malta. Despite the concerns, some legal experts argue that regulatory diversity is inevitable in a single market. While some view regulatory arbitrage as a byproduct of adapting national laws to EU regulations, others see it as a form of regulatory arbitrage.

Blockchain technology is a decentralized system that records and verifies digital transactions. At the same time, it has expanded into sectors such as finance, supply chains, and data verification. This development happened in parallel to the escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions. During the October 10-11 period, Bitcoin declined over 14% from its previous high on Friday. It had previously reached a record high of over $126,000 on October 6, 2025. At the same time, Ether fell over 12% amid panic selling and forced liquidation. Both gave up prior day's gains after imposition of new port fees and tariffs reignited U.S.-China trade tensions, reflecting the sector's sensitivity to geopolitical risks. On the same day, S&P Global and Chainlink announced a landmark collaboration, demonstrating blockchain's growing adoption in traditional finance. This collaboration will enable on-chain delivery of S&P Global Ratings' Stablecoin Stability Assessments through Chainlink's infrastructure. With this, real-time risk analytics will be brought to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Furthermore, the partnership represents a critical step toward bridging institutional-grade credit analytics with blockchain ecosystems.
