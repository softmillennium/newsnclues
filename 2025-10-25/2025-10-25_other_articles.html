                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Only second to losing, good NFL teams hate “noise” around their team, especially “noise” around a player who is not making an impact on the team. Deserved or not, once teams evaluated him as a developmental prospect, the attention Sanders receives knocked him down a round or three. The social media and traditional media noise around Sanders has continued to grow, with starting QB Dillon Gabriel struggling. Browns owner Jimmy Haslam addressed the team's reasonable plan around the quarterback position, noting that Gabriel needs more time and Sanders is progressing well. Then, on Saturday, early afternoon, the team announced that Sanders was being added to the injury report due to a tight back and would be listed as questionable for Week 8 against the New England Patriots. Along with that announcement, Cleveland elevated QB Bailey Zappe from the practice squad, along with DT Sam Kamara, for Sunday. According to Mary Kay Cabot, Sanders' back tightened up on him overnight: This is the second injury of Sanders' NFL career. Fans and media alike have opined on whether the Browns have Sanders' best interests in mind or are trying to sabotage him. With the Browns flying out on Saturday, how Sanders reacts to treatment Saturday evening will decide his fate, while social media and media ponder what all of this might mean.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mystery has always been one of the most appealing genres in movies and TV. And that satisfaction of finally putting it all together? But what happens when a mystery has no solution? This is the general question asked and cleverly left unanswered in Unsolved Mysteries. The late '80s-early '90s documentary series thrived for years on a variety of networks and became a staple of pre-21st century television. Starting on NBC, continuing to CBS, having a run on Lifetime, and ending on Spike, Unsolved Mysteries totaled a run of 14 seasons and 581 episodes at the time. While it seemed the show had ended for good, it found new life in 2020, when Unsolved Mysteries entered the streaming era through Netflix. So, whether you want to complement your final run of spooky season or if you end October craving for more spooks all year long, this perfect weekend binge-watch is waiting for you right there at the streamer. Before Netflix, the long-running Unsolved Mysteries had aired its last episode on Spike in 2010. A joint effort between Cosgrove-Meurer Productions, which teamed up with Shawn Levy's 21 Laps Entertainment, breathed new life into the show. Throughout three new seasons, spread in five volumes that total 30 episodes, this revival unearthed new mysterious crimes, missing persons cases, and even dabbling into supernatural phenomena. Although the Netflix continuation doesn't have a host or narrator, Robert Stack – who hosted most of the original's episodes – is honored by showcasing a picture of him in the credits. Up to this day, the search for him continues, still making news and even proposed films. By dedicating episodes to covering well-known urban legends, the show honors what made the show so popular back then. The latter is also a staple of conspiracy theories and pop culture in general. Unsolved Mysteries unearths the information through its local interviews to remind us this ordeal marked generations and is far from over. By the very definition of the show's title, these cases expose clues that could help get answers, but not necessarily solve them. Still, each episode includes a contact card to be able to reach the Unsolved Mysteries staff and submit tips that could help solve a particular case. Going a step further, the third volume and 16th season of Unsolved Mysteries featured an episode about children being abducted by their own parents. Thanks to the exposition that these cases got, tips submitted helped find two children. Kayla Unbehaun and Aziz Khan were located and returned safely home after the release of “Abducted by a Parent.” Although they were unrelated, in both cases the children were abducted by their mothers in 2017, while fighting for custody with their fathers. This way, Unsolved Mysteries proved it not only fulfilled morbid curiosities, but it also justified its existence as a stepping stone to shed light on otherwise forgotten cases. This amount is nothing short of shocking, so it's not an overstatement to say that the revival was a total triumph. Thus, if you still haven't plunged into this mystery-filled extravaganza, this show is the perfect binge-watch you need for a weekend at home.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While plowing a wheat field in rural Washington state in the 1990s, William Wallace spotted a gray plane overhead that he believed was releasing chemicals to make him sick. The rancher began to suspect that all white vapor trails from aircraft might be dangerous. Its treatment as a serious issue underscores that under President Donald Trump, unscientific ideas have unusual power to take hold and shape public health policy. The concept posits that airplane vapor trails, or contrails, are really “chemtrails” containing toxic substances that poison people and the terrain. Another version alleges planes or devices are being deployed by the federal government, private companies, or researchers to trigger big weather changes, such as hurricanes, or to alter the Earth's climate, emitting hazardous chemicals in the process. Several GOP lawmakers and leaders in the Trump administration remain convinced the concepts are legitimate, though scientists have sought to discredit such claims. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is planning to investigate climate and weather control, and is expected to create a task force that will recommend possible federal action, according to a former agency official, an internal agency memo obtained by KFF Health News, and a consultant who helped with the memo. The plans, along with comments by top GOP lawmakers, show how rumors and conspiracy theories can gain an air of legitimacy due to social media and a political climate infused with falsehoods, some political scientists and researchers say. The agency has interviewed applicants to lead a “chemtrails” task force, said Jim Lee, a blogger focused on weather and climate who Delany said helped edit the memo, which Lee confirmed. “HHS does not comment on future or potential policy decisions and task forces,” agency spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in an email. The memo claims, without providing evidence, that the substances cause elevated heavy-metal content in the atmosphere, soil, and waterways, and that aluminum is a toxic product used in SAI linked to dementia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, asthma-like illnesses, and other chronic illnesses. The July 14 memo was addressed to White House health adviser Calley Means, who didn't respond to a voicemail left by a reporter seeking comment. High-level federal government officials are presenting false claims as facts without evidence and referring to events that not only haven't occurred but, in many cases, are physically impossible, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California. “It's done, we think, by DARPA,” Kennedy said, referring to a Department of Defense agency that develops emerging technology for the military's use. We're bringing on somebody who's going to think only about that.” DARPA officials didn't return a message seeking comment. Deploying chemtrails to poison people is just one of many baseless conspiracy theories that have found traction among Trump administration health policy officials led by Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist before entering politics. He continues to promote a supposed link between vaccines and autism, as well as make statements connecting fluoride in drinking water to arthritis, bone fractures, thyroid disease, and cancer. The World Health Organization says fluoride is safe when used as recommended. “This is an issue that really matters to MAHA,” said Delany, referring to the informal movement associated with Kennedy that is composed of people who are skeptical of evidence-based medicine. “It is unconscionable that anyone should be allowed to spray known neurotoxins and environmental toxins over our nation's citizens, their land, food and water supplies,” Delany's memo states. Scientists, meteorologists, and other branches of the federal government say these assertions are largely incorrect. Some points in the memo are accurate, including concerns that commercial aircraft contribute to acid rain. But critics say the memo builds on kernels of truth before veering into unscientific fringe theories. Efforts to control the weather are being made, largely by states and local governments seeking to combat droughts, but the results are modest and highly localized. It isn't possible to manipulate large-scale weather events, scientists say. Severe flooding in the United Arab Emirates in 2024 couldn't have been caused by weather manipulation because no technology could create that kind of rainfall event, Maarten Ambaum, a meteorologist at the University of Reading who studies Gulf region rainfall patterns, said in a statement on the floods. Similar debunked claims emerged this year after central Texas experienced devastating floods. Research into changing the climate has been conducted, including work by one private company that engaged in field tests. Still, federal agencies say no ongoing or large-scale projects are underway. “Solar geoengineering is not occurring via direct delivery by commercial aircraft and is not associated with aviation contrails,” the agency says on its website. Misperceptions about weather, climate control, and airplane contrails extend beyond the Trump administration, scientists said. In September, a congressional House committee hearing titled “Playing God With the Weather — A Disastrous Forecast” involved two hours of debate on the once-fringe idea. Frequently citing chemtrails, GOP lawmakers have introduced legislation in about two dozen states to ban weather modification or geoengineering. Florida passed a bill to establish an online portal so residents can report alleged violations. Ron DeSantis said in a press statement this spring. It's just nuts.” And “Chemtrails,” a psychological thriller, wrapped filming in July. Social media has given wing to the chemtrails concept and other fringe ideas involving public health. There is no evidence of such a link, public health leaders say. There is no evidence of such a connection, scientists and researchers say. More severe weather events due to global warming may be driving some of the baseless theories, scientists say. And risks occur when such ideas take hold among the general population or policymakers, some public health leaders say. Climate researchers, including Swain, say they've received death threats. The memo and focus at HHS on climate and weather control are alarming because they perpetuate conspiracies, said David Keith, a professor of geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago. “I expected there were documents like this, but seeing it in print is nevertheless shocking. Our government is being driven by nonsensical dreck from dark corners of social media.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the night of August 14, the quiet farming town of Candioti in Argentina's Santa Fe province was shaken by a mysterious event. Around 10 PM, residents reported seeing strange white lights with violet flashes hovering above a nearby field. Mayor Sergio Oreggioni alerted the police, and a deputy inspector was sent to investigate. On his way, a farm caretaker told him that the animals were acting wildly. The animals immediately calmed down, and no damage was found. That silent, eerie night has now turned into a lasting mystery in Candioti. After the mysterious light sighting in Candioti, police filed a routine report. His request was justified under Argentina's Access to Information Law. The case was classified for “public and national security” reasons, they said while citing three national and provincial security laws. The event added to a growing list of unexplained lights in north-central Santa Fe, often seen near farming areas. However, what makes this case stand out is the sealed document. In February 2024, an elderly couple from Argentina claimed to have captured photos of a UFO while on holiday near San Pedro de Colalao. Rina Juarez, 76, and her husband Rene were taking pictures of white birds when they spotted an oval-shaped object flying near power lines before it rose higher into the sky. At first, Rina thought it was a black bird. But, her husband said it looked like a flying saucer. Their grandchildren were amazed by the photos, and Rina told Jam Press, “You had to see it to believe it.” Stay updated with the latest Trending,  India ,  World and  US news.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just in time for Halloween, HBO presents a prequel to Stephen King‘s horror classic It with Welcome to Derry. Jeremy Renner returns for a fourth season, with Edie Falco signing on as the prison's new warden. A true-crime documentary features audio recordings left by convicted serial killer Albert DeSalvo, the Boston Strangler. SUNDAY: They're not clowning around with this prequel to the hit It franchise, derived from Stephen King's massive novel that spawned a memorable 1990 miniseries and two blockbuster movies in 2017 and 2019. Set in 1962, with nuclear-war fears and civil-rights social turbulence as context, the series from It feature-film director Andy Muschietti sets an ancient evil loose on the otherwise quaint Maine town, terrorizing the kids most susceptible to succumbing to primal fears. The series bides its not-so-sweet time in revealing the dreaded clown Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård reprising his movie role), but until then, terror takes many grisly shapes and gruesome forms. SUNDAY: If your tastes lean more toward the late Anne Rice's supernatural universe, AMC offers an original thriller built around the clandestine, centuries-old agency that tracks and tries to control the antics of vampires, witches, and other ghouls. Nicholas Denton stars as Guy Anatole, a young law-school grad recruited by the mysterious Helen (Elizabeth McGovern) to join the shadowy group, then sent to London on an off-the-books mission. No one's exactly who they seem to be in this twisty tale — except for devious vampire Jasper (the terrific William Fichtner), who's commandeered the London “motherhouse” HQ for his own purposes. He's the undead life of the party, proving once again that in Rice's world, vampires have more fun. SUNDAY: Mike McLusky (Jeremy Renner) is used to running the show in Kingstown, a Michigan prison town that's the setting for Taylor Sheridan and Hugh Dillon‘s grim drama. A broker between cops and criminals, currently working both sides of a gang war, Mike faces perhaps his greatest challenge in the Season 4 premiere when a new boss arrives at the prison: The Sopranos‘ Edie Falco as Nina Hobbs, the tough new warden. A two-hour documentary features excerpts from 16 hours of DeSalvo's audio tapes, which contradict some aspects of the official accounts, raising more questions about his true culpability. DeSalvo reportedly was preparing to recant his confession when he was stabbed and killed in prison in 1973.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With its frozen wilderness, Alaska's massive Mount Hayes towers 8,000 feet high and stands as one of the nation's largest peaks. At first glance, nothing would seem extraordinary about it. These assertions have generated enough fascination for Apple TV to broadcast a limited series about it called The Secrets of Mount Hayes. YouTube also streamed a brief documentary produced by the Travel Channel, titled 'Searching for UFO's Beneath Mount Hayes', reports the Daily Star. A preview for the series opens with an interview featuring Jonny Enoch, a self-proclaimed Paranormal Researcher, who said, "In my opinion there are unpredictable, dangerous forces at work here." According to LadBible, the mystery originates from historical CIA files that suggested aliens might be running concealed facilities on Earth, including deep beneath the ocean and within isolated mountain chains. They were allegedly made public through the US Freedom of Information Act. Mount Hayes was listed among them, alongside Monte Perdido in Spain and submerged locations off Puerto Rico's coast and near the Bahamas. The location has allegedly also witnessed some peculiar UFO encounters, with observers documenting unexplained craft displaying unusual behavior. The document notes that one individual questioned claimed they could remotely observe an "entity" possessing a "very large, round-shaped head" and a "very unhuman appearance." The encounter was also characterized as "very pale" with a "sharp nose". However, there is allegedly no documentation of this individual undergoing drug screening. The verified History Channel, boasting 14.5million followers, posted one clip titled 'CIA Analyst Discovers UFO Base in Alaska.' Another clip, labeled 'Does Mount Hayes hold the dark secret to thousands of disappearances?'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The mysterious visitor from another star system is set to reach its perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, on 29 October. It just passed its solar conjunction, placing it on the exact opposite side of the Sun from Earth, conveniently out of sight. While most scientists have gathered significant evidence that 3I/ATLAS is an unusual comet made of carbon dioxide ice, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb is holding fast to a more sensational theory. He has not given up his suspicion that it is an enormous spacecraft, sent to us by an intelligent extraterrestrial civilisation. Now, Loeb has sharpened his criticism of the official narrative, accusing NASA of deliberately 'burying the evidence' while praising European counterparts for greater transparency. Avi Loeb claims that NASA has photographic evidence of #3IATLAS but has not released it allegedly to conceal proof of extraterrestrial lifeHe also claims he contacted NASA via email regarding 3IATLAS but received no responseHe also mentioned that the European Space Agency is… pic.twitter.com/bam0vTi91N Loeb has repeatedly pointed out all of the object's 'anomalies', from its enormous suspected size to its unusual trajectory that took it suspiciously close to Mars earlier this month. In a new blog post, Loeb suggested that if 3I/ATLAS were a spacecraft, it might use its proximity to the Sun's powerful gravitational pull to either accelerate or slow itself down, all while conveniently hidden behind our star. ', Loeb told science communicator and author Mayim Bialik in a September interview. 'If 3I/ATLAS is a massive mothership, it will likely continue along its original gravitational path and ultimately exit the Solar system', he added. However, to him, the timing raises even more tantalising questions. 'This opportune time happens to be during the same period when it is hidden from view to Earth-based telescopes', he posited. Members of the scientific community have repeatedly pushed back. 'It looks like a comet,' Tom Statler, NASA's lead scientist for solar system small bodies, told The Guardian last month. However, Loeb has directly accused NASA of mishandling crucial data and downplaying anomalies. Following unverified leaks from a purported European Space Agency (ESA) insider suggesting the object emitted an 'engine-like sound,' Loeb commented that while the leak itself was unconfirmed, it reflected what he saw as a generally 'more honest' and open approach from ESA regarding potentially anomalous findings compared to NASA's perceived tendency to 'bury the evidence.' He sees NASA's stance as overly conservative and dismissive of possibilities outside the mainstream. However, while even Loeb recently admitted that there's only a slim chance that 3I/ATLAS was technological in origin, the astronomer isn't giving up hope. 'We can find the answer to the above question by monitoring the sky during November and December 2025, and searching for any unusual activity of 3I/ATLAS or any new objects that came out of it.' 'As of now, 3I/ATLAS appears most likely to be a natural comet,' Loeb added. 'But the remote possibility of an Oberth manoeuvre must be considered seriously as a black swan event with a small probability, because of its huge implications for humanity'.' While the scientific consensus overwhelmingly points to 3I/ATLAS being a fascinating but natural comet, Avi Loeb's 'black swan' theory, now coupled with direct accusations against NASA, serves as a powerful reminder of what's at stake. All we can do now is wait and watch.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Panic grips social media as whispers of an 'alien invasion 2025' spread, triggered by telescope images capturing a colossal 'giant jet' erupting from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS toward the Sun, fuelling wild theories of extraterrestrial probes amid its perihelion approach. Discovered on 1 July 2025 by NASA's ATLAS telescope in Chile, this third interstellar visitor—racing at 58 km/s from the Milky Way's edge—has astronomers buzzing with NASA Hubble images revealing a fan-shaped plume of gas and dust stretching 10,000 km, while Harvard's Avi Loeb warns of a potential 'black swan event' with 30-40% odds of alien tech. Confirmed as the third interstellar object after 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, its hyperbolic orbit—eccentricity 6.1374—proves unbound origins beyond our solar system, with excess velocity 58 km/s exceeding predecessors. Precovery images trace back to 7 May 2025 via NASA's TESS, revealing early activity at 6.4 AU, while Hubble's 21 July 2025 snapshot pegged the nucleus at 0.32–5.6 km wide, the largest such wanderer yet. This galactic origins tale captivates, as 3I/ATLAS—potentially older than our Sun—nears perihelion on 29 October 2025 at 1.3561 AU, promising peak emissions for study. Teide Observatory's composite image, released on 15 October 2025 via The Astronomer's Telegram, portrays 3I/ATLAS's dark nucleus amid a luminous coma, with a vivid purple fan-shaped jet propelling sunward over 10,000 km from sublimating ices. Astrophysicist Miquel Serra-Ricart from Teide's Light Bridges stated, 'This is the usual. Harvard's Avi Loeb amplifies extraterrestrial speculation, positing a 30-40% likelihood that 3I/ATLAS conceals alien technology based on anomalies like its 5-11 km scale, 68 km/s velocity, and nickel alloy plumes unseen in nature, potentially a 'Trojan horse' leveraging solar gravity for manoeuvre. In his 24 August 2025 analysis, Loeb wrote, 'The team of NASA's SPHEREx space observatory just reported tantalizing new data on the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS,' highlighting its mass and CO2 traits as red flags for artificial origins with profound human implications. He advocates intensified International Asteroid Warning Network monitoring through January 2026, post its safe 19 December 2025 Earth approach at over 1.8 AU—more than 240 million km distant, per NASA assessments. Countering this, Michigan State's Darryl Seligman emphasises, 'This is only the third such interstellar comet we've ever been able to study, and planetary scientists are super excited to learn about what comets in other solar systems are like,' chalking jets to perihelion-induced ice activation for compositional insights. Consensus holds: JWST and VLT data affirm natural comet traits, no threats, as Billy Carson posted on X, sharing Gemini North's jet image amid the buzz.
