                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Throughout life, our cells are continually exposed to both internal and external influences that can harm DNA. This DNA damage is a well-known factor in the development of aging and cancer, yet scientists have long struggled to understand the exact link -- especially how DNA-damaged stem cells affect tissue health over time. Here, they exist as immature melanoblasts, ensuring that hair and skin maintain their color through repeated cycles of regeneration. Published online on October 6, 2025, in Nature Cell Biology, a study led by Professor Emi Nishimura and Assistant Professor Yasuaki Mohri at The University of Tokyo explored how McSCs react to different types of DNA damage. Using long-term lineage tracing and gene expression profiling in mice, the researchers discovered that when McSCs experience DNA double-strand breaks, they undergo a process known as senescence-coupled differentiation (seno-differentiation). In this state, the stem cells permanently mature and are eventually lost, which leads to hair turning gray. When McSCs are exposed to certain carcinogens, including 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene or ultraviolet B radiation, they do not follow the same protective path. Even with DNA damage present, these cells avoid seno-differentiation and continue to renew themselves. They expand clonally instead, aided by KIT ligand signals released from surrounding tissue and the epidermis. According to Nishimura, "These findings reveal that the same stem cell population can follow antagonistic fates -- exhaustion or expansion -- depending on the type of stress and microenvironmental signals." Instead, seno-differentiation appears to serve as a stress-triggered defense mechanism that removes damaged stem cells before they can become harmful. When this safeguard fails or is bypassed, those damaged cells can survive and potentially lead to melanoma. It also highlights the value of naturally removing compromised stem cells through "senolysis," a biological process that helps prevent cancer by sacrificing cells that could otherwise become malignant.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The findings could also lead to new ways of treating human conditions linked to uric acid buildup, such as kidney stones and gout. Every living creature needs to get rid of waste, and reptiles are no exception. In humans, the body eliminates excess nitrogen by flushing it out through urine as urea, uric acid, and ammonia. They transform some of those same nitrogen-based compounds into solids known as "urates," which are expelled through a shared opening called the cloaca. Scientists think this solid form of waste evolved as an adaptation to conserve water, a valuable trait for animals that often live in dry environments. Using powerful microscopes, the researchers discovered that species such as ball pythons, Angolan pythons, and Madagascan tree boas produce urates made up of tiny textured spheres between 1 and 10 micrometers across. X-ray analysis revealed that these microspheres are built from even smaller nanocrystals made of uric acid and water. They believe uric acid might play a similar protective role in humans. Although more research is needed, these findings suggest that the chemistry behind reptile waste could eventually help scientists develop better treatments for uric acid-related diseases.
