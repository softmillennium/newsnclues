When Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stormed through Santa Ana, California, in June, panicked calls flooded into the city's emergency response system.

Recordings of those calls, obtained by ProPublica, captured some of the terror residents felt as they watched masked men ambush people and force them into unmarked cars. In some cases, the men wore plain clothes and refused to identify themselves. There was no way to confirm whether they were immigration agents or imposters. In six of the calls to Santa Ana police, residents described what they were seeing as kidnappings.

“He's bleeding,” one caller said about a person he saw yanked from a car wash lot and beaten. “They dumped him into a white van. It doesn't say ICE.”

One woman's voice shook as she asked, “What kind of police go around without license plates?”

And then this from another: “Should we just run from them?”

During a tense public meeting days later, Mayor Valerie Amezcua and the City Council asked their police chief whether there was anything they could do to rein in the federal agents — even if only to ban the use of masks. The answer was a resounding no. Plus, filing complaints with the Department of Homeland Security was likely to go nowhere because the office that once handled them had been dismantled. There was little chance of holding individual agents accountable for alleged abuses because, among other hurdles, there was no way to reliably learn their identities.

Since then, Amezcua, 58, said she has reluctantly accepted the reality: There are virtually no limits on what federal agents can do to achieve President Donald Trump's goal of mass deportations. Santa Ana has proven to be a template for much larger raids and even more violent arrests in Chicago and elsewhere. “It's almost like he tries it out in this county and says, ‘It worked there, so now let me send them there,'” Amezcua said.

Current and former national security officials share the mayor's concerns. They describe the legions of masked immigration officers operating in near-total anonymity on the orders of the president as the crossing of a line that had long set the United States apart from the world's most repressive regimes. ICE, in their view, has become an unfettered and unaccountable national police force. The transformation, the officials say, unfolded rapidly and in plain sight. Trump's DHS appointees swiftly dismantled civil rights guardrails, encouraged agents to wear masks, threatened groups and state governments that stood in their way, and then made so many arrests that the influx overwhelmed lawyers trying to defend immigrants taken out of state or out of the country.

And although they are reluctant to predict the future, the current and former officials worry that this force assembled from federal agents across the country could eventually be turned against any groups the administration labels a threat.

One former senior DHS official who was involved in oversight said that what is happening on American streets today “gives me goosebumps.”

Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, the official rattled off scenes that once would've triggered investigations: “Accosting people outside of their immigration court hearings where they're showing up and trying to do the right thing and then hauling them off to an immigration jail in the middle of the country where they can't access loved ones or speak to counsel. Bands of masked men apprehending people in broad daylight in the streets and hauling them off. Disappearing people to a third country, to a prison where there's a documented record of serious torture and human rights abuse.”

The former official paused. “We're at an inflection point in history right now and it's frightening.”

Although ICE is conducting itself out in the open, even inviting conservative social media influencers to accompany its agents on high-profile raids, the agency operates in darkness. The identities of DHS officers, their salaries and their operations have long been withheld for security reasons and generally exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. However, there were offices within DHS created to hold agents and their supervisors accountable for their actions on the job. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, created by Congress and led largely by lawyers, investigated allegations of rape and unlawful searches from both the public and within DHS ranks, for instance. Egregious conduct was referred to the Justice Department.

The CRCL office had limited powers; former staffers say their job was to protect DHS by ensuring personnel followed the law and addressed civil rights concerns. Still, it was effective in stalling rushed deportations or ensuring detainees had access to phones and lawyers. And even when its investigations didn't fix problems, CRCL provided an accounting of allegations and a measure of transparency for Congress and the public.

The office processed thousands of complaints — 3,000 in fiscal year 2023 alone — ranging from allegations of lack of access to medical treatment to reports of sexual assault at detention centers. Former staffers said around 600 complaints were open when work was suspended.

The administration has gutted most of the office. What's left of it was led, at least for a while, by a 29-year-old White House appointee who helped craft Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint that broadly calls for the curtailment of civil rights enforcement.

Meanwhile, ICE is enjoying a windfall in resources. On top of its annual operating budget of $10 billion a year, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill included an added $7.5 billion a year for the next four years for recruiting and retention alone. As part of its hiring blitz, the agency has dropped age, training and education standards and has offered recruits signing bonuses as high as $50,000.

“Supercharging this law enforcement agency and at the same time you have oversight being eliminated?” said the former DHS official. “This is very scary.”

Michelle Brané, a longtime human rights attorney who directed DHS' ombudsman office during the Biden administration, said Trump's adherence to “the authoritarian playbook is not even subtle.”

“ICE, their secret police, is their tool,” Brané said. “Once they have that power, which they have now, there's nothing stopping them from using it against citizens.”

Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, refuted descriptions of ICE as a secret police force. She called such comparisons the kind of “smears and demonization” that led to the recent attack on an ICE facility in Texas, in which a gunman targeted an ICE transport van and shot three detained migrants, two of them fatally, before killing himself.

In a written response to ProPublica, McLaughlin dismissed the current and former national security officials and scholars interviewed by ProPublica as “far-left champagne socialists” who haven't seen ICE enforcement up close.

“If they had,” she wrote, “they would know when our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs” and other criminals.

McLaughlin said the recruiting blitz is not compromising standards. She wrote that the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is ready for 11,000 new hires by the beginning of next year and that training has been streamlined and boosted by technology. “Our workforce never stops learning,” McLaughlin wrote.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson also praised ICE conduct and accused Democrats of making “dangerous, untrue smears.”

“ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law, arrest criminal illegal aliens and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism,” Jackson said. “Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals are simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens and fueling false narratives that lead to violence.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the Trump pick who fired nearly the entire civil rights oversight staff, said the move was in response to CRCL functioning “as internal adversaries that slow down operations,” according to a DHS spokesperson.

Trump also eliminated the department's Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which was charged with flagging inhumane conditions at ICE detention facilities where many of the apprehended immigrants are held. The office was resurrected after a lawsuit and court order, though it's sparsely staffed.

The hobbling of the office comes as the White House embarks on an aggressive expansion of detention sites with an eye toward repurposing old jails or building new ones with names that telegraph harsh conditions: “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades, built by the state and operated in partnership with DHS, or the “Cornhusker Clink” in Nebraska.

“It is a shocking situation to be in that I don't think anybody anticipated a year ago,” said Erica Frantz, a political scientist at Michigan State University who studies authoritarianism. “We might've thought that we were going to see a slide, but I don't think anybody anticipated how quickly it would transpire, and now people at all levels are scrambling to figure out how to push back.”

Frantz and other scholars who study anti-democratic political systems in other countries said there are numerous examples in which ICE's activities appear cut from an authoritarian playbook. Among them was the detention of Tufts University doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was apprehended after co-writing an op-ed for the campus paper that criticized the school's response to the war in Gaza. ICE held her incommunicado for 24 hours and then shuffled her through three states before jailing her in Louisiana.

“The thing that got me into the topic of ‘maybe ICE is a secret police force'?” said Lee Morgenbesser, an Australian political science professor who studies authoritarianism. “It was that daylight snatching of the Tufts student.”

Morgenbesser was also struck by the high-profile instances of ICE detaining elected officials who attempted to stand in their way. Among them, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was detained for demanding a judicial warrant from ICE, and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a DHS press conference.

And David Sklansky, a Stanford Law School professor who researches policing and democracy, said it appears that ICE's agents are allowed to operate with complete anonymity. “It's not just that people can't see faces of the officers,” Sklansky said. “The officers aren't wearing shoulder insignia or name tags.”

U.S. District Judge William G. Young, a Ronald Reagan appointee, recently pointed out that use of masked law enforcement officers had long been considered anathema to American ideals. In a blistering ruling against the administration's arrests of pro-Palestinian protesters, he wrote, “To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.” The Trump administration has said it will appeal that ruling.

The fallout is being felt in places like Hays County, Texas, not far from Austin, where ICE apprehended 47 people, including nine children, during a birthday celebration in the early morning of April 1.

The agency's only disclosure about the raid in Dripping Springs describes the operation as part of a yearlong investigation targeting “members and associates believed to be part of the Venezuelan transnational gang, Tren de Aragua.”

Six months later, the county's top elected official told ProPublica the federal government has ignored his attempts to get answers.

“We're not told why they took them, and we're not told where they took them,” said County Judge Ruben Becerra, a Democrat. “By definition, that's a kidnapping.”

In the raid, a Texas trooper secured a search warrant that allowed law enforcement officers to breach the home, an Airbnb rental on a vast stretch of land in the Hill Country. Becerra told ProPublica he believes the suspicion of drugs at the party was a pretense to pull people out of the house so ICE officers who lacked a warrant could take them into custody. The Texas Department of Public Safety did not respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration has yet to produce evidence supporting claims of gang involvement, said Karen Muñoz, a civil rights attorney helping families track down their relatives who were jailed or deported. While some court documents are sealed, nothing in the public record verifies the gang affiliation DHS cited as the cause for the birthday party raid.

“There's no evidence released at all that any person kidnapped at that party was a member of any organized criminal group,” Muñoz said.

McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, did not respond to questions about Hays County and other raids where families and attorneys allege a lack of transparency and due process.

Months after ICE's widely publicized raids, fear continues to envelop Santa Ana, a majority-Hispanic city with a large immigrant population. Amezcua, the mayor, said the raids have complicated local policing and rendered parents afraid to pick up their children from school. The city manager, a California-born citizen and Latino, carries with him three government IDs, including a passport.

Raids of car washes and apartment buildings continue, but the community has started to “push back,” Amezcua said. “Like many other communities, the neighbors come out. People stop in the middle of traffic.”

With so few institutional checks on ICE's powers, citizens are increasingly relying on themselves. On at least one occasion in nearby Downey, a citizen's intervention had some effect.

On June 12, Melyssa Rivas had just started her workday when a colleague burst into her office with urgent news: “ICE is here.”

The commotion was around the corner in Rivas' hometown, a Los Angeles suburb locals call “Mexican Beverly Hills” for its stately houses and affluent Hispanic families. Rivas, 31, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, belongs to Facebook groups where residents share updates about cultural festivals, church programs and, these days, the presence of Trump's deportation foot soldiers.

Rivas had seen posts about ICE officers sweeping through LA and figured Downey's turn had come. She and her co-worker rushed toward the sound of screaming at a nearby intersection. Rivas hit “record” on her phone as a semicircle of trucks and vans came into view. She filmed at least half a dozen masked men in camouflage vests encircling a Hispanic man on his knees.

Her unease deepened as she registered details that “didn't seem right,” Rivas recalled in an interview. She said the parked vans had out-of-state plates or no tags. The armed men wore only generic “police” patches, and most were in street clothes. No visible insignia identified them as state or federal — or even legal authorities at all.

“When is it that we just decided to do things a different way? There's due process, there's a legal way, and it just doesn't seem to matter anymore,” Rivas said. “Where are human rights?”

Video footage shows Rivas and others berating the officers for complicity in what they called a “kidnapping.” Local news channels later reported that the vehicles had chased the man after a raid at a nearby car wash.

“I know half of you guys know this is fucked up,” Rivas was recorded telling the officers.

Moments later, the scene took a turn. As suddenly as they'd arrived, the officers returned to their vehicles and left, with no apology and no explanation to the distraught man they left on the sidewalk.

Through a mask, one of them said, “Have a good day.”

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement has inked a new $5.7 million contract for AI-driven social media surveillance software, according to federal procurement records reviewed by The Lever. It's the latest move in the agency's ongoing quest to build out a social media surveillance dragnet.

The five-year contract with government technology middleman Carahsoft Technology, made public in September, provides Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) licenses for a product called Zignal Labs, a social media monitoring platform used by the Israeli military and the Pentagon.

An informational pamphlet marked confidential but publicly available online advertises that Zignal Labs “leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning” to analyze over 8 billion social media posts per day, providing “curated detection feeds” for its clients. The information, the company says, allows law enforcement to “detect and respond to threats with greater clarity and speed.”

The Department of Homeland Security, ICE's parent agency, has in the past procured Zignal licenses for the U.S. Secret Service, signing its first contract for the software in 2019. The company also has contracts with the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation. 

But the September notice appears to be the first indication that ICE has access to the platform. The licenses will be provided to Homeland Security Investigations, ICE's intelligence unit, to provide “real-time data analysis for criminal investigations,” per the disclosure.

Zignal joins ICE's growing arsenal of social media surveillance tools, many of which employ artificial intelligence to generate leads and identify “threats” from vast quantities of online data. These tools pose a particular threat as ICE, under the Trump administration, appears to be increasingly using social media to direct its immigration enforcement strategy. 

Several pro-Palestinian activists, including Mahmoud Khalil, were targeted and jailed by immigration authorities after being doxed online by right-wing, pro-Israel blacklist websites like Canary Mission. Just this week, immigration agents raided street vendors in New York City after a right-wing influencer posted a video of the block online, demanding action by authorities.

Last week, a group of labor unions sued over the federal government's growing use of social media surveillance to target immigrants for their political speech, calling it a “mass, viewpoint-driven surveillance program.”

And there are indications that ICE intends to further expand its social media surveillance capabilities. As Wired reported earlier this month, ICE has plans to develop a round-the-clock social media monitoring team to identify leads for immigration enforcers.

Advocates told The Lever that ICE's purchase of Zignal Labs licenses, like its other uses of digital surveillance tech, raises civil liberty concerns.

“[The Department of Homeland Security] should not be buying surveillance tools that scrape our social media posts off the internet and then use AI to scrutinize our online speech,” said Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's National Security Project. “And agencies certainly shouldn't be deploying this kind of black box technology in secret without any accountability.”

Zignal Labs, founded in Silicon Valley in 2011, initially catered to public relations firms and political campaigns, advertising data analytics and media monitoring to help identify and respond to narrative trends online.

But like the many private companies that now provide digital surveillance tools to the federal government, Zignal Labs soon moved into the defense and intelligence industries, formally announcing the new focus, along with a “public sector advisory board” staffed by industry veterans, in 2021. One Zignal pamphlet from this year advertises the company's work with the Israeli military, saying its data analytics platform provides “tactical intelligence” to “operators on the ground” in Gaza. The pamphlet also highlights Zignal's work with the U.S. Marines and the State Department.

Zignal Labs did not return a request for comment about its work with Israeli forces or its new contract with ICE.

The unions' lawsuit over the Trump administration's use of social media surveillance details the myriad digital surveillance tools that ICE already has at its disposal, including ShadowDragon, a software that uses publicly available websites to map out an individual's online activity, and Babel X, which links social media profiles and location information to a target's Social Security number. 

“We've been seeing an uptick in ICE surveillance contracts,” said Julie Mao, an attorney with Just Futures Law, a legal advocacy group that closely monitors ICE's surveillance regime.

This week, ICE signed a $7 million contract with the firm SOS International LLC, for “skip tracing services,” a term that refers to tracking a person's whereabouts, per federal procurement records reviewed by The Lever. The multimillion-dollar contract comes just three months after SOS International LLC, which also does business as SOSi, announced that the company had hired Andre Watson, an ICE Homeland Security Investigations intelligence chief, to “expand [the company's] business and deliver capabilities to state and federal law enforcement agencies.” 

Many of these services tout that their surveillance capabilities are enhanced by artificial intelligence, including Zignal. In a July post announcing the latter company's partnership with Carahsoft Technology, Zignal's CEO boasted that the latest iteration of the software used AI to scour global digital data, “helping defense and intelligence teams detect and respond to threats with greater clarity and speed.” Two months after this announcement, ICE signed its new contract with Carahsoft for Zignal licenses.

ICE's use of AI to surveil vast swathes of the internet in real time presents serious privacy and free speech concerns, the labor unions argued in their lawsuit against the Trump administration.

“The government's utilization of AI and automated tools for viewpoint-driven online surveillance gives teeth to its threat to surveil ‘everyone' online for disfavored expression,” attorneys with the civil liberties group the Electronic Freedom Foundation and Yale Law School's Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic wrote in the complaint, saying that such tools “exacerbate the chilling impact of that surveillance.”

Reclusive Republican billionaire is descendant of gilded age industrialist and former treasury secretary Andrew Mellon

A reclusive billionaire, anti-tax crusader and major financial backer of Donald Trump has been named as the anonymous private donor who gave $130m to the government to help pay US troops during the federal shutdown that is now in its fourth week, according to the New York Times.

Timothy Mellon, heir to the gilded age industrialist and former treasury secretary Andrew Mellon, is the secret donor whom Trump has described as a “friend”, “great American” and “patriot”, but has refused to name, the Times reported on Saturday, citing two anonymous sources familiar with the arrangement.

Trump first announced the secret, legally controversial donation on Thursday amid growing clamor about the potential financial hardship being caused by the ongoing federal shutdown on the 1.3 million active duty military troops.

​​“He doesn't want publicity,” Trump said on Friday as he headed to Malaysia. “He prefers that his name not be mentioned, which is pretty unusual in the world I come from, and in the world of politics, you want your name mentioned.”

​​The Pentagon told the Times that the donation was accepted under the “general gift acceptance authority”.

“The donation was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of service members' salaries and benefits,” said Sean Parnell, the Pentagon's chief spokesperson, in a statement.

Still, the donation, which equates to about $100 per service member, appears to be a potential violation of the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending funds in advance or in excess of congressional appropriations – and from accepting voluntary services “except in the case of emergency involving the safety of human life or the protection of property”.

Potential penalties for violations include both administrative and criminal sanctions such as suspension or removal from duty, fines and imprisonment.

A White House spokesperson referred the Guardian to the treasury department, which has been contacted for comment.

Mellon, 80, pumped over $165m to back Trump, Robert F Kennedy and other Republican candidates during the 2024 election cycle, making him the top donor fueling outside spending groups last year, according to the campaign finance watchdog OpenSecrets. This included $125m to the Super PAC Make America Great Again Inc, which supported Trump, according to Federal Election Commission documents. Mellon has also given money to Kennedy's anti-vaccine group, Children's Health Defense.

Mellon, a retired railroad magnet who lives mostly in Wyoming, is a relatively new player in campaign financing, donating just $32,000 in the 2016 election cycle when Trump first ran for office. This jumped to $10m in 2016 and $60m in 2020, when in a rare interview with Bloomberg the recluse said he believed Trump had delivered on what he'd said on the stump.

after newsletter promotion

In 2021, the Texas Tribune reported that Mellon had donated $53m to Texas governor Greg Abbott's fund to build a wall on the state's border with Mexico.

Mellon's wealth and anti-tax leanings can be traced back to his industrialist grandfather, who made his money in banking and investments in startups before serving as treasury secretary from 1921 to 1932.

The Mellon family remains one of the country's richest with a combined net worth of $14bn in 2024, according to Forbes. Timothy Mellon's individual wealth is unclear, with reported estimates ranging from $700m to $4bn.

MOSCOW, October 25. /TASS/. Ukraine's Mirotvorets (or Peacekeeper) extremist website has added 25 more children born in 2022 and 2023 to its database, according to the website's data, which was reviewed by TASS. Most of these children are citizens of Ukraine.

The children are accused of "deliberately violating the state border" and "attempting to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity" of Ukraine. The documents indicate that they traveled through checkpoints from the Rostov Region to the People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

Overall, the website has added data on approximately 100 two-and three-year-old children this week.

The Mirotvorets database previously included minors aged 2 to 17.

In 2021, Faina Savenkova, a writer from the Lugansk People's Republic who was 12 years old at the time, was added to the list. The website's administrators claimed that the girl was "participating in anti-Ukrainian propaganda activities." Savenkova believes that "the publication of children's personal information on such websites is a violation of children's rights."

Rodion Miroshnik, the Russian Foreign Ministry's ambassador-at-large tasked with overseeing the Kiev regime's crimes, told TASS earlier that the publication of the personal data of minors on such websites made it clear that the terrorist regime's militants were ready to do away with Russian children.

The infamous Mirotvorets website was launched in 2014 to identify individuals allegedly posing a threat to Ukraine's national security and publish their personal data. Over the years, it has collected the personal information of journalists, artists, and politicians who visited Crimea and Donbass or drew criticism from the site's administrators for other reasons.

Artificial intelligence is running up against hardware barriers in rendering Ukraine's drone swarms autonomous.

Ukraine's drones are setting new standards for self-piloting on the battlefield. Full autonomy, however, remains well out of reach — and is likely to stay there.

The broader vision of drones operating fully independently of pilots remains something of a holy grail for drone developers, even as it may seem a dystopian nightmare to many human rights activists and luminaries, including the pope himself.

Ukrainian developers hope that progressively delegating more tasks to drones and software can free up pilots and their attention spans, which, in turn, can compensate for the lack of manpower relative to Russia, which is typically pegged at a ratio of about 3-to-1.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is often mentioned alongside autonomy to the point that in Ukrainian weapons circles, the terms are often used interchangeably. But AI technologies and their underlying neural networks remain far from capable of making choices on the Ukrainian battlefield.

“We're not going along the route of that full autonomy,” Andriy Chulyk, a co-founder of Sine Engineering, which makes drone guidance modules and software, told the Kyiv Independent. “Tesla, for example, having enormous, colossal resources, has been working on self-driving for ten years and — unfortunately — they still haven't made a product that a person can be sure of.”

Beyond the moral hazards of giving any computer a license to kill, drones face a major barrier in terms of what they can carry.

When it comes to consumer-facing AI applications like ChatGPT, cloud computing hides AI's insatiable appetite for computing power in distant data centers. In contrast, drone autonomy is most useful precisely in situations where data connections with operators and, by extension, potential cloud linkage die. Delegating life-or-death decision-making to the kind of computer a 10-inch drone can carry remains a distant prospect.

“(AI) is in use virtually everywhere, but you have to take into account that it can make mistakes,” as Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi told RBC-Ukraine in August. “Virtually all of our technological weapons have elements of artificial intelligence.”

“The main role of AI in the nearest future on the real battlefield will be just a kind of supportive function rather than replacing humans,” Kate Bondar, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the Kyiv Independent.

One of the most promising of these applications is in interceptor drones, which aim to strike down fast-moving Russian Shahed-type drones as they criss-cross Ukraine.

Given Ukraine's size and the speed of newer jet-powered Shaheds, interceptors need to be ready across a vast territory, while taking as few operators as possible.

“It's just execution, where AI can be way, way more efficient than a human, because the Russians are installing these avoidance systems, and they're starting to maneuver, and it's in the air, so it will be easier for software to react on that, to adjust the flight of the interceptor, rather than relying on connection, latency, and taking into account all the factors that operator cannot feel, like wind gusts, et cetera, et cetera.”

Interceptors “still rely on FPV technology,” Yaroslav Azhnyuk, founder and CEO of two companies, the Fourth Law and Odd Systems, told the Kyiv Independent. Odd Systems started off as a mass FPV producer, though it's currently testing anti-Shahed-type drone interceptors. The Fourth Law, meanwhile, produces small and cheap — roughly $70 — AI vision modules for FPVs.

“The difference between most Ukrainian interceptors and, say, Merops produced by Eric Schmidt's company, is that Ukrainian solutions currently lack the AI part of it.”

When it comes to FPVs, AI is fairly standard issue, largely in the form of “last-mile targeting,” which allows a pilot to select whatever object on the screen they want the drone to head towards — maybe a soldier, maybe a bunker, maybe an S-300 — while they still have a video linkage. The drone will retain and zoom towards the visual target its pilot clicked on even after the connection to the pilot falters due to electronic interference.

Last-mile targeting in Ukraine's FPV drones was a big step in circumventing Russian radio-frequency jammers, but it has remained the province of fairly simple machine vision software for over a year. Last-mile targeting also requires a pilot to select and lock on a target in a way similar to the predictive focus tracking found on any decent DSLR camera for years. In other words, it's not exactly a technological revolution.

Azhnyuk has not given up on full autonomy as a way of multiplying Ukrainian FPV forces “by a factor of 100.” But for the time being, the Fourth Law's impact has been primarily in streamlining the necessary neural networks to, for example, hold last-mile targeting even on Russian vehicles driving through shadows or soldiers hiding in tree cover.

He touts preliminary results of one brigade using his products, which he said have boosted the rate at which drones hit their end targets from 20% to 80%. Among the biggest changes in his AI is the ability to recognize a target as it passes through shadows or treelines, rather than locking on to a set of pixels that such distortions to the visual field camouflage.

Speaking with the Kyiv Independent, Azhnyuk says that full autonomy in one-off demos would already be feasible, but “massive deployment” is a whole different challenge, one that's nowhere in sight.

Among the most obvious use cases for autonomy in drones is missions that go far beyond the distance at which a drone can maintain radio contact with its operator — particularly with cheaper kamikaze drones on which it's not worth mounting, for example, a Starlink.

Deep strikes, however, are an illustrative example, as there is no chance Ukraine will let its deep-strike drones do their own target selection any time soon. They spend too much time flying over Russian cities and civilians to be left up to their own devices — or target selection.

A recent partnership between US-originated Shield AI and Ukrainian Iron Belly is illustrative of the future.

In a training field in Western Ukraine, a V-BAT — a million-dollar reconnaissance drone with a sticker loitering time of 13 hours — takes off in the direction of a practice target, in this case a civilian car.

The V-BAT returns with a trail of images taken along the way, and pictures of the target itself from every angle. It passes these along to the D4, a cheap kamikaze drone that uses onboard AI software and its own camera to track those images back to the target in question

A light rain picks up shortly after the D4 launches, blurring its camera and sending it off course for some 20 minutes. The operators, however, let it ride out the weather without touching its controls. It eventually self-corrects, making some demonstrative swoops of victory over the target car when it arrives.

Such deployment of AI would effectively extend the range of “last-mile targeting” to a hundred kilometers or more. It remains, however, in the testing phases.

The U.S.-made V-BAT is armed with top-of-the-line camera equipment that rarely makes it to Ukraine, largely due to the cost.. Part of the issue, Bondar says, is that while Ukrainian drones have accumulated enormous visual data since February 2022, the origin of that data is “mostly analog, cheap cameras.”

“Yes, it will be able to distinguish between a tank and a human. It will identify that it's a tank or it's a vehicle or that it's a human. But not more than that. So the problem of, for example, distinguishing between a Russian and Ukrainian soldier, or even a soldier and a civilian, has not been solved,” said Bondar.

The software powering much of Ukraine's visual AI is heavy on open sourcing. While free software like YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) is economical, it's unlikely to be the best in the world.

Bondar, for one, is suspicious that much of the AI talk in Ukrainian drones is driven by marketing.

“War's also a business. You have to sell something, you have to be competitive, and to be competitive you have to have an advantage. To have AI-enabled software, or some cool AI system, that's something that sounds really cool and sexy,” Bondar said.

Experts say there has been an 80% drop-off since serial killing peaked in the US in the 1970s – but that hasn't stopped social media speculation

For the past two years, rumors of a serial killer have preoccupied residents of Austin, Texas, and beyond as body upon body kept turning up at a lake in the city. The killer was even given a name: the Rainey Street Ripper.

But authorities now say some 36 drownings in the lake, near Rainey Street neighborhood, were probably related to alcohol and drug consumption and the reservoir's proximity to the city's famous bar scene.

There is almost certainly no serial killer. But will that be enough to put the rumors to bed, or does the broader American fascination – both in fact and in fiction – with macabre mass killers mean that facts and truth have little say in the matter?

The report by Texas State University researchers in collaboration with the Austin police department that reviewed 189 cases over a 20-year period found no evidence of a serial murderer, no pattern of clustering or hotspots of similar criminal activity.

“While social media speculation has suggested otherwise, the independent academic study supports the findings of APD investigations and confirms that Austin is not facing a serial killer,” the Austin police department said in statement.

The study found that men are more likely to drown than women, and that could explain why more men than women were drowning in Lady Bird Lake.

Dr Kim Rossmo is professor of criminal justice at the university who developed the field of geographic profiling that helped locate serial killer Robert Pickton, known as the Pig Farmer Killer, in 2001. He told a local news outlet that social media has been “propagating something that's sensational to get a few more clicks”.

“Let's not spend money and time chasing phantom serial killers,” he added.

But the absence of evidence of foul play, and efforts to debunk serial killer theories, may not be enough.

Last year, New York police said there was no evidence of a serial killer at work near two nightclubs in Brooklyn, after the bodies of three men were found in a nearby creek over the course of a little over a year.

In August, police in Boston addressed online discussions about a potential serial killer in New England after multiple corpses were found across six states since April. The Massachusetts state police have said there is no evidence to suggest a serial killer. Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox, author several books on the subject, said: “There is little commonality among the victims.”

But the interest in serial killers is scarcely on the wane, despite a striking drop in their numbers since the dark heyday of Ted Bundy, who kidnapped, raped and murdered dozens of young women and girls between 1974 and 1978, and Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed and dismembered 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991.

Fox estimates there has been an 80% drop-off since serial killing peaked in the 1970s. At that time there were nearly 300 known active serial killers in the US. A decade later there were 250 active killers, who accounted for between 120 and 180 deaths a year. In the 2010s, there were fewer than 50 known active killers.

Fox points to several factors that might collectively suggest why the numbers have fallen so dramatically.

“We have very few hitchhikers now,” he said. “Back then people put them at significant risk when seemingly good Samaritans gave them a ride.”

The same can be said for motorists accepting help with a flat tire, leading to a serial killer in Indiana being dubbed “The Flat Tire Killer”. “But now we have Uber, so we don't to hitchhike, and we have cellphones to call for help. Overall, people are much more aware about strangers.”

Equally significant is the adoption of DNA technologies, which did not become available until the 1990s, and the availability of large DNA databanks that can lead to direct identifications or of family members.

Idaho mass murderer Bryan Kohberger was identified in part when genetic genealogy pointed to his family in Pennsylvania. Kohberger, while not strictly a serial killer, studied under DeSales university forensic psychology professor Katherine Ramsland.

“Advances in DNA technology have given authorities the ability to identify killers before they assemble large body counts,” Fox says, adding that cameras, cross-jurisdiction law enforcement agency communication, and reduced street prostitution have helped to reduce opportunities for serial killers.

Thus Kohberger – who killed four students in a single house in Moscow, Idaho – was caught before he could commit a second crime.

Fox, who manages the Associated Press/USA Today/Northeastern University Mass Killing Database, also points out that in the 1970s there weren't so many outlets for sexual sadists to satisfy their urges. “With violent imagery available to all they can to some extent satisfy themselves without having to use an unwilling victim,” he says.

But while serial killers fade in reality, there's a certainly been a surge in interest around serial killers in popular entertainment.

Accused Long Island serial killer Rex Heuermann, who faces trial on charges of murdering seven women next year, has already had two documentaries made about his alleged crimes. The Netflix murder series “Monster”, has looked at Dahmer and Ed Gein, the Butcher of Plainfield, who inspired Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Both shows have been audience hits.

“It's the killers of yesteryear that are entertaining to people,” says Fox. “And that reflects the fact that we have so many. So many, in fact, that two killers in California that were named Freeway Killer One and Freeway Killer Two.”

Horrifically, the decline in serial killers has coincided with the rise of something equally horrifying and maybe even more of a threat: mass shooters, especially in schools.

“Because of their bizarre and extreme nature, serial killers inspired attention but not necessarily fear, except in a particular community,” Fox argues. “Mass shooting engender fear. So now we have Americans avoiding certain places because they don't want to get caught up so it's a different kind of thing.”

Still, the societal need to understand the motivation, or lack of it, for murder remains intact. In a new book, The Monsters We Make, published next week, journalist Rachel Corbett threads together her own family's experience with murder with a study of criminal profiling, a pursuit that's more art than science.

“Society needs monsters,” Corbett writes. “They remind us of who we are – and who we are not. They are terrifying because they break down the boundaries between what we consider human and inhuman, and warn us of what we could become.”

The need to create monsters where they may not exist, including the Austin, Massachusetts and Brooklyn scares, confronts a reality identified by Fox that the serial killer era, such as it ever was, has been supplanted.

“Even at it's height the serial killer epidemic it was vastly overblown,” she says. “Now we're catching old serial killers but the new ones are doing one-off murders here and there.”

Corbett point out that the stories do serve a purpose.

“A serial killer is Frankenstein - a patchwork for anything you want to project on to it. Conservatives said Ted Bundy was the creation of the loss of religiosity in society, family breakdown and women's rights. On the left, you had people saying we need advance social programs and understand mental health. Let's study them and not just kill them.”

Regardless of the real world decline of the crime, the American fascination with serial killers lives on.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has prepared new sanctions against Russia, Reuters reported on Oct. 25, citing an unnamed U.S. official and another person familiar with the matter.

The sanctions could reportedly be imposed if Russian President Vladimir Putin shows no interest in meaningful negotiations and continues to delay ending Russia's war in Ukraine.

Trump announced his administration's first sanctions against Moscow since taking office on Oct. 22, targeting Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, and their subsidiaries.

The measures freeze all U.S.-based assets of those companies and pave the way for secondary sanctions against foreign institutions that handle transactions with those on the blacklist.

Some of the additional sanctions prepared by the U.S. are directed against Russia's banking sector and the infrastructure used to supply oil to the market, according to the Reuters sources.

Ukrainian officials also reportedly proposed new sanctions to Washington last week. Among the specific proposals were measures to cut off all Russian banks from the U.S. dollar system.

Two sources told Reuters that U.S. officials have informed Europe that they support the EU's plan to use Russian frozen assets to buy American weapons for Kyiv, as requested by Ukraine.

Washington has reportedly held preliminary discussions on the use of Russian assets located in the U.S.

The EU froze about $300 billion of Russia's central bank's foreign reserves in February 2022 as part of its third sanctions package, prohibiting all transactions related to their management.

Belgium, where the majority of frozen funds is parked, put the brakes on swift progress on the use of frozen Russian assets, warning that its demands related to legal worries would first need to be met.

The move signals a tougher U.S. stance after Putin's negotiating position led to the cancellation of a planned Trump-Putin summit in Budapest, with Trump saying he did not want "a wasted meeting." 

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov earlier reiterated that Russia's stance on ending hostilities along the current front lines, which Washington and Ukraine support, "has not changed." 

Following Trump's sanctions, India's biggest refineries are expected to reduce purchases from Rosneft and Lukoil to virtually zero, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed executives at Indian oil companies. 

Chinese state-owned oil companies have also suspended purchases of seaborne Russian crude following the sanctions, amid fears of potential secondary sanctions, according to Reuters.

Experts earlier told the Kyiv Independent that the sanctions might squeeze Russia's oil sector.

After relocating to Warsaw, he spent a year and a half at the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, initially as a news anchor and later as managing editor.





The plant is Russia's fourth-largest oil refinery and processed 13.1 million tons of oil last year, according to Russian estimates.

The sanctions could be imposed if Russian President Vladimir Putin shows no interest in meaningful negotiations and continues to delay ending Russia's war in Ukraine, Reuters reported.

Russia launched nine Iskander-M ballistic missiles from Rostov and Kursk oblasts overnight, along with 62 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones, according to Ukraine's Air Force. 

The claim contradicts Moscow's actual negotiating stance, as Russia continues to reject any compromise and insists on its maximalist demands.

Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, reported that multiple fires had broken out at "several locations on the left bank of the city."

Lithuanian Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene said a large group of "smuggling balloons" was launched from Belarus toward Lithuania.

The attack marks the second time in recent days that Ukrainian drones have struck an electrical substation in the region.

Tapping Russia's frozen central-bank assets would likely prolong the Ukraine conflict via further weapon supplies rather than help rebuild the country, according to Belgian Defense Minister Theo Francken. EU leaders have thus far failed to agree on how to use the funds.

The comment came shortly after Belgium Prime Minister Bart De Wever opposed the so-called “reparations loan” scheme under which the EU was planning to raise around €140 billion ($160 billion) to fund Ukraine using Russia's assets as collateral. The plan entails Moscow eventually paying reparations to Ukraine as part of a peace settlement. 

“Of course, this money will not rebuild Ukraine but will continue the war,” Francken said in a post on X on Friday, adding that war is extremely costly. 

The minister warned that many EU leaders, led by the bloc's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, “want to give these assets to Ukraine through a legally questionable structure.” He emphasized that “even during the Second World War, such a dubious confiscation was never carried out.” 

Belgium, where most of the immobilized assets – estimated at around $300 billion – are housed at the clearinghouse Euroclear, has voiced concern over the risks the plan entails. De Wever has set three conditions for backing the loan, one of which is that the potential risks be shared, warning that otherwise he would “do everything” to stop the confiscation. 

Francken reiterated that the EU proposal undermines trust in institutions such as Euroclear. He also warned that Russia could retaliate by seizing €200 billion ($172 billion) in Western assets, including both movable and immovable property, held in Russia by Belgium and countries such as the US, Germany, and France. The minister stressed that while the confiscation plan had been shelved for now, it could resurface in future discussions.

Moscow has repeatedly said it would regard any use of its frozen assets as theft. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that channeling Russian funds to Ukraine would “boomerang,” adding that “if someone wants to steal our property, our assets, and illegally appropriate them, they will be subjected to legal prosecution one way or another.”

Guidance from health and human services secretary contradicts decades of dietary recommendations

Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health and human services secretary, is planning to issue guidance encouraging Americans to eat more saturated fats, contradicting decades of dietary recommendations and alarming experts.

“My response and sort of counsel to myself was to stay calm, and let's see what happens, because there was no indication given as to how, why, when this potential shift would occur,” said Cheryl Anderson, an American Heart Association board member and professor at the University of California, San Diego's school of public health and human longevity science.

“The recommendation around saturated fat has been one of the most consistent recommendations since the first edition of the dietary guidelines.”

While Ronald Krauss, a professor of pediatrics and medicine at the University of California, San Francisco who has researched saturated fats extensively, found that saturated fats may be less harmful than previously thought, he believes if “[Kennedy] is actually going to go out and say, we should be eating more saturated fat, I think that's really the wrong message”.

Kennedy has indicated that new dietary guidelines will “stress the need to eat saturated fats of dairy, of good meat, of fresh meat and vegetables … when we release those, it will give everybody the rationale for driving it into our schools”, according to recent reporting in the Hill.

Krauss's research shows that “saturated fat is relatively neutral” compared with what scientists have believed in the past.

His studies have shown that reducing saturated fat intake is only beneficial if you replace it with the right things. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats, like olive oil and “polyunsaturated fats from other plant sources can really improve metabolic health and reduce heart disease risk, but that's not saying that saturated fat is necessarily harmful”. His research also found that replacing saturated fats with sugars and carbohydrates can actually increase heart disease risk.

Krauss said that guidelines that create a particular cutoff point for saturated fats, like the current guideline of 10%, tend to be arbitrary.

But, Anderson explained, “if you don't focus so much on where the line might be drawn around how much saturated fat, what you can see is that the more saturated fat that's consumed in the population, the higher the risk for elevated cholesterol, the more people develop cardiovascular disease”.

While Anderson agrees with Krauss that what people choose to eat instead of saturated fats matters, she does not agree that saturated fat is itself “neutral”.

“When you look at the current American diet, there's too much saturated fat in it, and so, currently, it's not having a neutral impact on our population,” she said.

Still, Anderson and Krauss agree that nutritional guidelines should move away from focusing on specific nutrients like saturated fats.

“People don't eat nutrients. They eat foods,” Anderson explained. “When you ask someone what they had to eat, they don't tell you: ‘I had fat, or I had carbohydrates, or I had protein.'

Focusing on foods rather than nutrients is not only less confusing for the public, it's also more scientifically sound, Krauss says. For example, there is plenty of evidence that meat intake, especially processed red meats, is associated with elevated heart disease risk.

“Now the question is, is that due to saturated fat, or is it due to other properties of these meats? And we really don't have the answer to that,” Krauss said.

Nutrition science is complex to tease out, in part because of ethical and practical issues with conducting clinical trials.

“One couldn't really justify to any institutional review board asking people to consume high levels of foods containing high levels of saturated fat for 20 years to determine whether that has an impact on heart disease,” Krauss said. Because of this, nutrition researchers must tease out years of observational data, which can be more difficult to interpret.

Typically, Anderson said, nutritional guidelines are years in the making. It's not normal for the HHS secretary to change them overnight. Every five years, the dietary guidelines advisory committee publishes the Dietary Guidelines for Americans report based on rigorous review of the latest research. The latest version of that report has yet to be released, but “would have been expected to produce guidance for 2025 through 2030”, Anderson said, adding that the current administration does not appear to be following the usual protocol.

Krauss said it appears that report is “being overruled, in a sense” and he's not sure what Kennedy's recommendation will end up looking like. He noted it could have a direct effect on the nutritional makeup of school lunches and military rations, specifically if saturated fat levels in those meals go up to 18% or 19%.

According to the United States Department of Agriculture and the National Institutes of Health, the recommended percentage allowed in both school lunches and military rations are currently less than or equal to 10% of total calories from saturated fat.

“That could certainly have an adverse effect on the population's cholesterol levels, and that would be predicted to impact heart disease risk,” he explained.

Krauss continued: “The guy is looking at evidence in a very cherrypicking kind of ways. There's certain things that he says that sort of fit what I would consider responsible recommendations regarding processed foods, etc, but then it's mixed up with this other thing, which makes it sound like the whole recommendation is evidence based, but it's just not true.”

DONETSK, October 25. /TASS/. The Ukrainian army's defense in the southern and southeastern parts of Krasnoarmeysk in the Donetsk region collapsed, a source in Russian defense circles told TASS.

"The enemy's defense in the south and southeast of the city has collapsed," the defense source said.

Russian troops are expanding a bridgehead in that frontline area, he added.

Critics of the Democratic nominee for NYC mayor have called him everything from ‘jihadist candidate' to ‘terrorist sympathizer'

On Thursday morning, hours after a combative final New York mayoral debate that failed to move the needle in his favor, Andrew Cuomo's attacks on progressive Democratic rival Zohran Mamdani resumed a familiar, racially charged theme.

“God forbid, another 9/11, can you imagine Mamdani in the seat?” the independent candidate and former governor told conservative radio talkshow host Sid Rosenberg, referring to the 2001 terrorist attacks on New York City by Islamic extremists.

“He'd be cheering,” Rosenberg replied, prompting Cuomo, who has previously referred to Mamdani as “a terrorist sympathizer”, to laugh and announce: “That's another problem”.

Mamdani, who will become the city's first Muslim mayor if he wins next month's election, condemned the comment as “disgusting” and “racist” in an appearance on New York's Pix11 News. “This is Andrew Cuomo's final moments in public life and he's choosing to spend them making racist attacks,” he said.

If Mamdani sounded weary, it was because the affront by Cuomo, who decided to run as an independent after being crushed in the Democratic primary in June, was merely the latest in a succession of personal insults and bigotry from a multitude of directions. Even later on Thursday, current New York City mayor Eric Adams called Mamdani “the communist” and said his own endorsement of Cuomo was motivated by seeking to fight Islamic extremism and people who were “burning churches”.

Since winning the nomination, the upstart Mamdani has been assailed by his opponent and a variety of political figures, wealthy donors and others up to Donald Trump, who lamented the prospect of “a communist as the mayor of New York” and promised to use the power of the White House to obstruct him.

Trump loyalist Elise Stefanik, the Republican New York congresswoman reportedly chasing the nomination for state governor, condemned Mamdani as “a jihadist candidate for mayor” in an incendiary tweet.

Meanwhile, hundreds of New York rabbis, riled by Mamdani's criticism of Israel and support for Palestinian independence,said he was a threat to “the safety and dignity of Jews” in an open letter signed this week.

And in June, Mamdani criticized Cuomo's political action committee (PAC) for “blatant Islamophobia” after it created a mailer accusing him of antisemitism and containing an image of the Democrat's face that appeared manipulated to give him a darker, longer and bushier beard.

On Wednesday night, during the debate, Cuomo's team posted to X then swiftly deleted a racist artificial intelligence-generated ad titled “Criminals for Zohran Mamdani” that featured the popular democratic socialist state assemblyman eating rice with his hands before being supported by a Black man shoplifting while wearing a keffiyeh, a man abusing a woman, a sex trafficker and a drug dealer.

Bill de Blasio, the Democratic former New York mayor, condemned the move in his own X post. “This is disqualifying. No candidate who approves a racist, disgusting ad like this can be allowed to govern. Bye, @andrewcuomo.”

Observers of New York electoral races say they have never seen a campaign with this level of personal vitriol, but credit Mamdani – a naturalized US citizen who was born in Uganda – with maturity defying his status as a relative political novice.

“The way that he has handled the attacks is really impressive,” said Laura Tamman, clinical assistant professor of political science at New York's Pace University.

“Consider if Brad Lander [a progressive Democrat who is New York City comptroller] had become the Democratic nominee, who has many of the same ideological positions that Mamdani has, he would not be facing the same barrage of attacks.

“So it's pretty clear there's some anti-Muslim and some racial bias that's affecting the coverage, and in those circumstances, I think him responding with smiles and grace is really impressive.”

One of the main lines of attack during the debates by Cuomo, and the Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, is that Mamdani lacks the necessary political experience to lead a city of 8.5 million people, but Tamman said that can work to his advantage.

“He became the Democratic nominee through widespread grassroots support, so his lack of experience is useful in this way because having not come up through the political system he also doesn't owe a bunch of people favors,” she said.

“That means he's really able to stay true to his values and feel confident in what he's saying because he actually believes it.”

Conversely, Tamman said, Cuomo's reliance on attack-ads could backfire. Mamdani's team has been critical of what they see as “desperate” efforts by Cuomo to undermine or misrepresent the Democrat's positions, including an attempt last week to tie him to anti-LGBTQ+ themes and a Brooklyn imam who opposes homosexuality.

Cuomo, Tamman said, was “not reading the moment”.

She said: “It doesn't seem like he thinks he should have to campaign. He seems to want to run the same kind of campaign that he ran for a gubernatorial re-election in 2018 which is: ‘I'm going to sit back and let my consultants create some TV ads, and I am willing to throw my hat in the ring for a lesser position than what I have previously been elected to.'

“And voters are not feeling grateful for him being willing to step in. They have someone else they're really excited about.”

Mamdani, in his television interview Thursday, said Cuomo's focus on ethnicity was wearing thin. “All Muslim New Yorkers want is to feel a sense of equality and respect that every New Yorker deserves, and even that is being denied by the former governor,” he said.

Parallel to the political attacks has been a concerted endeavor by wealthy donors and supporters of Cuomo to direct their considerable resources against him. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who has previously supported Democrats but backed Trump in the 2024 presidential election, donated $1m this month to the Defend NYC Pac after donating another half-million dollars to another pro-Cuomo group in June, Politico reported.

Other prominent billionaire donors in opposition to Mamdani include former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg; businessman Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress; and John B Hess, head of the Hess Corporation.

At a 13 October rally in Washington Heights, Mamdani acknowledged their intervention, and said he saw it as a compliment.

“Billionaires like Bill Ackman and Ronald Lauder have poured millions of dollars into this race because they say that we pose an existential threat. I am here to admit something: they are right,” he said.

Russia and Ukraine, with U.S. mediation, are close to reaching a diplomatic settlement to end Moscow's war, Kirill Dmitriev, Russia's senior economic negotiator, claimed on Oct. 24. 

The claim contradicts Moscow's actual negotiating stance, as Russia continues to reject any compromise and insists on its maximalist demands, including Ukraine's surrender of the entire Donetsk Oblast as a precondition for peace.

"I believe Russia and the U.S. and Ukraine are actually quite close to a diplomatic solution (to Moscow's war)," Dmitriev told CNN, offering no details about potential terms.

Dmitriev arrived in the U.S. just days after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed his first sanctions on Russia, citing Moscow's lack of progress in ending its war against Ukraine.

Russia's rigid negotiating position led to the cancellation of Russian President Vladimir Putin's planned summit with Trump in Budapest, with Trump saying he did not want "a wasted meeting."

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov reiterated on Oct. 20 that Russia's stance on ending hostilities along the current front lines, which Washington and Ukraine support, "has not changed."

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Oct. 21 that Moscow would not end hostilities without a "comprehensive peace agreement," arguing that halting the war now would mean "forgetting the root causes of this conflict."

Dmitriev's claim also comes as Russia intensifies attacks on Ukraine, killing civilians and destroying infrastructure daily. Overnight on Oct. 25, Russia launched a ballistic missile barrage against Kyiv, killing at least two people and injuring 12.

President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier said Russia's attacks on civilian energy infrastructure are driving Ukraine "toward a humanitarian disaster." Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia aims to collapse the national power grid ahead of winter and the heating season.

Dmitriev, who heads Russia's Direct Investment Fund, has long been involved in the Kremlin's backchannel outreach to Washington. He visited the U.S. in April and joined talks in Alaska in August.

During his current trip, he is expected to meet Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff in Miami on Oct. 25 to discuss U.S.-Russia relations, according to Axios.

The plant is Russia's fourth-largest oil refinery and processed 13.1 million tons of oil last year, according to Russian estimates.



All mine workers were brought to the surface safely, and none were injured, Ukrainian energy company DTEK said.

The sanctions could be imposed if Russian President Vladimir Putin shows no interest in meaningful negotiations and continues to delay ending Russia's war in Ukraine, Reuters reported.

Russia launched nine Iskander-M ballistic missiles from Rostov and Kursk oblasts overnight, along with 62 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones, according to Ukraine's Air Force. 

The claim contradicts Moscow's actual negotiating stance, as Russia continues to reject any compromise and insists on its maximalist demands.

Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, reported that multiple fires had broken out at "several locations on the left bank of the city."

Lithuanian Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene said a large group of "smuggling balloons" was launched from Belarus toward Lithuania.

The attack marks the second time in recent days that Ukrainian drones have struck an electrical substation in the region.

By the end of 2024, Canadian direct investment abroad outpaced foreign direct investment in Canada by almost $1-trillion.Justin Tang/The Canadian Press

Laurence B. Mussio, PhD, is a senior business historian, co-founder and chair of the Long Run Institute, and fellow of the Royal Historical Society of the United Kingdom.

Amid growing calls for our pension funds to invest more at home, a hard truth must be faced: Canada has become a magnificent place to generate savings, but a difficult one to deploy them. Our capital and talent are conceived here, but perfected abroad.

Benjamin Graham once observed that while markets vote on sentiment in the short run, they weigh substance in the long run. Canada today faces its own weighing-machine moment on its substance – and the verdict is damning. As our federal debt spirals past $1.4-trillion and infrastructure crumbles, we confront a bitter irony: Canada is now one of the world's great capital exporters precisely when we need that capital most.

The Maple Eight Canadian pension funds hold more than $2.3-trillion in assets, but only 25 per cent are in Canada. This exodus is rational, not disloyal. Pension funds are duty-bound to seek the best global returns. With Canada representing less than 3 per cent of global market capitalization, our economy simply lacks the depth to absorb their vast portfolios. The problem isn't our investors; it's our failure to create compelling domestic opportunities.

Opinion: Waste, not the cost of labour, is at the root of our productivity problem

By the end of 2024, Canadian direct investment abroad outpaced foreign direct investment in Canada by nearly $1-trillion. That gap is widening fast: In 2024, our investment abroad grew more than twice as fast as foreign investment here. We are evolving into a sophisticated rentier nation – a country whose expertise is allocating global capital rather than creating domestic value. We manage wealth brilliantly; we create it poorly.

The velocity of this capital flight is breathtaking. In May, investors poured a record $14.2-billion into U.S. equities. That same month, foreign investors sold off $11.4-billion in Canadian shares, a massive monthly capital flight from our productive economy.

Ask why, and the answers are consistent. Scale constrains ambition. While Canada creates startups, we fail to grow them. According to the APEXE Nations Report, from 2021 to 2023 we produced 0.81 high-value “unicorn” firms per million people – a fraction of Israel's 5.6 and less than half the U.S. rate. This “scale-up gap” is driven by a lack of domestic growth capital, leading to the premature sale of our most promising firms to foreign buyers.

Worse, a web of regulatory uncertainty actively deters investment. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ranks Canada's framework for foreign investment as the most restrictive in the Group of Seven countries, with a discretionary screening process that creates a wall of uncertainty for global investors who prize predictability above all else.

In a refreshingly frank assessment, Bank of Montreal chief executive officer Darryl White recently explained why international capital remains on the sidelines. He described global investors who are interested but unwilling to commit: “At the end of the day, capital's not that sophisticated. It'll flow to the point of least resistance.”

The consequence of this capital starvation is a deep and persistent productivity gap. Since the mid-1990s, American labour productivity has grown at roughly twice the Canadian rate.

This crisis extends to human capital. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, a record 29,186 Canadians permanently emigrated. The University of Waterloo's elite software engineering program exemplifies this exodus: In recent years, more than 70 per cent of its graduates have left for the United States, chasing compensation packages often more than double what Canada offers.

We export the capital and the talent that could close our productivity gap. This dynamic risks reinforcing our transformation from a country that creates new wealth to one that primarily manages existing wealth.

History offers a stark warning. Both the Dutch Republic and Great Britain saw their economies shift from dominating global industry to dominating global finance, transforming from dynamic workshops into passive counting houses as their domestic productive engines atrophied. Canada risks completing this same transformation at digital speed.

Opinion: We need to worry more about Canada's economic growth

The solution is not to build walls, but to open doors. A crucial first step is to dismantle our own barriers by reforming our uniquely restrictive foreign investment review process to prioritize speed and predictability. Concurrently, we must create the large-scale domestic opportunities our capital pools can absorb by developing investable, user-pay infrastructure frameworks.

We must also tackle the scale-up gap with policies that foster a domestic venture-capital ecosystem and address the brain drain by ensuring our tax system rewards, not repels, our most productive citizens. Capital will not return out of sentiment. It will return only when the complete domestic ecosystem – of regulation, opportunity and reward – makes staying home the most compelling choice of all.

History's weighing machine is taking our measure. The $2-trillion question is whether we have the courage to tip the scales – to transform from a nation that exports its capital into one that earns it. Change demands the political will to create a competitive domestic environment that capital – ours and the world's – will choose over exile.

            Improvise and innovate have become the watchwords for both the Russian and Ukrainian militaries as they try to outwit each other on the ground, at sea and in the air.
    


            Several recent developments illustrate this constant evolution of tactics and weaponry: a new Russian jet-powered bomb, the Ukrainian use of light planes as long-range ‘suicide bombs,' and a fresh generation of maritime drones.
    


            Both countries are exploiting AI, robotics and unmanned systems at a high tempo.
    


            But some innovations are remarkably low-tech.
    


            As night fell on one Ukrainian airfield earlier this month, a small group of men assembled a pilot-less light plane for a 2,000-kilometer (1,243-mile) mission deep into Russia. Its target was in the Russian industrial city of Dzerzhinsk, about 230 miles east of Moscow.
    


            Strapped to its undercarriage was a very basic bomb.
    


            Hours after the single-engined plane took off into the night sky, a large fire was reported at an explosives factory in Dzerzhinsk that makes shells for the Russian military.
    


            The program was created by an aviation enthusiast with the call-sign Goronych and converts single-seater planes into rudimentary but effective long-range missiles. Instead of a pilot's seat, there is an additional fuel tank and batteries that power navigation and communication systems, according to a report by the Ukrainian outlet Babel that CNN has confirmed.
    


            Goronych and his group are now integrated into the 14th regiment of Ukraine's special operations forces, who spoke with CNN about their work. On Wednesday, according to the Ukrainian military, they were involved in an attack on a mechanical plant in the Russian city of Saransk – nearly 800 kilometers (497 miles) from the Ukrainian border – where detonators and mines are manufactured.
    


As US gets tough on Moscow, has Putin's strategy of playing Trump run its course?



            The Goronych project represents one of dozens of adaptations made by both sides as the conflict has worn on – especially using light aircraft and drones.
    


            In September, the Ukrainian military's chief of staff, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said light aircraft mounted with machine guns were proving effective in intercepting Russian drones and the military would consider buying more.
    


            The Russians recently began deploying small planes equipped with machine guns in occupied territory to take down Ukrainian drones on their way to targets in Russia.
    


            Their mistake was profiling them on television.
    


            The Ukrainian Security Service established where the planes were based and said on Tuesday that it had “neutralized two small aircraft that the occupiers stationed at airfields and used to shoot down Ukrainian long-range drones.”
    


            Not all innovations are as basic.
    


            In recent weeks, Russia has begun deploying a new jet-powered guided bomb, adapted from its huge stocks of old “free-fall” bombs, according to Ukrainian Defense Intelligence (DI).
    


            “The range and combat radius of such bombs will be approximately 200 kilometers (124 miles),” said the deputy head of DI, Vadym Skybitski, in a statement.
    


Ukraine could get 150 advanced Swedish fighter jets under just-signed deal



            The Russians had already been converting Soviet-era bombs into glide munitions with a range of some 80 kilometers (50 miles), allowing aircraft to fire them while staying well clear of Ukrainian air defenses. On just one day last week, nearly 300 such bombs were fired against Ukraine. The daily average is just over 100, according to the Ukrainian General Staff.
    


            The new longer-range variant – dubbed the UMPB-5 – has already been used in strikes against Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine in recent days. A Russian aviation blogger posted on Monday that the weapon was “already being used against the Ukrainians… Now they will put it into production and things will really heat up.”
    


            The Ukrainians have pioneered the development of maritime drones, which have been especially effective against Russia's Black Sea fleet. This week, the Security Service (SBU) unveiled the latest generation.
    


            One of them was used in an attack on the bridge linking Russia and occupied Crimea in June, the SBU said. The updated models are capable of traveling more than 1,500 kilometers (932 miles), and can carry up to 2,000 kilograms (4,409lbs) of explosives. They can also carry a multiple rocket launcher system.
    


Trump's sanctions target Russian ‘war ATM,' but the real test is enforcement



            In the early days of the conflict, the Ukrainian military was much more agile than Russian forces in terms of adapting tactics and equipment. But over time, said defense analyst Dara Massicot, “Russian units grafted protective armor onto vehicles, learned new styles of camouflage, and adopted small-unit assault tactics, among many other adaptations.”
    


            The Russian Defense Ministry also set up an elite drone unit called Rubikon, “which experiments with different types of tactics that now inform how other UAV units are instructed,” Massicot wrote in Foreign Affairs.



            For all its innovation and a surge in domestic production of drones and missiles, Ukraine still needs a constant pipeline of weapons from its allies. Russian barrages of missiles and drones – often several hundred in one night – have again underlined its shortfall in air defenses.
    


            Zelensky renewed calls for Western-made defenses in the wake of a deadly attack overnight on Friday into Saturday, which killed two in capital Kyiv. Ukraine is “paying special attention to the Patriot systems, so that we can protect our cities from this horror,” he said.
    


            Russia is moving toward producing more than 6,000 Shahed-type drones each month, Ukraine's Defense Intelligence told CNN in September.
    


            That's just one reason why Ukraine wants longer-range missiles – to take the war to targets such as drone factories deep inside Russia. But US President Donald Trump says that, for now, providing Tomahawk cruise missiles is off the table.
    


            Kyiv is now pinning its hopes on Europe to beef up its capabilities. “Everyone who is now helping Ukraine with air defense systems and (the) missiles for them is protecting lives,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday.
    


            “And everyone who helps Ukraine with long-range capabilities will bring the end of the war closer,” he added.
    


            Zelensky said he anticipated “a good and, in many ways, completely new agreement on our defense capabilities” in meetings with European allies this week.
    


            But, with most weapons production pipelines measured over years rather than months, rapid improvisation has an important role on the battlefield.

NOVI SAD, Serbia — Paris Olympic champion Akari Fujinami struck gold in her first major tournament since moving up to the next Olympic weight class of 57 kilograms, cruising to victory at wrestling's U23 World Championships on Friday in Novi Sad, Serbia.

The 21-year-old Fujinami overwhelmed Aryna Artinova, a Belarussian competing under the United World Wrestling banner, in the final as she won all four of her matches by 10-0 technical superiority, and all within the first period.

“It was my first tournament in a while, so it was a relief, and it reminded me how much fun matches are,” Fujinami said.

The victory in her first international tournament in 14 months extended Fujinami's current win streak to 145 matches, dating back to a loss in junior high school in June 2017.

Fujinami, a two-time senior world champion, won the gold at the Paris Olympics in the 53-kg division. After an extended hiatus from the sport, she announced she would move up to 57 kgs — bypassing the non-Olympic weight of 55 kgs — in preparation for an Olympic repeat at the 2028 Los Angeles Games.

She opted to skip this year's senior worlds as she continued to make the physical adjustment to the heavier weight class and work on improving her techniques, making her “global debut” at 57-kg at the world U23, a tournament she had previously missed due to injury.

“This is the start,” Fujinami said. “From now, I'll enter a bunch of competitions.”

In addition to aiming for Los Angeles, Fujinami, a native of Mie Prefecture, has her sights set on winning a gold at the neighboring Aichi-Nagoya Asian Games in October next year.

ASTANA, October 25. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated his Kazakh counterpart Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on Republic Day and expressed confidence that Moscow and Astana will continue developing strategic partnership and allied relations.

"I am confident that we will keep comprehensively developing strategic partnership and allied relations between Moscow and Astana by joint efforts. Your upcoming state visit to the Russian Federation will, undoubtedly, contribute to this," Putin said in a congratulatory message posted by the Russian embassy in Kazakhstan on its Telegram channel.

Russia-Kazakhstan relations are at a high level, the Russian leader stressed.

"Our states successfully interact in various spheres," Putin said, highlighting effective cooperation within the CIS, the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and other structures.

Russia and Kazakhstan "confidently move along the path of social-economic development and consistently strengthen their positions on the international scene," the Russian leader said. "I wish you, respected Kassym-Jomart Kemelevich, good health and successes, and all citizens of Kazakhstan well-being and prosperity," Putin said.

On October 25, Kazakhstan is celebrating 35 years of the adoption of its sovereignty declaration.

            The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford, billed by the US Navy as “the most capable, adaptable, and lethal combat platform in the world,” is being sent to the Caribbean as the Trump administration ramps up military pressure on Venezuela over alleged drug trafficking.
    


            Here's a look at the Ford and the military assets it will bring to US operations in the region.
    


            With a displacement of more than 100,000 tons and a length of 1,100 feet (334 meters), the Ford is the largest warship the US has ever put to sea.
    


            Commissioned in 2017, it's the first of its class, the successor to the Navy's 10 Nimitz-class carriers, the oldest of which will be retired next year.
    


            It carries a crew of almost 4,600, including its air wing. That's about 20% less personnel than the Nimitz class, which the Navy says is possible because of more efficient systems on the Ford.
    


            Those efficiencies are what make the Ford the most advanced carrier in the world and result from its two nuclear reactors, whose exact specs are classified but that put out three times the electrical power of those on the Nimitz-class ships, according to the Navy.
    


            That extra power enables the Ford to operate the electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS). Using magnets instead of steam to power the ship's catapults gives the Ford the ability to launch aircraft faster and with heavier weapons and more fuel, increasing the range and lethality of its fighter jets.
    


            The same science applies to its 11 Advanced Weapons Elevators, which use electromagnetic motors rather than hydraulics, meaning it can move munitions more quickly from magazines to the flight deck and loaded onto aircraft.
    


            The ship also boasts the Navy's Advanced Arresting Gear, the system which essentially grabs the tailhook of aircraft with wires when they touch down on its flight deck. The Navy says the digitally controlled system allows for increased sortie rates and lower energy consumption.
    


            The Ford's flight deck is about four feet wider than the Nimitz class, and its “island” – the portion of the ship rising above the flight deck – is smaller and set farther back, giving more space for easier handling of aircraft movements.
    


            The sharp teeth of the Ford are the F/A-18 fighter jets in carries.
    


            The twin-engine Boeing aircraft can carry a range of air-to-air, air-to-ground and anti-ship missiles as well as laser-guided bombs. They have a maximum combat range of 1,250 miles (2,011 kilometers), according to the Navy.
    


            The Ford also carries electronic-jamming aircraft, airborne early warning and control planes, cargo and passenger planes and helicopters.
    


            But the Ford doesn't carry the Navy's newest stealth fighter jet, the F-35C. Modifications needed to support the fifth-generation aircraft are not expected to be made until a yet-to-be-determined future maintenance period.
    


            Getting the Ford into fighting shape was a struggle for the Navy. Though it was commissioned in 2017, it didn't make its first deployment until 2022 as the service struggled to work out kinks in its advanced systems.
    


            The ship made its first combat deployment in 2023, an eight-month cruise that saw it spend time in the eastern Mediterranean after the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel.

TORONTO (AP) — Shohei Ohtani followed his two-way show for the ages with a homer in the Dodgers' World Series opener, but he also grounded out with the bases loaded in Los Angeles' 11-4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays on Friday night.

Trailing 11-2 in the seventh inning, Ohtani hit a soaring two-run shot to right field off Braydon Fisher. It was his fourth homer in two games after connecting three times and striking out 10 as a pitcher in LA's Game 4 win to clinch their NL Championship Series.

Ohtani's homer Friday didn't do much for Los Angeles' chances after a flop by the Dodgers' pitchers. Starter Blake Snell was knocked out of the game before getting an out in the sixth inning, and Toronto then pummeled the bullpen during a nine-run sixth highlighted by Addison Barger's pinch-hit grand slam and Alejandro Kirk's two-run homer.

Ohtani also missed an earlier chance to impact the game with his two-out, bases-loaded groundout in the second inning. Los Angeles led 1-0 at that point.

Blue Jay fans booed Ohtani loudly during pregame introductions. Before signing a $700 million, 10-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, the two-way star met with Blue Jays officials on Dec. 4, 2023, at the team's spring training complex in Dunedin, Florida. Toronto manager John Schneider joked Thursday that he wanted Ohtani to return a Blue Jays hat and a jacket for his dog, Decoy, that he took after that meeting.

Fans chanted “We don't need you!” at Ohtani while he batted in the ninth inning. He walked in that at-bat, then was nearly picked off a moment later by left-hander Eric Lauer with two outs. Ohtani was ruled safe after a video review.

“Don't poke the bear,” Blue Jays pitcher Chris Bassitt warned about the Ohtani chants.

Ohtani helped lead the Dodgers to last year's title, hitting .310 with 54 homers, 130 RBIs and 59 stolen bases.

Back to pitching in a limited role this season as he returned from elbow surgery, he batted .282 with 55 homers, 102 RBIs and 20 steals while going 1-1 with a 2.87 ERA in 14 starts, striking out 62 in 47 innings. He's expected to start Game 3 or 4 on the mound.

Toronto Blue Jays' Addison Barger watches his grand slam home run take flight during the sixth inning.David J. Phillip/The Associated Press

In Friday's first game of the World Series, the Los Angeles Dodgers had a clear approach to the game – they would Dodgers their way through it. 

Their ace, Blake Snell, came out looking like he'd gotten a ransom phone call five minutes before taking the field. Snell can sometimes be a little erratic. On Friday, he couldn't locate the plate with binoculars. But no problem, his team seemed to say. He'll Dodgers it. 

Toronto loaded the bases in the first. No problem. He'll Dodgers it.

Snell gave up a single against the wall in the fourth, and then a home run – his first since August. No problem. He'll Dodgers it. 

Snell was back out in the sixth, nearing 100 pitches and looking like he could lie down on the mound and fall straight to sleep. Being allowed to face Alejandro Kirk (the to-the-wall single guy) after walking Bo Bichette was one thing. Being allowed to stay in against Daulton Varsho (the home-run guy) after putting Kirk on was another. 

Nine pitches into his at-bat with Varsho, Snell hit the Jays centre fielder. The likeliest explanation was some combination of exhaustion and frustration.

The eventual result – an L.A. bullpen Three Mile Island, an Addison Barger grand slam, a nine-run inning and an 11-4 Toronto victory. 

World Series Game 1: As it happened

The rest of baseball can stop rushing to find their outfit for the California coronation. We have a World Series to play in the interim. 

If any Toronto manager had stuck with a starter the way L.A. stuck with Snell, Jays fans would currently be in a Home Hardware looking for a couple of planks and a bucket of nails. 

But the Dodgers can do this, because they're the Dodgers. That's their greatest strength, and their only weakness. They're one game down and they think they're two games up. 

There was a moment in the second inning that spoke to this idea. The Dodgers had loaded the bases on Jays rookie Trey Yesavage. Shohei Ohtani was at-bat. Big, big moment. I don't care who you root for, or even if you like baseball. 

Cameras panned to the L.A. dugout. Manager Dave Roberts and conflicted Canadian Freddie Freeman were standing at the top of the steps, chatting, laughing, having a good old natter. A key sequence in the game, and the two of them looked like they were waiting for a bus. 

It's good to be loose. The Dodgers hit this World Series like they were macrodosing muscle relaxants. 

By the time Alejandro Kirk came back to the plate in the sixth and hit a two-run homer, the Dodgers didn't look relaxed any more. That's the only downside to the size of the Jays' Game 1 victory. It may have slapped the Dodgers awake.

Everything Toronto changed to start the World Series worked. Bo Bichette looked great at second base and at the plate. Yesavage was solid. The offence remains in a Grand Canyon-sized groove. 

If you had to describe the opener in baseball terms, you would call it Ernie Banksian. It felt like two games worth of action. Now for the psychology. 

Though this is the first post-season Game 1 they've dropped in two years, the Dodgers will still think they are winning this series. They may be considering cancelling the golf round they booked in Scotland next weekend, but they will believe this has only just begun. Toronto must allow them to think that. Encourage them in it. 

That work falls to the rest of the baseball – to all the American-based pundits and number crunchers who will tell you that L.A. has too much pitching to lose the World Series. One aberrant Snell start doesn't change that. 

The stats-oriented nature of baseball does not allow for the most crucial factor in any game – luck. 

The story behind the Blue Jays' bedazzled home run jacket

Throughout this run, the Jays have been so lucky they've made it seem like a skill. Whenever they've needed a hit, or a big out, or a burst to demoralize the opponent, they've gotten it. Even their losses have been well placed. At no point have they actually felt like losing. Not because they were in control, but because they were lucky. 

On Friday, Toronto's luck ran out. You could feel that in the early going, and so could the crowd. It happened around the time Ernie Clement tried to turn a bad L.A. throw to first from one extra base into two and got caught at third. 

Against New York or Seattle, that works. But not early on Friday. 

Clement couldn't believe it. After being tagged out, he looked up at the third-base coach and said, ‘Yeah?' like he was talking to the arbitrating authority. 

Right then, Toronto had passed its luck to the other side. Then L.A. passed it back. 

If someone had told you before the game that Ohtani was going to crush a seventh-inning home run and that it wouldn't matter, what would you say? You'd say, ‘Lucky.'

The Jays' first Mission Impossible was beating the Dodgers in the opener. It was a non-negotiable necessity. Toronto can now afford to lose Game 2, but I wouldn't advise it.

The Dodgers are also creatures of luck. Why else do you think they stuck with Snell when his own mother would have pulled him? It was 2-2 at the time and still too early for the Dodger luck to have appeared. Why not tempt it into arriving? Show Toronto that fate has a new boyfriend, and he lives in Hermosa Beach. 

That didn't work, and the Blue Jays killed them for it. We'll try it again on Saturday night. 

Somebody's going to win this series and when they do it won't be because they attacked left-handed pitching. It will be one of two things – because things just broke their way a few crucial times; or because they trusted luck, and luck didn't trust them back.

The potential unification of Ireland would be a major blow to the West's security as it could allow Russia and China to expand their reach in the North Atlantic, a former NATO commander has warned.

Speaking at a briefing for members of Parliament and the House of Lords on Wednesday, retired British Rear Admiral Chris Parry argued that if the UK were to lose its foothold in Northern Ireland, it would present a major opportunity for Moscow and Beijing.

He noted that the waters between Northern Ireland and Scotland are essential for Britain's nuclear-armed submarines, describing it as “critical to our strategic deterrent.” 

“With a united Ireland, there is no guarantee we could deploy our ballistic missiles,” Parry said.

He also suggested that Irish unification would enable NATO adversaries to threaten critical undersea cables.

“The UK needs to calibrate the threat to itself of a supine Republic of Ireland. My view is that the best way to help Ireland now is to increase NATO and Allied activity in Ireland's economic zone waters,” he said.

Parry even suggested that NATO should hold exercises in Irish-controlled waters “whether Dublin agreed or not,” saying the bloc must be prepared to “fish in Irish waters for our potential opponents.” He added that the republic should move toward closer military cooperation with NATO and renounce neutrality.

“If anyone attacks Britain, they will attack Ireland… Neutrality cannot be seen as conscientious objection any more. If you are part of the free world, you have to be prepared to defend it. The Republic needs to reduce its vulnerabilities,” he stated.

Moscow has dismissed claims that it plans to attack NATO as “nonsense.”

Ireland has been militarily neutral since gaining independence in 1921, and is not a NATO member but cooperates with the bloc.

The idea of Irish reunification – merging the Republic of Ireland with Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK – is permitted under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. The accord ended a three-decade standoff between Irish nationalists and pro-British unionists by establishing a power-sharing government in Belfast and confirming that Northern Ireland's status can only be changed if a majority there votes for it.

WASHINGTON, October 25. /TASS/. Washington has imposed sanctions on Colombian President Gustavo Petro for political reasons, American lawyer and human rights activist Dan Kovalik, who will represent Petro's interests in the US, told TASS.

"We believe that this designation is totally without merit. This is being done for political reasons," he pointed out. "What are those reasons? I think the two things that upset President Trump are that President Petro is one of the most outspoken advocates for the Palestinian cause in the world right now. And given that Trump is supporting the genocide against the Palestinians, that upsets him," Kovalik noted, referring largely to Israel's military operations in the Gaza Strip.

"The second thing is that Petro is unwilling to help in any intervention in Venezuela. He's made that clear," the lawyer went on to say, adding: "So in response, they've put him on this sanctions list."

"We're obviously exploring our options, but we're going to take all measures, legal measures to challenge this," Kovalik concluded.

On Friday, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury announced that Washington had decided to impose sanctions on Petro, his wife and son. Colombian Interior Minister Armando Benedetti was blacklisted.

NEW YORK, October 25. /TASS/. Moscow hopes that a peaceful solution to the Ukraine conflict can be achieved in a reasonable timeframe, Kirill Dmitriev, Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) CEO and special presidential envoy for economic cooperation with other countries, said.

"I think what's more important is that we move towards a diplomatic solution, really taking Russian interests into account, and not only thinking about a ceasefire, but also about the end solution to the conflict. The US, Ukraine, and Russia understand what the solution can be, and we hope that it's achieved in a reasonable timeframe," he pointed out in an interview with Fox News.

Fox News contributor Michael Pillsbury gives his thoughts on President Trump's high-stakes trip to Asia and the points of tension between China and the United States on 'America Reports.' 

President Donald Trump kicked off the week meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, and closed out the week jetsetting to Asia. And at home, the White House launched constructing its new ballroom — much to the ire of many Democrats. 

Trump said construction started Monday and that the project would be funded privately. The project is estimated to cost $300 million, up from the $200 million estimate first provided in July when the project was unveiled. 

"For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State Visits, etc. I am honored to be the first President to finally get this much-needed project underway — with zero cost to the American Taxpayer!" Trump said in a social media post. "The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly. This Ballroom will be happily used for Generations to come!"

US TO EXPEDITE NUCLEAR-POWERED SUBS TO AUSTRALIA THAT WILL SIT NEAR CHINA'S DOORSTEP

Still, the project has faced criticism as the White House's historic East Wing was completely demolished. The wing has served as the official entrance to the White House, and is designated as space for the first lady. 

On Monday, Trump signaled he wants to expedite outfitting Australia with nuclear submarines under the trilateral agreement between the U.S., Australia and the U.K. that seeks to enhance Australia's submarine force to deter Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific.

The agreement, known as AUKUS, stipulates the U.S. will sell up to five Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines to Australia that are scheduled for delivery as soon as 2032. The deal also outlines that Australia and the U.K. will work to build additional attack submarines for Australia's fleet.

However, Trump told reporters that he is looking at equipping Australia with the submarines soon, when asked if he was interested in speeding up the process.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES MEETING WITH XI JINPING AT SOUTH KOREA APEC SUMMIT SCHEDULED FOR NEXT MONTH

"Well we are doing that, yeah … we have them moving very, very quickly," Trump told reporters Monday.

However, Trump also said that he didn't believe the deal was necessary to undermine China.

"I don't think we're going to need it," Trump said about the trilateral agreement. "I think we'll be just fine with China. China doesn't want to do that. First of all, the United States is the strongest military power in the world by far. It's not even close, not even close. We have the best equipment. We have the best of everything, and nobody's going to mess with that. And I don't see that at all with President Xi."

President Donald Trump, center, shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping, as they gather for a group photo at the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, June 28, 2019. 

Meanwhile, Trump departed for Asia Friday, as he is slated to meet with Xi during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit.

The meeting comes amid ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries, which escalated when Beijing announced Oct. 9 it would impose export controls on rare-earth magnets. Rare earth magnets are used in products ranging from electric cars to F-35 fighter jets. 

As a result, Trump said the U.S. would impose a new 100% tariff on all Chinese goods, which is slated to take effect Nov. 1.

However, Trump has sought to neutralize tension, and has regularly spoken highly of his relationship with Xi in recent weeks. Additionally, he has said he believes a deal will be reached between the two countries.

TRUMP AND PUTIN'S RELATIONSHIP TURNS SOUR AS PRESIDENT PUSHES FOR RESOLUTION WITH UKRAINE

"I think we are going to come out very well and everyone's going to be very happy," Trump said Thursday.

Trump and Xi have not met in person since Trump took office in January. Their last meeting took place in June 2019 in Japan.

Trump will also visit Malaysia, Japan and South Korea as part of the trip.

Trump also met with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte Wednesday, just after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and after calling off a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Trump said that he didn't want a "wasted meeting" with Putin in Hungary, and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump didn't see enough progress toward peace from Russia.

"We canceled the meeting with President Putin," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office with Rutte Wednesday. "It just it didn't feel right to me. It didn't feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I canceled it. But we'll do it in the future."

New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani addressed his opponents' "Islamophobic rhetoric" on Friday, Oct. 24, 2025.

Vice President JD Vance criticized New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani on Saturday, writing on X that according to the Democrat, "the real victim of 9/11" was his aunt.

Vance made the remark as early voting began Saturday in New York City, where Mamdani, the frontrunner in the race, is trying to fend off challengers Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa.

"I want to speak to the memory of my aunt. Who stopped taking the subway after September 11th because she did not feel safe in her hijab," Mamdani said in a clip of a Friday campaign event that Vance shared.

"According to Zohran, the real victim of 9/11 was his auntie who got some (allegedly) bad looks," Vance said.

Mamdani also said Friday that, "I want to speak to the Muslim who works for our city, whether they teach in our schools or walk the beat for the NYPD, New Yorkers who all make daily sacrifices for the city they call home, only to see their leaders spit in their face."

"I want to speak to every child who grows up here marked as the other, who is randomly selected in a way that never quite feels random, who feels that they carry a stain that can never be cleaned. Growing up in the shadow of 9/11, I have known what it means to live with an undercurrent of suspicion in this city," Mamdani added.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the Mamdani campaign for reaction to Vance's comment.

Mamdani accused Cuomo this week of "Islamophobic rhetoric" after the former governor joined a radio show and its host speculated that Mamdani would be "cheering" if New York City faced another 9/11-style attack.

During an appearance on WABC's "Sid & Friends in the Morning" on Thursday, Cuomo questioned Mamdani's ability to lead the city through a crisis situation.

"Any given moment, there's a crisis, and people's lives are at stake. God forbid, there's another 9/11. Can you imagine Mamdani in the seat?" Cuomo asked host Sid Rosenberg.

"He'd be cheering," Rosenberg retorted.

"That's another problem," said Cuomo, before returning to his hypothetical question: "But could you imagine that?"

During a Mamdani campaign event in Manhattan later on Thursday, a reporter asked Mamdani if Cuomo's comments were Islamophobic.

"Yes, I believe that they were," Mamdani said, before adding, "We're speaking about a former governor who, in his final moments in public life, is engaging in rhetoric that is not only Islamophobic, not only racist, it's also disgusting."

            Georgia's internal security service said on Saturday that it had arrested three Chinese citizens in the capital Tbilisi, for attempting to illegally purchase two kilograms of “nuclear material” uranium, Georgia's Interpress news agency reported.
    


            Interpress cited the deputy head of Georgia's State Security Service as saying the three detainees had been planning to buy the uranium for $400,000 and transport it to China, via Russia. The uranium was “nuclear material,” it said, without elaborating on the motive for the planned purchase.
    


            It quoted the security official as saying that the detainees faced charges that could see them imprisoned for up to 10 years.
    


            The security of nuclear materials left over from the Soviet era was one of the biggest concerns after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, of which Georgia was a member. There have been several serious incidents involving the illicit trade in nuclear materials in Georgia over recent decades.
    


            In July, Georgia arrested one Georgian and one Turkish national, charged with the illegal purchase, possession and disposal of radioactive substances, which the national security service said could have been used to make a deadly bomb.

Paranormal investigator Zak Bagans and his team are back for a new season of their hit series.

Across the U.S., travelers are checking into spooky hotels that once held inmates, soldiers and even cult members.

As travelers crave experiences over ordinary stays, hotels that have transformed grim to glam are now embracing their bizarre and sometimes haunted histories, even hosting weddings and wellness retreats. 

Paranormal tours and repurposed spaces built on old bones draw everyone from ghost hunters to history buffs, The New York Times recently reported. Whether it's the "most haunted hotel in America" or a jail-turned-boutique stay in Boston, these locations offer a peek into the darker corners of American history.

MAN DISCOVERS 'GHOST TOWN' FULL OF EMPTY, EERIE HOTELS: 'LIKE A TIME CAPSULE'

The Algonquin Hotel in Manhattan's Times Square was once the meeting place of the famed Round Table — a daily gathering of sharp-tongued writers, critics and actors whose wit helped define New York's Jazz Age. 

Today, guests say the laughter hasn't faded entirely, with reports of footsteps, flickering lights and phantom chatter ringing through the halls. In 2015, a reporter spent a night at the Algonquin with ghost-hunting tools and claimed that eight spirits — possibly including Dorothy Parker — answered her call. Standard rooms can start at around $177.

Today, McMenamins Edgefield, which sits about 15 miles outside of Portland, boasts a winery, brewery, distillery, spa and golf course. But when it opened in 1917, it served as one of the nation's first detention centers for women accused of carrying sexually transmitted infections amid a wartime health panic, according to History.com.

HERE'S WHAT 'AMERICA'S MOST HAUNTED HOTEL' WILL COST YOU FOR A STAY

After closing in 1923, the site became a government-run "poor farm," later housing a military academy, medical staff and elderly residents before falling into disrepair. McMenamins revived the property in 1990 with a ceremonial pipe-and-drum "cleansing," and private rooms now range from $130 to $300.

Widely known as "America's most haunted hotel," guests and staff report encounters with spirits from its past, including a stonemason who died during construction and patients from the 1930s, when con man Norman Baker turned it into a fraudulent cancer hospital, examining cancer patients in the hotel's basement and draining families of their life savings, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

Today, the mountaintop hotel overlooking Eureka Springs offers ghost tours through its Victorian halls and former morgue, and the price of a room ranges from about $150 to $600.

Built in 1893, Milwaukee's Pfister Hotel has long been linked to flickering lights, strange noises and shadowy figures said to haunt its ornate halls. Some locals believe founder Charles Pfister still roams the property, according to reports, and even celebrities like rapper Megan Thee Stallion have gone ghost hunting there. Visiting Major League Baseball players in town to play the Brewers often share eerie stories and Los Angeles Dodgers star shortstop Mookie Betts has said he's too spooked to stay there, ESPN reported.

Rooms start at $149 and go up to $899.

The upstate hotel occupies the historic Richardson-Olmsted Campus and was originally built in the late 1800s as the Buffalo State Asylum for the Insane. The site became overcrowded and used controversial treatments such as electroshock and insulin coma therapy, according to local reports, and since its abandonment, many visitors report paranormal activity in the former ward buildings. 

The property also hosts weddings, conferences and events, and is now managed by a nonprofit board dedicated to preserving the historic campus. Rooms there start at $169 a night.

The Liberty Hotel in Boston is housed in the former Charles Street Jail, a massive Gothic structure completed in 1851 that remained open until 1990. Notable inmates once held at the jail include Boston Mayor James Michael Curley, anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, civil rights leader Malcolm X and mobster Whitey Bulger, according to records. 

It underwent a $150 million conversion and reopened in 2007 as a luxury hotel, preserving many original elements, such as the massive atrium, catwalks, former cell doors and restaurants with names like Clink and Alibi, and rooms start at $590.

Andrew Cuomo slammed Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani for claiming he is a "victim" as a Muslim, saying his rival has "been dividing and attacking and offending" different New York groups during his campaign.

Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo slammed Democratic socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani for painting himself as a victim because he is a Muslim, saying the rival mayoral candidate has spent his campaign offending 9/11 families, Jews and various other groups of New Yorkers. 

"He claims that he is the victim of attacks because he is a Muslim. Nothing could be further from the truth. He is not a victim, he is the offender," Cuomo said on Saturday. "This entire campaign, he has been dividing and attacking and offending different New York groups."

While speaking at an event in which he received the endorsements of several faith leaders, Cuomo lambasted Mamdani, who he called his "main opponent." Cuomo listed a number of groups who he says have been hurt by Mamdani, including Jews, Blacks, Italians, members of the LGBTQ community — and even some Muslims.

Cuomo first addressed the Jewish community, saying that Mamdani had hurt them "in a truly painful way." The former governor recounted a recent interaction with a Jewish New Yorker who said he was afraid of wearing a Star of David in the city. In 2023, the UJA-Federation of New York said in a report that there were just over 1.3 million Jews living in New York City. 

The former governor took issue with Mamdani's refusal to condemn the phrase "globalize the intifada," which many see as a call for violence against Jewish people. Mamdani has faced criticism for his refusal to condemn the phrase early in the mayoral race.

The former governor also said his opponent hurt the Sunni Muslim community by advocating for the decriminalization of prostitution. Cuomo added that according to the Quran, prostitution is haram, which means "forbidden" in Arabic.

After condemning Mamdani's gesture toward the Columbus statue and invoking its offense to Italian-Americans, Cuomo broadened his criticism. He pointed to a photo of Mamdani with a Ugandan official who backs harsh anti-gay laws, framing it as an affront to the LGBTQ community.

He didn't stop there — Mamdani's friendship with controversial Twitch streamer Hasan Piker, who once said "America deserved 9/11," also drew scrutiny from the former governor.

"You offend 9/11 families. You offend every New Yorker because 9/11 was an attack on all New Yorkers, and it traumatized all New Yorkers. So, no, he's not the victim. He is the offender, and he has done a great deal of damage," Cuomo said.

This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.

            Right after setting her out-of-office email on October 1, one furloughed US Department of Agriculture worker filed for unemployment benefits to help her pay for food, rent and other necessities during the federal government shutdown.
    


            More than three weeks later, her application is still listed as pending – forcing her to borrow from family and friends as the impasse continues with no end in sight. The Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance told her she may have to wait up to three months to receive her first payment, though she will receive a lump sum for all the missed weeks of claims.
    


            “But that doesn't help me now,”  said the worker, who asked for anonymity for fear of retaliation. “The rent is due on November 1.”
    


            The USDA staffer is among the nearly 20,600 furloughed federal employees who have filed for unemployment benefits during the first three weeks of the shutdown, according to Andrew Stettner, director of economy and jobs at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. Initial jobless claims for federal workers have soared to their highest level since the record 35-day shutdown that ended in January 2019.
    


Is the federal government shutdown affecting you? Tell us about it



            That compares to 635 initial claims filed by federal workers for the week ending September 13, according to the most recent data published by the US Department of Labor before the impasse.
    


            Maryland and Texas have the highest number of initial claims, with more than 3,100 filings each, said Stettner, who analyzed unemployment data filed in 49 states and territories.
    


            More workers are expected to file for unemployment compensation in the coming weeks since many missed their first full paychecks on Friday and more will do so in coming days.
    


            Unlike in previous shutdowns, many are concerned that they may not receive back pay or have a job to go back to after the shutdown ends. The Trump administration has called into question a 2019 law that guarantees retroactive compensation for furloughed workers and has tried to lay off more than 4,000 workers during the impasse. (A federal judge recently paused the administration's efforts to downsize the federal workforce during the shutdown.)
    


            Still, only a small share of the estimated 670,000 furloughed federal employees have applied for jobless benefits. There are multiple reasons why most of them don't file claims, including the hassle in having their wages verified, the delay in getting payments and the fact that they'll have to repay the benefits once the shutdown ends and they receive their back pay.
    


            Plus, the benefits are only a fraction of what many federal workers receive in compensation. The maximum weekly payment in Washington, DC, is $444, $430 in Maryland and only $378 in Virginia, for instance.
    


            The Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program is similar to traditional state jobless benefits, but it differs in significant ways that could delay getting money into the hands of furloughed staffers.
    


            State unemployment offices have the wage records of private-sector employers, but they don't have that information for the federal government. So, the states must contact the federal agencies to verify the employment and salary for each claimant. But many of the workers who would handle such requests have been furloughed themselves, said Stettner, who also served as a senior US Department of Labor official in the Biden administration.
    


            “Federal workers should apply for unemployment benefits. They don't know how long the shutdown is going to be,” he said, noting it's akin to an interest-free loan. “But it's really, really hard. There are a lot of barriers.”
    


            Some states are trying to smooth the process for furloughed workers. Washington's Employment Security Department, which has had more than 1,800 federal employees file for benefits, held a webinar earlier this week that drew nearly 500 participants and is offering another one next week. Maryland's Department of Labor has a webpage specifically for furloughed federal staffers and contractors. Utah's Department of Workforce Services posted an FAQ for affected federal employees on its site.
    


            Ben Emmel, a senior analyst at the Government Accountability Office, decided to file for unemployment benefits two weeks ago, but the Maryland resident was only able to submit his application on Friday because he had to resolve an identity verification issue first.
    


            Several of his colleagues around the country have also had problems filing claims, said Emmel, who is president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers Local 1921.
    


            Even when he gets the benefits, the weekly payment will only cover a trip or two to the grocery store for Emmel, who is married with four young children.
    


            Federal employees aren't the only ones being hit hard by the shutdown. Many contractors who work for federal agencies have also been furloughed, although they don't have the same guarantee of getting their back pay that federal staffers do.
    


Contractors can also run into issues filing for jobless benefits. Sharon, a contractor for the Drug Enforcement Administration, visited a Washington, DC, unemployment office after having difficulty applying online. After waiting in line, she still didn't get clear answers about her eligibility or next steps.
    


            “I'm super frustrated,” she said.

Voters in Ireland went to the polls Friday to elect one of two women as their new president for the next seven years, a largely ceremonial role in the European Union member country.

LONDON (AP) — Left-wing independent Catherine Connolly is set to become Ireland's next president after her rival conceded defeat in a presidential election Saturday.

Vote counting was still underway but ahead of the official result, Heather Humphreys, of the center-right party Fine Gael, told reporters that she wanted “to congratulate Catherine Connolly on becoming the next president of Ireland.”

“Catherine will be a president for all of us and she will be my president, and I really would like to wish her all the very, very best,” she said.

Polls have suggested consistent and strong voter support for Connolly, 68, over Humphreys, 64, for president, a largely ceremonial role in Ireland.

Connolly, a former barrister and an independent lawmaker since 2016, has been outspoken in criticizing Israel over the war in Gaza. She has also warned against the European Union's growing “militarization” following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 

Ireland has a tradition of military neutrality, but her critics have said she risks alienating the country's allies. 

The politician has garnered the backing of a range of left-leaning parties, including Sinn Féin, the Labour Party and the Social Democrats.

Prime Minister Micheál Martin on Saturday congratulated Connolly on her “very comprehensive election victory,” adding “it is clear she will be the next president of Ireland.”




Martin said he was looking forward to working with the new president as “Ireland continues to play a significant role on the global stage, and as we look forward to hosting the EU presidency in the second half of 2026.”

Initial and incomplete results show Connolly taking more than 60% of votes.

Connolly and Humphreys were the only contenders after Jim Gavin, the candidate for Martin's Fianna Fail party, quit the race three weeks before the election over a long-ago financial dispute. 

Martin, who heads Ireland's government, had personally backed Gavin as a presidential candidate. Though Gavin had stopped campaigning, his name remained on the ballot paper because of his late withdrawal from the race.

The electoral commission said Saturday that there was a “significantly higher than normal” number of spoiled ballots, and that there will “clearly be a need for deeper and further reflection” about voter dissatisfaction. 

Simon Harris, the deputy premier, said the spoiled ballots showed “the number of people in Ireland now who are clearly feeling disaffected or disconnected with politics.” He said officials will be looking at the possibility of changing the threshold needed to secure a nomination in future presidential elections. 

While Irish presidents represent the country on the world stage, host visiting heads of state and play an important constitutional role, they do not have the power to shape laws or policies. 

Nonetheless, parties on the left celebrated the results as a significant shift in Irish politics.

“We have seen a real appetite for the change that Catherine represents,” said Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik. “We believe this really does mean a new sort of politics is possible, that we can now realize the ambition that I talked about a year ago: The real prospect of a center-left-led government after the next general election.”

Others — including musician Bob Geldof and the former mixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor — had indicated they wished to run for president but failed to receive enough backing for a nomination.

Connolly will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who has been president since 2011, having served the maximum two seven-year terms. She will be Ireland's 10th president and the third woman to hold the post.

Voting slips were being counted by hand. The final result will be declared later Saturday once all 43 electoral constituencies have completed counting.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro speaks to reporters after the man accused of attempting to set fire to his home pleaded guilty.

One of the Democratic Party's top potential 2028 figures will stump for Virginia gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger on Sunday.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who has notably made a lane to the right of far-left Democratic Party figures like New York Assemb. Zohran Mamdani, will rally with Spanberger in the crucial Hampton Roads area.

The former Virginia congresswoman plans to hold multiple rallies in the Tidewater alone before Election Day, including another with former President Barack Obama across the ‘roads' in Norfolk.

"Governor Shapiro this weekend is headed to New Jersey and Virginia to help elect Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger; two more Democratic governors who will focus every day on getting stuff done, delivering results for hardworking families and protecting freedom in their states," Shapiro campaign spokesman Manuel Bonder told Fox News Digital on Friday.

Shapiro also plans to stump for Rep. Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey as she hopes to keep Trenton in Democratic hands.

Shapiro – who has announced he will run for reelection to Harrisburg in 2026 and has not officially indicated interest in a presidential bid – is one of several Democrats whose names repeatedly come up in such conversation – including Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Kentucky Gov. Andrew Beshear.

He was also the reported runner-up to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in Kamala Harris' 2024 veepstakes.

Shapiro lambasted antisemitic behavior at the University of Pennsylvania following the Hamas attack on Israel, while separately adding of Mamdani's view of the Jewish State:

"You have to speak and act with moral clarity, and when supporters of yours say things that are blatantly antisemitic, you can't leave room for that to just sit there."

THE ONLY TWO DEMS RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR IN 2025 ARE FORMER ROOMMATES WITH MIRRORING POLITICAL CAREERS

While Shapiro has faced criticism from Republicans in his own state for supporting former Gov. Tom Wolf's COVID-era shutdowns and for the current budget impasse, he's also been a rare Democrat to earn praise from some in the GOP.

Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican nominee in New Jersey's sweeps, namedropped Shapiro favorably enough times that Newark Mayor Ras Baraka – then running for governor – suggested he cross the Delaware and run in the Keystone State instead.

"[Pennsylvania doesn't] have a property tax crisis [like New Jersey], they don't have a business climate crisis, they don't have an energy crisis," Ciattarelli said, contrasting the two neighbors.

Pennsylvania Republicans, however, disputed some of those descriptions, with state Rep. Russ Diamond, R-Lebanon, and Sen. David Argall, R-New Ringgold, recently drafting bills to eliminate property taxes altogether.

State Sen. Doug Mastriano, R-Gettysburg, who challenged Shapiro in 2022 and is being urged by the conservative wing to do so again in 2026, also blasted Shapiro's budget proposals as "fantasy," warning in a statement that "eventually, the funds from ‘we the people' will run dry."

Shapiro has also been vocal on election law itself, rebuking the president over a Truth Social post potentially foreshadowing an end to mail-in balloting.

"Donald Trump can sign whatever the hell executive orders he wants… But he can't change the Constitution with an executive order, and the Constitution gives the authority to set our election rules to the states." Shapiro said.

Fox News Digital spoke to attorney Katilin Puccio about today's Democratic Party and its members who have failed to condemn political violence.

With less than two weeks before critical elections across the country, Democrats have tough questions to grapple with in terms of their messaging and whether they can navigate the growing movement in their party that is embracing or downplaying political violence, attorney and political commentator Kaitlin Puccio told Fox News Digital. 

"We do hear a lot of just the Democrats are against Trump, but we don't hear a lot of what they're actually for, which is problematic and it kind of seems to me like they don't really have a cohesive message," Puccio, adjunct professor at Fordham Law and the Director of the Art and Bioethics Initiative of the UNESCO Chair in Bioethics and Human Rights, said in an interview with Fox News Digital. 

Puccio said the ‘No Kings' protests last week, where several examples of promoting violence went viral on social media, show a "fracture" in the Democratic Party that the mainstream elected officials will have to contend with. 

Additionally, messaging at those rallies, Puccio explained, lacked substance.

"It's mostly ‘we are against Trump.' Okay, but, specifically, what are you against? What is the specific policy that you are against?" Puccio said. "'No Kings': great. But we don't have a king. We all know that. We're not supposed to take this phrase literally, but what about the policies that are in place right now, do you think are authoritarian? And what do you want instead? So we're hearing a lot of slogans and phrases and kind of catch phrases. And really that leaves the message without substance."

Questions about Democrat support for political violence have been front and center in recent weeks after Virginia Democratic attorney general candidate Jay Jones was outed for past texts fantasizing about killing a Republican colleague and wishing death on that colleague's children.

"I don't think that it's lost on voters that there are these horrible texts that came out recently from Jay Jones and the strange thing is that there are very few people who are condemning these texts," Puccio said, highlighting that prominent Democrats, particularly in Virginia, have refused to call on Jones to drop out of the race.

"But I think the reason for that is that the party of tolerance, right, the Democrats, is actually, it's become a very intolerant party," Puccio added. 

"So if you have people condemning these texts, this sort of violent political rhetoric and things like that, they don't want to be alienated by their own party. Look at what they've done or tried to do to John Fetterman. When he tries to think for himself instead of having the party tell him what to think, they ostracize him. I think that is kind of the reason that we're in this weird place with our leaders, because everyone is kind of being quiet."

In addition to Jones, Maine Democratic Senate candidate Graham Platner has faced scrutiny over advocating for political violence in the past and a tattoo that resembles a Nazi Germany symbol.

Puccio told Fox News Digital that Platner's apology seemed to show remorse compared to the reaction from Jones, which could serve as a blueprint going forward on how Democrats can acknowledge past mistakes.

"The point is that every situation has to be evaluated separately, but the conversation still has to be had over what to do within our Democratic Party about this violent rhetoric, which is, it's basically being accepted right now," Puccio said. "What we're about to see, I don't know how long it's going to take, but I do think there's going to be a shift toward the middle because I think there is going to be a realization that we are leaving out and by we, I mean, all Americans in general were forgetting from both sides of the political aisle about the middle."

While Democrats are expected to perform strongly in next year's midterms, given that, historically, the party not in power does well in those elections, Republicans have been closing the gap in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections being held in early November, which could send a signal that Democrats aren't in as strong of a position as many experts think. 

Puccio said today's Democratic Party is "unrecognizable," which will hopefully push leaders to come out forcefully and take back control.

"I think that there will be this realization that the loudest voices on either side of the political aisle are not necessarily representative of the entire party and I think that people are going to be forced to say no to this kind of uncivil discourse that we're seeing, because people, we citizens, are going to get very tired of seeing our leaders behave in very childish and frankly, disrespectful ways toward each other," Puccio said. 

"These are not supposed to be the way our elected leaders act. And I would hope that there emerge some actual leaders and not just politicians in the future who recognize that they need to speak to everyone and not a small niche in their party."

Former federal prosecutor Katie Cherkasky discusses Kilmar Abrego Garcia's pending deportation, President Donald Trump's D.C. crime crackdown and more on ‘Fox News Live.'

The Trump administration said it could soon deport Salvadoran illegal immigrant Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to the African nation of Liberia after reaching an agreement with that country, according to a Department of Homeland Security filing Friday.

The court filing said that Abrego Garcia could be sent to the West African nation as soon as Oct. 31 to fulfill a standing deportation order against him.

Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March despite a 2019 protection finding and a court order barring his removal to his home country. His case has become a focal point in the clash between Trump's hardline deportation agenda and Democratic efforts to block removals.

The filing noted that Abrego Garcia's attorneys cited more than 20 countries he allegedly fears would prosecute or torture him if he were removed there and that Liberia is not on that list.

"Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States's closest partners on the African continent," the filing said.

The filing said the country's national language is English, its constitution "provides robust protections for human rights," and Liberia is "committed to the humane treatment of refugees."

DHS said in the filing that it has received diplomatic assurances from Liberia about the humane treatment of people removed there.

Attorneys for Abrego Garcia blasted the administration's latest move as political retribution, arguing the latest deportation plan is part of a pattern of punitive deportation tactics.

"After failed attempts with Uganda, Eswatini, and Ghana, ICE now seeks to deport our client, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to Liberia, a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland," attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said in a statement, according to The Associated Press.

"Costa Rica stands ready to accept him as a refugee, a viable and lawful option," the lawyer added. "Yet the government has chosen a course calculated to inflict maximum hardship. These actions are punitive, cruel and unconstitutional."

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., a staunch supporter of Abrego Garcia, condemned the latest filing on Friday. Van Hollen flew to El Salvador in April in a publicized visit to meet Abrego Garcia in prison and has led the effort to get him released.

"The Trump Administration has been desperately shopping for faraway countries they can ship Kilmar Abrego Garcia to in order to deny his constitutional due process right to defend himself against the charges they have brought," Van Hollen said in a statement.

"Clearly, Trump's cronies want to avoid answering for the claim that they are engaged in a vindictive prosecution against Abrego Garcia, after a federal judge concluded earlier this month that his prosecution ‘may stem from retaliation by the DOJ and DHS due to Abrego's successful challenge of his unlawful deportation in Maryland.' Kilmar must be allowed his day in court to fight for his rights," the senator said.

Abrego Garcia entered the U.S. illegally in 2011 and was issued a deportation order in 2019. Two previous judges found he was likely affiliated with MS-13.

Trump administration officials acknowledged in court that his deportation had been an administrative error, although some top Trump officials said he was correctly removed and contended he's a member of the notorious MS-13 gang.

One immigration judge in 2019 found that Garcia had not sufficiently refuted evidence of MS-13 affiliation and was thus removable to anywhere other than El Salvador because of a threat from a rival gang.

The latest move to deport him comes as Abrego Garcia remains in immigration detention in Pennsylvania. A federal judge in Maryland previously barred his immediate deportation while reviewing claims that the government is retaliating against him for successfully challenging his wrongful removal earlier this year.

The same judge wrote in an October order that his prosecution "may stem from retaliation by the DOJ and DHS," while a separate case in Tennessee over human smuggling charges is still pending.

When pressed on why Democrats are using working-class Americans as "leverage" amid the ongoing government shutdown, several Democratic senators offered varying responses — but only one rejected the premise that their party is holding Americans hostage.

"It's the only lever we have," Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., responded when asked about the matter.

"We're doing this because we're hearing from so many families concerned about their healthcare," said Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J. "We're doing this because we're hearing from them and wanting to address that." Kim also blamed President Donald Trump and his allies, arguing that "this administration has been unwilling to actually negotiate."

DEMOCRATS REFUSE TO BUDGE OVER OBAMACARE FIGHT AS SHUTDOWN DRAGS ON

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said that the government shutdown is "the only lever" Democrats have to extend Obamacare subsidies, passed during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

"Schumer and Jefferies have asked yet again to talk to Trump before Trump goes on an international trip," Kim lamented. "When we have all this problem here at home, for the amount of money that Donald Trump has organized to send over to Argentina, we could have funded the ACA subsidies for another year."

Republicans counter that Democrats are the ones refusing to negotiate, noting the Obamacare subsidies at issue don't expire until year's end and can be debated once the government reopens.

"The way I see it, 2024 was about one issue above and beyond all else, and that was about lowering costs," said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.

But, it was swing-state Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., who objected to the framing of the question, telling Fox News Digital that "this isn't a political game."

"I would never say – I'm not going to describe the lives of millions of Americans as a euphemism, as ‘leverage,'" Fetterman shot back in response to the question. "This isn't a political game. I'm not checking about how it's polling or who's going to blink. Millions of Pennsylvanians are going to lose their SNAP benefits and I think we should have them both at the same time."

Fetterman, appearing to side with an argument coming from the GOP that the Obamacare subsidies can be negotiated after the government reopens, said he believes there can be "an honest conversation" between Republicans and Democrats once the government gets to a place where it can turn the lights back on.

"I think plenty of [Republicans] are going to want this too – have that conversation – open up this government because that's not leverage, this is a fail," Fetterman said.

            The Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration often looks like a car crash.
    


            Literally.
    


            There have been car crashes between federal agents and suspects trying to flee. There have been alleged “rammings” involving pro-immigrant activists. There have been dramatic traffic stops featuring smashed windows and law enforcement shootings. Even the standoffs outside ICE facilities have focused on tense moments around the arrival or departure of federal vehicles.
    


            These incidents, many captured on video, have provided some of the most dramatic visuals of the immigration crackdown this year.
    


            “They're the most highly visible, and I think they're so unusual that it shocks the psyche to see federal agents making administrative warrant arrests and using potential deadly force tactics,” said Thaddeus Johnson, a former law enforcement official in Tennessee and a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank.

            The crashes show federal law enforcement's use of aggressive tactics in busy city streets, such as dangerous “PIT” maneuvers, unmarked cars and masked officers, law enforcement and immigration experts said.
    


            The collisions also reflect the desperate fear of the immigration targets, who in some cases have tried to flee when faced with the potential end of their freedom.
    


            “Often people in their cars get scared and they try to drive away, knowing that stopping and talking to ICE might end up in a severe violation of their constitutional rights and arrest and detention,” said Nayna Gupta, policy director of the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration nonprofit group.
    


            “This kind of interaction on the streets – using traffic stops, people fearful when ICE or federal agents are following them – leads to the kinds of accidents and crashes that we're starting to see in the news.”
    


            Bill Essayli, acting US attorney for the Central District of California, noted in a post on X on Tuesday that “encouraging resistance to federal agents can lead to deadly consequences.”
    


            “PSA: A vehicle is a deadly weapon,” Essayli said. “Using it against law enforcement justifies their use of deadly force in self-defense. If you wish to challenge law enforcement actions, do so in court, not on the streets.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment.
    


            Some of these car crashes have been initiated by federal agents and show a willingness to use aggressive and potentially dangerous tactics.
    


            In Chicago on October 14, US Border Patrol agents pursued and crashed into a vehicle as part of an immigration enforcement operation, leading to an angry response from community residents.
    


            The incident unfolded when a white SUV hit the side of a red SUV, sending it backward through the intersection before it crashed into another vehicle, video captured by a nearby resident showed. What appeared to be federal agents can then be seen exiting the white vehicle and chasing two people.
    


            The red SUV was driven by a person in the country illegally who rammed a Border Patrol vehicle before trying to flee the scene, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement to CNN. Agents used “an authorized precision immobilization technique (PIT) maneuver,” which forces a vehicle to spin out and stop, said DHS.
    


            Border Patrol agents eventually arrested the two individuals, according to DHS.
    


            A PIT maneuver is considered a use of deadly force and is justifiable in certain situations, depending on the suspect's risk to the public, the risk to the officer and the potential collateral damage of a crash, according to Jerry Robinette, a former special agent in charge of ICE's Homeland Security Investigations.
    


            “There are a series of factors that agents have to take into account before they even become involved in a high-risk pursuit,” he said. “When you're involved in a high-risk pursuit, one of your main responsibilities is the general public, along with yourself and the violator.”
    


            Video of an October 16 crash in Oxnard, California, also shows federal agents performing what appears to be an intentional crash.
    


            Video of the incident shows a dark gray truck driving in circles with an unmarked beige SUV closely following him around. Once the truck begins driving straight, the beige SUV speeds up and slams into the truck's back-left side. It is not immediately clear what happened before the video starts.
    


            Leo Martinez, the driver of the truck, is a US citizen and an immigration rights volunteer. He told CNN's Erin Burnett last week he is one of multiple volunteers who have been patrolling neighborhoods in Ventura County to document ICE detentions and was shocked when the SUV he says was driven by federal agents drove into his truck.
    


            Martinez told CNN he was temporarily detained him and then released from custody pending charges.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security responded to the incident in a statement, calling it a “targeted enforcement operation.”
    


            Traffic stops and car chases have long been considered some of the most dangerous of law enforcement activities, and indeed some of these crashes have led to injuries and death.
    


            Last month, an ICE officer fatally shot a man who DHS said resisted arrest and dragged the officer during a vehicle stop in a Chicago suburb, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            The man, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, was an undocumented immigrant, according to DHS. The officer, who was not immediately identified, was released from the hospital after suffering injuries, an ICE spokesperson said.
    


            In another incident, Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old US citizen, was shot five times by a US Customs and Border Protection agent after her vehicle and a federal law enforcement vehicle collided on October 4 in Chicago.
    


            A federal criminal complaint accuses Martinez of ramming her car into the federal vehicle, and a DHS official referred to her as a “domestic terrorist.” However, her attorney has disputed this, saying unreleased body camera footage shows the federal agent swerved into her vehicle.
    


            Martinez has pleaded not guilty to a charge of assaulting, resisting, and impeding officers.
    


            In Los Angeles earlier this week, a federal marshal and an undocumented immigrant were injured after an agent's weapon discharged during an immigration enforcement operation, officials said.
    


            Federal prosecutors allege Carlitos Ricardo Parias, a TikTok influencer, rammed law enforcement vehicles in an attempt to dislodge his car during an immigration arrest. Authorities said Parias is a 44-year-old Mexican national living illegally in the US.
    


In immigration crackdown, DHS statements on arrests face a problem of credibility



            Parias been charged with assault on a federal officer, according to a statement from the US Attorney's Office in the Central District of California.
    


            “He's a very pacifist man. He's very calm,” his lawyer Carlos Jurado told CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS. “A lot of the police officers here know him. They know that he's very respectful.”
    


            Investigators believe gunfire erupted after an ICE officer confronted the suspect's vehicle and smashed a window with their service weapon, a law enforcement source said. While attempting to grab the suspect, authorities believe the agent's weapon discharged, striking both the suspect and a deputy US marshal. They are both expected to recover, prosecutors said.
    


            Ultimately, the mistrust of immigration enforcement can be dangerous for both suspects and officers, said Johnson, the senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice.
    


            “People are afraid,” he said. “If you're afraid and you don't trust the authorities – fight, flight or fear. Those responses to fear can get you killed or get officers hurt.”

A left-wing education nonprofit organization that the Washington Examiner recently found to be publishing classroom materials promoting political violence has received hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer funding, according to public records reviewed by the North American Values Institute. 

Teaching for Change, alongside allied nonprofit organization Rethinking Schools, runs the Zinn Education Project. The project, named for late socialist academic Howard Zinn, has published classroom materials containing praise of violent organizations, riots, and other illegal activity oriented toward left-wing political goals. Despite this, the D.C. municipal government and the federally-funded Smithsonian Institution have doled out large grants to Teaching for Change in recent years.

D.C. public schools, the mayor's office, and the city's commission on art collectively approved nearly $330,000 in contracts with Teaching for Change between the 2023 and 2025 fiscal years. The Smithsonian, meanwhile, paid out roughly $20,000 to the nonprofit organization between 2019 and 2022 to hold “teach in[s].”

Teaching for Change is linked to radical and violent politics through its work operating the Zinn Education Project. 

Classroom materials developed by the Zinn Education Project praised members of the Black Panther Party implicated in violence, such as Eldridge Cleaver, who organized an armed ambush of Oakland police officers in 1968, and Assata Shakur, a left-wing activist who was convicted of murdering a New Jersey state trooper in 1977. Angela Davis, who purchased firearms used by a fellow activist to engage in a shootout with police and murder a judge, was also praised in the materials.

The Zinn Education Project distributes materials expressing approval of the Stonewall Riots, a series of violent clashes between law enforcement and members of the LGBT community, and crimes targeting critical energy infrastructure in service of advancing environmental activism. Additionally, the organization produced materials equating actions taken by the American and Israeli governments to 9/11, as well as lessons arguing that Israel brought the October 7 terrorist attacks upon themselves.

The Washington Examiner recently reported that, despite these publications, the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers union, has extensive partnerships with the Zinn Education Project and, by extension, Teaching for Change.

“These organizations earned teachers' trust by leading honest conversations about race and Indigenous history,” Naomi Rodriguez, an NEA member, told the Washington Examiner. “That work mattered. It gave people hope. But now their messaging about Jews feels like a betrayal. It's a bait and switch. They built their reputation on justice and inclusion, then used that trust to spread misinformation about Jews.”

“Many teachers, and even NEA leadership, still treat them as equity leaders, even as their lessons on the history of the Middle East fuel bias against a people who've endured persecution for generations,” Rodriguez continued. “When so few Americans understand Jewish identity beyond the Holocaust, those false lessons don't just misinform; they shape worldviews. They've turned education into prejudice and curricula into propaganda.”

Teaching for Change is very active in the D.C. metropolitan area, hosting D.C. Area Educators for Social Justice, a network of liberal educators who “seek to strengthen and deepen social justice teaching” in order to “challenge systems of oppression through anti-bias, anti-racist, and multicultural education.” It works towards this goal by disseminating documents, hosting working groups, and organizing left-of-center protests.

Another NEA member accused Teaching for Change of contributing to antisemitism through its “distorted and biased lessons” in a statement to the Washington Examiner.

TOP TEACHERS UNION INVITES PRO-VIOLENCE ACTIVISTS TO SHAPE PUBLIC SCHOOL CURRICULA 

The Smithsonian's links to the Zinn Education Project go deeper than grant funding. 

In 2022, the two organizations joined to hold a teacher workshop for high school and middle school educators on how to teach African American history following the Civil War.

The Smithsonian and the D.C. Executive Office of the Mayor did not respond to requests for comment.

            A massive AWS outage Monday that brought down some of the world's most popular apps and services all started with a glitch.
    


            The bug – which occurred when two automated systems were trying to update the same data simultaneously – snowballed into something significantly more serious that Amazon's engineers scrambled to fix, the company said Thursday in a postmortem assessment.
    


            The massive cloud service's outage meant people couldn't order food, communicate with hospital networks, access mobile banking, or connect with their security systems and smart home devices. Major global companies, including Netflix, Starbucks and United Airlines, were temporarily unable to give customers access to their online services.
    


            “We apologize for the impact this event caused our customers,” Amazon said in a statement on the AWS website. “We know this event impacted many customers in significant ways. We will do everything we can to learn from this event and use it to improve our availability even further.”
    


You thought Monday's internet outage was bad? Just wait



            At a high level, the issue stemmed from two programs competing to write the same DNS entry – essentially a record in the internet's phonebook – at the same time, which resulted in an empty entry. That threw multiple AWS services into disarray.
    


            “The analogy of a telephone book is pretty apt in that the folks on the other line are there, but if you don't know how to reach them, then you have a problem,” Angelique Medina, head of Cisco's ThousandEyes Internet Intelligence network monitoring service, told CNN. “And that telephone book effectively went poof.”
    


            Indranil Gupta, a professor of electrical and computing engineering at the University of Illinois, used a classroom analogy to explain Amazon's technical analysis in an email to CNN. Say two students, one who is a fast worker, the other who is a slower worker, are asked to collaborate on a shared notebook.
    


            The slower student “pays attention in brief bursts, but their work may conflict or contradict the work of the faster student,” he wrote. At the same time, the quicker student may be “trying to constantly ‘fix' things quickly” and delete the slower student's work because it's outdated.
    


            “The result… an empty page (or crossed out page) in the lab notebook, when the teacher comes and inspects it,” he wrote.
    


            That “empty page” brought down AWS' DynamoDB database, creating a cascading effect that impacted other AWS services like EC2, which offers virtual servers for developing and deploying apps, and Network Load Balancer, which manages demands across the network. When DynamoDB came back online, EC2 tried to bring all of its servers back online at once and couldn't keep up.
    


            Amazon is making a number of changes to its systems following the outage, including fixing the “race condition scenario,” which caused the two systems to overwrite each others' work in the first place, and adding an additional test suite for its EC2 service.
    


            Outages like Monday's, while rare, are just a reality, Gupta said. But what matters is how such issues are addressed.
    


            “Large scale outages like this, they just happen. There's nothing you can do to avoid it, just like (how) people get ill,” Gupta told CNN over the phone. “But I think how the company reacts to the outages and keeps customers informed is really, really key.”

            On the floor of their tiny makeshift home in a refugee camp in Bangladesh, her mother Fatima Begum feeds Sofiya by rubbing her gums with a food paste designed to treat severe malnutrition.
    


            These life-saving packets were provided by the US government, labeled with the logo of USAID – a legacy of the now-defunct organization which was dismantled by the Trump administration in January. With US aid cuts of $8 billion annually, a gaping hole has been left in international aid.
    


            The impact is already being felt in the world's largest refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, where UNICEF reports an alarming 11% rise in the number of children with acute malnutrition between January and September this year.
    


            The remaining USAID supplies are now running out, and Begum says their regular food donations are also decreasing.
    


            “Before, they gave more food, but now they don't,” Begum said. “They don't give fruits like before. They don't give fish. Still, I'm thankful for whatever they give.”
    


            An ethnic Rohingya Muslim, Fatima Begum fled her home in western Myanmar's Rakhine state in 2017, after the military carried out what the US and UN experts call a genocide. Now, she is crammed alongside 1.2 million Rohingya in sprawling refugee camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh.
    


            Begum fled one type of hell, only to land in another – now facing a daily battle to keep her baby alive.
    


            Sofiya is currently receiving 2.5 portions of the ready-to-use therapeutic food packets (RUTF) every day, with each one providing 500 calories from the mix of powdered milk, peanuts, vegetable oil and vitamins. Over the past few decades, this simple product has helped to bring millions of children back from the brink of starvation.
    


            As of July this year, UNICEF has had to cut the number of RUTF packets given per child in the camps, to try to stretch resources.
    


            “Cox's Bazar is ground zero for the impact of budget cuts on people in desperate need,” said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres after he visited the camps in March, adding that “people will suffer and even people will die.”
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has repeatedly denied that US aid cutbacks caused any deaths, and has defended the move as a way to cut bureaucracy and prioritize “our national interests.”
    


            But a study published in The Lancet predicts the cuts will result in 14 million deaths over the next five years – and an online impact tracking tool run by a Boston University professor estimates that there are already 88 deaths per hour.
    


            In a statement to CNN, a US State Department spokesperson said the US announced “an additional $60mn in life-saving humanitarian assistance for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh” in September, including emergency food assistance and RUTF packets.
    


            “The Trump Administration is significantly enhancing the efficiency and strategic impact of foreign assistance programs and continues to deliver life-saving assistance around the world, including to vulnerable populations like the Rohingya refugees while remaining accountable to the American taxpayer,” the spokesperson said.
    


            The children wasting away, day by day, don't have time to wait for funding gaps to be filled.
    


            At a nutrition center in Camp 15 of Cox's Bazar – run by Concern Worldwide, with programs from UNICEF and the World Food Programme (WFP) – babies are measured for malnutrition by wrapping a paper tape measure around their tiny arms.
    


            Chronic malnutrition – or stunting – has remained persistently high in the camps, at around 41%, UNICEF says.
    


            “More and more children are being detected with the severest form of malnutrition, and they are at a risk of mortality because of that,” said Deepika Sharma, the Chief of Nutrition and Child Development in Bangladesh for UNICEF.
    


            As international aid is pulled back from the US, along with reductions from other countries including the UK and France, aid agencies have slashed jobs globally to try to protect frontline operations – including nearly 5,000 job losses at the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.
    


            But life-saving projects are still being impacted, including medical services, food supplies, and vaccine programs. And the coming year looks worse – with many aid agencies facing a “funding cliff” in 2026.
    


            “People are suffering,” said Shamsud Douza, the joint secretary of the Additional Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner (RRRC) Office in Cox's Bazar. “Humanitarian aid decreased, funding is going down, some people are losing jobs, education programs, everything.”
    


            In August, the Bangladeshi government organized a major conference to try to raise the funds for the Rohingya. And on September 30, the UN held a special conference on the situation in New York.
    


            Refugees in the camps are living on $12 USD of food per person, per month. The World Food Programme said it has not made any ration cuts so far this year, but faces a $126 million funding gap in the next 12 months.
    


            “The needs of the Rohingya in Bangladesh are outpacing resources at an alarming rate,” Julie Bishop, special envoy of the UN secretary-general on Myanmar, said in New York on September 30. “Without new contributions, food assistance for the entire Rohingya community will come to a complete halt in two months.”
    


            More than 150,000 new Rohingya refugees have arrived in the camps in the past two years, UNHCR says, straining the tight resources. They escaped intense fighting between the Myanmar military and the ethnic Rakhine Arakan Army during the civil war – with both sides linked to alleged atrocities against the Rohingya population.
    


            A lot of the new arrivals are already badly malnourished, as aid provision has largely been cut off for their homes in northern Rakhine – where the military has been accused of using hunger as a weapon of war.
    


            Further south in Sittwe – the capital of Rakhine – hundreds of Rohingya have been living in refugee camps since 2012, after previous violent attacks on their community.
    


            Hla Tin, a 39-year-old Rohingya living in a Sittwe camp, told CNN that they haven't received any aid in the camps since June – suggesting that the situation there is even more dire than in Cox's Bazar. The humanitarian need inside Myanmar is only 12% funded, according to the UN.
    


            Hla Tin has five children, and the youngest two are both suffering from malnutrition.
    


            “These days due to lack of nutritious food, both elderly people and children get sick more easily,” Hla Tin said.
    


            Among 432 families in the camp, over 300 are not eating regular meals, and people are getting into debt taking loans to buy food, he said.
    


            “I would like to call on the international community and organizations to not turn a blind eye to us, but to help us,” he said.
    


            Back in the bamboo and tarpaulin tents which blanket the hillsides of Cox's Bazar, refugee Mariam Khatun dresses her three small children and prepares a meal – these daily tasks the only thing keeping her going since the death of her eldest daughter, Estafa.
    


            She was a bright student, so her family sent 7-year-old Estafa to private lessons to learn Arabic – hoping that this would give her a chance to leave the camp one day and find a better future.
    


            But things started to change this year when budgets were slashed.
    


            “We can't afford to educate our children. Access to medicine has decreased compared to before,” Khatun said. “If there is no budget in the future… we will suffer even more.”
    


            In the camps, 48 health facilities, along with 11 primary health care centers, have been directly affected by the US government cuts, aid agencies say.
    


            “We see long queues now in our hospitals, people waiting for treatments,” said Hasina Rahman, the Bangladesh country director for the International Rescue Committee (IRC). “Services have been restricted and are limited now in the camps, and that is creating a massive impact.”
    


            In February, Khatun says Estafa became suddenly ill with stomach pains, so they took her to a camp hospital, and she was then transferred to a bigger facility where she received treatment.
    


            “My child suffered and died in pain,” Khatun said, as tears rolled down her face.
    


            The cause of death was “aspiration pneumonia and encephalitis,” according to a death certificate seen by CNN.
    


            The grieving mother blames a lack of medical care for her child's death – although the medical team which treated her told CNN that there was no link between her death and the funding cuts.
    


            But tragedies like these also reflect the vulnerability of this refugee population – with the overall reduction in support causing a cascade effect for those already living on a knife edge of survival.
    


            “This is basically a catastrophe in the making,” Rahman, from the IRC, added.
    


            “Before, we used to get support from America,” Mariam Khatun said. “We want their help again.”

For a quarter century, President Vladimir Putin has faced the specter of Russia's shrinking and aging population.

In 1999, a year before he came to power, the number of babies born in Russia plunged to its lowest recorded level. In 2005, Putin said the demographic woes needed to be resolved by maintaining “social and economic stability.”

In 2019, he said the problem still “haunted” the country.

As recently as Thursday, he told a Kremlin demographic conference that increasing births was “crucial” for Russia.

Putin has launched initiatives to encourage people to have more children -- from free school meals for large families to awarding Soviet-style “hero-mother” medals to women with 10 or more children.

“Many of our grandmothers and great-grandmothers had seven, eight, and even more children,” Putin said in 2023. “Let's preserve and revive these wonderful traditions. Having many children and a large family must become the norm.”

At first, births in Russia grew with its economic prosperity, from 1.21 million babies born in 1999 to 1.94 million in 2015.

But those hard-won gains are crumbling against a backdrop of financial uncertainty, the war in Ukraine, an exodus of young men and opposition to immigration.

Russia's population has fallen from 147.6 million in 1990 — the year before the USSR collapsed — to 146.1 million this year, according to Russia's Federal Statistics Service. Since the 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea, it has included the peninsula's population of about 2 million, as well as births and deaths there, in its data.







The population also is significantly older. In 1990, 21.1% was 55 or older, government data said. In 2024, that figure was 30%.

Since the 2015 peak, the number of births has fallen annually, and deaths are now outpacing births. There were only 1.22 million live births last year — marginally above the 1999 low. Demographer Alexei Raksha reported the number of babies born in Russia in February 2025 was the lowest monthly figure in over two centuries.




Russia is trying new restrictions to halt the backslide and embrace what it calls “traditional family values” with laws banning the promotion of abortion and “child-free ideology” and outlawing all LGBTQ+ activism.

Officials believe such values are “a magic wand” for solving demographic problems, said Russian feminist scholar Sasha Talaver.

In the government's view, women might be financially independent, but they should be “willing and very excited to take up this additional work of reproduction in the name of patriotism and Russian strength,” she said.

In Russia, as in much of the West, shrinking births are usually linked with economic turbulence. Young couples in cramped apartments, unable to buy their own homes or who fear for their jobs, usually have less confidence they can afford raising a child.

But Russia is saddled with a harsh demographic history.

About 27 million Soviet citizens died in World War II, diminishing the male population dramatically.

As the country was beginning to recover, the Soviet Union collapsed, and births tumbled again.

The number of Russian women in their 20s and early 30s is small, said Jenny Mathers of the University of Aberystwyth in Wales, leaving authorities “desperate to get as many babies as possible out of this much smaller number of women.”

Although Russia has not said how many troops have been killed in Ukraine, Western estimates have put the dead in the hundreds of thousands. When the war began, many young Russians moved abroad — some for ideological reasons like escaping a crackdown on dissent or to avoid military service.

“You've got a much-diminished pool of potential fathers in a diminished pool of potential mothers,” Mathers said. That is a particular problem for Putin, who has long linked population and national security, she said.

Some family-friendly initiatives are popular, like cash certificates for parents that can go toward pensions, education or a subsidized mortgage.

Others are controversial, such as one-time payments of about $1,200 for pregnant teenagers in some regions. Officials say these aim to support vulnerable mothers, but critics say they encourage such pregnancies.

Still other programs seem mostly symbolic. Since 2022, Russia has created state holidays like Family, Love and Fidelity Day in July, and Pregnant Women's Day -– celebrated on April 7 and Oct. 7.

Last year, Russia's fertility rate — the average number of children born per woman — was 1.4, state media reported. That's well below the 2.1 replacement rate for the population, and slightly lower than the U.S. figure of 1.6 released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Some regions have laws making it illegal to “encourage abortions,” while national legislation in 2024 banned the promotion of “child-free propaganda.” The wording in such initiatives is often vague, leaving them open to interpretation, but the change was enough to prompt producers of a reality TV hit “16 and Pregnant” to change the show's name to “Mommy at 16.”

For many women, the measures make already sensitive conversations even more fraught. A 29-year-old woman who's decided not to bear children told The Associated Press she sees a gynecologist at a private Moscow clinic, rather than a state one, to avoid intrusive questions.

“Whether I plan to have children, whether I don't plan to have children — I don't get asked about that at all,” she said, speaking on condition of anonymity because she feared repercussions. It's “a completely different story” at state-run clinics, she said.

An increasing number of laws limit access to abortion. While the procedure remains legal and widely available, more private clinics no longer offer abortion services. New legislation has also curbed the sale of abortion-inducing pills, a move that also affects some emergency contraceptives. 

Women are encouraged to go to state clinics, where waits are longer and some sites refuse to do abortions on certain days. By the time patients have completed compulsory counseling and mandatory waiting periods of between 48 hours and a week, they risk surpassing the time frame for a legal abortion.

Abortions have steadily decreased under these laws, although experts say the number of procedures already was falling. Still, there hasn't been a corresponding increase in births, and activists believe restricting abortion will only harm the health of women and children.

“The only thing you will get from this is illegal abortions. That means more deaths: more children's deaths and more women's deaths,” says Russian journalist and feminist activist Zalina Marshenkulova.

She sees the new government limits as repression for repression's sake. “They exist just to ban, to block any voice of freedom,” she told AP.

Russia could increase its population by allowing more immigrants — something the Kremlin is unlikely to adopt.

Russian officials have recently fomented anti-migrant sentiment, tracking their movements, clamping down on their employment and impeding their children's rights to education. Central Asians who have traditionally traveled to Russia for work are looking elsewhere, hoping to avoid growing discrimination and economic uncertainty. 

While the war in Ukraine continues, Moscow can promise financial rewards for would-be parents but not the stability needed for gambling on the future.

When people lack confidence about their prospects, it's not a time for having children, Mathers said, adding: “An open-ended major war doesn't really encourage people to think positively about the future.”

The 29-year-old woman who chose not to have children agrees.

“The happiest and healthiest child will only be born in a family with healthy, happy parents,” she said.

With their distinctive shaggy orange manes, pale blue faces and dense fur covering their hands and feet, it's hard to mistake China's endangered golden snub-nosed monkeys for any other animal.

These rare and charismatic monkeys, unique to the frigid mountains of central China, have recently joined the country's famous pandas as furry envoys to zoos in Europe for the first time — on loan for 10 years from the same government-overseen group that coordinates official panda exchanges.

As with “ panda diplomacy,” some observers cheer new opportunities for scientific and conservation collaboration, while others raise concerns about the welfare of individual animal ambassadors transported around the world.

Three golden monkeys arrived at France's Beauval Zoo in the city of Saint-Aignan this April, following an agreement to mark the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and France.

Another trio of golden monkeys arrived at the Pairi Daiza zoo in Hainaut, Belgium, in May. The zoo distributed Belgian and Chinese hand flags to visitors on the day the monkeys arrived.

After a monthlong quarantine, the two sets of monkeys made their public debuts. So far, they appear to be in good health, according to the two zoos, adapting to new climates outside Asia for the first time.

At Pairi Daiza, the habitat enclosure for Liu Yun, Lu Lu and Juan Juan includes traditional Chinese gazebos with red columns and gray-tiled roofs, where the monkeys spend much of their time jumping between logs and rope ladders and scrambling over roofs. 

“The diplomatic aspect comes from this cultural awareness,” said Pairi Daiza spokesperson Johan Vreys.

The hope is to build longstanding scientific exchanges between the zoos and Chinese authorities, said Anaïs Maury, the communications director for the Beauval Zoo.

The zoo is in discussions with China to launch joint research and conservation programs “similar to those already in place for other emblematic species like pandas,” Maury said.

Both giant pandas and golden snub-nosed monkeys are endangered animals that are unique to China and they can only be moved outside the country with approval from the central government, said Elena Songster, an environmental historian at St. Mary's College of California.

While both species are considered national treasures, only monkeys have deep roots in Chinese art and culture, appearing in countless paintings and as characters in classic literature, including the wily Monkey King in the 16th century novel “Journey to the West.”

When pandas stepped, rolled, scratched and stumbled onto the world stage in recent decades, they quickly became symbols of modern China — in part to due to their own “cuddly cuteness” and deft diplomatic presentation, said Susan Brownell, a China historian at the University of Missouri, St. Louis.

The original soft power couple from post-war China was a pair of giant pandas, Ping Ping and Qi Qi, sent to the Soviet Union in 1957 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, which led to the establishment of the world's first Communist state.

In 1972, a pair of pandas was sent to the U.S. for the first time, following President Richard Nixon's historic visit to Beijing. In 1984, China switched from gifting pandas to loaning them.

Following outcry from animal-rights activists, China ended the practice of short-term loans and began longer leases, usually around a decade. In this arrangement through the China Wildlife Conservation Association, part of the money that an overseas zoo pays annually to China must be earmarked for habitat conservation or scientific research to benefit the species.

Still, what benefits a species may not be beneficial to an individual animal. Transporting animals over long distances and sending their offspring back to China, as the agreements require, may highly stress animals, said Jeff Sebo, an environmental and bioethics researcher at New York University. 

“Animal health and welfare matters,” he said, “not just for geopolitical or strategic aims.”

Within China, the golden snub-nosed monkeys today live across a swath of central and southwestern China that includes parts of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Hubei provinces.

At the Shennongjia National Park in Hubei, conservation efforts since the 1980s have helped increase the region's population threefold to around 1,600 monkeys today, said Yang Jingyuan, president of the Academy of Sciences at the park. 

It's unclear exactly how to evaluate the diplomatic track record of furry ambassadors.

Still, in an era of rising global tensions, “I think pandas are a really useful entryway,” said James Carter, a China historian at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia. “Pandas open up an opportunity for people to think something positive about China — they're cute, they don't do anything bad.”

The golden snub-nosed monkeys now at zoos in France and Belgium are so far the only ones outside of Asia. 

“China's golden snub-nosed monkeys aren't globally iconic yet,” said Brownell, “but there may be potential for them to be in the future.”

President Donald Trump announced he's ending all trade negotiations with Canada because of a television ad opposing U.S. tariffs. The ad was paid for by the Ontario provincial government, not the Canadian federal government.

TORONTO (AP) — The leader of Canada's most populous province said Friday he'll pull the anti-tariff ad that prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to end trade talks with Canada. 

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said after talking with Prime Minister Mark Carney he's decided to pause the advertising campaign effective Monday so that trade talks can resume. 

Trump announced he's ending “all trade negotiations” with Canada because of a television ad sponsored by Ontario that used the words of former President Ronald Reagan to criticize U.S. tariffs. 

“We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels,” Ford said in a statement. 

“Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses.”

Ford said the commercials will continue to run this weekend including during the first World Series games between the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers. 

“I've directed my team to keep putting our message in front of Americans over the weekend so that we can air our commercial during the first two World Series games,” he said. 

Indeed, the ad aired Friday night during the seventh inning of Fox's national broadcast of Game 1. The Blue Jays were leading 11-4.

On Thursday Trump posted, “The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs.”




Trump doubled down on his criticism of the Ontario ads Friday and accused Canada of trying to influence an upcoming U.S. Supreme Court ruling on his global tariff regime.

Trump's call for an abrupt end to negotiations has further inflamed trade tensions between the neighbors and longtime allies. 

Carney said this week he aims to double his country's exports to countries outside the U.S. because of the threat posed by Trump's tariffs. Canadian officials remain ready to continue talks to reduce tariffs in certain sectors, he said. 

“We can't control the trade policy of the United States. We recognize that that policy has fundamentally changed from the 1980s,” Carney said Friday morning before boarding a flight to Asia. “We have to focus on what we can control and realize what we can't control.”

Carney is trying to secure a trade deal with Trump, but tariffs are taking a toll in the aluminum, steel, auto and lumber sectors.

Carney spoke to Ford Thursday night and again Friday. 

White House spokesman Kush Desai said talks with Canada have not led to any constructive progress. 

“Ontario's taxpayer-funded ad campaign on American TV networks — that misleadingly edited President Reagan's 1987 radio address about trade — is the latest example of how Canadian officials would rather play games than engage with the Administration,” Desai said in a statement. 

“As President Trump made clear on Truth Social, further talks are a futile effort if Canada can't be serious.”

The Ontario government has said it would pay about $75 million Canadian (US$54 million) for the ads to air across multiple American television stations using audio and video of Reagan speaking about tariffs in 1987.

Ford said earlier this week he had heard that Trump had seen the ad. 

“I'm sure he wasn't too happy,” Ford said. 

He said the aim is to “blast” the pro-trade message to Americans. 

“It's real, because it was coming from the best president the country's ever seen, Ronald Reagan,” Ford said. “I feel the Reagan Republicans are going to be fighting with the MAGA group, and let's hope, Reagan Republicans win.”

Ford is a populist conservative who doesn't belong to the same party as Carney, a Liberal. 

Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew and British Columbia Premier David Eby backed Ford. 

“It's clear that these ads are working. If you throw a rock at a lake and you don't hear a splash, you probably missed. So to my good friend Doug Ford, keep the ads on TV. They're effective, and this country is behind you,” Kinew said. 

Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said the ad has backfired “big time.”

Trump has been threatening Canada's economy and sovereignty with tariffs, most offensively by claiming Canada could be “the 51st state.”

Jason Kenney, a former Conservative cabinet minister under ex-Prime Minister Stephen Harper, called Trump's posts “just embarrassing.”

“The Ontario ad does not misrepresent President Reagan's anti-tariff radio address in any respect whatsoever. It is a direct replay of his radio address, formatted for a one minute ad,” Kenney posted on social media.

Kenney also took aim at the Reagan Foundation, saying it “now has gormless leadership which is easily intimidated by a call from the White House, yet another sign of the hugely corrosive influence of Trump on the American conservative movement.”

The U.S. military is sending an aircraft carrier to the waters off South America, in the latest escalation and buildup of military forces in the region, the Pentagon announced Friday.

President Donald Trump‘s defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford and its strike group to deploy to U.S. Southern Command to “bolster U.S. capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States,” Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a social media post.

Deploying an aircraft carrier is a major escalation of military power in a region that has already seen an unusually large U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean Sea and the waters off Venezuela.

The U.S. military has conducted its 10th strike on a suspected drug-running boat, leaving six people dead, Hegseth said earlier Friday, blaming the Tren de Aragua gang for operating the vessel. The pace of the strikes has quickened in recent days from one every few weeks when they first began to three this week, killing a total of at least 43 people since September.

The Trump administration is rejecting the idea of using roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep food aid flowing amid the government shutdown, according to a Department of Agriculture memo that surfaced Friday. States temporarily covering the cost of benefits next month will not be reimbursed, the memo says.

Democratic lawmakers and various advocacy groups have been calling on the administration to use the contingency fund to provide partial benefits into November though the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly referred to as SNAP.

The prospect of SNAP benefits running out as a result of the shutdown has become a major concern. Lawmakers from both political parties are blaming the other for the hardship that would ensue. The program helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries.

The document states that the contingency fund is reserved for such things as helping individuals in disaster areas.

President Donald Trump pulled out of trade talks with Canada Thursday, furious over what he called a “fake'' television ad from Ontario's provincial government that quoted former President Ronald Reagan from 38 years ago criticizing tariffs -- Trump's favorite economic tool.



A federal appeals court has paused a decision from a three-judge panel that could have allowed Trump to deploy 200 Oregon National Guard troops, ostensibly to protect federal property in the city. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it needs until Tuesday to decide whether to reconsider the panel's decision.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, earlier this month issued two temporary restraining orders prohibiting Trump from deploying troops to Portland. The first order — which was appealed by the administration — barred the deployment of 200 Oregon National Guard members. The second barred the deployment of any troops at all, after the Trump administration sought to deploy troops from California and Texas.

A 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel put the first order on hold on Monday, but the second order remained in effect, blocking him from actually deploying them.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says the department won't tolerate violence like the truck that rammed into a Coast Guard station in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Trump had said he's easing off of a planned surge of federal agents to San Francisco, but Noem suggested that might change if more violence occurs.

Speaking at a Minneapolis news conference, Noem said that in a discussion Friday morning the president called the incident “their one chance” and suggested that if state and local leaders “don't figure out how to protect our law enforcement officers and protect our Coast Guard members, that we would be forced to come in and protect those individuals.”

Trump is urging his supporters in New Jersey to back Republican Jack Ciattarelli during a nine-day early voting period in the race for governor.

Trump spoke for about 10 minutes at a telephone rally backing Ciattarelli Friday evening before the president was scheduled to leave for a trip to Asia.

He said Ciattarelli will focus relentlessly on reducing energy costs, repeating the cost-of-living message he emphasized in a Truth Social post earlier this week.

“He knows energy better than anybody I know outside of the energy business,” Trump said. He noted his own ties to New Jersey, where he owns a golf club and spends many of his weekends in the summer.

Trump urged voters with mail ballots to send them in, then returned to his longstanding criticism of mail ballots and cast doubt on the integrity of the election.

“Sometimes I think you're better off in person, but you do it the way you want to do it,” Trump said. “You got to make sure the votes are counted, because New Jersey has a little bit of a rough reputation, I must be honest.”

Kate Rogers says she resigned Thursday, after Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick wrote a letter to the Alamo Trust's Board of Directors suggesting she either resign or be removed, questioning her “judgement” over an academic paper she wrote in 2023.

“It was with mixed emotions that I resigned my post as President and CEO at the Alamo Trust yesterday,” Rogers said in a statement texted to The Associated Press. “It became evident through recent events that it was time for me to move on.”

In an excerpt from her paper she posted online, Rogers noted the Texas Legislature's “conservative agenda” in 2023, including bills to limit what could be taught about race and slavery. Her paper also mentioned the book “Forget the Alamo,” which challenges traditional historical narratives surrounding the site's 13-day siege.

“She has a totally different view of how the history of the Alamo should be told,” Patrick wrote to the board.

Patrick's call for Rogers' ouster follows Trump's pressure to get Smithsonian museums in Washington to put less emphasis on slavery and other dishonorable parts of American history.

Alameda County Sheriff Yesenia Sanchez says she's been told by federal immigration officials that an operation has been called off for the entire region.

Trump said Thursday he was calling off a surge of federal forces to San Francisco after conversations with the mayor and tech leaders. Those comments came as U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents began arriving at a U.S. Coast Guard base in nearby Alameda. Trump had previously said he would send the National Guard to San Francisco.

Local officials wondered if Trump would send federal agents into other parts of the Bay Area, a nine-county region of about 8 million people.

Alameda County Sheriff Sgt. Roberto Morales, a spokesperson for Sanchez, said Friday that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials informed the sheriff Thursday afternoon that the operation had been called off for the whole region.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement, didn't immediately comment.

The State Department announced the move Friday after the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Colombian President Gustavo Petro over accusations of involvement in the global drug trade.

U.S. assistance to the country is expected to fall by at least 20%, or roughly $18 million, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to offer details that have not been made public. The amount was an estimate and could change.

A State Department statement Friday didn't specify the dollar amount affected.

It comes after the Trump administration last month added Colombia, the top recipient of American assistance in the region, to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years.Trump has vowed to pull all payments to Colombia.

The Department of Homeland Security says the two planes purchased this month replace planes that were 20 years old and experiencing maintenance problems.

The department has come under criticism for buying two Coast Guard planes while the government is shut down.

Homeland Security said in a statement Friday that the aircraft are required for official travel for the secretary, the deputy secretary and four top command positions in the Coast Guard.

The department said those aircraft have to have certain capabilities such as communications system that can handle top secret information that allow senior officials to manage a situation wherever they are.

Sean Plankey, a senior adviser to the secretary for the Coast Guard, accused critics of “playing politics with the funding of the Coast Guard” and said the planes were important for “safety and mission readiness.”

The ongoing government shutdown continues to disrupt flights at times and put pressure on air traffic controllers who are working without pay.

The announcement Friday raises ethical questions after Trump had said a friend offered the gift to defray any shortfalls.

While large and unusual, the gift amounts to a small contribution toward the billions needed to cover service member paychecks. The Trump administration told Congress last week that it used $6.5 billion to make payroll. The next payday is coming within the week, and it's unclear if the administration will again move money around to ensure the military does not go without compensation.

“The donation was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of Service members' salaries and benefits,” said Sean Parnell, a Pentagon spokesman.

Military pay is a key concern among lawmakers of both parties as well as a point of political leverage.

District Judge Jeffrey Cummings pressed attorneys representing the federal government over missing the deadline for a report regarding over 1,000 potential warrantless arrests since June.

Earlier this month, Cummings ruled that federal immigration agents illegally arrested 26 people in the Midwest during the early days of Trump's second term, in violation of a 2022 consent decree that bans ICE from arresting people without warrants or probable cause. 

Cummings ordered ICE to make monthly disclosures of how many warrantless arrests agents make and produce the report. Cummings emphasized the importance of getting information about these arrests quickly so that the people impacted could seek justice. 

Attorneys also dodged Cummings' repeated questions about the conditions people arrested without warrants may be facing while detained and if they have access to advice from lawyers.

“We've got to speed this process up,” he said. "...I want that information to be made available to the plaintiffs as quickly as possible.”

Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said Friday that countries cannot violate another nation's sovereignty or constitution in the name of fighting drug trafficking.

Speaking to reporters in Jakarta, Indonesia, Lula was responding to recent comments by Trump, who recently said Latin American drug cartels were the ISIS of Western hemisphere.

“It would be much better if the U.S. were willing to talk with the police of other countries, with the justice ministries of other countries, to do something jointly,” Lula said. “If this becomes a trend. if each one thinks they can invade another's territory to do whatever they want , where is the respect for the sovereignty of nations?”

Lula added that he intends to raise the issue with Trump during their in-person meeting Sunday in Malaysia, “if he brings it to the table.”

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, says she'll rule by Monday.

She issued two temporary restraining orders earlier this month — one prohibiting Trump from calling up Oregon troops to Portland, and another blocking him from sending any Guard members to Oregon at all after he tried to evade the first order by deploying California troops instead.

A federal appeals court panel on Monday put the first ruling on hold. Now Immergut must decide whether to dissolve her second order, which the administration has not appealed.

The DOJ has insisted Immergut is required to immediately dissolve the second order because its reasoning was the same as the first. Attorneys for Oregon disagree, saying the second order is distinct and that she should wait to see if the 9th Circuit will reconsider the panel's ruling.

Meanwhile Immergut has set a trial to begin next Wednesday on the merits of the case.

The Treasury Department leveled the penalties against President Gustavo Petro; his wife, Veronica del Socorro Alcocer Garcia; his son, Nicolas Fernando Petro Burgos; and Colombian Interior Minister Armando Alberto Benedetti.

The administration is accusing Petro's government of involvement in the global drug trade, sharply escalating tensions with the leftist leader of one of the closest U.S. allies in South America.

Petro “has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. “President Trump is taking strong action to protect our nation and make clear that we will not tolerate the trafficking of drugs into our nation.” 

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province had sponsored the ad, made the announcement Friday afternoon.

Ford said after talking with Prime Minister Mark Carney he's decided to pause the advertising campaign effective Monday so that trade talks can resume. Ford said they've achieved their goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels. 

“Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses,” Ford said. “We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels.”

A spokesperson for Ford had said earlier Friday that the ad will run during a Game 1 of the World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers.

The Brooklyn lawmaker said Democrats have a “clear obligation to push back against” Republican extremism, even as he acknowledged he had “areas of principled disagreement” with his party's nominee for mayor.

Mamdani, in a statement, said he looked forward to “fighting Trump's authoritarianism” alongside Jeffries.Jeffries has for months declined to officially throw his support behind Mamdani, a Democratic socialist state lawmaker who upended the New York political establishment when he handed former Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo a resounding and stunning defeat in the June primary.

Cuomo is still running in the November general election, but as an independent. Republican Curtis Sliwa is also on the ballot, as is Mayor Eric Adams, though the embattled Democrat dropped out of the race last month and has endorsed Cuomo.

The top Democrats on congressional intelligence committees are demanding information about the Trump administration's escalating strikes on drug-running vessels, which have killed at least 43 people.

U.S. Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut and Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia wrote to Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard Friday asking about the intelligence service's role in the strikes.

In the letter to Gabbard the lawmakers wrote that the administration is withholding important information about the strikes and their effects, including the evidence that prompted the strikes and the justification for lethal force.

“Please tell us in writing whether IC (intelligence community) attorneys have independently analyzed the legality of these strikes and the potential for legal repercussions for IC personnel who support them,” the lawmakers wrote.

Gabbard's office did not immediately respond to the letter.

The drumbeat of deadly strikes on the alleged drug boats and the tough talk from Trump about a possible land incursion into Venezuela are widely viewed in Congress, on both sides of the political aisle, as a potential escalation of military involvement in the region.

Ahead of Friday's announcement that the U.S. military is sending an aircraft carrier to the waters off South America, Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said there is a growing concern on both sides of the political aisle over the Pentagon's lack of transparency to Congress.

“Who are these people, what's the plan?” Smith told AP in an interview late Thursday. “They're basically saying: Drug dealers, we killed them, trust us, end of story.”

Smith said, “It has the whiff of extrajudicial killings.”

In the Senate, a bipartisan war powers resolution led by Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine that would block military action in Venezuela is heading toward a vote in coming weeks.

Trade Representative Jamieson Greer says his office launched an investigation of China's implementation of the trade deal struck about six years ago during the first Trump administration, when Beijing agreed to buy more U.S. farm goods and other products. 

The deal, often called the Phase One Agreement, stalled when the COVID-19 pandemic started. The announcement by Greer came on the same day Trump is scheduled to embark on a trip to Asia, where he said he will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping about trade issues. 

Beijing says Xi will travel to South Korea but has yet to confirm a meeting with Trump. Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade official, said Washington, by taking this move, might be seeking new leverage over Beijing in trade negotiations.

The president, along with first lady Melania Trump, will host a trick-or-treat on the South Lawn of the White House next week.

The event will be held Oct. 30, once Trump returns from a three-country visit to Asia.

The first lady's office says thousands of children and their parents will attend, including military families, law enforcement families, foster and adoptive families, and administration officials with children.

The Trumps will hand out “commemorative candies,” the first lady's office said, as Halloween tunes play in the background and the U.S Postal Service hosts a “BE BEST” postcard station for children.

The Associated Press first reported Friday that the Department of Justice is planning to monitor polling sites in Passaic County, New Jersey, and five counties in southern and central California: Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside and Fresno in next month's off-year elections. The goal, according to the DOJ, is “to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.”

Democrats in both states criticized the action.

New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin called the move “highly inappropriate” and said the DOJ “has not even attempted to identify a legitimate basis for its actions.”

And Rusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic Party, said in a statement that “No amount of election interference by the California Republican Party is going to silence the voices of California voters.”

The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend the leaders meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping in Gyeongju, South Korea, next week.

The announcement, however, didn't confirm a meeting with Trump, who is leaving Washington on Friday for his Asia trip, where he says he will meet the Chinese leader over trade issues.

Beijing said Xi also would pay a state visit to South Korea.

The USS Ford is currently deployed to the Mediterranean Sea along with three destroyers. It would likely take several days for the ships to make the journey to South America.

A spokesperson for Ontario's premier says the ad that prompted Trump to announce he's ending all trade negotiations with Canada will run during Game 1 of the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers series on Friday night. 

The Ontario government has said it would pay about $75 million Canadian ($54 million U.S.) for the ads to air across multiple American television stations. They use audio and video of former President Ronald Reagan speaking about tariffs in 1987. 

The Pentagon's announcement came after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the U.S. military has conducted its 10th strike on a suspected drug-running boat. 

He blamed the Tren de Aragua gang for operating the vessel and leaving six people dead in the Caribbean Sea.

In a social media post, Hegseth said the strike occurred overnight, and it marks the second time the Trump administration has tied one of its operations to the gang that originated in a Venezuelan prison.

The pace of the strikes has quickened in recent days from one every few weeks when they first began to three this week, killing a total of at least 43 people since September.

Republican Laura Swett is the new chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas and other energy infrastructure.

Swett, a lawyer, replaces Democrat David Rosner, who led the panel the past two months. Rosner remains on the five-member commission, which now includes three Republicans and two Democrats.

The Senate confirmed Swett and fellow Republican David LaCerte to the energy panel earlier this month. LaCerte has served as White House liaison and senior adviser in the Office of Personnel Management, prompting concerns from Democrats about his independence.

Swett's appointment comes as the Trump administration seeks to boost fossil fuels and data center development. She said in a statement that she looks forward to continuing the commission's “crucial mission of ensuring reliable and affordable energy for all consumers.”

Gary Peters of Michigan is calling for an investigation of the Department of Homeland Security's purchase of two Coast Guard planes.

The department purchased the fixed-wing aircraft on Oct. 17, according to a listing in the Federal Procurement Data System which details federal contracts. The two aircraft were purchased by the Coast Guard, which falls under Homeland Security.

The listing didn't give a specific reason for the purchase, but historically the department has used Coast Guard planes to transport the secretary and other senior Homeland Security officials.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the purchases during a news conference this week, saying they were to replace 25-year old Coast Guard planes and that Congress had appropriated the money.

Peters is the ranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

The New York attorney general addressed a crowd of supporters after appearing in court in Virginia and pleading not guilty.

James thanked the people who had gathered outside the courthouse and who chanted “we stand with Tish!”

She said the justice system had been weaponized. It “has been used as a tool of revenge, and a weapon against those individuals who simply did their job and who stood up for the rule of law,” she told the crowd.

The House Democratic leader is urging the Trump administration to deploy a $5 billion emergency contingency fund to ensure that food assistance for millions of Americans continues on Nov. 1

The fate of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is becoming a deep concern as it gets closer to Nov. 1, when the benefits could dry up without either a resolution of the federal government shutdown or other action.

Jeffries was asked Friday at a Capitol press conference if he was confident that SNAP recipients would be able to continue to access their benefits. He said the administration has the resources to ensure than not a single American goes hungry on Nov. 1.

He accused Republicans of “trying to weaponize hunger” and called it unconscionable.

It would be the first time on record that the government did not issue the monthly inflation report, which provides crucial pricing data that is closely watched by financial markets and the Federal Reserve.

“Because surveyors cannot deploy to the field, the White House has learned there will likely NOT be an inflation release next month for the first time in history,” the Trump administration said in an email.

The announcement follows Friday's release of September inflation data, which showed prices ticked higher but not by as much as many economists expected. The Fed is likely to cut its key interest rate next month as it grows more concerned about sluggish hiring than inflation.

“Stay tuned,” the House minority leader and Brooklyn native says. 

Jeffries had said he would announce his position before early voting begins, and New Yorkers head to the polls starting Saturday. “I have not refused to endorse. I have refused to articulate my position, and I will momentarily at some point in advance of early voting,” Jeffries reiterated to reporters.

Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has become a lightning rod in national politics. But Jeffries resisted claims that his abstention from endorsing Mamdani is dividing his party. Democrats are “as unified as I've seen us throughout the entirety of this year” ahead of elections in Virginia, New Jersey and California, Jeffries said.

The New York attorney general pleaded not guilty on Friday to federal charges accusing her of lying on mortgage papers to secure favorable loan terms in a case pushed by Trump.

Her lawyers have already signaled they will challenge the appointment of the U.S. attorney who brought the indictment after the resignation of Erik Siebert, longtime prosecutor who resisted Trump administration pressure to bring charges. Siebert was replaced with Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide and former Trump lawyer who had never previously served as a federal prosecutor and presented James' case to the grand jury herself.

James' lawyers asked the judge to prohibit prosecutors from disclosing information from the case outside court, citing the revelation that Halligan used an encrypted messaging platform to contact a reporter from Lawfare, who then published her texts about the case. “The exchange was a stunning disclosure of internal government information,” lawyers for James wrote.

Letitia James is set to make her first court appearance on Friday. She's the third Trump adversary to face a judge on federal charges in recent weeks.

James was indicted on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection with the 2020 purchase in Norfolk, Virginia, of a home where her relatives have lived. The charges came shortly after the Trump publicly called on the Justice Department to take action against James and other political foes.

James, a Democrat who has sued Trump and his administration dozens of times, has denied wrongdoing and decried the indictment as “nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system.”

“Transparency at the polls translates into faith in the electoral process, and this Department of Justice is committed to upholding the highest standards of election integrity,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement to The Associated Press.

The federal election observers will monitor the states' off-year elections following requests from state Republican parties, at sites in Passaic County, New Jersey, and five counties in southern and central California: Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside and Fresno. 

Election monitoring is a routine function of the Justice Department, but California and New Jersey are holding elections with national consequences on Nov. 4. New Jersey's open seat for governor has attracted major spending by both parties, and California's special election enables voters to approve or reject a redrawing of the state's congressional map to counter Republican gerrymandering efforts elsewhere ahead of the 2026 midterms.

U.S. stocks are heading for records on Friday after an update on inflation came in a bit less painful than feared.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9% and was on track to top its all-time high, which was set earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 411 points, or 0.9%, as of 10:15 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.2% higher. Both were also rising toward records.

The inflation data could mean less pain for lower- and middle-income households struggling with still-high increases in prices every month. Even more importantly for Wall Street, it could also clear the way for the Federal Reserve to keep cutting interest rates in hopes of giving a boost to the slowing job market.

Marco Rubio's visit Friday of the center in Israel is the latest by a top U.S. official as the Trump administration works to set up an international security force to maintain the tenuous truce between Israel and Hamas.

Around 200 U.S. troops are working alongside the Israeli military and delegations from other countries at the center for civilian and military coordination, planning Gaza's stabilization and reconstruction. On Friday, an Associated Press reporter saw international personnel there with flags from Cyprus, Greece, France, Germany, Australia and Canada.

“I think we have a lot to be proud of in the first 10 days, 11 days, 12 days of implementation, where we have faced real challenges along the way,” said Rubio.

Rubio named the U.S. ambassador to Yemen, Steven Fagin, to lead the civilian side, while the center's top military official is Adm. Brad Cooper of the U.S. Central Command.

The U.S. military has conducted its 10th strike on a suspected drug-running boat, killing six more people in the Caribbean, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Friday. 

Hegseth blamed Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang. In a 20-second black and white video of the strike posted to social media, a small boat can be seen apparently sitting motionless on the water when a long thin projectile descends on it, triggering an explosion.

Trump said Thursday he isn't planning to ask Congress to issue a declaration of war against the cartels: “I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK? We're going to kill them, you know? They're going to be like, dead.”

Jason Kenney, who served in former Prime Minister Stephen Harper's cabinet, said “The Ontario ad does not misrepresent President Reagan's anti-tariff radio address in any respect whatsoever. It is a direct replay of his radio address, formatted for a one minute ad.”

“Everything that Reagan said in his pro-free trade April, 1987 radio message is consistent with the ad. In fact, everything he ever said about trade, before and after becoming President, is consistent with his principled opposition to tariffs,” Kenney added in a social media post Friday.

Kenney also took aim at the Reagan foundation.

“They know perfectly well that the Ontario ad captures precisely President Reagan's opposition to tariffs, and support for free trade. But it is obvious that the Foundation now has gormless leadership which is easily intimidated by a call from the White House, yet another sign of the hugely corrosive influence of Trump on the American conservative movement.”

Hillary Clinton's Onward Together PAC is leveraging Trump's demolition of the White House East Wing into a fundraising opportunity ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, selling hats and stickers with the message: “Not His House. Our House.”

“If you're hopping mad about Trump destroying the White House, we've got a new hat or sticker for you,” the 2016 Democratic nominee against Trump posted Friday on Instagram. “Your purchase supports progressive groups working to build a fairer, more inclusive America for everyone — and win elections!”

Onward Together PAC says it has contributed nearly $1 million to more than 225 candidates since 2017, the majority of them women, and that 62% have won their races.

The hat sells for $35. The sticker sells for $8. The merchandise also features an image of the iconic North Portico of the White House, facing Pennsylvania Avenue.

That television ad that the provincial government of Ontario sponsored, showing President Reagan's opposition to tariffs? It's airing across the United States.

Ontario bought more than $275,000 of ad reservations for the spot to air in 198 of the nation's 210 media markets this month, according to data from the nonpartisan media tracking firm AdImpact. 

The vast majority of markets saw the ad once. It was broadcast most frequently in the New York market, with more than 530 airings, followed by Washington, D.C., at around 280. The only other markets with more than 100 airings were those around Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and West Palm Beach, Florida.

Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia rounded out the markets with at least 10 airings.

Video showed what appeared to be a U-Haul truck trying to back into the base in Alameda. The truck drove away and no Coast Guard personnel were hurt after the shots were fired at about 10 p.m. Thursday, the Coast Guard posted on X.

“Coast Guard personnel issued multiple verbal commands to stop the vehicle, the driver failed to comply and proceeded to put the vehicle in reverse,” the statement said. “When the vehicle's actions posed a direct threat to the safety of Coast Guard and security personnel, law enforcement officers discharged several rounds of live fire.”

The Coast Guard said the FBI was investigating. The FBI and U-Haul did not immediately respond to emails seeking further information.

A crowd had gathered earlier Thursday to protest a planned surge of federal agents, which Trump called off after hearing from several billionaires and San Francisco's mayor. 

The former Justice Department special counsel says he's ready to testify before Congress in an open hearing, responding to Republicans' demands that he answer for investigations he led into Trump's storage of classified documents and attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

A letter to both the House and Senate committee overseeing the Justice Department from Smith's attorneys says that “Mr. Smith steadfastly adhered to established legal standards and Department of Justice guidelines.”

Smith is essentially daring Republicans and the Justice Department to allow him to speak openly. 

He has come under scrutiny from GOP lawmakers after the FBI revealed that his investigation analyzed phone records for a handful of lawmakers as part of the investigation into Trump's attempt to overturn the presidential election.

In cutting off trade talks with Canada, Trump cited the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute's claim that an ad sponsored by the province of Ontario misrepresented the 40th U.S. president's remarks on tariffs.

The foundation in Simi Valley, Calif., is perhaps best known for maintaining the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum, which has the plane Reagan used as Air Force One on display and has hosted GOP presidential primary debates. 

Its board includes longtime Republican Party stalwarts such as former Trump Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who resigned after the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the Capitol, and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, whose free-market philosophy often clashes with Trump's protectionist tendencies. 

Another board member is Lachlan Murdoch, the son of Rupert who is executive chairman and CEO of Fox Corporation. The board is chaired by Fred Ryan, the former publisher and CEO of The Washington Post.

Many Hispanic voters were motivated by economic concerns in last year's presidential election. A new AP-NORC poll shows that despite Trump's promises of economic revitalization, they continue to feel higher financial stress than Americans more broadly.

“Now it's like, OK, you're in office. I'm still getting done dirty at the grocery store. I'm still spending an insane amount of money,” said Alejandro Ochoa, 30, a warehouse worker in Adelanto, California, who said she voted for Trump in 2024.

According to the survey, 65% of Hispanic adults say the cost of groceries is a “major” source of stress in their lives right now, compared to 54% of Americans overall. And 61% of Hispanic adults say this about the cost of housing, compared to 45% of Americans overall.

The new AP-NORC poll also finds that Hispanic adults are slightly less likely to approve of Trump's handling of immigration and the economy than they were earlier in the year.

In March, 41% of Hispanic adults approved of the way Trump was handling his job as president, but now that has fallen to 27%.

The poll found particularly high levels of financial stress among Hispanic adults, compared to Americans overall, and Latino communities have also been a target of the president's aggressive immigration tactics. Some see the two issues as linked. Trump's attacks on immigration have affected low-wage and high-skilled workers alike, at a moment when the economy is already uncertain because of his erratic trade policies.

Passive investing through exchange-traded funds may be losing its appeal.

Tidal Financial Group Chief Revenue Officer Gavin Filmore finds many of his clients are no longer satisfied with buying popular ETFs tied to market indexes.

 "I think investors are looking beyond just the let's call it the 'VOO and chill approach' where you just buy the index in an ETF, which is a great approach but they're looking for diversification," Filmore told CNBC's "ETF Edge" this week." "And they're not finding it within the product or within the index, so they have to look beyond that." 

Filmore refers to the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which tracks the S&P 500's performance. Both are up almost 16% so far this year.

Meanwhile, Strategas Securities' Todd Sohn contends investors are losing diversification by using the S&P 500 as a benchmark.

"Imbalance is the perfect word," said the firm's senior ETF & technical strategist in the same interview. He added technology now accounts for more than 35% of the index, a record high.

Meanwhile, defensive sectors including consumer staples, health care, energy and utilities are at an all-time low weight of 19% in the S&P 500, according to FactSet.

So, where are traders turning? Sohn is seeing renewed interest in small-cap stocks.

The Russell 2000, which tracks the group, hit an all-time high on Wednesday and just saw its best week since August. It's now up more than 28% over the past six months — outperforming the S&P 500. Earlier this month, the Russell 2000 topped 2,500 for the first time ever.

"I wonder if you're seeing this broadening happen outside the large cap space where investors are comfortable with their tech and AI exposure and seeking other routes," Sohn said.

While there is a growing chorus of voices throwing support behind the small caps, the heavy hitters will take center stage on Wall Street next week. That's when five of the seven so-called "Magnificent 7" — Meta Platforms, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon — are due to report their latest earnings.

Tropical Storm Melissa neared hurricane strength Saturday and was expected to rapidly intensify this weekend, as forecasters warned of massive rainfall and life-threatening flooding and landslides in the northern Caribbean.

An astounding 35 inches (89 centimeters) of rain was anticipated in southwest Haiti.

The erratic and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.

Up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain was forecast for Jamaica and the southern regions of Haiti and the Dominican Republic through Monday, with up to 35 inches (89 centimeters) of rain possible across Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.

"Unfortunately for places along the projected path of this storm, (the news) it is increasingly dire," said Jamie Rhome, the center's deputy director. "We think it will become a hurricane later today." He said it will continue to move slowly for up to four days.

Melissa was located about 155 miles (245 kilometers) southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and about 235 miles (375 kilometers) southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. It had maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 kph) and was slowly moving west-northwest at 1 mph (2 kph), according to the hurricane center.

"Rapid intensification is forecast to begin over the next 24 hours. Melissa is forecast to become a hurricane shortly and a major hurricane by Sunday," the center added on Saturday.

A hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica and a hurricane watch remained in place for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti.

The center of Melissa is expected to move near or over Jamaica early next week, forecasters said. Melissa was expected to become a major hurricane by Sunday and possibly reach Category 4 status by early Monday, U.S. forecasters said. It is forecast to hit eastern Cuba early Wednesday, where up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) could fall in some areas.

Authorities in Jamaica warned that all airports would close within 24 hours if a hurricane warning is issued. More than 650 shelters were activated. Officials said warehouses across the island were well-stocked and thousands of food packages prepositioned for quick distribution if needed.

"I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously," said Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. "Take all measures to protect yourself."

The hurricane center confirmed the risks in a key message Saturday afternoon.

"Jamaica prep should be completed today. Melissa's slow motion brings multi-day damaging winds plus heavy rainfall, catastrophic flash flooding, landslides, damage, long-duration power communication outages, isolation," the center said.

Haitian authorities said three people had died as a consequence of the hurricane and another five were injured due to a collapsed wall. There were also reports of rising river levels, flooding and a bridge destroyed due to breached riverbanks in Sainte-Suzanne, in the northeast.

"The storm is causing a lot of concern with the way it's moving," said Ronald Délice, a Haitian department director of civil protection, as local authorities organized lines to distribute food kits. Many residents are still reluctant to leave their homes.

The storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic and knocked out water supply systems, affecting more than half a million customers. It also downed trees and traffic lights, unleashed a couple of small landslides and left more than two dozen communities isolated by floodwaters.

The Bahamas Department of Meteorology said Melissa could bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to islands in the Southeast and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by early next week.

Melissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had predicted an above-normal season with 13 to 18 named storms.

One quality separates the most successful business owners from all others, according to billionaire Jimmy John Liautaud: They work really, really hard.

In that vein, the 61-year-old founder and former chairman of the Jimmy John's sandwich chain doesn't believe in work-life balance, he said in a TikTok video posted by The School of Hardknocks on Oct. 9. 

"Work-life balance [for entrepreneurs] is the biggest line of bulls--- that's ever been created," he said. "There's no such thing as work-life balance. When you're going to squeeze lemonade out of horses---, you've got to squeeze really, really hard ... To create something from nothing, there is no such thing."

Liautaud speaks from experience: Despite graduating second-to-last in his high school class, he created a billion-dollar brand, he said. He launched his first sandwich shop in Charleston, Illinois in 1983, as a 19-year-old with a $25,000 loan from his father — and spent the next 36 years carefully and persistently growing his business, he told the "American Optimist" podcast during an October 2024 episode.

In his first 10 years of business, for example, Liautaud only opened stores that he operated himself — 10 of them, all in Illinois, he said. From that foundation, he eventually franchised out additional locations across the country. Jimmy John's now has over 2,600 locations across 45 states.

In September 2016, Liautaud sold his majority stake in the company, 65% of the business, to Atlanta-based private equity firm Roark Capital Group at a valuation of "about $3.5 billion," he said in the TikTok video. He stepped down as chairman in October 2019, after Roark-owned Inspire Brands acquired the rest of Jimmy John's for an undisclosed sum.

DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate better

As with any business, the sandwich chain's growth path was hardly linear or straightforward, Liautaud noted. In 2002, for example, 70 of the then-200 Jimmy John's locations were struggling to become profitable, he said.

His response: Teach the franchise owners a lesson in work ethic, he said. "I said, 'If you're going to go into the sandwich business, this is 24/7 365. If you're in the cattle business, cattle need to get fed on Sunday. They need to get fed on Christmas day,'" said Liautaud.

"I started telling people the truth about the business," he continued. "If you're going to do this, you better be ready to be a grinder."

Liautaud currently has an estimated net worth of $2.4 billion, according to Forbes.

Other highly successful entrepreneurs built their businesses using a similar mindset. Bill Gates didn't believe in vacations or weekends during Microsoft's early days, and Elon Musk has been known to occasionally sleep at the office and work throughout the night. Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang works "from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep," he said during a May 2024 interview with Stripe CEO Patrick Collision.

Now, some of them opt for more sleep and better time-management. Gates regrets his previous workaholic lifestyle, he told students at Northern Arizona University's commencement ceremony in May 2023.

"Don't wait as long as I did to learn this lesson," Gates said. "Take time to nurture your relationships. To celebrate your successes. And to recover from your losses. Take a break when you need to. Take it easy on the people around you when they need it, too."

For Cameron Pappas, owner of Norton's Florist in Birmingham, Alabama, the artificial intelligence boom is a world away.

While companies like Nvidia, Alphabet and Broadcom are lifting the stock market to fresh highs and bolstering GDP, Pappas is experiencing what's happening in the real economy, one that's far removed from Wall Street and Silicon Valley.

Small businesses like Norton's, and companies of all sizes in retail, construction and hospitality, are struggling from higher costs brought by the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs, and as downbeat consumers reduce their spending.

"We've just got an eagle eye on all of our costs," Pappas, 36, told CNBC in an interview.

Norton's generated $4 million in revenue last year, selling flowers, plants and gifts to locals. To avoid raising prices, which could cause customers to flee, Pappas has been forced to get creative, reworking some of his designs.

"If a bouquet has 25 stems in it, if you reduce that by three to four stems, then you're able to keep the price the same," Pappas said. "It's really forced us to focus on that and to make sure that we're pricing things the best that we possibly can."

Pappas' story and many like it are being masked in the macro data by the power of AI. In the first half of the year, AI-related capital expenditures contributed to 1.1% of GDP growth, according to a September report from JPMorgan Chase. That spending outpaced the U.S. consumer "as an engine of expansion," the report said.

Total U.S. GDP increased at an annual rate of 3.8% during the second quarter of 2025 after falling 0.5% in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said.

U.S. manufacturing spending has contracted for seven straight months, according to the Institute for Supply Management. And construction spending has been flat to down, due to high interest rates and rising costs. Cushman & Wakefield said in a report this month that total project costs for construction in the fourth quarter will be up 4.6% from a year earlier because of tariffs on building materials.

The stock market shows a similar disconnect between AI and everybody else.

Eight tech companies are valued at $1 trillion or more and, to varying degrees, are all tied to AI. Those companies — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Broadcom — make up about 37% of the S&P 500. Nvidia, with a $4.5 trillion market cap, accounts for over 7% of the benchmark's value by itself.

Investors are giddy about the massive investments they're seeing in AI infrastructure. Broadcom shares are up more than 50% this year after more than doubling in each of the prior two years, while Nvidia and Alphabet have jumped almost 40% in 2025.

That explains why the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are up 15% and 20%, respectively, reaching record highs on Friday, even as the government shutdown continues to cause economic angst.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 subgroups that include consumer discretionary and consumer staples companies have increased by less than 5% year to date.

The latest troubling sign in the consumer market came on Thursday, when Target said it's cutting 1,800 corporate jobs — the retailer's first major round of layoffs in a decade. Target shares have plunged 30% this year.

"I think the message that the AI economy is sort of driving up the GDP numbers is a correct one," Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, told CNBC in an interview. "There may be weakness in the rest of the economy, or not weakness, but there may be more modest growth."

Investors will hear all about AI in the coming days, the busiest stretch of the quarter for tech earnings, and will be listening closely for additional guidance on capital expenditures. Meta, Microsoft and Alphabet report on Wednesday, followed by Apple and Amazon on Thursday.

Last month, Nvidia announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, a startup valued at $500 billion. The capital will help OpenAI deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems, which is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 8 million U.S. households.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices have doubled this year and soared more than 20% earlier this month after the chipmaker announced a deal with OpenAI, while Oracle has been on a tear of late due to its ties to OpenAI and the broader infrastructure buildouts.

"Are we sort of inflating the economy now, thereby setting ourselves up for a crash in the future?" Sundararajan said. He added that he's not seeing signs that demand for AI infrastructure will slow anytime soon.

When it comes to local businesses, most only know about the AI gold rush from the news headlines. One in four small business owners are stuck in "survival mode" as they contend with challenges like rising costs and tariffs, according to a September KeyBank Survey. It's a segment of the economy that routinely accounts for about 40% of the nation's GDP.

Pappas' flower shop was founded in 1921, and purchased by his dad in 2002. The business has survived the Great Depression, World War II and the Covid pandemic. Pappas said his father, who died in 2022, reminded him that these periods were "just another season" for Norton's, and that such challenges come with the territory.

But Trump's tariffs have created a whole new set of constraints, as roughly 80% of all cut flowers in the U.S. are imported from countries like Colombia and Ecuador, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

There's no way for Norton's to avoid higher import costs, but Pappas said he's started buying some flowers directly from South American growers, which saves him money versus going through distributors that charge extra.

Pappas said it's part of his "tariff price management" effort.

Trump's tariffs will cost global businesses more than $1.2 trillion this year, and most of those costs are being passed onto consumers, according to S&P Global.

With the holiday season rapidly approaching, consumer sentiment is of particular importance. The picture is bleak.

The majority of U.S. consumers, 57%, that responded to a Deloitte survey published this month said they expect the economy to weaken in the year ahead, up from 30% a year ago. It's the most negative outlook since the consulting firm began tracking sentiment in 1997.

Gen Z consumers, which the survey defined as ages 18 to 28, said they plan to spend an average of 34% less this holiday season compared to last year. Millennials, those between 29 and 44, said they expect to spend an average of 13% less this holiday season.

Additionally, seasonal hiring in the retail industry is poised to fall to its lowest level since the 2009 recession, according to a September report from job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

The firm released another report earlier this month that showed new hiring in the U.S. has totaled just under 205,000 so far this year, off 58% from the same period last year.

Starbucks announced a $1 billion restructuring plan in September that involves closing several stores in North America. Around 900 nonretail employees were laid off as part of the plan, and the company let go of another 1,100 corporate workers earlier this year.

Starbucks shares are down about 6% this year.

Shares of Wyndham Hotels & Resorts slumped on Thursday after the hotel chain issued disappointing third-quarter results. CEO Geoff Ballotti cited a "challenging macro backdrop" in the company's earnings release. The stock is down roughly 25% year to date.

Even in parts of the tech industry that have benefited the most from the AI boom, companies have been conducting layoffs. Microsoft announced plans to cut around 9,000 jobs in July, which the company partly attributed to reducing layers of management. Salesforce is one of a number of tech companies that have announced layoffs, saying that AI can now handle the work.

But Hatim Rahman, an associate professor specializing in AI at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, said that most businesses using AI for efficiencies won't find them right away. So companies can't count on the technology to counter declining revenue and, Rahman said, "the road to the future is going to be bumpy."

"AI is not a plug-and-play solution," Rahman said. "For many organizations, it's going to involve engagement with people, processes, culture, tools to be able to reap the benefits. And in the aggregate, it's going to take time."

WATCH: The AI boom is lifting the stock market, but it may be masking a weaker economy

Hundreds of thousands of federal workers have been sent home amid the government shutdown. One of them has been using his newfound free time to sell hot dogs.

"This is self-expression," Isaac Stein, the 31-year-old owner of "Shyster's Dogs," told Business Insider at his hot dog stand in Washington, DC's NoMa neighborhood. "This is me having artistic fun."

Stein has a day job: He's been working for three years as a lawyer at the Internal Revenue Service, where he handles tax regulations around employee benefits. But for the last three weeks, he's been working as a full-time hot dog vendor on the corner of First and M Street NE.

The hot dog stand idea came to Stein months before the shutdown cleared his schedule. He said that he first made the decision to start the business in June, though it took months to obtain all of the necessary permits. Stein said he invested a "five-figure sum" into buying all of the equipment.

A post shared by Isaac (@shystersdogs)

By the time he was ready to go, it was September. He had originally planned to operate the stand outside of work hours, on Thursday and Friday evenings and over the weekend. "To be real, Thursday was a bit ambitious," Stein said. "It's hard to function in the office without enough sleep, and I want to be good at my legal job."

Then, on October 8, he was "furloughed" — essentially suspended from his job until the shutdown ends. That turned his side gig into a nearly full-time job, and he now typically sells hot dogs from noon to 5 p.m. on weekdays.

Stein's hot dog stand is laden with humor. The name "shyster," a slang word referring to a deceptive or unethical lawyer," is about wanting to "bring a laugh to the legal community," he told Business Insider.

"Part of what I'm doing with my expression here is there are many layers of irony," Stein said. "One of the layers is that I'm a lawyer, and I'm doing everything correctly. I have all the right permits, and I pay taxes."

On his menu, he offers the "SHIRT OFF MY BACK" for $1,000. And the menu itself is fairly simple: if you order "The Only Choice," you'll get a hot dog with mustard and sauerkraut for $10. If you order "Hot Dog with the Wrong Toppings," you can have other toppings, such as ketchup — but you'll be charged more. That option costs $11.

"From a young age, I have wanted to punish people for putting ketchup on a hot dog. It's utterly mystifying to me as to why someone would want this. But to be commercially viable, you have to have it," Stein said. "The pricing difference is reflective of incentives: I want people to do it the right way."

So far, Stein says his hobby has worked out well for him. He's been serving 40 to 50 customers per day, he said, and has been making $200 to $300 in profit each day. But for him, the hot dog stand has been less about making ends meet and more about taking on a creative project.

"It's given me a chance to be in the community more," Stein said. Some of his customers, he said, have very particular orders and have become regulars. "If I can bring that to their life, that makes me really happy."

Still, Stein said that he's looking forward to returning to his day job, whenever that may be.

"People who are tax lawyers for the government aren't doing it for the money," he said. "Everyone wants to get back to work, because we actually like what we do."

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amar Saurabh, a product manager at PayPal in his 30s, based in San Mateo, California. It's been edited for length and clarity.

I spent the last five years of my career at Meta and later at TikTok as a product manager.

While I enjoyed the high-growth, fast-paced culture at TikTok, I was looking to work for a more established company with stability in the US, so I started applying to other jobs in April.

During the first two months of filling out job applications, I only landed two or three interviews. After not finding much help from ChatGPT, I came up with the idea of creating a custom GPT.

It took less than two hours to create, and the tool helped me land my lead product manager job at PayPal. If I needed to find another job, I'd absolutely use it again.

At the start of my job hunt, I reached out to recruiters on LinkedIn, but personalizing each message took a lot of time. I tried using ChatGPT to draft messages, but it kept making mistakes.

I realized that, on ChatGPT, I'm not just chatting about my job search; I'm also chatting about recipe ideas, workout plans, budgeting, and travel itineraries. When ChatGPT would give me an answer, it would often get mixed up or provide generic answers that weren't customized to me.

It also kept asking me to reupload my résumé or share more details about myself. That's when I came up with the idea of building a custom GPT, a specialized AI assistant that performs a specific task, exclusively for my job search.

You can access custom GPTs through ChatGPT's free tier, though a paid subscription allows you to upload more documents. I use the paid version, which costs $20 a month.

I clicked on "custom GPT" and named it "PM job search advisor." I shared my résumé, a link to my LinkedIn profile, and additional details about the projects I've worked on. Then I provided context that I was looking for a senior-level product management position.

It probably took me about an hour and a half to fully prep it with my initial input before it was ready to work for me.

Next, I started the outreach stage by asking my custom GPT to draft customized messages to recruiters or other members of the team I was applying to.

I could ask it to write a LinkedIn connection request with a character limit of 300, or I could request a longer, email-style message. I even asked my GPT to find me the right people to reach out to for a role and the email address to contact them at. When I applied for jobs, I had it refine my résumé to fit the job description.

It also helped me with interview prep. Before an interview, I would input the job description, tell it the date of my job interview, and ask, "What should I highlight from my experience? What questions should I expect from the recruiter?"

It saved me hours that would've been spent trying to remember everything I've done in my career.

There were a couple of times when it would forget certain details about me, and I'd have to remind it, "Hey, you have all my information. Do you remember this conversation we had?"

It would come back saying something like "oh yeah, sorry for not taking that into account," and it would. It was like talking to a person. Overall, my custom GPT worked really well for me.

The number of applications I filled out didn't change as I implemented my custom GPT, but what did change was the number of responses and interviews I got. In two months, I landed at least 7 interviews with companies like Reddit, Intuit, and PayPal.

My GPT helped me write my custom email to the PayPal recruiter and prepared me for each round of interviews. When I did get the job offer, I even used it to help me negotiate my salary. 

If I were in the job market in the future, I'd use this method again. The benefits of a custom GPT are confounding and will only get better as more information is added. My next step would be to build out my GPT to have agentic capabilities, meaning it could apply to jobs and answer application questions for me.

Bundle up and hunker down. The low-fire, low-hire job market can be summed up in one phrase: the "Great Freeze."

There are a lot of "lows" in the soft job market, including layoffs and unemployment. That's the good news and has been the story for over a year. However, the not-so-good news is that job openings and hires have also dropped.

The lack of hiring and the lack of firing could have the same causes. Economists told Business Insider that the US hasn't had large-scale layoffs because even though the economy is still strong, uncertainties around tariffs and other issues mean that companies are hanging on to the talent they have while being reluctant to hire more.

Are you job searching, staying put in your job, or a hiring manager who has seen the workplace change? Reach out to this reporter to share at mhoff@businessinsider.com. 

The low-fire, low-hire labor market has its pros and cons, including hindering potential career growth for workers but offering cost-saving measures for companies.

ZipRecruiter called the recent labor market "The Great Freeze" in a new report on recent turnover and hiring outlook.

"We're seeing employers and job seekers both trying to wait out any of the uncertainty," Nicole Bachaud, labor economist at ZipRecruiter, told Business Insider.

The lockup between low layoffs and low hiring might not end any time soon.

"We're only a few months until the end of the year, and there isn't an immediately obvious catalyst for why the job market would snap out of the malaise that it's in," Daniel Zhao, the chief economist at Glassdoor, said.

Jason Draho, the head of asset allocation Americas for UBS Global Wealth Management, said growth and consumer spending remain relatively solid, making it hard to justify large-scale layoffs.

"Earnings are still positive, businesses are still making money, and there's not really a catalyst for them to reevaluate their head count," said Stephen Juneau, a senior US economist at Bank of America.

Juneau said that uncertainty, artificial intelligence, pockets of economic weakness — such as in construction activity — and supply issues ​​are affecting companies investing in new talent.

There are likely fewer workers entering the US these days, slowing labor force growth. "This negative labor supply shock obviously contributes to a slowdown in hiring," Juneau said.

Supply issues combined with low hiring have also affected unemployment, which has risen but remains relatively low, Draho said.

Zhao said that employers are labor hoarding, or holding on to talent as a precaution, because they don't want to relive previous staffing troubles. "After the experience during the Great Resignation and the labor shortages era, many businesses are hesitant to return to a world where they are desperate for workers and can't find them," he said.

Draho said that if next year has better growth, stimulus measures, and tariff clarity, then companies won't want to be making mass layoffs now and then have to scramble for employees. "They don't want to be caught short with a lack of labor," he said.

ZipRecruiter's September survey of talent acquisition professionals showed 63% of businesses intend to hire moderately or significantly more in the next year, down from 76% last year. "However, the current macroeconomic conditions are continuing to add delays and additional layers that are going to continue to keep hiring and movement in general at this slower pace for the next couple of months," Bachaud said.

But labor hoarding could crumble if the economy worsens. "If employers have some cash or some buffer to work with, they can afford to keep some workers on staff, even if it isn't profitable right now," Zhao said. "I don't expect this labor hoarding story to be able to protect against a full business cycle and recession where businesses are going to be forced to lay off workers."

Zhao said labor hoarding can be good for workers because of job security, and unemployed people have less competition than if there were mass layoffs. However, many people are still actively seeking employment in the low-hiring, low-layoff environment. So, it can be tough to land a job. There were 7.4 million people unemployed in August, but only 7.2 million job openings were available; the number of job openings per unemployed person has cooled way down since the tight labor market recovery after the pandemic recession.

"Many workers have to settle for jobs that are not a good fit for them, whether they don't pay commensurate with their experience or it's not in a field or industry that they're skills would best match," Zhao said.

Lack of turnover can hinder professional development. Zhao said that low hiring affects jobholders who may want to secure a new job that offers better career growth opportunities or who wish to advance or negotiate a raise internally. The Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker showed the 12-month moving averages of median wage growth were similar for job switchers and job stayers as of August.

"Employers who are focusing too much on stability and keeping everything as it is, keeping the status quo, are going to risk losing out to innovation and growth that's not going to be happening if there's no movement internally in their company," Bachaud said. "Employees are going to be stuck in their role without growing and adding new skills and moving along their career paths."

In the cool job market with workers staying put, Bachaud suggested people upskill within their roles so they can still grow and add to their résumé when they look for a new position.

Top economic officials from the U.S. and China kickstarted talks in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday to avert an escalation of their trade war and ensure that a meeting happens next week between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. 

The talks on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit will chart a path forward after Trump threatened new 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and other trade curbs starting on November 1, in retaliation for China's vastly expanded export controls on rare earth magnets and minerals. 

The recent actions, which also include an expanded U.S. export blacklist that covers thousands more Chinese firms, have disrupted a delicate trade truce crafted by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng over four previous meetings since May. 

China's top trade negotiator Li Chenggang is also participating in the talks. A Reuters witness saw Li arriving alongside He at Kuala Lumpur's Merdeka 118 tower, the second-tallest building in the world, where the venue for the talks is located.

The Malaysian government and the U.S. and Chinese sides have provided few details about the meeting or any plans to brief the media about outcomes.

The three officials will try to pave the way for Trump and Xi to meet next Thursday at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea, a high-stakes conversation that could revolve around some interim relief on tariffs, technology controls and Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans. 

Minutes before the talks started, Trump left Washington for his tour of Asia and laid out several talking points for the meeting with Xi.

He said farmers, hit by a Chinese freeze on U.S. soybean purchases, and the democratic island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, would be on the list of topics discussed. 

Trump added he does not have any plans to visit Taiwan. He also flagged the release of jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai, whose case has become the most high-profile example of China's crackdown on rights and freedoms in the Asian financial hub.

"We have a lot to talk about with President Xi, and he has a lot to talk about with us. I think we'll have a good meeting," Trump said.

Trump left Washington on Friday night for a five-day trip to Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, his first to the region and longest journey abroad since taking office in January.

Aboard Air Force One, he told reporters that he would also like China to help Washington in its dealings with Russia.

Josh Lipsky, international economics chair at the Atlantic Council in Washington, said Bessent, Greer and He must first find a way to mitigate their dispute over U.S. technology export curbs and China's rare earths controls, which Washington wants to reverse. 

"I'm not sure the Chinese can agree to that. It's the primary leverage that they have," Lipsky said. 

Some of those announcements may fall to Trump, who is due to arrive in the Malaysian capital on Sunday. 

"We won't know if Beijing has successfully counterbalanced the U.S.'s export controls with restrictions of their own or if they've induced a continuation of an escalatory spiral until Trump and Xi meet," said Scott Kennedy, a China economics expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies. 

"If they make a deal, their gambit will have paid off. If there's no deal, then everyone will need to prepare for things to get much nastier."

The world's two largest economies are seeking to avoid a return of their tariff escalation to triple-digit levels on both sides. Bessent and Greer's first meeting with He in Geneva in May led to a 90-day truce, which brought down tariffs sharply to about 55% on the U.S. side and 30% on the Chinese side and restarted the flow of magnets. 

It was extended in subsequent talks in London and Stockholm and was due to expire on November 10. But the delicate truce frayed at the end of September, when the U.S. Commerce Department vastly expanded an export blacklist to automatically include firms more than 50% owned by companies already on the list, banning U.S. exports to thousands more Chinese firms. 

China struck back with the new global rare earth export controls on October 10, aiming to prevent their use in military systems. Bessent and Greer blasted China's move as a "global supply chain power grab" and vowed the U.S. and its allies would not accept the restrictions. 

Reuters reported that the Trump administration is considering a plan to up the ante with curbs on a dizzying array of software-powered exports to China, from laptops to jet engines, according to sources familiar with the deliberations. 

The Trump administration added to the tension on Friday by announcing a new tariff probe into China's "apparent failure" to meet the terms of the 2020 U.S.-China "Phase One" trade agreement that halted their trade war during Trump's first term.

Kyrgyzstan has introduced a national stablecoin and a central bank digital currency with the help of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, as announced by President Sadyr Japarov.

The country, home to about 7 million people, has aimed to become a cryptocurrency leader in Central Asia.

A stablecoin named A5A7, backed by the Russian rouble, faces sanctions from Western governments for allegedly helping Russia avoid sanctions related to the Ukraine conflict.

Binance's founder, Changpeng Zhao, has become an adviser to the president and confirmed that the stablecoin is on the BNB Chain, with a digital version of the som ready for government payments. Kyrgyzstan is set for snap parliamentary elections on November 30.

The line between sports and crypto just tightened. 

KEY POINTS:
➡️ Khabib and MultiBank are launching a multi-billion-dollar regulated tokenized sports ecosystem.
➡️ Fan participation, athlete branding, and real-world sports assets are moving on-chain.
➡️ The best altcoins to watch in this trend include $MAXI, $SUBBD, and $ATLA.

MultiBank Group, one of the world's largest regulated financial derivatives institutions, announced a multi-billion-dollar joint venture with Khabib Nurmagomedov.

Khabib retired undefeated in the UFC at 29-0 and has since become one of the most influential global sports figures. Now he is entering the blockchain arena in a serious way.

The new company, MultiBank Khabib LLC, will operate from Dubai and aims to build the world's first regulated tokenized sports ecosystem.



This includes a network of high-end sports facilities, athlete-driven brands like Eagle FC and Gameplan, and the rollout of 30 Khabib-branded gyms worldwide.

All of this will connect to a digital layer powered by the MBG token, which serves as the backbone of MultiBank's real-world-asset platform.

It's a sports business rebuilt for the digital era, with regulation and global reach baked in.

And when a move this big happens at the top of the sports world, momentum trickles outward into the broader market of best altcoins.

Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is the body-building, caffeine-powered, never-sleeps version of Doge.

He is the final evolution of the Shiba Inu bloodline, forged in the pain of 2017 altcoin trenches and reborn for the 2025 bull cycle.

If you're looking to buy $MAXI right now, the token price sits around $0.0002645, with the presale raising roughly $3.7M so far.

$MAXI positions itself not just as a meme coin but as a lifestyle asset. The personality is loud: every bag is backed by sweat, rage, and the refusal to be mid.

Holders are encouraged to compete through challenges, leaderboard clout, staking pools, fitness-themed social waves and planned partner events funded through the MAXI Fund.



This fits perfectly into the larger narrative we're seeing with MultiBank x Khabib: sports identity and digital ownership merging. Fans are no longer just fans.

They want to participate. Maxi Doge delivers that energy through meme-powered belonging.

If you believe culture drives value, $MAXI is one to watch early.

SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is building a tokenized creator platform that connects influencers and fans through direct access, premium content, AI tools, and real-time engagement.

Right now, you can buy $SUBBD $0.056775. The project has already raised around $1.2M, backed by a combined social footprint of more than 250M followers across its creator network and ambassador partnerships.

At its core, SUBBD is a creator subscription and interaction platform, but upgraded for Web3 and powered by AI.



Creators can tokenize their content, offer gated access tiers, sell exclusive livestreams, and share premium drops. Fans can support directly through staking, tipping, or paid memberships.

The AI layer is what makes this model scale: creators can automate chat responses, edit and schedule content, and even approve user-generated AI content that references them.

If athletes are building regulated tokenized ecosystems to strengthen fan identity and community, $SUBBD is doing the same for digital creators. Both point toward a future where fans hold economic stakes in the people they support.

For those watching the rise of tokenized fandom, $SUBBD is a strong early-stage entry to monitor.

Atleta Network ($ATLA) is building a sports-focused blockchain ecosystem designed for athletes, clubs, sponsors, and fans. $ATLA is currently priced around $57.59.

Source: CoinMarketCap

Atleta aims to create a full infrastructure rather than just a token.

It provides a smart contract platform, cross-chain connectivity, and storage tools that allow sports organizations to tokenize data, tickets, experiences, and fan engagement mechanics at scale.

The network supports high transaction throughput and fast block times, which is important when dealing with real-time fan interactions, sports content drops, gated experiences, or event-based rewards.

Athletes and clubs benefit by gaining a direct channel to their supporters without intermediaries taking a cut.

This matches the direction of the MultiBank and Khabib project, where sports are becoming tokenized and fans get a real stake in the experience. Atleta represents the fan and community infrastructure side of that shift.

As tokenized sports culture expands, $ATLA is one project that could see growing attention.

The MultiBank x Khabib venture signals that tokenised fan participation is moving into mainstream sports infrastructure. Projects like $MAXI, $SUBBD, and $ATLA show how culture coins and creator tokens fit into that same evolution.

Crypto watchers are seeing another shift in tone this week as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Avalanche (AVAX) regain traction. Traders are cautiously optimistic, juggling the fading meme hype around SHIB with the growing confidence surrounding network-driven tokens like AVAX.

Meanwhile, Remittix, a rising payment-focused crypto, is positioning itself around real-world use, testing whether practical innovation can outshine pure speculation.



Currently, SHIB is trading at $0.00001009, gaining 2.5% in the last 24 hours and holding a $5.94 billion market cap. Daily trading volumes are up more than 8% to $169.6 million, a sign that retail activity is creeping back into play among its 2.87 million wallet holders. However, its massive circulating supply, which is over 589.5 trillion tokens, continues to cap price mobility.



Analysts note that even with improved liquidity, SHIB's structure makes a $1 target virtually impossible under current tokenomics. The coin's volume-to-market cap ratio of 2.85% points to moderate engagement but not enough to counter long-term dilution.

Unlike Shiba Inu's battle with oversupply, Avalanche (AVAX) is holding firm near its critical support between $18 and $20, a zone that historically triggered several strong rallies. According to VexeCrypto, this range represents a super discount zone, where early accumulation often precedes expansion phases.



Technical analysts highlight a maturing symmetrical triangle on the monthly chart , a structure often seen before major breakouts. If AVAX clears $40 to $45, momentum could carry it toward $70 to $90, matching the formation's measured move target.



Among the more established names in the market, Remittix is steadily defining its own space by tackling a real-world challenge which is cross-border payments. The platform is built for both individuals and small businesses, offering quick, affordable transfers across multiple fiat and crypto options.

Using blockchain for settlement, Remittix aims to remove the delays and high fees that continue to frustrate millions who send money internationally.

Remittix (RTX) -- It's building a payment network that uses blockchain to make transfers faster, cheaper, and easier to access. As the world leans further into digital finance, that kind of practicality could make Remittix's growth feel less like hype and more like genuine demand.

Communist Party newspaper Study Times argues that digital assets are the new toolbox for wartime financial strategies

Digital currency is emerging as a powerful, disruptive tool in global geopolitics, fundamentally reshaping the financial battlefield in times of conflict, according to a commentary in a key Communist Party publication.

Digital currencies are issued by central banks and pegged to real-world assets such as fiat currencies or commodities as well as cryptocurrencies issued by the private sector, such as bitcoin, which is powered by blockchain technology.

“In multiple global geopolitical conflicts in recent years, digital currencies have begun to enter the realm of military applications, providing fast, secure and anonymous transaction features that lay the foundation for the militarisation of digital assets,” the article said.

The article's author, Xue Zichen, said it was “worth noting” that the 2025 US National Defence Authorisation Act authorised a Pentagon initiative known as the Defence Blockchain Internal Testing Programme, which meant that digital currencies could become a “significant strategic tool for future financial defence”.

While Xue's title was not disclosed, the author seemed to be an active contributor to state media, including party mouthpiece People's Daily.

Ether ETH$3,941.22 hovered near $3,946 at 13:57 UTC on Oct. 25 after a high-volume rejection around $4,000 left price coiling below resistance, while analysts outlined five-digit scenarios and on-chain data pointed to larger wallets adding.

Analyst Ali Martinez projected a long-term path to $10,000, cautioning it may take longer than some expect; his weekly sketch implies a pullback into 2026 followed by a climb toward five digits around 2027–2028. 

Separately, The Long Investor set a $13,500 target by 2029, framing a multiyear trajectory rather than a near-term call. 

On the flows side, Santiment said “whales and sharks” holding 100–10,000 ETH have added back roughly one-sixth of the coins they sold between Oct. 5 and Oct. 16, describing that as a sign of improving confidence among larger accounts. 

Together, the views lean constructive over a multi-year horizon, but they also imply that clearing major resistance levels must come first before momentum can compound.

According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, ether ETH$3,941.22 moved from $3,955.91 to $3,937.05 over the prior 24-hour session ending this morning (UTC), a roughly $120 swing (about 3.1% intraday) that finished near the lower end. The model marks resistance in the $3,945–$4,000 zone and support around $3,870–$3,880, with an immediate shelf near $3,930. The structure reflects a narrowing range beneath a round-number ceiling and above a recently defended support area.

The key inflection came when volume jumped 188% above the 24-hour average — peaking at 444,887 contracts — during a failed push through the $4,000 level. Price briefly tagged $4,001.69 before sellers capped the move. 

After that rejection, ETH made lower peaks and settled into a late-session rectangle between $3,930 and $3,940 as activity cooled. A smaller burst of 23,884 contracts lifted price toward $3,948, but it faded without follow-through above $3,945, reinforcing the idea that $3,945–$4,000 is the local cap that needs a decisive break.

A clean break and hold above $4,000 on UTC closes would open $4,100 and put early-month highs back in view; failing that, a loss of the immediate $3,930 shelf would likely send price to the $3,870–$3,880 demand area identified by the model. The analyst projections are multi-year and do not depend on a single day's tape, but near-term traction still hinges on converting the high-$3,900s into support.

Over the same window, the CoinDesk 5 Index rose from 1,945.13 to 1,953.72 after reversing from an intraday low at 1,922.57 and stalling near 1,961.57, with support firming around 1,920–1,925 after multiple checks.

As of 13:57–13:58 UTC on Oct. 25, ETH was $3,946 (up 0.5% over the period). On the 24-hour chart, the session opened near $3,926, reached a high at $3,957 and a low at $3,876. In practical terms, $3,900–$3,920 acted as intraday buy zones, and $3,950–$3,960 capped rebounds ahead of the next attempt at $4,000. 

On the one-month chart, ETH has rebounded from the mid-October dip and is grinding back toward $4,000, still below early-month highs — a setup that supports the analyst view of a longer road higher, provided resistance gives way and reclaimed levels hold on subsequent retests.

                            Tether's Paolo Ardoino explains how decentralized, open-source AI can outlast its creators, run on any device, and keep technology in people's hands. | Credit: CCN.com                        

Artificial intelligence is shaping the next decade of technology, but who will own it?


In an exclusive conversation with CCN's Dr. Lorena Nessi, Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, explores the politics of AI, the danger of centralization, and the long-term vision behind Tether's decentralized AI projects.

For Ardoino, this isn't just a technological matter; it's a philosophical one. The challenge, he says, is to build an AI that doesn't depend on a handful of companies, servers, or gatekeepers.

Ardoino has warned for years about the risks of AI monopolies, where massive data centers and proprietary models give a few corporations control over global intelligence.

When asked how Tether balances decentralization with the practical need for central leadership, he said the answer lies in building technology that can live without its creators.

“If you build technology that can only survive if you're around, that's not good technology,” he said. “You can't claim it's decentralized or resilient.”

He pointed to projects like QVAC, an open-source framework Tether is developing to enable decentralized, peer-to-peer AI.

According to Tether, QVAC's modular AI architecture adapts and performs across all hardware types, from the simplest to the most advanced. Designed to scale to sextillions of agents, all self-sovereign yet enabled to connect and collaborate as infinite swarms in an unstoppable peer-to-peer network.

“They don't need our data centers, keys, or permission,” Ardoino explained. “Anyone can take them, build on them, or change them in any direction.”

For Ardoino, open source isn't just a development model, it's a moral stance. “That's the best way to help society move toward freedom and stability,” he said.

Ardoino's vision for AI doesn't come from corporate strategy manuals; it comes from science fiction. In particular, he cites Isaac Asimov's short story The Last Question as a significant influence.

In Asimov's tale, a supercomputer evolves over billions of years, eventually becoming part of the fabric of the universe itself, a being capable of reversing entropy and restarting creation. For Ardoino, that story reflects the ultimate goal of distributed, universal intelligence.

“If we want to create actionable steps that could one day lead to an AI able to answer the most complex question in the universe, how to stop the universe from dying, then AI must become part of the fabric of the universe,” he said.

To him, that means the opposite of centralization. “We can't have the universe connected to OpenAI data centers,” he added. “That makes no sense.”

Instead, he envisions tiny, local, and efficient AI systems that can run on minimal hardware, even “powered by a potato,” as he put it.

Such AIs could exist everywhere, from phones to sensors to satellites. “They should scale from the smallest thing to the biggest thing,” he said.

Ardoino knows this may sound ambitious, even eccentric, but he sees Tether's work as the spark for something far greater:

“We're not saying we'll solve everything now. But we want to be the spark, like the Univac I of the 1950s, that, over time, will give life to the AI that answers the last question.”

While many tech companies now claim to support open-source AI, Ardoino argues that Tether's model of openness is structural, not superficial.

He explains that QVAC's goal is to create a common runtime capable of running AI models across many devices, phones, laptops, and edge computers without reliance on any single cloud infrastructure.

“We're compatible with the best open-source language models out there,” Ardoino said. “We're not trying to compete with them. There won't be one answer; we just want to build a shared execution layer.”

Ardoino is skeptical about tokenizing intelligence.

“Intelligence isn't fungible,” he said. “It doesn't make sense to tokenize it.”

But he does believe AI needs access to money, programmable money. That's where USDT (Tether's stablecoin) comes in.

“AI agents are rational tools,” he explained. “They'll choose the most logical way to interact with others, using the most widely used programmable money. Today, that's USDT, already used by over 500 million people.”

In other words, he sees Tether not just as a payments network for humans, but as the monetary layer for machine-to-machine economies.

According to Ardoino, the future of AI will not live in data centers but on simpler devices like phones.

“Good smartphones today can already run 60% to 70% of AI use cases,” he said. “In 30 years, that number will rise to 85%. We'll reach 95% to 97% in five to ten years.”

This shift toward local AI could mean faster, cheaper, and more private computation. And while many companies race for short-term advantage, Ardoino says Tether takes a longer view.

“Tether doesn't build to compete tomorrow,” he said. “We build for what the world will look like in ten years.”

Ardoino referred to his ideas about the “dark times” and “building for the apocalypse.” These ideas are not as ominous as they sound; they are about preparing society for systemic shocks by reinforcing independence.

He described three core principles: resilience, independence, and disintermediation.

Every Tether project, from its stablecoins to AI tools, is designed to preserve communication and financial freedom even in crisis conditions.

“The only way to preempt chaos is to bring stability,” he said. “That means ensuring people have financial freedom and the ability to communicate. Without that, chaos becomes unstoppable.”

In his view, the world's most significant risks come not from AI but from centralized control of communication and money. Preventing that, he argues, is how humanity avoids the “apocalypse.”

“If we want to reverse chaos, we need to stop it in society first,” he said. “And that begins by keeping peer-to-peer communication alive.”

When asked how he envisions the world in ten years, Ardoino paints a hopeful and cautious picture.

“The future will have a lot of AI, robots, and uncertainty,” he said. “There will be a push toward centralization and a push toward freedom. It's never black or white.”

He's a self-proclaimed science fiction fan and welcomes a future of intelligent machines, but only if ownership stays with the people.

“I want to see AI and robots happen,” he said. “But I want people to own them, not corporations.”

But he doubts he'll ever see it realized.

“I'm not optimistic,” he admits, “but I'll never stop trying.”

The commercial real estate industry, long resistant to digital disruption, is finally embracing blockchain technology in ways that could fundamentally transform how buildings are bought, sold, and financed.

While Bitcoin made headlines in residential deals a decade ago, it's the underlying blockchain infrastructure that's now capturing the attention of commercial real estate investors and developers—and experts predict the entire sector will operate on this technology within just 10 years.

Forget Flipping Houses — This $36 Trillion Asset Class Lets You Invest Without Owning Property

This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.

The blockchain serves as a secure platform and what industry insiders describe as a “great, big virtual filing cabinet” capable of storing billions of records—titles, deeds, cryptocurrency holdings, and mortgage bonds—into perpetuity without risk of loss or manipulation, according to CNBC.

But the applications extend far beyond basic record-keeping. Blockchain-based smart contracts are being linked to public utility services, enabling automated billing for water, waste management, energy, and even smart parking systems. This integration promises more efficient, data-driven city management and property operations.

One of the most innovative uses of cryptocurrency in CRE involves leveraging digital assets without liquidating them. Investors are increasingly using crypto as collateral for both residential and commercial property loans, allowing them to acquire real estate while maintaining ownership of digital currencies that often appreciate faster than property values.

This strategy addresses a critical pain point: forcing investors to choose between their crypto holdings and real estate investments. Now they can have both.

Perhaps the most transformative blockchain application is tokenization—converting ownership rights in commercial properties into tradable digital tokens. This process enables fractional ownership and makes it dramatically easier to trade shares in individual properties, according to CNBC.

The market potential is staggering. Industry projections indicate that roughly $4 trillion of real estate will be tokenized by 2035, up from less than $300 billion in 2024. This expansion would open commercial real estate investing to a vastly broader pool of participants who previously lacked the capital for whole-property purchases.

There's a regulatory caveat: U.S. citizens currently cannot invest in tokenized U.S. real estate due to ongoing regulatory frameworks, though international investors can participate.

One of the most burdensome aspects of commercial real estate financing is the prepayment penalty—often costing property owners millions when they want to refinance or sell. Blockchain platforms like BV Innovation are attacking this problem with AI-enabled solutions.

These platforms allow commercial real estate finance companies to transfer loans, including their current favorable interest rates, from one property to another using AI software that automatically performs risk analysis on the new asset, according to CNBC.

This innovation enables owners to avoid massive prepayment penalties and instead redirect that capital toward new property investments, while banks gain confidence that existing interest rates apply to quality assets. Property owners don't need to understand the technical backend—they just need to know the process is secure and saves them money.

For an industry where being locked into unfavorable interest rates has historically frozen transactions, this capability could unlock significantly more deal flow.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is naturally the first digital coin that comes to mind when the subject of cryptocurrencies comes up. From institutional investors to everyday traders, Bitcoin is often viewed as the ultimate measure of sentiment in the crypto market – the one that sets the tone for the rest.





That, says top investor Neil Patel, is entirely justified. Its dominance is well-earned thanks to its strong brand recognition, first-mover advantage, powerful network effects, and massive $2.2 trillion market cap. Yet, Patel notes, investors looking beyond Bitcoin might uncover other intriguing opportunities in the crypto universe.

Among the contenders, XRP (XRP-UDS) and Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) stand out – though for very different reasons. Dogecoin earned its fame as the original meme coin, while XRP was created to challenge the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border payments. The question for investors, then, is which of the two presents the better buying opportunity.

Dogecoin's story is well known. What began in 2013 as an internet joke quickly evolved into a multi-billion-dollar asset. Its cultural status, driven by an enthusiastic online community and high-profile fans like Elon Musk, helped it climb into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market cap north of $29 billion. However, its rallies have mostly been propelled by hype rather than fundamentals. A single tweet or wave of retail enthusiasm can send prices soaring, only for them to tumble just as quickly.

That volatility stems from deeper issues. Dogecoin's real-world utility remains limited, and its development community is small. More importantly, its unlimited supply (roughly 151 billion DOGE in circulation with 5 billion new coins minted each year) makes long-term appreciation difficult. 

As Patel bluntly puts it, “This crypto is nothing more than a tool for speculation. It's difficult for any long-term investor to consider owning it with a five- or 10-year time horizon.”

XRP, by contrast, has tried to distance itself from speculative mania by focusing on utility. Its mission is to enable fast, low-cost international transactions, using XRP as a bridge currency between fiat systems. Payments settle in seconds, at minimal cost, and Ripple (the company behind XRP) continues to expand partnerships across the global financial ecosystem in pursuit of mainstream adoption.

That said, the road ahead isn't free of obstacles. The global payments landscape is dominated by entrenched financial giants that aren't eager to cede ground, and the rapid ascent of stablecoins adds further competition. Even with Ripple launching its own stablecoin (RLUSD), it remains a small player compared to dollar-pegged tokens commanding hundreds of billions in value.

Still, when Patel weighs the two cryptos side by side, his preference is clear. “Despite lots of uncertainty, I still view XRP as the much better investment option than Dogecoin,” said the 5-star investor, who ranks among the top 4% of stock pros on TipRanks. “Over the next decade, the former has more potential than the latter.” (To watch Patel's track record, click here)

Oops, something went wrong

Key Takeaways

BitMine Chairman Tom Lee believes Bitcoin could reach $1.6–$2 million if it matches gold's total market capitalization.

Michael Saylor predicts Bitcoin could hit $21 million within 21 years.

CCN analysts believe such valuations would require a massive global financial shift.

Bitcoin's growing mainstream appeal has continued to spark bold price predictions, with some of crypto's most vocal advocates calling for stratospheric valuations, but analysts disagree.

BitMine Chairman Tom Lee, speaking in an interview with Anthony Pompliano, said the long-term value of Bitcoin could rise to between $1.6 million and $2 million if the asset eventually equals gold's total market capitalization.

“Well, gold is moose first and then Bitcoin catches up,” Lee said.

Lee said that as gold's “network value” rises, it creates a higher benchmark for digital store-of-value assets like Bitcoin.

Gold has surged more than 115% in the past two years, reaching an all-time high of $4,381 in October before retreating.

Bitcoin, meanwhile, has gained about 150% since the start of 2024, outperforming gold's roughly 100% rise over the same period.

While Bitcoin briefly fell from its Oct. 6 record high, it continues to trade near key support around $107,000.

Echoing that optimism, Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Bitcoin holding company Strategy, has projected a longer-term target of $21 million per Bitcoin within 21 years.

Speaking at a conference in Prague, Saylor said the digital gold's capped supply and accelerating institutional adoption could drive exponential gains.

Saylor's firm's total holdings sit at around 640,418 BTC, the world's largest corporate stash, around 3% of the total that will ever exist.

He said Bitcoin's rising recognition as “digital gold” will fuel its rise:

“If institutions decide to increase their crypto allocation even slightly, the impact on price could be enormous,” he said.

Television personality Jim Cramer, a long-time market commentator, has also weighed in with bullish sentiment.

Posting on X earlier this week, Cramer wrote:

“Crypto due for a push today. We are in 2000 territory on specs… We MUST focus on this before people really get hurt. TRIM.”

Shortly after his remarks, Bitcoin's price fell nearly 4%, dipping to about $106,700 before recovering slightly.

The drop reinforced the so-called “Cramer Effect,” a running joke among crypto enthusiasts who have mocked his calls, which often go in the opposite direction.

Not everyone is convinced that Bitcoin can climb to such extraordinary levels.

CCN analyst Valdrin Tahiri argued that Lee's projection assumes a radical reshaping of global financial markets.

“If Bitcoin ever reached $2 million, its market cap would soar to about $42 trillion, nearly twice the total value of all the world's gold, which is around $20–25 trillion,” Tahiri said.

Tahiri said that “shift feels far-fetched” unless there's a “massive currency debasement or a global move away from traditional assets.”

At the time of reporting, Bitcoin's price is trading at $111,279, according to CoinMarketCap.

MegaETH—a high-performance Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain targeting sub-millisecond latency and over 100,000 TPS—confirmed the authenticity of its MiCA-compliant whitepaper, officially unveiling detailed tokenomics and utility for its native $MEGA token.

This comes ahead of an ongoing public ICO on Sonar by Echo running until October 27, 2025 and a planned Token Generation Event (TGE) in January 2026. The release emphasizes community alignment, with modest team and VC allocations, and ties emissions to performance-based KPIs rather than fixed schedules.

Backed by investors like Dragonfly Capital and endorsements from Vitalik Buterin, MegaETH positions $MEGA as a utility and governance token powering real-time DeFi, gaming, and AI applications.

Register for Tekedia Mini-MBA edition 19 (Feb 9 – May 2, 2026): big discounts for early bird. 

Tekedia AI in Business Masterclass opens registrations.

Modest VC/team allocations 24.2% total and a $990M FDV at ICO start make $MEGA attractive, with early trading at ~$0.50 5x ICO price signaling strong market confidence. The ICO's KYC, EU custody requirements, and high minimum bids $2,650 may limit retail participation, though testnet activity and NFT rewards offer alternative entry points.

The total supply is capped at 10 billion $MEGA. The allocation prioritizes long-term ecosystem growth through staking incentives 53.3%, while limiting early unlocks for insiders. Vesting schedules include a 1-year cliff and 3-year linear vesting for team/advisors, and similar locks for sales participants who opt in for rewards.

English auction format; min. bid $2,650 USD, max $186,282; starts at ~$0.099/token FDV ~$990M; requires KYC and EU custody via OKCoin. Community multipliers for testnet activity and social engagement.

Fully diluted valuation at ICO start: ~$990M; already trading at ~$0.50 on Hyperliquid 5x ICO price. $MEGA isn't just a governance token—it's integral to MegaETH's real-time infrastructure, creating demand through staking, auctions, and priority access.

Stake $MEGA to earn from the 53.3% pool, unlocked only when KPIs are met (e.g., ecosystem growth, technical benchmarks). This bootstraps activity without inflationary dumps, with rewards claimable per vesting schedules.

MegaETH uses a single active sequencer that rotates globally to minimize latency. Operators bid/stake $MEGA in English auctions for time slots, ensuring decentralization and low-cost execution. Apps, market makers, and traders lock $MEGA to bid for “sequencer-adjacent” floorspace, enabling tokenized, tradable low-latency access.

An on-chain indexer streams real-time data for millisecond reactions, with fees split between sequencers and the treasury which earns yield on USDm reserves. Vote on protocol upgrades; used for grants via the foundation reserve.

Ties into USDm Ethena's yield-bearing stablecoin for predictable fees, where sequencer costs are covered by reserves rather than user gas. This design avoids “fee extraction” models, using yield revenue to subsidize operations and keep user costs near-zero.

Register by October 27 via megaeth.com connect wallet, KYC on Sonar, link X/Discord + 3 active wallets. Bidding opens October 27–30; allocations finalized by November 21. EU buyers need MiCA-licensed custody; expect oversubscription given pre-market hype.

Over 210K wallets have interacted; Fluffle NFTs guarantee 5% supply share. Early activity (e.g., via GTE or MegaForge apps) boosts ICO priority and potential retroactive drops. Mainnet Q4 2025; focus on 100K+ TPS with EVM compatibility.

With 53.3% of tokens allocated to KPI-driven staking rewards and only 9.5% for the team, MegaETH prioritizes ecosystem growth and user alignment, reducing insider dumps and fostering long-term trust.

Tying token unlocks to KPIs (e.g., TVL, TPS, decentralization) incentivizes network activity and prevents inflationary oversupply, potentially stabilizing $MEGA's value.

$MEGA's role in sequencer bidding, proximity markets, and low-latency access creates organic demand, especially for DeFi, gaming, and AI apps, positioning MegaETH as a high-performance L2.

Achieving 100K+ TPS with sub-millisecond latency could set a new standard for L2s, pressuring competitors to innovate or risk obsolescence.

Farcaster—a decentralized social protocol built on Optimism and heavily integrated with Coinbase's Base chain—announced the acquisition of Clanker, the leading AI-powered token launchpad on Base.

This move integrates Clanker's rapid token deployment tools directly into Farcaster's social graph, enabling seamless, social-driven meme coin and ERC-20 launches right from Farcaster clients like Warpcast.

It's a strategic play to blend social networking with on-chain utilities, positioning Farcaster as a one-stop hub for community-backed token creation.

Clanker is an AI “token bot” that simplifies token launches on Base with support for Arbitrum. Users tag @clanker
in a Farcaster post with a token idea (e.g., name, symbol, description), and the bot deploys an ERC-20 token in seconds—no coding required.

Since its launch in late 2024, it has:Generated over $4 million in revenue in its first two weeks alone. Powered viral hits like $ANON anonymous posting tool, bought by Vitalik Buterin, $LUM first AI-to-AI launched token, $BANKR (AI crypto banker), $NOICE, and $BRACKY.

Become Base's “Pump.fun equivalent,” with 3,500+ tokens issued and daily fees averaging $70K–$200K in peak periods. The $CLANKER token was the platform's first self-launched token, tying its economics to launch activity.

Farcaster's co-founder Dan Romero shared the news via a Farcaster frame post titled “clank clank,” confirming the merger. Clanker will be “deeply integrated” into Farcaster apps, allowing users to launch and engage with tokens socially (e.g., tagging for instant deploys).

No financial terms were disclosed, but it's Farcaster's first major infrastructure buy—following a rejected acquisition bid from Rainbow Wallet in September 2025.

Immediate tokenomics updates for $CLANKER independent of Farcaster, which has no native token: Fee Flywheel: 2/3 of all protocol fees will buy and hold $CLANKER, creating ongoing demand. The remaining 1/3 supports operations.

3.1M legacy tokens burned; all accumulated ecosystem tokens in the fee vault e.g., 2–5% of supplies like $BANKR, $NOICE were incinerated to reduce sell pressure. 7% of total supply locked in a one-sided liquidity provider position on Base, enhancing stability though it mimics short-term sell pressure.

These changes aim for “responsible and sustainable tokenomics,” per Clanker's team, with fees now accruing directly to holders instead of idling in treasuries.

$CLANKER surged 50–100% immediately, hitting $44+ from a $22 base, with 24h volume exceeding $25M. Trading at ~$35.4 MC $35.4M as of Oct 24, it's seen as undervalued given revenue multiples—analysts eye $100M+ caps if Base's “casino season” heats up.

Ecosystem tokens like $FCAST Clanker's first official launch and x402 meta plays $KARUM, $HEU are riding the wave.Community buzz on X highlights this as a “game-changer” for Base:” Farcaster acquisition changed the game… $1M weekly buyback on $50M cap.”

This fits a hot week for Base acquisitions (e.g., Echo by Coinbase), signaling maturing M&A in crypto social infra. Farcaster adds “social context” to launches, competing with Zora while attracting builders/AI agents. Expect more AI-meme hybrids, like Aether-Clanker collabs.

Base accelerates “meme manufacturing,” with Clanker's revenue funneled back on-chain. Base szn feels imminent. Blurs lines between social, AI, and DeFi—launchpads now have “social DNA.” If fees scale (e.g., $40M annual run-rate), $CLANKER could 10x, but watch for volatility in meme meta.

Kyrgyzstan is moving ahead with its national cryptocurrency strategy, launching a stablecoin and preparing for a public sector rollout of a central bank digital currency (CBDC),according to Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ).

The new stablecoin, believed to be KGST, is pegged 1:1 to the national currency, Kyrgyzstan's Som, and is registered in the State Register of Digital Assets. It differs from USDKG, a dollar-backed stablecoin backed by $500 million in gold reserves from the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance planned to launch in Q3.

At the same time, the country's CBDC, the digital som, is now legally recognized and expected to be piloted for government-related payments, CZ added.

This follows an April decision by President Sadyr Japarov to amend the country's constitutional law, giving the digital som legal tender status if fully launched by the National Bank.

Kyrgyzstan is also building out a broader crypto infrastructure. It has created a national cryptocurrency reserve that includes BNB, launched law enforcement training and signed on Binance Academy to partner with 10 universities.

Binance has also localized its app in Kyrgyz and hosted a 1,000-person meetup in the capital, Bishkek, Zhao pointed out.

Sign, where CZ's family fund YZi Labs is an investor in, is also working with the Kyrgyz government on smart contract infrastructure, he added.

Blockchain.com has recently obtained a MiCA license in Malta, a significant step for the company's expansion into Europe. This move enables Blockchain.com to offer services across the entire EU market. The company joins a growing list of crypto firms, including Kraken, Gate, and Gemini, that are seeking access to the European market through Malta.

A spokesperson for Blockchain.com  stated that Malta's regulatory environment provided the “right combination of transparency, institutional expertise, and strategic access.” The MiCA license will now serve as the foundation for Blockchain.com's European operations. Fiorentina D'Amore will lead the company's EU strategy from Malta, positioning it for growth across the region.

The MiCA regulation came into full effect in late 2024. This framework allows crypto companies to apply for authorization in one EU member state and operate across the 27-country bloc. Blockchain.com sees this as an opportunity to expand its services, shifting from centralized exchanges to focus on brokerage, institutional infrastructure, and self-custody wallet services.

Blockchain.com's spokesperson also highlighted that the company is monitoring regulatory developments in the UK, Singapore, Latin America, and the Middle East. The firm has not yet addressed rumors of a potential U.S. public listing, but it remains open to such a move in the future.

Malta's relatively light approach to crypto regulation has raised concerns among some European regulators. In mid-September, markets authorities from France, Austria, and Italy pushed for stronger EU oversight. They called for a more centralized role for the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in supervising the crypto market across member states.

A recent ESMA review of Malta's licensing practices highlighted that some risks were not fully assessed during the authorization process. While the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) demonstrated strong cooperation, certain areas were flagged as potential concerns. Critics argue that Malta's regulatory approach, including its history of offering “golden passports” and a lenient stance on gambling, may attract companies seeking more relaxed conditions.

The European Banking Authority (EBA) also expressed concerns about “forum shopping.” This practice occurs when crypto companies seek licenses in jurisdictions with more lenient regulations, such as Malta. The EBA warned that such actions could compromise the integrity of the EU's financial system, making it more difficult to ensure investor protection.

Despite the concerns, some legal experts argue that regulatory diversity is inevitable in a single market. Dr. Hendrik Müller-Lankow, a lawyer at Kronsteyn, noted that different national approaches reflect the balance between EU integration and national discretion. While some view regulatory arbitrage as a byproduct of adapting national laws to EU regulations, others see it as a form of regulatory arbitrage.

Ferrari aims to engage the next generation of car enthusiasts by launching a groundbreaking auction for its Le Mans car. The luxury automaker has revealed plans to use AI and cryptocurrency in an innovative approach. This new strategy reflects Ferrari's desire to connect with younger buyers, particularly in the digital age.

The company is setting the stage for an exclusive auction of a limited-edition Le Mans race car. By leveraging AI and crypto, Ferrari is adapting to the digital shift that younger buyers are increasingly embracing. This bold move reflects Ferrari's intent to remain relevant in the high-performance vehicle market.

Ferrari's upcoming Le Mans car auction will integrate both artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency for the first time. AI technology will help determine the bidding process, creating a more dynamic and personalized auction experience. Additionally, cryptocurrency will be accepted as a payment method, catering to a growing market of digital asset enthusiasts.

“We want to bring a unique and futuristic approach to the auction experience,” said Ferrari's CEO Benedetto Vigna. “By using AI and crypto, we aim to meet the evolving preferences of a new generation of buyers.”

Ferrari sees this as a way to blend its traditional legacy with emerging technologies.

The integration of AI is expected to enhance the auction process by analyzing trends and preferences in real-time. As a result, bidders will experience a more tailored and efficient process. Meanwhile, the use of cryptocurrency expands Ferrari's reach to global buyers who prefer digital payments, making the auction more accessible to them.

Ferrari's Le Mans car, which will be available for auction, is a nod to the brand's racing heritage. The vehicle will incorporate cutting-edge performance technology that reflects Ferrari's commitment to innovation. The Le Mans car is not just a symbol of Ferrari's past victories; it also showcases the brand's ability to push boundaries in the modern era.

Ferrari's decision to auction this car through AI and crypto aligns with its focus on blending tradition with innovation. The car's design and features will be revealed as part of the auction experience, making it an even more exclusive offering. This initiative reflects Ferrari's vision of creating a bridge between its iconic racing history and the future of automotive technology.

The move to use AI and crypto is particularly significant as it aligns with Ferrari's ongoing efforts to maintain its appeal to a younger, tech-savvy demographic. By embracing these technologies, Ferrari hopes to position itself as a forward-thinking brand while maintaining its prestigious image.

Ferrari's decision to incorporate AI and cryptocurrency into its auction strategy marks a significant shift in the luxury car market. The brand is not only embracing digital innovation but also ensuring its legacy remains intact. This blend of the past and the future represents Ferrari's strategic vision for the years to come.

In this article, we discuss the 12 Most Promising Blockchain and Crypto Mining Stocks According to Hedge Funds.

Blockchain technology is a decentralized system that records and verifies digital transactions. It underpins cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. At the same time, it has expanded into sectors such as finance, supply chains, and data verification. Rising from less than $10 billion in 2023, the value of tokenized blockchain assets exceeded $30 billion in 2025, according to data from Morningstar.

However, crypto-linked assets experienced heightened volatility in recent weeks. According to Reuters, the crypto market experienced its largest liquidation to date on October 10, erasing over $19 billion in leveraged positions. This development happened in parallel to the escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions. During the October 10-11 period, Bitcoin declined over 14% from its previous high on Friday. It had previously reached a record high of over $126,000 on October 6, 2025. At the same time, Ether fell over 12% amid panic selling and forced liquidation.

The weakness in the cryptocurrency market continued on October 14, as Reuters reported fresh declines in Bitcoin and Ether. Both gave up prior day's gains after imposition of new port fees and tariffs reignited U.S.-China trade tensions, reflecting the sector's sensitivity to geopolitical risks.

On the same day, S&P Global and Chainlink announced a landmark collaboration, demonstrating blockchain's growing adoption in traditional finance. This collaboration will enable on-chain delivery of S&P Global Ratings' Stablecoin Stability Assessments through Chainlink's infrastructure. With this, real-time risk analytics will be brought to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Furthermore, the partnership represents a critical step toward bridging institutional-grade credit analytics with blockchain ecosystems.

With this backdrop, let's move on to our list of the 12 Most Promising Blockchain and Crypto Mining Stocks According to Hedge Funds.



To identify the 12 most promising blockchain and crypto mining stocks according to hedge funds, we first compiled a list of all U.S.-listed companies with meaningful exposure to blockchain technology and cryptocurrency mining using credible online resources, ETFs, databases, and stock screeners. We then used Insider Monkey's database of hedge funds to assess each stock's hedge fund sentiment and selected 12 stocks with the highest hedge fund interest. Finally, we ranked the selected stocks in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each stock as of Q2 2025.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 427.7% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 264 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 10

Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ:BITF) is included in our list of the 12 most promising blockchain and crypto mining stocks according to hedge funds.

On October 10, 2025, Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ:BITF) announced the conversion of its $300 million private debt facility with Macquarie Group into project-level financing. The company made this move to fund its 350 MW Panther Creek campus in Pennsylvania.

Furthermore, Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ:BITF) made an immediate $50 million drawdown to advance equipment purchases and site construction. The groundbreaking is scheduled for Q4 2025.

Following momentum from these developments, Northland increased its price target on Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ:BITF) from $3.25 to $7.00 on October 13, 2025, while maintaining an “Outperform” rating. Citing the company's 1.3 GW development pipeline, the investment firm called the stock “an underappreciated way to gain exposure to the next wave of U.S. AI/HPC infrastructure buildout.”

With a focus on blockchain validation and computation power services, Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ:BITF) operates integrated Bitcoin mining and digital infrastructure data centers across Canada, the U.S., Paraguay, and Argentina.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19

With significant hedge fund interest, CleanSpark, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK) secures a spot on our list of the 12 most promising blockchain and crypto mining stocks according to hedge funds.

On October 13, 2025, BTIG raised its price target on CleanSpark, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK) from $22 to $26, maintaining a “Buy” rating.

The revised target comes after CleanSpark Inc.'s (NASDAQ:CLSK) recent major capacity expansion, which increased its hash rate to 50 EH/s. This represents roughly 80% growth year-to-date. The company's strategic focus has historically been placed on owning and scaling its mining infrastructure. This focus has resulted in strong revenue growth and balance sheet health for the company.

Furthermore, BTIG sees CleanSpark, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK) diversifying into high-performance computing (HPC) colocation, which will be enabled through its growing data center network. It also identified the company's potential to adopt hybrid models where power allocation shifts between HPC workloads and Bitcoin mining based on demand.

Looking ahead, CleanSpark, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK)'s ongoing expansion across U.S. sites positions it well to capitalize on both crypto and AI-driven computing opportunities in the coming quarters.

CleanSpark, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK), a bitcoin mining and digital infrastructure company, operates across the Americas. It owns and manages data centers that support both blockchain operations and emerging compute applications.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24

MARA Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA) is included in our list of the 12 most promising blockchain and crypto mining stocks according to hedge funds.

On October 21, Guggenheim analyst Jonathan Lee began coverage on MARA Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA) with a Hold rating and without assigning a price target. The analyst acknowledged the company's leadership in Bitcoin mining network capacity and that its acquisition of a significant stake in Exaion, a data center developer, would provide it with diversification opportunities. However, he said that the strategic importance of the acquisition is not evident, which keeps him from becoming more positive. Moreover, the company's share price is correlated with Bitcoin's price, which has seen higher volatility recently, further adding to the analyst's cautious stance.

On the positive side, on October 6, 2025, Cantor Fitzgerald increased its price target on MARA Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA) to $30 while keeping an “Overweight” rating.

The investment firm highlighted higher bitcoin prices and MARA Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA)'s solid mining output as key drivers behind the revised target. Cantor Fitzgerald also cited the company's mining of 736 Bitcoin in September, which generated roughly $83.5 million in revenue for the month. Furthermore, the company's mining operations generated $245.7 million in revenue for the third quarter of 2025.

While the firm acknowledged a slight reduction in fiscal 2025 revenue and EBITDA estimates due to rising network hash rates, it expressed confidence in MARA Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA)'s ability to demonstrate strong execution, stable cash flows, and operational efficiency. Citing the company's Bitcoin reserves as one of the largest among public companies, Cantor Fitzgerald believes the company remains a key player in the crypto-mining ecosystem and is well placed to capitalize on renewed digital asset momentum.

MARA Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA), a digital asset technology company in the U.S. and Europe, offers infrastructure and software solutions to optimize high-performance Bitcoin mining operations.

Bitcoin slipped into a tight holding pattern, trading below a clean breakout threshold at 08:00 UTC as buyers and sellers marked out a narrow corridor with clear levels above and below.

According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, bitcoin BTC$111,459.82 moved from $111,157 to $111,634 during the 24 hours ending Oct. 25, 08:00 UTC, contained inside a roughly $2,025 (about 1.8%) band. The session's map set resistance around $111,800–$111,900 and support near $109,800, with no dominant catalyst to force a sustained move.

Trading activity peaked at 14:00 UTC on Oct. 24, when volume rose to 23,728 BTC — about 180% above the 24-hour average of 8,200 BTC — while price pressed into $109,818 and stabilized. Into the final hour of the window, bitcoin eased from $111,745 to $111,545 (about 0.18%) as turnover cooled to around 85 BTC per minute versus a prior roughly 135 BTC per minute, then coiled between $111,540 and $111,645, consistent with consolidation.

A clean break and hold above $112,000 on UTC closes would shift focus to $115,000. Losing $109,800 would bring $108,000 back into view.

Over the same window, CD5 rebounded intraday from 1,920.75 to 1,961.57 before settling at 1,940.94 by Oct. 25, 08:00 UTC, leaving momentum mixed just below the 1,950 area.

CoinDesk Research's model places the 200-day near $108,000 and the 100-day near $115,000 as reference levels during the window ending Oct. 25, 08:00 UTC.

LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman has joined the growing trend of high-profile tech figures engaging with the world of NFTs. Hoffman recently acquired a CryptoPunk profile picture (PFP), signaling his increasing involvement in the digital asset and blockchain space. The move adds to his history of exploring and investing in blockchain technologies, underscoring a rising interest among entrepreneurs and investors in this evolving sector.

Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, has made waves in the crypto community by acquiring a CryptoPunk NFT. This move comes as part of a broader trend where leading tech figures experiment with blockchain-related projects and digital assets.

Hoffman's updated LinkedIn profile now features a CryptoPunk, a pixel art character from one of the earliest and most prominent NFT collections. The decision to showcase the CryptoPunk as a profile picture suggests Hoffman's continued interest in the growing influence of digital ownership and NFTs in today's tech ecosystem.

Hoffman's acquisition signals his deeper engagement with blockchain technology. In recent years, he has shown interest in experimenting with and investing in various crypto-related ventures. The CryptoPunk acquisition represents an ongoing shift in how entrepreneurs and investors view NFTs, which have been gaining more recognition as both assets and community symbols within the blockchain space.

The CryptoPunks collection, launched in 2017 by Larva Labs, consists of 10,000 unique pixel art characters. These characters have become some of the most recognizable and valuable NFTs in the world. CryptoPunks paved the way for other profile picture-based NFTs, and they remain a symbol of the early days of digital collectibles. The collection includes various designs, from human-like figures to non-human traits like apes or aliens, each with distinct features and characteristics.

Over time, CryptoPunks have become more than just digital art; they have emerged as status symbols in the digital world. Their scarcity and early introduction to the NFT market have made them highly sought after by collectors, including notable figures in the tech and investment sectors. By adopting a CryptoPunk as his profile picture, Hoffman aligns himself with a well-known symbol within the crypto community, further solidifying his involvement in the digital asset space.

Hoffman's move is part of a larger trend where more tech leaders are stepping into the blockchain ecosystem. From major investments in blockchain startups to personal involvement in NFTs, these figures are helping bridge the gap between traditional technology industries and the emerging world of decentralized finance and digital assets. This shift has led to increased visibility of blockchain technologies in mainstream sectors.

These tech entrepreneurs, including Hoffman, view blockchain not only as a financial opportunity but also as a cultural and technological movement. Many are exploring different aspects of the blockchain ecosystem, from cryptocurrencies to decentralized applications (dApps). Their participation also signals a growing acceptance of digital ownership and NFTs, which were once considered niche or speculative assets.

The rise of NFTs, including CryptoPunks, reflects a larger transformation in how people view and interact with digital assets. NFTs are changing the way people perceive ownership, with buyers acquiring digital goods that are unique, verifiable, and tradeable through blockchain technology. In this context, NFTs are not just collectibles but also markers of identity and status within digital communities.

Despite market fluctuations, interest in NFTs continues to grow. Collectors, investors, and tech leaders are consistently looking for ways to engage with and benefit from this new form of digital ownership. As more figures like Reid Hoffman embrace NFTs and blockchain projects, the relationship between traditional tech industries and the blockchain space becomes more intertwined, shaping the future of both sectors.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) will allow institutional clients to use Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) as collateral for loans, marking a major shift in how Wall Street's largest bank integrates digital assets into its core lending operations, according to Bloomberg.

The program, set to launch by year-end, will let clients pledge Bitcoin and Ethereum for secured loans.

A third-party custodian will safeguard the pledged tokens to ensure risk compliance.

The move expands JPMorgan's earlier initiative that accepted crypto-linked ETFs as loan collateral.

It underscores how traditional banks are deepening their exposure to digital assets amid loosening regulations and rising institutional demand.

A JPMorgan spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.

The decision highlights a symbolic reversal for CEO Jamie Dimon, who once labeled Bitcoin a "hyped-up fraud" and compared it to a "pet rock."

Dimon has since softened his stance, saying at a May investor conference, "I defend your right to buy Bitcoin, go at it," even as he maintains personal skepticism toward the asset.

For JPMorgan, the new framework marks both a cultural and structural shift.

By recognizing Bitcoin and Ethereum as eligible collateral, the bank effectively treats them alongside traditional assets such as stocks, bonds, and gold.

JPMorgan joins Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), State Street Corp. (NYSE:STT), and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (NYSE:BK) in expanding crypto services.

The Trump administration's pro-crypto stance and recent regulatory rollbacks have helped major banks increase digital asset exposure.

Morgan Stanley is preparing to let users on its E*Trade platform access leading cryptocurrencies in early 2026.

Meanwhile, BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK) and Fidelity Investments have already begun accepting Bitcoin as part of ETF collateral programs.

Throughout life, our cells are continually exposed to both internal and external influences that can harm DNA. This DNA damage is a well-known factor in the development of aging and cancer, yet scientists have long struggled to understand the exact link -- especially how DNA-damaged stem cells affect tissue health over time.

Melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) are specialized cells that give rise to melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells responsible for the color of our hair and skin. In mammals, these stem cells are found in a region of the hair follicle known as the bulge-sub-bulge area. Here, they exist as immature melanoblasts, ensuring that hair and skin maintain their color through repeated cycles of regeneration.

Discovering How DNA Damage Drives Hair Graying

Published online on October 6, 2025, in Nature Cell Biology, a study led by Professor Emi Nishimura and Assistant Professor Yasuaki Mohri at The University of Tokyo explored how McSCs react to different types of DNA damage. Using long-term lineage tracing and gene expression profiling in mice, the researchers discovered that when McSCs experience DNA double-strand breaks, they undergo a process known as senescence-coupled differentiation (seno-differentiation). In this state, the stem cells permanently mature and are eventually lost, which leads to hair turning gray. The process is controlled by the activation of the p53-p21 signaling pathway.

When McSCs are exposed to certain carcinogens, including 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene or ultraviolet B radiation, they do not follow the same protective path. Even with DNA damage present, these cells avoid seno-differentiation and continue to renew themselves. They expand clonally instead, aided by KIT ligand signals released from surrounding tissue and the epidermis. These niche-derived signals block the protective differentiation response, pushing the stem cells toward a cancer-prone state.

Opposing Cellular Fates: Graying or Cancer

According to Nishimura, "These findings reveal that the same stem cell population can follow antagonistic fates -- exhaustion or expansion -- depending on the type of stress and microenvironmental signals." She adds, "It reframes hair graying and melanoma not as unrelated events, but as divergent outcomes of stem cell stress responses."

The researchers emphasize that their findings do not imply that developing gray hair prevents cancer. Instead, seno-differentiation appears to serve as a stress-triggered defense mechanism that removes damaged stem cells before they can become harmful. When this safeguard fails or is bypassed, those damaged cells can survive and potentially lead to melanoma.

Linking Aging, Cancer, and Cellular Self-Destruction

By uncovering the molecular pathways that determine whether stem cells undergo protective exhaustion or dangerous expansion, this study connects the biology of tissue aging with cancer formation. It also highlights the value of naturally removing compromised stem cells through "senolysis," a biological process that helps prevent cancer by sacrificing cells that could otherwise become malignant.

If you've never kept a reptile, you might be surprised to learn that many of them actually "pee" in crystal form. In a study published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, researchers examined the solid urine of more than 20 different reptile species and found that all contained tiny spheres made of uric acid. This discovery highlights how reptiles have developed a unique method for safely storing and removing waste in a crystalline form. The findings could also lead to new ways of treating human conditions linked to uric acid buildup, such as kidney stones and gout.

How Reptiles Save Water With Solid Waste

Every living creature needs to get rid of waste, and reptiles are no exception. In humans, the body eliminates excess nitrogen by flushing it out through urine as urea, uric acid, and ammonia. Reptiles and birds, however, take a different approach. They transform some of those same nitrogen-based compounds into solids known as "urates," which are expelled through a shared opening called the cloaca. Scientists think this solid form of waste evolved as an adaptation to conserve water, a valuable trait for animals that often live in dry environments.

What's Dangerous for Humans Is Normal for Snakes

Although forming crystals in urine helps reptiles survive, the same process can cause serious health problems in people. When uric acid levels become too high in humans, the crystals can collect in the joints, leading to gout, or form in the urinary tract as kidney stones. To understand how reptiles manage to excrete these crystals safely, Jennifer Swift and her research team analyzed urates from more than 20 species.

"This research was really inspired by a desire to understand the ways reptiles are able to excrete this material safely, in the hopes it might inspire new approaches to disease prevention and treatment," explains Swift, the corresponding author on the study.

Microscopic Spheres With Big Medical Potential

Using powerful microscopes, the researchers discovered that species such as ball pythons, Angolan pythons, and Madagascan tree boas produce urates made up of tiny textured spheres between 1 and 10 micrometers across. X-ray analysis revealed that these microspheres are built from even smaller nanocrystals made of uric acid and water. The team also found that uric acid helps transform ammonia, a toxic compound, into a safer solid form. They believe uric acid might play a similar protective role in humans. Although more research is needed, these findings suggest that the chemistry behind reptile waste could eventually help scientists develop better treatments for uric acid-related diseases.

From empty offices in 2020 to AI colleagues in 2025, the way we work has been completely rewired over the past five years. Our guest on this week's GeekWire Podcast studies these changes closely along with her colleagues at Microsoft. 

Colette Stallbaumer is the co-founder of Microsoft WorkLab, general manager of Microsoft 365 Copilot, and the author of the new book, WorkLab: Five years that shook the business world and sparked an AI-first future, from Microsoft's 8080 Books.

As Stallbaumer explains in the book, the five-year period starting with the pandemic and continuing to the current era of AI represents one continuous transformation in the way we work, and it's not over yet.

“Change is the only constant—shifting norms that once took decades to unfold now materialize in months or weeks,” she writes. “As we look to the next five years, it's nearly impossible to imagine how much more work will change.”

The ‘Hollywood model' of teams: “What we're seeing is this movement in teams, where we'll stand up a small squad of people who bring their own domain expertise, but also have AI added into the mix. They come together just like you would to produce a film. A group of people comes together to produce a blockbuster, and then you disperse and go back to your day job.”

The concept of the ‘frontier firm': “They're not adding AI as an ingredient. AI is the business model. It's the core. And these frontier firms can have a small number of people using AI in this way, generating a pretty high run rate. So it's a whole new way to think about shipping, creating, and innovating.”

The fallacy of ‘AI strategy': “The idea that you just need to have an ‘AI strategy' is a bit of a fallacy. Really, you kind of want to start with the business problem and then apply AI. … Where are you spending the most and where do you have the biggest challenges? Those are great areas to actually think about putting AI to work for you.”

Adapting to AI: “You have to build the habit and build the muscle to work in this new way and have that moment of, ‘Oh, wait, I don't actually need to do this.' “

The biggest risk related to AI: “The biggest risk is not AI in and of itself. It's that people won't evolve fast enough with AI. It's the human risk and ability to actually start to really use these new tools and build the habit.”

Human creativity and AI: “It still takes that spark and that seed of creativity. And then when you combine it with these new tools, that's where I have a lot of hope and optimism for what people are going to be able to do and invent in the future.”

Another day, another federal probe into Elon Musk's troubled EV company. This week, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reportedly announced that it was looking into one of Tesla's automated driving modes, which is charmingly called “Mad Max.”

If you haven't heard of “Mad Max,” that's probably because it's new. Ars Technica notes that it and another mode, “Sloth,” were added to cars by a firmware update issued earlier this month. Well, Reuters now reports some folks on social media have been complaining that Teslas using the driving mode were exceeding the speed limit (that certainly sounds like something Max would do). Now, the government is looking into it.

“NHTSA is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information,” the agency told Reuters. “The human behind the wheel is fully responsible for driving the vehicle and complying with all traffic safety laws.” There's not a whole lot of information available other than that, but Gizmodo reached out to Tesla for comment (although the company dissolved a majority of its communications team years ago), and to the NHTSA for more information.

Who would have thought that a semi-automated driving mode named after a vengeful dystopian drifter with a lead foot might someday catch the eye of federal regulators? Not I. Sarcasm aside, Tesla's FSD function has been probed by federal regulators for years so, for that reason too, this isn't all that surprising. FSD has been criticized because, despite its name, it does still require the driver to…you know, drive.

Earlier this month, the NHTSA also opened an investigation into Tesla over dozens of reports that alleged its vehicles were running stop signs while engaged with FSD, CBS previously reported. Tesla also recently lost a wrongful death lawsuit involving Autopilot that will reportedly cost them $329 million.

After nearly 25 years, there's one new world for Halo to travel to: the PlayStation 5.

During Friday's Halo World Championships, developer Halo Studios unveiled Campaign Evolved, a remake of the first game's single-player story. Like in the original game, players will take on Master Chief after he and his UNSC allies crash-land on a ring world teeming with the alien Covenant and parasitic Flood. Beyond being the first Halo game made in Unreal Engine—reliably used across the industry—this new version features three prequel missions centered on Chief and his friend Sgt. Johnson set before the events of the first game that are said to include new characters, gameplay, and environments.

That's not the only change on the horizon. In recreating the campaign from scratch, the developers are “modernizing areas that could better match today's expectations for pacing and clarity,” and specifically namedropping “The Library,” one of the most-disliked levels in the series' history. That particular mission now has “reevaluated pacing and enhanced environmental storytelling,” said creative director Max Szlagor.

And there's that whole PS5 thing. Over the years, Microsoft has gradually loosened its grip on first-party Xbox titles being exclusive to its platform, with the Ori games, Gears of War, and more jumping to Sony's console and the Nintendo Switch.

After Gears and Forza, Halo was the last holdout of major Xbox franchises, and this won't be a one-off: studio community lead Brian Jarrard said during the reveal that the series would be on PlayStation “going forward.”

“[Our] community is super excited to welcome in their friends. This means more Halo for everyone, and it's a new era,” he continued. To that end, Campaign Evolved will have four-player online co-op between PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S via crossplay when the game launches in 2026.

Data centers are being built with unprecedented gusto all over the U.S. The reason for this is fairly well known: the AI business requires gargantuan amounts of electricity and computing power. Every time you use an app like DALL-E to, say, make one of those dumb AI-generated images of Mickey Mouse committing the 9/11 terrorist attacks, you're apparently using as much energy as it takes to charge an iPhone. Now picture how much electricity is being used if millions of Americans do it at the same time.

The Trump administration has made it known that it's a friend to the AI industry (it recently launched the AI infrastructure initiative Stargate) and so, it makes perfect sense that its Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, has decided to cut the red tape when it comes to hooking data centers up to the electrical grid.

In a statement published Friday, the Energy Department announced its plan to amend current rules to allow organizations that consume a lot of electricity to connect to the grid much faster: “U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) today to initiate rulemaking procedures with a proposed rule to rapidly accelerate the interconnection of large loads, including data centers, positioning the United States to lead in AI innovation and in the revitalization of domestic manufacturing.”

Hear that, guys? Chris Wright is apparently such a big fan of large loads that, in a bout of deregulatory fervor, he's now helping to usher in a new era of easier data center connection. While the specifics of Wright's proposed rule are a little bit complicated, the obvious takeaway seems to be an effort to make the regulatory process less onerous on people who want to hook up a lot of servers to the grid. The Register notes that one proposed rule is to “limit the time taken to review connection decisions to 60 days,” ostensibly so applicants don't get bogged down in a lengthy review process. In a letter about the proposed rule change published to the government's website, Wright wrote:

“To usher in a new era of American prosperity, we must ensure all Americans and domestic industries have access to affordable, reliable, and secure electricity. To do this, large loads, including AI data centers, served by public utilities must be able to connect to the transmission system in a timely, orderly, and non-discriminatory manner. This is an urgent issue that requires prompt attention.”

He added:

“This Administration is committed to revitalizing domestic manufacturing/ and driving American AI innovation.' both of which will require unprecedented and extraordinary quantities of electricity and substantial investment in the Nation's interstate transmission system. We must do so efficiently, fairly, and expeditiously.”

The data center industry is booming, and, despite all that “bubble” talk when it comes to the AI business, it shows no signs of slowing down. Companies like Nebius—which most of us had never heard of twelve months ago—are in the process of making themselves essential to large parts of the digital economy. Nebius, which is an AI infrastructure provider (it operates data centers), recently netted a deal with Microsoft, and went in on a robotaxi firm with Uber. Its stock price has also erupted some 350 percent this year, so, suffice to say—for the moment—it really pays to have a lot of servers.

Every few weekends, 21-year-old student Lavanya Jain opens the BlaBlaCar app to find a lift from Noida on the outskirts of New Delhi to his home in Kandhla, a small town in northern India's Uttar Pradesh state. The 120-kilometer journey costs him about ₹500, the equivalent of about $6. That's a fraction of the ₹1,500–₹2,000, or $17–$23, he would pay for a private cab. 

“If you're looking for a fast, efficient, affordable, and comfortable way to travel — and you like to chat — you should basically check out BlaBlaCar,” Jain told TechCrunch, adding that he has used the app some 40 to 50 times over the past two years.

Jain is one of millions of Indians turning to long-distance carpooling as a cheaper, more social way to travel between cities. That surge has made India the company's largest market worldwide, with an estimated 20 million passengers this year — up almost 50% from a year earlier. Based on that forecast, BlaBlaCar's India market would surpass the 18 million passengers projected in Brazil and its home market of France.

For a company that shut its India office in 2017 after poor traction, the turnaround is striking. 

Growth has come largely without marketing or a local team, driven instead by word of mouth, expanding mobile internet access, and the rise of digital payments and car ownership among India's middle class.

India is home to more than 700 million smartphone users and has seen a sharp rise in digital payments, which now account for over 99% of all transactions in the country. 

At the center of that shift is the Indian government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system, which processed about 19.6 billion transfers worth around ₹24.9 trillion (roughly $284 billion) in September alone. Car sales have climbed in tandem, reaching 4.73 million vehicles in 2024, up from 3.87 million a year earlier — a 5.2% year-on-year increase and an all-time high.

Other factors behind BlaBlaCar's rapid growth in India include the country's limited public transport capacity relative to its over 1.4 billion population, and the steady expansion of road infrastructure that is improving connectivity between smaller towns, rural areas, and major cities.

“We have lots of examples from users who say, ‘Before, I was flying to a destination or taking the train or not going at all — and now I can actually drive. It takes three hours, and it's a pleasant ride,'” said Nicolas Brusson, co-founder and chief executive of BlaBlaCar, in an interview.

BlaBlaCar first entered India in early 2015, setting up a local office in New Delhi. The company soon faced stiff competition from Uber and local rival Ola, both of which were experimenting with carpooling services and marketing them heavily. (The companies would ended up suspending those carpooling services during the COVID-19 lockdowns.) 

Struggling to gain traction, BlaBlaCar withdrew its local team in 2017. Still, the app remained live — and in 2022, usage began to surge again. Since then, it has skyrocketed from 4.3 million users in 2022 to a projected 20 million this year.

BlaBlaCar has averaged about 1.1 million monthly active users in India this year, peaking at around 1.5 million in August. Roughly three-quarters are passengers, while the remaining 25% are drivers. India now accounts for about 33% of BlaBlaCar's global carpool passengers, the company said.

Trip-wise, BlaBlaCar recorded its strongest growth in India, with 13.5 million trips completed as of September 30, up from 9.1 million during the same period last year. Brazil remained slightly ahead, with 14 million trips this year compared with 11.7 million in 2023, while France ranked third with 5.6 million trips, broadly flat from a year earlier.

“For us, the center of gravity has shifted away from our initial markets in Western Europe toward places like Japan, Turkey — and increasingly, India,” Brusson told TechCrunch.

Although BlaBlaCar does not yet generate revenue from India, drivers on its platform earned around ₹713 million (about $8 million) in August alone, the company said. On average, drivers earn about ₹390 (roughly $4) per seat in India, with an average trip distance of 180 kilometers (about 112 miles). 

By comparison, average driver earnings are about €15 (around $17) in France and roughly €6.5 (roughly $7) in Brazil, even though trip distances are broadly similar in India and Brazil and shorter than France's average of about 250 kilometers (roughly 155 miles). The difference, BlaBlaCar said, reflects lower local purchasing power and cost-sharing expectations in India.

Nearly 70% of BlaBlaCar's Indian users are between the ages of 18 and 34, and about 95% of activity takes place through its mobile app. Roughly half of all rides in India occur along the country's 15 busiest intercity routes, while the other half comes from outside the top 150 corridors — evidence of growing adoption beyond major metros and into smaller cities. Among the busiest routes are Pune–Thane and Pune–Nashik in Maharashtra, Bengaluru–Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh, and several others linking mid-sized urban centers.

Despite all this growth, BlaBlaCar is not looking to enable monetization in India anytime soon.

“We are in no hurry to start introducing a fee or generating revenue in India. We are focused on generating usage, and we have the playback because we've done that in several markets,” Brusson told TechCrunch.

Nonetheless, BlaBlaCar plans to set up its local office in India and have the first hire by the end of this year or early next year, Brusson said.

BlaBlaCar does not view ride-hailing platforms such as Uber and Ola as its competitors in India. Brusson described them as “demand-led” products, while BlaBlaCar, he said, is “supply-led.” Instead, the company sees people driving their own cars — or opting for readily available trains and buses — as its main substitutes.

BlaBlaCar still faces some challenges in India. 

State regulations around carpooling are ambiguous, which has brought the service under scrutiny in some cities. Some users, including Jain, have complained that  it can be difficult to reach BlaBlaCar's customer support, which often replies with automated messages. The company told TechCrunch it operates a “blended model,” with an outsourced local team handling most day-to-day queries and a smaller group at its Paris headquarters managing complex issues and quality checks.

BlaBlaCar introduced an ID Check feature in India to verify users' identities through government-issued documents — a tool it later rolled out globally. However, TechCrunch found that users can still book or publish a ride even if their ID check is incomplete.

“This is a deliberate design choice to make it easier for new members to engage with the platform,” the company said in response. “ID verification is just one part of our broader trust and safety framework; we don't rely on a single feature, but on multiple, layered mechanisms that work together to build confidence within our community.”

The company added that more than 70% of trips in India are made with drivers who have completed government ID verification. BlaBlaCar also displays user reviews and ratings and verifies accounts through phone numbers and email addresses.

“We actively encourage members to complete all verification steps, as fully verified profiles — with photo and ID — significantly increase the chances of finding carpoolers. Profiles lacking these elements tend to receive fewer bookings,” the company said.

Some BlaBlaCar users in India also report frustration when drivers or passengers cancel trips at the last minute, sometimes even after reaching the meeting point. Additionally, the app lacks a live location–sharing feature, which Jain noted limits BlaBlaCar's use for those trying to book rides on behalf of family members or friends.

BlaBlaCar has adapted its product to better suit Indian users, introducing features such as “meeting-point logic” to make coordination easier. Unlike in countries such as France, where designated carpooling zones exist, India lacks fixed pickup areas. Drivers and passengers typically agree to meet at convenient spots along the route — a petrol station, for instance, or near a highway exit. The app now suggests and displays these locations using a mix of machine-learning algorithms and user input, helping reduce detours and align with India's on-the-ground infrastructure, the company said.

Globally, BlaBlaCar expects to reach about 150 million passengers this year, including users of its bus services, which operate in markets such as France but are not yet available in India. As BlaBlaCar broadens its global footprint, India's unexpected rise has positioned it at the heart of the company's next phase of growth.

The tired wood veneer and fish tank case trends need to be disrupted, but admittedly, this might not be the idea that dislodges them.

An RGB ‘gaming PC' build in a translucent plastic jug can provide an uncomfortably beguiling proposition. The design, showcased by The87Player on Reddit, is simultaneously grotesque yet elicits nods of respectful approval in the Tom's Hardware newsroom. Perhaps the PC industry, now stuck in a groove producing almost endless small variations of wood veneer and/or fish tank-style cases, needs to be disrupted. This won't do it, of course, but it shows us that ‘something else' now has a lot of appeal.

The87Player also showcased this PC in a YouTube Short, embedded above, which would have looked much better if videoed in landscape. At least we get to see the case window, seen in the Reddit images, is actually a hinged door that is open for easy access to the internals.

So, the most charming things about this “beast gaming PC” are its case, and its price. On the topic of pricing, The87Player asserts that the whole build cost a total of €130 (~$150). Yes, that's a great price for a full RGB gaming PC, that is a purported “beast,” but closer inspection of the specs reveals a list of pretty ancient components inside the translucent chassis.

The conclusion is that the Redditor has a well developed sense of humor, with their superlative description of this gaming PC, as they go on to ‘boast' that it is only capable of “15fps in Fortnite high.” Another Redditor quipped that there must be a “bottleneck.”

Specifically, the key PC components used here are the:

Thanks to the magic of video (pausing), we also noticed the ‘case' was actually an empty flower-scented liquid soap container. It held 20kg of that liquid, which if a similar density of water would make it a 20 liter case (roughly 5 US Gallons). You can buy a similar translucent plastic jug in the US on Amazon for $30 (in blue), and similar-capacity translucent colorless ones here. Many folks might already have similar containers in their workshops, garages, or other areas.

PC cases and water canisters are both sold in liter sizes, which might have inspired The87Player to undertake this project. However, we will only know that this is a real, established trend in the PC enthusiast world when Amazon listings for water containers start including motherboard compatibility. For example, we could eventually see listings like ‘3-gallon plastic jug, mini-ITX compatible.'

Xiaomi blames memory chip price surge for increased smartphone costs


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The increasing cost of memory chips seems to be slowly creeping into the smartphone industry. Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi saw a disappointing response to its newly launched Redmi K90 range. According to a Reuters report, Xiaomi President Lu Weibing wrote in a social media post that cost pressure is being passed on to the pricing of the company's new and upcoming products.

For context, Xiaomi launched its budget-centric Redmi K90 series in China on Thursday. The base configuration featuring 12GB of memory and 256GB of storage is priced at 2,599 Yuan ($364), which is about 100 Yuan ($14) more than the previous-generation Redmi K80, which launched in November 2024.

Lu further stated that the rising costs of memory chips are far beyond expectations and could continue to rise. Citing consumer dissatisfaction with the price difference between configurations, Xiaomi is planning to lower the price of the most popular K90 model with 12GB memory and 512GB storage by 300 Yuan ($42), bringing the price down to 2,899 Yuan ($407) for the first month of sales.

The cost of NAND and DRAM has risen throughout the year, with Digitimes reporting an estimated 15–20% increase in the fourth quarter of 2025. The reason has been attributed to a combination of rapid AI infrastructure development and supply chain constraints. The report further states that supply shortages forced cloud service providers to buy aggressively, with high-stack 3D NAND products nearly sold out. Due to its faster read speeds and larger die capacities, 3D NAND has seen strong demand from CSP customers.

Back in September, memory and storage manufacturer SanDisk announced a 10% NAND price increase, while Micron temporarily suspended DRAM and NAND price quotations to reassess allocations after forecasts indicated shortages. Meanwhile, Samsung's next-generation V9 NAND, claimed to offer improved density and cost advantages, is nearly sold out ahead of its expected release in the first half of 2026.

These developments have potential implications for consumer pricing, and it seems only the beginning. With NAND and DRAM pricing expected to remain on the higher side due to AI-driven demand and supply constraints, consumers can expect higher prices across a wide range of devices, including desktops, laptops, and even smartphones.

If you find traditional wireless earbuds uncomfortable, or maybe they just won't stay in no matter what you do, there's still hope, thanks to open-ear earbuds like Baseus's Inspire XC1. Open-ear earbuds don't sit directly in your ear, up against your ear canal, which gives them two major advantages over the more common “closed” design (think AirPods Pro with the silicone ear tips): better comfort and situational awareness.

There are currently two styles of open-ear earbuds to choose from: the classic, ear hook design, and the newer clip shape, which wraps around the side of your ear and sort of resembles an earring. The Inspire XC1 belong to the latter group.

You may not be familiar with Baseus; it's a relative newcomer to the personal audio space. And yet, every time I try one of its products, I marvel at how it manages to get so much right, at prices that are well below the competition. The Inspire XC1, crafted in partnership with Bose, are no exception.

I'm sure it's no accident that Baseus created the XC1 in Cosmic Black and Starlight Off-White (pictured here), two colors that mimic Bose's preferred hues. The charging case's plastic is very smooth, making it tricky to open the lid. Once open, it provides easy access to the XC1, which firmly snap in and out of their charging nooks thanks to their strong magnets. You don't get wireless charging, but that feature seems to be a rarity among open-ear models and almost unheard of with clip styles.

Like almost every set of open-ear buds I've tried, the XC1 are very comfortable, even after three hours of constant use, and they're a better option than ear hooks if you wear glasses. Most of the time, I can't even tell that I'm wearing them. Once clipped in place, they hardly budged, even when working out. An IP66 rating gives them excellent protection against both dust and water. Showers are fine, but don't take them swimming.

Like the OpenDots One, the XC1 are reversible. Onboard sensors figure out the left/right balance when you put them on. This is especially useful when dealing with the controls. Baseus uses a single button on each bud, mounted on the battery/electronics pod, and you can decide if you prefer to activate it with your thumb or index finger.

The buttons are a breeze to click, and unlike touch controls, they can be used while wearing gloves. The Baseus app lets you customize the click gestures, with options for single-, double-, triple-, and long-clicks—more than enough flexibility for your preferred playback, volume, calling, and voice assistant controls. As an added convenience, the earbuds have wear sensors that auto-pause and resume your music when you remove or replace them.

Baseus also deserves props for its handling of Bluetooth Multipoint. In the app, you can add a new device pairing and see a list of previously paired devices, making it easy to switch between simultaneous connections.

If you've never tried open-ear earbuds, you should know that, by design, they let in a lot of external sound. It's perfect for conversations; you'll never need to remove an earbud to hear the other person. This also makes them ideal for phone calls, because you can hear your own voice without the muffling effect of regular earbuds. It's better than the best transparency mode.

All of this openness also means that your music is competing with whatever is going on around you. Traffic, coffee shop chitchat, the howl of a treadmill as the person next to you is midway through a high-intensity hit—you'll hear it all, and when it's really loud, it will simply overpower your audio. No set of open-ears can completely compensate for this reality, but the Baseus Inspire XC1 are up with the best.

To help with the XC1's sound (or perhaps its marketing), Baseus partnered with Bose on its three-product Inspire line, which includes the XP1 ANC earbuds and XH1 ANC headphones. According to Baseus, “Bose's legendary audio engineers have fine-tuned the sound performance,” and I'm sure that having Bose know-how helped, but it also didn't hurt that Baseus gave the XC1 a dual-driver system with a dynamic driver for the lows and a Knowles balanced armature for the highs—an unusual setup in the open-ear world.

In what I've come to think of as typical for open-ears, loud locations proved challenging, especially for spoken-word content like podcasts and calls, and the low end lost some of its punch. When things were quieter, however, they wowed me with their bass response and clarity.

Using a selection of some of my favorite headphone test tracks, like Billie Eilish's “Bad Guy,” Dominique Fils-Aimé's “Birds,” and Stevie Ray Vaughn's “Tin Pan Alley,” I compared the Inspire XC1 to leading clip-style models, including the Shokz OpenDots One, Bose Open Earbuds Ultra, and Soundcore AeroClip. The XC1 didn't disappoint, with bass response that goes deeper than Bose's pricey Open Earbuds Ultra, and an overall sound signature that rivals the OpenDots One for midrange and high clarity.

Open-ear earbuds have an inherently wide soundstage that gives a natural, airy feel to the sound. This is true of the XC1, making them an ideal choice for those who like Dolby Atmos Music tracks.

Out of the box, the Inspire XC1 use Baseus's “Sound by Bose” EQ preset, which is a lively mix, but a little too tame in the lows and highs for my liking. Thankfully, the Baseus app gives you six additional presets and the ability to mix your own using an eight-band equalizer. I found only subtle differences between the presets; a custom EQ with boosted lows and highs proved most satisfying. When listening critically, certain bass notes lacked detail, but for casual listening, it didn't bother me at all.

Speaking of critical listening, the XC1 work with Sony's hi-res capable LDAC Bluetooth codec, should you happen to own a compatible Android phone (sorry, iPhone users). Using LDAC can reveal more detail, especially when listening to a source of lossless audio, but for these earbuds, I don't think the juice is worth the squeeze. Using LDAC disables your EQ settings and Bluetooth Multipoint, and the XC1 struggle to maintain a steady Bluetooth connection when LDAC is set to its highest-quality setting.

Baseus also includes two Dolby Audio modes (Music and Cinema), which are meant to create a more immersive, spatial experience. For me, it's the opposite. I find they wash out the sound, with Cinema being downright muddy. At 60 percent volume, there was more than enough power for an engaging listening experience indoors. Outside, I needed a bit more oomph.

Calling on the Inspire XC1 is good. Whether indoors or outdoors, your callers will find it easy to understand you, and almost all background sounds are kept at bay. However, as with most clip-style open-ear earbuds, your voice won't be crystal clear—some distortion does manage to creep in, particularly when outside.

Baseus rates battery life on the XC1 at eight hours per charge, with 40 hours of total use when you include the case's battery, numbers that are only eclipsed by the OpenDots One's 10/40 combo. Baseus assumes 50 percent volume and does not include the use of either Dolby Audio or LDAC. LDAC can be very power hungry, often reducing battery life by up to 30 percent, which is one more reason to avoid it.

Open-ear earbuds aren't for everyone, but with great sound quality, a comfortable, clip-style design, and easy-to-use controls, the Baseus Inspire XC1 are an excellent choice. They check a lot of boxes for a price that's considerably less than their nearest competitors, including strong water and dust resistance, optional LDAC mode, and Bluetooth Multipoint. The only thing that's missing is support for Auracast. Sadly, that feature has yet to see widespread adoption. If you're after an affordable pair of open buds that compete with the best, these are among the best we've tried.

Will there ever be a time when the best gaming monitors reach their maximum speed? Is there an as-yet unknown limit on frame rates? If you subscribe to Moore's Law, you know that for decades, integrated circuits doubled their transistor density about every two years. However, this progress has slowed due to the inevitable physical limitations that arise from creating components not much larger than a molecule. You can only get so small.

Monitors have a ways to go, apparently, because fresh on the heels of my first 500 Hz OLED review, I've just cracked open the box to Asus' latest screamer: the ROG Strix XG248QSG Ace. This 24-inch TN 1080p screen operates at 600 Hz and overclocks to 610 Hz, while also offering Adaptive-Sync and two types of blur reduction. You also get HDR10, accurate wide-gamut color, and brightness over 400 nits. Let's take a look.

The XG248QSG Ace is an esports tool, much like a race car with just enough bells and whistles to be a formidable gaming screen, but without any features that would reduce frame rates, such as excessive resolution. Although many gamers are gravitating towards QHD and UHD screens due to their high pixel density, FHD remains the choice for maximum frame rates. It also utilizes a TN part, which is widely regarded as the most responsive panel technology among LCDs.

Although the pixel density is relatively low at 92ppi, there are some effective picture enhancements, including HDR10 support, wide gamut color, and high brightness. Backlight zone dimming (eight horizontal zones) is also available for HDR and SDR, which, in some cases, increases contrast past the point of measurability. Speaking of that backlight, Asus has upped its game with ELMB (Extreme Low Motion Blur), its form of backlight strobing, AKA black frame insertion. You get ELMB Sync, which works along with Adaptive-Sync to remove blur and prevent frame tears. Alternatively, you can opt for ELMB 2 instead of AS, which offers five levels of pulse width modulation.

Although you sacrifice some off-axis image quality with the TN panel, it remains a bright and colorful screen. The gamut covers around 92% of DCI-P3, which is more than most in the super-fast esports class. Most FHD screens with a refresh rate over 360 Hz are sRGB+ at best. You also get a bright backlight, which peaks at nearly 450 nits for SDR and over 525 nits in HDR mode. The XG248QSG is DisplayHDR 400 certified.

Asus includes its full suite of GamePlus aids, which feature aiming points, sniper mode, timer, stopwatch, multiple frame counters, and alignment marks. You can plug headphones into a 3.5mm jack, but there are no USB ports or internal speakers here. Video inputs include two HDMI 2.1 and a DisplayPort 1.4 with Display Stream Compression (DSC). Slick styling and premium build quality are also included.

So, are there downsides? The price might be an obstacle for some. At the time of writing, the XG248QSG is priced at $1,000. To be fair, it has no exact equal at present. However, one could also purchase a 500 Hz OLED from Asus, the XG27AQDPG, which features QHD resolution and a 27-inch screen with Quantum Dot color, for around the same price. If you're wondering how the two monitors compare, I've included said OLED in my charts so you can see for yourself.

My XG248QSG arrived with the upright already attached; I just had to put on the small but heavy metal base with a captive bolt. The package is very solid and free of any wobble or play. The zippered pouch that ships with nearly all Asus gaming monitors contains just a DisplayPort cable and a small external power supply. There isn't much there, but you don't need more than that to get playing.

The XG248QSG is a full 24 inches diagonal, 24.1 inches to be exact, not 23.5 or 23.8 like most 24-inchers. With a thin bezel, it nearly pulls off the border-free look. A small ROG logo is the only thing you see up front besides the image. The control keys and joystick are around the back right. They're large and easy to operate by feel.

The stand is rock solid despite its small base, which is designed to minimize the XG248QSG's footprint. However, it doesn't compromise stability. The monitor ain't goin' anywhere, even when you might be pounding on the keyboard during intense gameplay. The back of the panel is smoothly tapered from edge to edge and features molded lines that resemble the surface of the Death Star. There are also LEDs back here, in the form of a backlit ROG logo that features multiple colors and effects through Aura Sync and Aura RGB. All of this can be controlled in the OSD or with Asus' DisplayWidget Center app.

The stand has full ergonomics with 5/35 degrees tilt, 45 degrees swivel, 6.3 inches height, and a 90-degree portrait mode. Movements befit a premium display with firm positioning and no play or slop. The stand also features a quarter-inch threaded socket at the top for items such as webcams and desk lights.

The input panel is very recessed, up and under, so much so that I had trouble plugging in my fat-ended cables. There are two HDMI 2.1 ports and a DisplayPort 1.4 with DSC. You also get a 3.5mm headphone jack. There are no USB ports or internal speakers.

The XG248QSG's OSD appears when you press the joystick, or you can use the three control keys to call up often-used functions. The menu is classic Asus ROG with a logical layout and a full set of gaming and image adjustment options.

The Gaming menu is where the XG248QSG's prime features are found. To achieve the full 610 Hz, enable the overclocking toggle. When it's off, you still get 600 Hz. The overdrive has 20 possible settings, making it very precise. Then you come to ELMB, which is the best version of the tech I've seen yet. ELMB Sync works with Adaptive-Sync to prevent motion blur and frame tears. It's very effective and it doesn't have the phasing artifact common to this feature. If you want even more blur reduction, engage ELMB 2 with its five-level pulse width option. This is the smoothest way to play, but you might see the occasional frame tear if you look closely. It depends on the frame rate you're able to achieve. Higher rates don't need as much help, but if you run closer to 200 fps, ELMB is a great choice.

Gaming aids include aiming points in three shapes and two colors, plus a dynamic crosshair that changes color automatically with shifts in the background to remain in contrast. The sniper mode has three magnifications and two colors for the aiming dot. There are countdown timers and a stopwatch. Finally, alignment marks help you precisely line up multiple screens.

GameVisual is the XG248QSG's picture modes and there are nine in total. Racing is the default and it's close to the mark. Minor tweaks take it to even better accuracy. sRGB brings you that smaller gamut if you need it.

The Image menu has luminance controls along with Dynamic Dimming, which employs eight horizontal zones rather than the more typical 16 vertical ones. It's part of the ELMB feature, but it's also a good way to see deeper black levels. For HDR signals, you get three dedicated modes plus an adjust toggle that opens up brightness and contrast controls.

In the Color menu, there's a full set of calibration options including three gamuts, fixed color temps, RGB sliders, color saturation and gamma presets. The XG248QSG is good enough to use without adjustment but a few tweaks of the RGB values bring a small but visible improvement. Here's a tip: for sRGB color, keep it in Racing mode and choose that gamut from the Display Color Space menu. Then, you can calibrate if you want.

Aura is the XG248QSG's LED lighting which is a large ROG logo in the back. It can show multiple colors and effects, and sync with onscreen action through Aura Sync and the DisplayWidget Center app. Two of the control keys can be programmed to the user's wishes and you can save settings in two memory slots for later recall.

Calibrating the XG248QSG isn't strictly necessary, but I went for it with a few changes to the RGB sliders in the User color temp slot. It improved grayscale tracking visibly and made a small change to the gamut as well. I used the wide gamut for SDR content, but if you'd rather use sRGB, just choose it from the available color spaces. The 2.2 gamma preset tracked 2.2 almost perfectly. My recommended settings are below. In HDR mode, Gaming is the default and best choice with accurate EOTF and color tracking. The XG248QSG supports HDR10 signals.

Like any fast monitor, you'll need an equally fast video card to get the most from it. My test PC has a GeForce RTX 4090 and the fastest frame rate I saw in Doom Eternal was 525fps. It fluctuated quite a bit with the numbers dipping down into the 380-390 range at times. But the bottom line is that you'll need something faster than an RTX 4090 to hit the XG248QSG's full 610 Hz at FHD resolution and max detail with HDR engaged.

The best part is the new ELMB implementation, which really takes backlight strobing to another level. I have reviewed many monitors with this feature and with some of them, the phasing artifact is so bad that it is unusable. The XG248QSG is by far the best example. ELMB Sync works seamlessly with Adaptive-Sync, and there is no brightness penalty. Motion resolution is very high. ELMB 2 makes it pretty much flawless with no blur at all, but you will see the occasional frame tear. And brightness is reduced somewhat, depending on how much blur reduction you dial in. The most aggressive setting eliminates all blur, has no phasing, and cuts light by around 40%. Since there's plenty of output headroom, there's no downside. The XG248QSG is super flexible and has enough video processing options to please everyone.

Gameplay is super quick, even when compared against my average skills. Pro gamers will want to check out the XG248QSG for their toolkit. However, comparing it to a fast OLED like the XG27AQDPG, I prefer the look of the OLED, not just because it's QHD but also for its better contrast and richer color. The XG248QSG is certainly colorful, more so than its LCD competitors, but it won't match the saturation of a Quantum Dot OLED.

For daily use, it serves well with its 93ppi pixel density. If you're spoiled by Ultra HD screens, it won't seem sharp, but for tasks like writing or spreadsheets, it's more than adequate. FHD isn't the best choice for photo and graphics work, but at least the XG248QSG has the color to get those jobs done.

My physical interactions were all positive. The XG248QSG has excellent build quality and an intuitive menu system. I could change settings even more easily using Asus' DisplayWidget Center app, which I downloaded for free. Between that, the joystick and the programmable control keys, it was a snap to make changes when needed.

Takeaway: The XG248QSG is a superb monitor and also incredibly fast. If you want to see 500 or 600fps, it's the only game in town. Just make sure you have at least an RTX 4090 in your PC. I'd love to see what an RTX 5090 would look like. But in terms of gameplay experience and image quality, for the money, I'd go for a QHD OLED. Even an Ultra HD OLED will deliver comparable smoothness and the same low input lag at around 200fps for around the same cost as the XG248QSG.

Magic? Not quite, but the solution is genius.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Coil whine is an irritating phenomenon where high-pitched noises can come from a graphics card, motherboard, or power supply. Sometimes it can be obvious, but sometimes it can also be difficult to track down, especially in a noisy environment. The developers behind the stress tester OCCT released version 15 of the stress tester, featuring a coil whine detection tool that doesn't require a microphone.

To do this, OCCT has developed a genius solution that turns the annoying high-pitched frequencies into a method of detecting the source of the noise. "While testing using Switch mode..." OCCT will load up the system artificially to produce one of "three pre-defined tunes", turning the noise from a consistently audible tone into a specific tune that will make the coil whine pop out above whatever other environmental noises might be hiding it.

 




This feature takes advantage of an inherent behavior of coil-whine, where the sound will usually increase as more power is loaded onto whatever component has coil-whine. The same can also happen when power fluctuates very fast between high and low loads. This is why most people will often only hear coil whine while they are gaming, especially while running a game at an exorbitantly high frame rate (such as 300-1000 FPS).

As a reminder, audible coil whine is a natural phenomenon that can exist in several computer hardware components, primarily graphics cards, PSUs, and motherboards. The annoying high-pitched sound is generated by a computer component's electromagnetic coils when current is passed through them.

Not only is it annoying, but coil whine is also highly inconsistent and won't behave the same from one system component to another, even if they are the exact same make and model. Even the behavior of coil whine can be different; some system components might coil whine only during certain (medium-load) workloads, while others might produce audible coil whine only at full load or while idling.

This unique addition to OCCT's feature set probably won't be beneficial for most gamers who keep their gaming PC in their bedroom. Bedrooms are usually quiet, and coil whine will be easy to detect, especially if the gaming PC is the only system in the room. But for offices, internet cafes, or any area where a system might be located in a harsh audible environment, this tester can be beneficial for hunting down coil whine and deciphering whether or not the annoying sound you're hearing is really coil whine or something dangerous.

What are the odds that two AI browsers launch in one week? OpenAI announced Atlas on Wednesday, a ChatGPT-powered Chromium browser, but a tiny startup called Nimo also debuted Nimo Infinity, a canvas-style AI browser with a generative user interface.

I first wrote about Nimo several years ago. The startup originally had a vision to build spatial computing smart glasses, very much like Sightful's Spacetop, and while Nimo chipped away at the project for several years, it finally pivoted.

Nimo Infinity is its first real product (though still in beta), and the software is available for macOS first; a Windows app is in the works. Launch it on macOS, and it'll take over your desktop, providing an AI canvas to space out all of your work.

The idea is that you connect your favorite apps to Nimo Infinity (the browser is based on Chromium), and rather than interacting with your apps in a traditional way, you can use the AI assistant to pull information from your app and have it generate a “Dynamic App” with a custom interface you can tailor to your taste.

For example, you can ask it to “Create a beautiful daily meeting prep app, ” and it can merge your Google Calendar and Gmail data into a unique interface that blends your schedule with relevant emails so you can get prepared before hopping on Zoom.

There are templates to get you started, but you can also play around with the assistant (largely powered by Anthropic's Claude) to craft anything from your connected apps—say, a financial dashboard app with data from Google Sheets. And if you're on a Google Sheet, you can chat with the assistant to have it make changes to the document without fussing with the cells.

I tried to give it a spin, but unfortunately, my “Dynamic App” was stuck trying to create the app for more than 30 minutes. It's a beta! There's a bit of a learning curve in figuring out how the entire canvas system works too.

Right now, you can sign up for early access, and Nimo founder Rohildev Nattukallingal tells me that while Nimo Infinity is free with a limited feature set, you can pay $20 per month to access many of the core features, like Dynamic Apps. Add Nimo to the growing list of companies trying to kill apps in favor of an AI-generated interface.

Aura, maker of digital photo frames, announced the Aura Ink ($499)—a wireless photo frame that runs on a battery. Unlike the rest of its lineup, which uses LCD screens, the Aura Ink has an e-paper display, like the kind on an e-reader or digital notebook. It's powered by E Ink's Spectra 6 tech, which allows pixels to be one of six colors; Aura says it has an algorithm to translate photos into a newspaper-like print style to make it look vibrant and colorful with the limited color range.

Thanks to the e-paper display, the Aura Ink can last up to three months on a single charge, and Aura hopes this design will finally make it possible for folks to hang an Aura frame on their walls without worrying about an unsightly power cord.

Battery life can vary depending on how often the digital frame changes the picture, but the Ink defaults to changing the photo once a day (overnight). That's due to the 30-second refresh the Ink needs to switch pictures. I'm currently testing this frame, so stay tuned for our review. —Nena Farrell

London-based Bamford's new Mayfair 2.0 is all about modular style blended with watchmaking credentials. But this isn't an automatic watch. The 40-milimeter Mayfair 2.0 is driven by a Swiss-made Ronda 3540.D quartz chronograph movement—so solid reliability and performance (with central seconds, 1/10-second counter, 30-minute counter) are delivered while allowing this piece to stay within a relatively accessible price point.

But the Mayfair 2.0 is not really about that quartz center. What sets it apart is its versatility: Each watch comes with interchangeable brightly hued outer cases made from high-density polymer that let wearers click on and swap out different-colored shells and straps.

This plug-and-play approach means you get a robust sports timepiece, with 100-meter water resistance, that can change to match your mood or outfit. I've tried it out, and although the switching of case covers isn't as fluid as I'd like it to be (it can get a touch fiddly), it is a quick process, and the end result is a winner.

However, at £495 ($660), this is a fair chunk more than the Blancpain X Swatch Scuba Fifty Fathoms, and that's a proper automatic diver that's just as colorful. But, crucially, the Mayfair 2.0 is the one that can change its look in less than a minute. —Jeremy White

Many outdoor security cameras rely on batteries, making it easy to install them wherever you want, without worrying about running cables. The problem is that batteries run out of power, sometimes pretty quickly if the camera is in a busy spot, and much faster when the temperature drops.

An increasingly popular solution is the inclusion of a solar panel to keep that battery topped up, enabling you to install and potentially never touch the camera again. Both Wyze and TP-Link just revealed interesting solar-powered cameras this week. Let's talk about Wyze first.

The Wyze Solar Cam Pan ($80) is a 2K outdoor security camera that can pan 360 degrees and tilt 70 degrees. It is IP65-rated, easy to mount, and sports a small solar panel that Wyze reckons can keep the camera running on just one hour of sunlight a day (we shall see as I test through the gray depths of a Scottish winter). The Solar Cam Pan also features AI-powered person tracking, two-way audio, color night vision, a spotlight, and a siren, though you need a subscription, starting from $3 per month, to unlock smart features and get cloud video storage.

Wyze also announced a new, impressively affordable Battery Video Doorbell ($66). We started testing Wyze cameras again recently after it beefed up its security policies, but the repeated security breaches, exposing thousands of camera feeds to other customers, may still give you pause.

Meanwhile, TP-Link is the first manufacturer to combine solar power with floodlight capability in its new Tapo C615F Kit. The similar-looking but larger Tapo C615F is another 2K camera, but it pans 360 degrees, tilts 130 degrees, and, most importantly, has an adjustable 800-lumen floodlight.

TP-Link says its solar panel only needs 45 minutes of sun a day to keep the camera ticking, and it comes with a handy 13-foot cable, so you can install the solar panel in the best spot to catch those rays. The Tapo C615F ($100) is available now, and you can use the promo code 10TAPOFLDCAM to get $10 off if you're quick. —Simon Hill

Fujifilm has released the X-T30 III, an update to the company's entry-level, SLR-shaped mirrorless X-T30 line. The third iteration of the X-T30 pairs Fujifilm's familiar 26-MP X-Trans APS-C sensor with the latest Fujifilm processor, the X-Processor 5. The latter means that the X-T30 III is now roughly the same as the X-M5 and X-T50 in terms of internal features. All of Fujifilm's film simulations are available, as are the subject-recognition AF modes. Video specs also see a bump up to 6.2K 30 fps open gate, and 4K 60 fps with a 1.18X crop.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

The body is nearly identical to the previous model; the size, weight, and button/dial layout are the same as on the X-T30 II. The one change is that the control dial is now a film simulation dial, with three options for custom film recipes. The X-T30 III goes on sale in November at $999 for the body, or $1,150 for the body and a new 13- to 33-mm F3.5-6.3 zoom lens (20 mm- to 50 mm-equivalent). —Scott Gilbertson

In time for the peak shopping season, Intel is launching a variety of "AI Experience Stores" at a few key locations around the world. We don't know exactly what they'll be like, but Intel says these pop-ups will include an "AI-powered shopping experience" of some kind and are based on the initial launch of the trial run store in London last year.

If it keeps that same design ethos intact, these stores will be fairly immersive experiences. There will be lots of AI-driven demos on devices from the wider Windows laptop ecosystem, presumably to help drive interest and curiosity in what PCs can do. Interestingly, it comes on the back of a significant marketing push by Microsoft with its new Windows 11 AI experiences, trying to convince buyers to upgrade and explain some of the new AI features.

Here are the dates and locations below for when Intel's stores will be open. —Luke Larsen

For residents of the southeastern United States, fall signals the return of Joro spiders—huge, bright yellow arachnids from Asia—haunting porches, gardens, and just about anywhere big enough for casting enormous webs.

Joros don't typically pose serious threats to humans. But their autumnal abundance does appear to be the source of significant irritation for local residents—something that David Coyle, an entomologist at Clemson University, knows better than most, as South Carolina's state advisor for invasive species.

After years of fielding Joro-related complaints, Coyle and his team decided to officially investigate these inquiries—a years-long effort resulting in two studies addressing the most common questions about Joro spiders, published Wednesday, October 22, in the Journal of Medical Entomology and the Journal of Economic Entomology.

Gizmodo spoke with Coyle about the spiders and shared tips for dealing with unwanted Joro encounters. The following conversation has been lightly edited for grammar and clarity.

Gayoung Lee, Gizmodo: What are Joro spiders, and why are they considered invasive?

David Coyle: Joro spiders are native to China and parts of Asia. They first got to the U.S. probably around 2010 but were first discovered in 2014 in northern Georgia. Since then, they've spread to multiple states, even all the way up into the Northeast. There are populations in and around Baltimore, Boston, and Pennsylvania. The hotspots are definitely northern Georgia, western South Carolina and North Carolina, and far eastern Tennessee.

They are an invasive species because… well, they're not native to this continent, and they show pretty significant displacement of native species. This is the fifth year of our “spider surveys,” as we call them.

And, where you have high populations of Joro spiders, you have little to no native or weaving spiders of that type. It's still too early to know what their true impact will be, but we're trying to track that down.

Gizmodo: Why do people consider Joros pests?

Coyle: They're incredibly pestiferous, in that they are very comfortable being in and around human structures and landscapes. They won't go inside a house at all, but they'll be on your bushes, on the carport, on the deck, and across doorways. They're also very big and yellow, so people notice them, and we get lots of calls about these things every fall.

Joro spiders are all over north Georgia this year…#spider #joro #jorospider #georgia #crawling #trichonephila #arachnophobia #arachnid #arachnids

 ♬ Spider Song – The Durbervilles 

 

Gizmodo: What kind of calls?

Coyle: Broadly speaking, “How do I get rid of them?” Whether that's “on my favorite bush outside” or “they put a web across the pillars to my house.” The second most common question is, “Are they dangerous? Will they bite me? Will they bite my kids? Will they bite our pets?”

Because these webs are huge—they can be 10, 15, or 20 feet across—and you walk into them to find a big spider on your head. When the adult females, these great big yellow-and-gray striped females, appear all over the place, people think, “Holy crap, what is going on out there?”

Gizmodo: And what advice are you giving the callers?

Coyle: This was actually the reason we did the new studies. We wanted to get concrete answers that weren't just anecdotal. Based on the cumulative years of our team's experience, we knew what happened here. We needed to do it in a scientific way to prove it.

Gizmodo: I see. And how did you answer these questions in the paper?

Coyle: I'll start with what we call the management study, the one for the Journal of Economic Entomology. That was in response to the question, “How can I get rid of them?” So we looked online because we figured this was where people go to find solutions.

We knew there were legitimate spider control products, so we tested several of those. Then we also evaluated things that we just found online: bleach, machine lubricant, hairspray, and some of these non-pest products that people used.

In a scientifically legitimate and systematic way, we tested every one of these compounds on a bunch of spiders to see if it would kill them, and if so, how long it would take. If not, will it at least make the spider leave? Because for some people, maybe they just want it off their porch—not necessarily dead.

What we ended up finding was that most of the commercial products work great. I'm not going to list any specific brands, but if it's labeled as a spider control, that stuff works pretty darn good.

Other things worked, too. I mean, machine lubricant works, but we do not advocate spraying that stuff all over your yard. That's not what it's for. We strongly recommend just using the stuff that's labeled for that purpose, because it works just as well.

Gizmodo: The second paper is about whether Joros are dangerous, right?

Coyle: Right. We did a series of tests where we looked at a spider's reaction to, basically, the human hand. We walked up to spiders in webs. We did everything from just holding our hand near it, trying to touch it, holding it in our hands, cupping it inside, to giving it a little squeeze.

 ♬ original sound – Dr. Dave Coyle 

 

And in almost every case, that spider just wants to get away. They don't want to be held. They don't want to be touched. If you cup them in your hands, they just sort of sit there and freeze. The only time you can really get them to bite is when you pinch them—like, really aggravating it.

Then we said, “Okay, let's say that someone does get bit. How bad is it?” We got 22 volunteers and had them get bitten by Joros. Then we tracked the bite over the course of a week and had the volunteers rate the level of pain based on a system used by pediatricians.

What we found was that it was akin to a mosquito bite. So it'll be a little swollen, red, and itchy for about 24 hours, then it pretty much goes away. And most of the pain levels were super low, like 1 to 2 out of 10.

So the take-home message is that, if you're going to get bit by a Joro spider, you've pretty much got to be really antagonizing the spider.

Gizmodo: You probably brought it upon yourself.

Coyle: You 100% brought it upon yourself. Like, they want no part of you. They would rather not be on you. They would rather not be held by you. They just want to do their thing and be left alone.

And if you accidentally walk into them, what's their response? They're going to drop to the ground and try to get away from you and get off it.

Gizmodo: Having said all that, do you have any personal advice for coexisting with Joro spiders?

Coyle: You don't have to use chemicals to get rid of these things. A broom works great, your foot works great, and a stick works great. And if you just knock them out of their web a few days in a row, they're going to take off and go somewhere else. I always tell people that using chemicals for something like this is often overkill, figuratively speaking.

Then the other thing is that I'd reinforce that they're not going to come in your house.  They don't want to be in your house. This type of spider in general puts its webs between big things outside so stuff can fly into it. So, if there's a Joro spider in your house, that means somebody brought it in there. It's plain and simple.

OpenAI's recently launched Atlas browser is a fascinating inversion of what users may expect from a browser, centering AI answers above traditional web links. Every click in a regular browser is a chance to see a new part of the web. Every click in Atlas is a chance to use ChatGPT.

Just typed a question into the address bar? That's now a ChatGPT query. Want help contextualizing a web page? The Ask ChatGPT sidebar can see and analyze what's on your screen. Want someone to buy your Halloween costume? The “agent mode” can click around on Amazon and throw some vampire fangs into your cart.

Ryan O'Rouke, OpenAI's lead designer for the browser, demonstrated the Ask ChatGPT feature during the livestream announcement of Atlas. He asked it to summarize GitHub code appearing on the web page in his browser. He called it “a major unlock,” since ChatGPT can now see what's happening on the page. "It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet," O'Rouke said.

The Ask ChatGPT feature is notably free to use in Atlas, unlike the browser agent tool that's reserved for subscribers to ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Pro. Here, ChatGPT shows up as another column-constrained bot on the right side of your screen, in the same vein as the AI sidebars in Perplexity's Comet browser and Microsoft's Edge.

After a few days of testing OpenAI's Ask ChatGPT feature in the Atlas Browser, I'm convinced that I want to surf the web alone. Sans sidebar. In peace.

The browser is built using Chromium, an open-source browser project managed by Google that provides the codebase for Chrome, Opera, and others. Because of this, Atlas looks a lot like Chrome. (As I swiped between the two browsers on my laptop during testing, I forgot which was which a couple of times.) The nascent browser's best days are still ahead of it, with a roadmap of upcoming features such as tab groups and an ad-blocker that could build it up to be a more fully realized competitor to Chrome. It's available only on macOS for the time being.

With that in mind, the Ask ChatGPT sidebar in Atlas felt clunky during my first couple of days. Not only was it difficult to get used to, I found myself having trouble thinking of questions to ask about the news articles, online recipes, and other web pages as I scrolled around. Also, the sidebar squishes the main content window, so websites you visit may appear skinnier than usual. It compressed the WIRED homepage, leaving it looking incredibly janky.

When the Ask ChatGPT sidebar is open in Altas, the layout of WIRED's homepage is destroyed.

While browsing the Xbox website for what game to potentially play next, Madden NFL 26 was one of ChatGPT's suggestions after it analyzed the page. A pretty vanilla answer, and not very in line with what the bot knows about me, despite having more than a year's worth of my ChatGPT interactions to pull from for insights.

In another example of the sidebar being underwhelming in this first iteration, I was looking through my personal Gmail inbox with Ask ChatGPT open. I requested help deciding what message to answer first, and its suggestion was to prioritize one I had already answered.

OK, then. Next, I was on the Rotten Tomatoes website trying to decide if Bugonia would be a good date night movie to see in theaters. In the Atlas sidebar, ChatGPT's initial summary of the reviews and other info on the web page was too lengthy to be efficient. I ended up just manually combing through the reviews to get a better sense of the movie's tone.

The oddest, and most memorable, interaction I had with ChatGPT Atlas occurred as I scrolled around on Bluesky and asked it to highlight any trends it saw. (ChatGPT listed “political anxiety” and “everyday absurdism" as two of the trends on my timeline.) I was curious what would happen if I opened my Bluesky DMs, which amounted to just a few old messages from friends. So I asked the bot what it would see if I opened that more private page.

“Opening your DMs won't expose anything to me—I'll simply stop ‘seeing' the page until you go back to a public view (like your feed, profile, or a post),” read part of ChatGPT's answer.

Knowing that my Bluesky DMs don't have anything sensitive, I gave it a whirl. Even though the bot said it wouldn't “see the message list, conversation text, or sender info,” that wasn't the case.

I opened a DM inviting me to an event, then asked the bot a follow-up question asking about the message and what the invitation was about. I received a response from ChatGPT that included facts culled from the conversation, along with details about the sender. What gives? I asked the bot to explain itself, just to see whether it would backtrack the privacy claims it made earlier in the chat.

“I do not have access to your private messages or account data unless you explicitly paste or show that text to me in the chat,” read ChatGPT's response. “What you just did—asking ‘what was this an invite to?'—temporarily surfaced part of the message context so I could answer your question. But I don't have any background or visibility into your inbox beyond what you actively bring into our conversation.”

The first answer the Ask ChatGPT sidebar spit out is a potential example of an AI “hallucination,” aka error, that's common during interactions with generative AI tools. The second is more aligned with how the tool actually works.

While some users may appreciate having a chatbot always pulled up on the side of their screen, ready to surface related facts or summarize details, it felt like an unreliable tour guide to me. One who was overly confident in its bland responses and taking up too much space.

I'll keep testing Atlas as my main browser for the next few weeks, but for now, I'm leaving that sidebar closed. I prefer the fullscreen version of the internet.

In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

“It is here, it is real, it is happening,” said play-by-play announcer Ian Eagle. “The NBA on Prime.”

And with that, Amazon's foray into live streaming NBA games tipped off. 

Amazon marked a major milestone with its growing sports portfolio on Friday, broadcasting its first-ever live NBA game around the world. The matchup — Celtics vs. Knicks — was part of an 11-year deal that gives Amazon exclusive rights to select regular season and playoff games.

We watched the game via Prime Video — accessible with a $139/year Prime subscription — and came away impressed. 

The stream ran seamlessly across Fire TV, iPhone, and MacBook. The quality was crisp, load times near-instant, and there wasn't a hint of lag — at least on a home WiFi connection. Amazon's 1080p HDR video and 5.1 surround sound were a slam dunk.

The broadcast looked and felt like a traditional national telecast. The graphics mirrored what fans expect from ESPN or TNT, the commentary came from familiar voices — Eagle and Stan Van Gundy — and the pregame show from featured a slick set with former NBA stars at Amazon MGM Studios.

But under the surface, Amazon quietly tested a new frontier: in-stream sports betting. 

The most noticeable new feature was the FanDuel integration, Amazon's latest experiment in blending live sports and interactive technology. 

Fans watching on Fire TV could log into their FanDuel accounts through Prime Video to view real-time betting information and track wagers directly within the broadcast.

You can't make actual bets on Prime Video — not yet, at least— but it marks a subtle yet significant shift in how live sports may evolve on streaming platforms.

And it comes at a fascinating moment: the NBA is dealing with a major betting scandal that made headlines this week and involves the FBI.

I was surprised when NBA Commissioner Adam Silver joined the broadcast for a live interview. Sideline reporter Cassidy Hubbarth opened by asking about the scandal.

Silver said he was “deeply disturbed” upon hearing the news.

“There's nothing more important to the league and its fans than the integrity of the competition,” he said.

Silver also praised Amazon's coverage: “I should have started [by saying] how excited we are to be on Amazon,” he said. “I guess I wouldn't have predicted that my first interview on Amazon would be about sports betting.”

The interview underscored how Amazon's coverage didn't shy away from real-time news relevance — adding a traditional journalistic layer within a tech-powered broadcast.

It was also a surreal moment: the NBA's top official discussing a sports betting scandal during the league's debut on a platform now integrating betting tools into its stream.

Amazon has other new tech-fueled features including advanced NBA stats powered by Amazon Web Services — but I didn't notice that during Friday's broadcast.

One of the only stumbles for me came on the Fire TV user experience, which feels clunky compared to mobile or desktop. Navigation wasn't intuitive, and the remote's button mapping made simple actions harder than expected.

But overall, the whole experience felt less like a tech demo and more like a finished product.

Amazon's sports strategy is crystalizing: use live sports to drive Prime signups and boost engagement across its ecosystem. The broadcast was promoted on Amazon's homepage and apps. Live sports also helps fuel Amazon's growing advertising business.

Bloomberg reported that Amazon is paying $1.8 billion annually for the NBA rights. 

As more people cut the cord, sports leagues are increasingly partnering with tech companies as their existing deals with traditional cable providers expire. Companies like Amazon, Apple, and Netflix are hungry for valuable content such as live sports to draw more subscribers to their respective platforms.

Amazon also aired the Timberwolves vs. Lakers game on Friday evening. It will stream 66 regular season games this year, along with some playoff games. 

The company also separate deals to air the NFL's Thursday Night Football, WNBA, and Premier League, among other sports-related programming on its Prime Video platform.  

The NBA debut on Friday was a reminder of Amazon's approach to live sports: combine the reliability of broadcast TV with subtle tech layers — such as betting, data, and e-commerce — built on its AWS cloud infrastructure and Prime membership model.

Getting into drone photography used to mean dropping serious cash on bulky equipment that required FAA registration but the DJI Mini 4K changes that equation completely. This drone weighs less than 249 grams which keeps it under the threshold that requires registration in most countries and which makes it perfect for casual flyers who want cinematic 4K footage without bureaucratic headaches.

Right now, Amazon has this drone marked down to $239 from its usual $299 price, but here's the catch: this deal is exclusively for Prime members. That's an all-time low for what might be the most accessible entry point into serious aerial photography. If you need more than the included 31 minutes of flight time, DJI also has bundles with two or three batteries on sale, which lets you extend your sessions without constantly heading back to charge.

The 4K UHD camera is resting on a three-way mechanical gimbal which helps to stabilize your footage in real time, countering wind gusts, rapid motions and the body vibrations that come with the rotation of two fans inches from the lens. The stabilization system is what makes the difference between professional footage that is smoothed out in a visually pleasing manner versus the shaky footage that screams “low-end drone quality.”

The 10km video transmission range gives you immense creative liberty to travel to far-off places with an uninterrupted video feed to control the drone with. Translated into reality, there would be no need for you to range the drone with its maximum video transmission range since it is mandatory for a video feed to be in your line of vision, even if it is a thousand meters away. The video feed is made possible with DJI's OcuSync technology which switches between 2.4GHz to 5.8GHz channels for a stable video feed is pertinent since it prevents interference from other sources, like WiFi signals in a location in an office space or other drones in flight range, which could hamper the video feed in a budget cord with other drones.

The auto return function removes any anxiety associated with drone flight by automatically guiding it back to where it came from if its battery gets critical, if the signal is lost, or if it's manually retuned with the return button. The drone can track its position using its GPS system by memorizing where it came from; hence, it returns using the safest path it identified during its original flight by tracking the obstacles it originally identified during its flight path. With such technology, losing the drone is even less likely since two major factors cause loss – battery drain and loss of signal – would no longer pose a problem.

Wind resistance is wind level 5, which is equivalent to winds with a maximum speed of 38 kilometers an hour, or 24 miles an hour. That is quite strong for handling different types of weather that different environments pose during recreational flight activities. The drone is small in size with a sleek body shape that prevents wind from affecting it in the same manner it would affect other drones with a boxy shape.

The maximum flight time is 31 minutes which is measured in optimal situations with no wind and with only minimal maneuvering, so in practice, it's more likely to be 25 minutes, which is fantastic for a drone with such a small size, providing time for location scouting, setting up shots, and doing multiple takes without constantly having to return for a battery changeover. The intelligent flight capabilities allow for QuickShots, where complex action shots for the camera can be implemented, such as dronie shots, helix shots, and boomerang shots, which would need quite a bit of piloting skill to do manually.

The controller is compatible with your cell phone, and converts your screen into a live viewfinder that displays real-time telemetry information such as altitude, distance, battery level, and GPS signal strength. The app's control interface is user-friendly even for an introductory pilot yet allows advanced settings for professional flyers who would like manual control over settings such as ISO, aperture, shutter speed, and white balance. The drone is foldable to fit into a small bag/jacket pocket for portability during travel, hiking, or an impromptu flight session.

At $239 for Prime members, it's the lowest that the DJI Mini 4K has ever been on Amazon.

Lost keys, misplaced wallets, luggage that vanishes at baggage claim: These daily frustrations cost time, stress and sometimes money when you need replacements. Apple AirTags solve this problem by turning any item into something you can locate instantly through your iPhone. The 4-pack normally sells for $99, but Amazon has it down to $64 right now, working out to just $16 per AirTag compared to $29 when bought individually. This record low price explains why Amazon has been moving these by the thousands for months which makes AirTags one of the top three best-selling tech products on the platform.

AirTags rely on the “Find My” network built by Apple,with access to over hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads, and Macs in use worldwide. As soon as you put an AirTag on your keys or in your backpack, it is possible to track it with the Find My app on your iPhone. You only need to use the Find My app to play a sound on the AirTag if it's missing in your home which makes it possible to relocate it using its speaker. You can also use “Hey Siri, find my keys.”

When it's time to look for things close by, Precision Finding relies on Ultra Wideband technology (found in the iPhone 11 and later models) to give you a specific distance and course to take to reach your AirTag. You'll see arrows on the screen guiding you with real-time distance readings so that your iPhone becomes akin to a metal detector for locating your goods in a cluttered room, perhaps with something dropped on the floor beneath piles of furniture or with keys fallen between the cushions on the couch.

Where the power of the service really kicks in is if an item goes missing off the premises of your own home. Since so many Apple devices are linked into the Find My system, any iPhone that happens to pass near where your missing AirTag is located will using anonymous and secure means relay its location back to you. You do not have to be in the vicinity in any way to track down where your item is located. When your backpack happens to get left on the bus with no driver in sight, or perhaps your luggage goes astray on its route from the airport, the location tracking done by the Find My system continues so long as other Apple devices happen to be in range.

Lost mode introduces an additional level of location recovery: When using the Find My app on an AirTag that has been misplaced, an immediate notification is received directly for its detection by the system. Additionally, you can engrave it with a message containing your contact information such that if it is lost, then the concerned item's location can be obtained by scanning it using an NFC-enabled iPhone or any other cell phone by someone who then gets in touch in return for handing over your item.

Setup is seamless and takes only seconds: You simply take the AirTag from its packaging, peel off the plastic protector to turn on the battery, and then press it against your Apple device. An alert pops up on your screen, which you simply tap to set up the AirTag by naming it according to what item it is that you want to track with it.
AirTags have a CR2032 coin cell battery with an average life span of over a year before it needs replacement. There's an alert on your iPhone once the battery goes low in power, and changing it requires only 10 seconds. You only need to turn the stainless steel back cover counterclockwise, insert a new battery, and then twist it backclockwise.

The AirTags themselves have an IP67 rating for water-resistance and dust-resistance so they can withstand immersion in water up to one meter deep for 30 minutes.

There's also a means to share AirTags with up to five other individuals. When your entire family uses the same car keys or the same luggage for traveling, each member can track it with their own device if the item is shared with all five family members.

At $16 for an AirTag in this 4-pack, you're getting Apple's tracking system for the best possible price it's ever offered.

The menopause transition can be a difficult part of a person's life. Hot flashes are a common symptom, but the effects of hormonal changes can run much more deeply and affect everyday life.

The research team of the new literature review, affiliated with BRAVE Lab at Ponce Health Sciences University, noted patterns in brain changes caused by hormones that may help explain many menopause-related symptoms.

The team will present their findings at the 2025 Annual Meeting of The Menopause Society.

Considering the impact menopause transition can have, especially throughout a decade or more of a woman's life, the researchers of the new review wanted to review existing studies to see what links they could find between menopause and brain structure changes. 

To do this, they searched various databases for studies published within the past five years related to menopausal symptoms and brain structure. They focused on the most recent research and only included peer-reviewed studies in their review. 

After going through the studies, the researchers compiled the links they found between menopause and brain structure. 

One pattern the review noted was that gray matter volume in the brain decreased. 

Gray matter is significant in terms of day-to-day functioning, and a decrease in gray matter is associated with cognitive decline. 

While this may sound concerning, the researchers said some studies suggest that gray matter volume may partially recover in postmenopause. This indicates that the brain may adapt and reorganize itself over time.

The research team also noticed a pattern in findings related to menopause and white matter hyperintensities. 

White matter hyperintensities show up as bright areas on MRI scans and may reflect stress or damage to the brain's communication pathways. 

These spots can affect everyday thinking, memory, and mood, and may signal an increased vulnerability to certain neurological conditions over time. The hyperintensities were more pronounced in women who went through early menopause and who had frequent vasomotor symptoms (also known as hot flashes and include night sweats).

Overall, the findings suggest menopause may lead to measurable changes in brain structure, which may impact memory, thinking, and mood.

Stephanie Faubion, MD, medical director for the Menopause Society, spoke with Medical News Today about the review. She cautioned against becoming overly concerned about some of the links found between menopause and gray matter volume loss. 

“While we know that menopause is related to some structural brain changes, we don't have a clear understanding of whether these structural changes cause functional changes or cognitive decline,” said Faubion. 

Faubion added that women who experience forgetfulness or trouble concentrating during the menopause transition should not assume it signals something more serious. 

“Indeed, there is no evidence that symptoms of ‘brain fog' during the menopause transition are associated with later risk of dementia, which is reassuring,” Faubion pointed out. 

Rhonda R. Voskuhl, MD, Professor of Neurology at UCLA and Inventor of CleopatraRX, also spoke with MNT about the review and discussed the importance of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) during menopause.

“Early treatment with estrogen for menopause is better than later treatment,” said Voskuhl. “Women are thought to become less responsive to estrogen treatment over the years.” 

It's important to note that people who still have a uterus will also need progesterone.

Voskuhl also touched on long-term cognitive concerns for women who experience brain fog during menopause. She pointed out that “not all menopausal women get Alzheimer's disease,” but it does affect women disproportionately. 

“Loss of neuroprotective estrogen during menopause may contribute to susceptibility to getting Alzheimer's disease 10 to 20 years later,” commented Voskuhl. She said that this would have to be further studied, including treating menopausal women with HRT to determine whether a “cause and effect relationship” exists.

Menopause occurs when an individual hasn't had a period for one full year, a signal that the ovaries have stopped producing most of their estrogen and progesterone. 

The time leading up to menopause is called perimenopause, or the menopause transition, which can last for a decade or more. The average age of menopause is 51 to 52.

However, some people may reach menopause earlier, and those who undergo treatment for certain cancers or have their ovaries removed will reach medical menopause without going through perimenopause.

During this time, people experience physical and emotional changes resulting from shifting hormone levels. The symptoms of menopause can vary in intensity from mild to more disruptive.

Common symptoms include: 

Another symptom that people report is brain fog or cognitive difficulties. These cognitive changes may include difficulty remembering things and concentrating, which can lead to frustration, anxiety, and depressive feelings. 

There are some ways to treat the symptoms caused by menopause. Doctors can prescribe hormone therapy, which can provide some relief for hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness. 

They can also prescribe selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), an antidepressant class that includes drugs such as escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), or sertraline (Zoloft), for mood symptoms and hot flashes.

However, not everyone is a candidate for hormone therapy during menopause. Each individual can discuss their options with a doctor.

Researchers at North Carolina State University have shown a link between the size of cockroach home infestations and the levels of both allergens and endotoxins in those homes, with lowering roach infestation numbers through pest control triggering significant declines in the levels of allergens and endotoxins. The study's findings suggest that eliminating cockroach infestations could help improve indoor environmental health by greatly reducing allergens and endotoxins.

Endotoxins are bacterial cellular components that get released when bacteria die. As omnivores that will eat just about anything, cockroaches have a rich and diverse gut microbiome. Previous research has shown that cockroaches shed a lot of endotoxins through their fecal matter, although house pets – and humans – can also shed endotoxins. The researchers in this study found that a large amount of the endotoxins found in household dust was associated with cockroach feces. 

"Endotoxins are important to human health, as inhalation of these components has been shown to provoke allergic responses," said Coby Schal, the Blanton J. Whitmire Distinguished Professor of Entomology at NC State and co-corresponding author of a paper describing the research. "Past surveys in U.S. homes found endotoxin levels much higher in homes with self-reported evidence of cockroaches; that association is stronger in low-income homes than in single-family homes." 

The study, held in multi-unit apartment complexes in Raleigh, N.C., compared estimated cockroach infestation sizes as well as allergen and endotoxin levels in homes infested by cockroaches. These baseline levels were tabulated by capturing settled and airborne dust in homes.

The researchers found significant amounts of endotoxins in infested homes, with female cockroaches excreting about twice the amount that males excreted. 

"Female cockroaches eat more than males, so more endotoxins are shed from their fecal matter," said Madhavi Kakumanu, an NC State research scholar in Schal's lab and co-corresponding author of the paper. She added that more endotoxins were found in kitchens than in bedrooms, as more cockroaches live in kitchens where they find more food.

Infested homes were then divided into untreated homes and homes receiving an extermination intervention to eliminate cockroaches. The researchers also included a control group of homes that had no cockroaches. Cockroach counts and floor and airborne dust samples were taken three months and six months into the study.

The results showed that infested homes without extermination had very large amounts of both endotoxins and allergens at all timepoints. 

Meanwhile, in most cases, infested homes that received the extermination intervention were rid of both cockroaches and their allergens, and experienced significant declines in endotoxins. 

When you eliminate cockroaches, you eliminate their allergens. Small decreases in cockroaches don't lower allergen levels because the remaining live cockroaches deposit more allergens. Endotoxins significantly decreased in homes where cockroaches were eliminated. This paper shows that the cockroach is the most important depositor of endotoxin in infested homes."

Coby Schal, the Blanton J. Whitmire Distinguished Professor of Entomology at NC State 

"We also saw that allergens and endotoxins can be airborne," Kakumanu said.

Schal added that next steps include further examining interactions between cockroach allergens and endotoxins in animal models of asthma, such as mice.

"There exists the implication that asthma can be worse due to interactions between allergens and endotoxins," Schal said. "We want to see if that is the case in mice."The study appears in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global. NC State's Richard G. Santangelo, Zachary C. DeVries at the University of Kentucky and Jeffrey Siegel of the University of Toronto co-authored the paper.

Metabolism guides the activation states of regulatory T cells, the immune cells that prevent inappropriate activation of the immune system. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital scientists recently uncovered how mitochondria, the powerhouse of cells, and lysosomes, cellular recycling systems, work together to activate and deactivate these immune controllers. Their discoveries carry implications from understanding autoimmune and inflammatory diseases to improving immunotherapy for cancer. The findings were published today in Science Immunology.

When the immune system identifies and responds to a threat, it creates inflammation to combat the problem. A subset of immune cells, called regulatory T cells, also become activated and ensure that the inflammation is properly controlled. They return a tissue to normal once the threat is neutralized. Regulatory T cells play such an important role that the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in recognition of their original discovery.

When regulatory T cells don't function properly, people can develop tissue damage from uncontrolled inflammation or autoimmune disorders due to the immune system being inappropriately activated. Despite their importance, the precise molecular process driving regulatory T cell activation has been unclear. This limits the capacity to harness these cells to treat autoimmune or inflammatory disorders.

We discovered how regulatory T cells are activated and become more immunosuppressive during inflammation. By defining how cellular metabolism rewires regulatory T cells through different states of activation, including their return to a resting state, we have provided a roadmap to explore future therapeutic interventions or ways to improve existing immune-related treatments."

Hongbo Chi, PhD, corresponding author, Department of Immunology chair and Center of Excellence for Pediatric Immuno-Oncology (CEPIO) co-director

The scientists uncovered a link between metabolism and signaling and regulatory T-cell activation by performing single-cell RNA sequencing of these T cells in a mouse model of inflammation. They noted four unique 'states' that emerged from analyzing gene expression related to energy production and cellular metabolism.

"We saw that these regulatory T cells undergo dynamic metabolic changes, starting out in a relatively 'quiescent' or relatively inactive metabolic state, then transition to an intermediately activated and then a highly metabolically activated state, before returning to a baseline status," said first author Jordy Saravia, PhD, St. Jude Department of Immunology. "That final subset, which re-enters metabolic quiescence, has never been described for regulatory T cells, but may explain how these immune suppressors are 'turned off' when their task is done."

After discovering the different regulatory T cell activation states, the researchers wanted to know the mechanisms controlling these transitions. Using electron microscopy, they found that the more activated cell states contained more mitochondria than the resting cell states. Additionally, mitochondria from the more activated states contained more dense cristae, or "folds", like having more generators in each power plant, suggesting that this mechanism is an important part of regulatory T cell activation during inflammation.

Interestingly, when the scientists deleted Opa1, a gene needed for mitochondria to alter their cristae, they saw that the cells partially compensated by increasing the abundance of lysosomes. Lysosomes recycle materials from the inside of cells, which can then be used to make energy or other building blocks. However, regulatory T cells without Opa1 still failed to generate sufficient energy or maintain their immunosuppressive function.

When the researchers instead deleted a gene critical for restraining lysosomes, Flcn, regulatory T cells again became defective. Through additional experiments, they uncovered that deletion of either Flcn or Opa1 altered the activity of TFEB, a protein that controls lysosome-associated gene expression as part of an energy stress-response pathway. They further demonstrated that this link between mitochondrial dysfunction and increased TFEB activity was due to enhancing signaling of another major pathway, AMPK signaling, presenting further evidence of intercommunication between the two organelles.

"We are the first to dissect this inter-organelle signaling between mitochondria and lysosomes in regulatory T cells," Saravia said. "It shows that these metabolic signaling pathways control discrete activation states, and ultimately, how well these cells perform their immunosuppressive functions."

One of the researchers' surprising findings is that without Flcn, regulatory T cells are unable to upregulate gene expression programs that let them gather in non-lymphoid tissues such as the lung and liver. Those same programs are also associated with regulatory T-cell function in tumors, which suppress the activity of anti-tumor immune cells. The researchers tested if Flcn deletion in regulatory T cells could help anti-tumor immune cells to better control tumor growth.

They found that this gene deletion enabled more effective immune responses against tumors, leading to decreased tumor size. Notably, Flcn deletion in regulatory T cells also reduced the accumulation of exhausted CD8+ T cells, a subset of cells that can impede responses to immunotherapies in tumors. These findings suggest that altering Flcn activity in regulatory T cells may open a new avenue to improve anti-tumor immunity and benefit cancer immunotherapies.

"We've taken the first unbiased look at the metabolic mechanisms of how regulatory T cells become activated during inflammation," Chi said. "We now have a better understanding of how organelles direct resting versus highly activated regulatory T-cell states in inflammation and tissues, providing new insights that will help improve treatments for autoimmune disorders and cancer."

The ability to sense heat protects the body from burns and injury. But how the body actually feels temperature has remained an elusive mystery.

Now, Northwestern University researchers have captured a detailed look at one of the body's major heat sensors, revealing how it turns on when temperatures rise. 

This sensor, called TRPM3, sits in the cell membrane, where it acts like a tiny gate. When TRPM3 detects heat, it allows charged particles, or ions, to flow into the cell. This triggers nerve signals, which the brain interprets as heat or pain. To their surprise, the scientists found that heat is sensed from within - by the part of the TRPM3 protein that lies inside the cell, not the section embedded within the membrane as previously assumed. 

The finding uncovers a new way that cells sense temperature and helps explain how the nervous system distinguishes harmless warmth from dangerous heat. Because TRPM3 also is involved in pain, inflammation and epilepsy, the discovery could lead to new types of non-addictive pain treatments.

The study will be published on Friday (Oct. 24) in Nature Structural & Molecular Biology.

"Temperature is an ever-present environmental factor that affects how we sense the world," said Northwestern's Juan Du, who co-led the study with Wei Lü. "It also affects how our bodies heal and how diseases progress. Understanding how temperature is detected at the molecular level can help us design better treatments for pain and inflammation."

Du and Lü are professors of molecular biosciences at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, professors of pharmacology at the Feinberg School of Medicine and members of Northwestern's Chemistry of Life Processes Institute. Sushant Kumar, a postdoctoral fellow in the Du and Lü Labs, is the lead author of the study.

Because it can't be seen or tracked directly, studying heat is notoriously difficult. Scientists often study drugs by watching them bind to proteins, but temperature has no physical shape or binding site.

To overcome this, Du and Lü's teams used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) -a technique that takes thousands of pictures of flash-frozen proteins - to create 3D images of TRPM3 at near-atomic detail. They also used electrophysiology, which measures electrical currents through the protein, to watch how TRPM3 behaves in living cells.

Using a chemical that mimics heat, the researchers captured the "active" state of TRPM3. Then, using an epilepsy drug that binds to the protein, they captured the "inactive" state. Comparing these structures revealed which parts of the protein shift during activation. This provided the foundation for understanding how the sensor responds to heat. The team then imaged TRPM3 at low and high temperatures, finding that both heat and chemical activators trigger similar structural rearrangements inside the protein.

By combining imaging and electrical recordings, the team found that TRPM3 functions as a molecular switch made of four parts. When the inner regions of these parts hold tightly together, the sensor stays inactive. Heat or a chemical activator disrupts these connections, shifting the protein into its active state.

"Both heat and chemical activators push the same internal switch to activate the channel," Du said. "In contrast, the epilepsy drug jams that same switch, preventing it from changing shape."

Because TRPM3 is found in both the brain and sensory neurons in the skin, tuning its activity could help manage chronic pain or neurological disorders.

When TRPM3 becomes overactive, it can cause pain. By learning how this sensor detects heat and how to control its activity, we may discover new pain-relief strategies that are safer and less likely to cause addiction."

Wei Lü, professor of molecular biosciences at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences

The study, "Structural basis for agonist and heat activation of nociceptor TRPM3," was supported by the National Institutes of Health (award numbers R01HL153219, R01NS112363, R01NS111031 and R01NS129804), a McKnight Scholar Award, Klingenstein-Simon Scholar Award, Sloan Research Fellowship and a Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences award.

A multiple sclerosis (MS) patient in the UK was the first to receive CAR T cell therapy, invented by UCL researchers, in a clinical trial testing whether this personalized treatment can slow or even halt the progression of the disease.

Emily Henders, 37, of Bushey in Hertfordshire, received her infusion at UCLH in October 2025 and is looking forward to being discharged from hospital.

She said: "I hope taking part in the trial means I will never have to experience another relapse and that my MS symptoms will not progress. I know it is still experimental but it offers a scientific rationale which, as a biology teacher, makes sense to me."

MS is a condition that affects nerves in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). In MS, the myelin coating that protects the nerves is damaged. This causes a range of symptoms such as blurred vision and problems with movement, memory and thinking.

There is no cure for MS, and while there are several treatments available to help manage symptoms or slow the progression of the disease, none are fully effective in preventing relapses or the long-term progression of the condition.

But with a CAR T cell therapy (obecabtagene autoleucel, known as obe-cel) proven to be highly effective in blood cancer patients, researchers have turned their attention to autoimmune conditions such as lupus and now MS.

CAR T cell therapy works by resetting the immune system by depleting B cells, which are thought to drive the autoimmune attack in MS. The therapy modifies the patient's own T cells to target and eliminate B cells (both types of immune cell), potentially leading to long-term remission and halting disease progression.

Dr. Claire Roddie, a UCL Cancer Institute researcher and UCLH consultant hematologist who has been instrumental to the UCL/UCLH collaboration on new treatments using CAR T cell therapy, said: "It is fantastic to be involved in the development of obe-cel for patients with MS and this Phase I clinical study will help us understand how safe and effective obe-cel is for MS. Our ultimate goal is to achieve long periods of disease remission with a single, one-time CAR T treatment."

The principal investigator on the clinical trial, called AUTO1-MS1, is Wallace Brownlee, a consultant neurologist at UCLH and clinical lead for multiple sclerosis at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery.

Dr. Brownlee said: "Although treatments for MS have dramatically improved in recent years, none of the available medication fully stops relapses or progression of the illness. CAR T cell therapy is an exciting new frontier in the treatment of autoimmune conditions, and this trial will be essential to understanding the feasibility and safety of CAR T in people with MS."

Despite the uncertainty about whether the therapy will work for her, Emily remains focused and keen to tackle her condition head on.

She added: "Ultimately, I am doing my best to preserve my ability to live life fully, and to enjoy it with my family for many years to come, without the limitations that this disease can bring. My focus is on living fully despite MS - being a wife, a mother, a teacher, and someone who refuses to be defined by illness.

"My journey with MS is about choice and action. I choose to be proactive, to educate myself, and to confront uncertainty head-on. While the path is often unpredictable and daunting, I refuse to let MS dictate my life and I remain hopeful, not only for myself but for others who may one day benefit from advances in treatment."

There are more than 150,000 people with MS in the UK and nearly 7,100 people are newly diagnosed each year.

Dr. Frederick Vonberg, from UCL Department of Neuromuscular Diseases and UCLH, said: "This trial is open to UK patients diagnosed with relapsing or progressive forms of MS who are not responding well to the best medications already available and whose disability is worsening. We encourage patients aged between 18 and 60 years to speak to their neurologist and explore whether they might be eligible for a referral to this trial. The trial aims to recruit up to 18 patients globally by early 2027."

The CAR T cell therapy being tested in this clinical trial was invented by scientists from the UCL Cancer Institute, led by Dr Martin Pule, and has delivered promising results in treating patients with an aggressive blood cancer.

The second-generation obe-cel CAR T cell therapy has reduced immune toxicity and persists for longer in blood cancer patients, overcoming two common limitations of earlier CAR T cell therapies.

It was licensed by UCL spinout Autolus and recently obtained the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approval for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia but remains an experimental treatment for autoimmune conditions.

Dr. Roddie and Dr Brownlee are supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) UCLH Biomedical Research Centre (BRC). The BRC has been crucial to the development of CAR T therapy at UCL and UCLH, which has helped to lay the groundwork for this trial, with CAR T now being trialled in MS.

This study is an example of how we are taking a promising new therapy, which has already been shown to work well in some cancers, and extending it into other disease areas. It is truly groundbreaking work reflecting the combined strengths of UCLH and UCL, and made possible by NIHR support through our Biomedical Research Centre. It is also a great example of our close working relationships with the biotech industry. Thanks to studies like this, many more patients could benefit from CAR T therapy in future."

Bayern Munich chief Max Eberl has seemingly confirmed that the club will pursue a move for Crystal Palace and England defender Marc Guehi as the German champions look to bolster their backline. Guehi, who is in the final year of his existing deal at Selhurst Park, has been linked with a move away from the club next summer as a free agent, with clubs including Liverpool and Inter in the race to sign him.

Bruno Fernandes made his 300th appearance for Manchester United as he started against Brighton on Saturday. The Portuguese midfielder joined United in January 2020 from Sporting CP and is regarded as the best signing the club has made in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. The captain made his milestone appearance five months after rejecting a succulent offer to join Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal.

Get unrivaled matchday access

Alex Morgan scored the first of her incredible 123 goals with the U.S. Women's National Team almost exactly 15 years ago, on Oct. 6, 2010.

China was leading the U.S. Women's National Team late into the match. Following a China goal kick, the U.S. won the 50-50 ball around midfield. Defender Heather Mitts played the ball forward from her position at right back. While forward Abby Wambach chased the ball down, Morgan anticipated how the play was unfolding, as a proficient forward often does. She made an overlapping run toward goal so when Wambach flicked a header into Morgan's path, the budding star stayed composed to give herself the opportunity to score. She smashed the ball into the net.

The rest was history.

“It was one of the best moments that I can remember with the team because it was really the start of something great for me,” Morgan said. “It was a great first goal, and I'm excited to be back at that stadium and be honored in this way so many years later.”

Two Women's World Cups and an Olympic gold medal later, Morgan will have the chance to revisit that epic beginning when the U.S. Women's National Team returns to Pennsylvania for a friendly on Oct. 23. Prior to kickoff against Portugal at Subaru Park, Morgan will be honored for her illustrious career, and the first 2,000 fans through the gate will receive a limited-edition bobblehead.

Morgan and Wambach, the two players who combined for the iconic equalizer, would become two of the most prolific goal scorers in Women's National Team history. Wambach will be there at the stadium on Thursday to help celebrate her former forward line running mate. 

“To have the first assist ever be from Abby was very fitting because I had so many great years up top with her,” Morgan said. “She's one of my favorite people ever and one of the best players ever in the history of soccer.”

The goal was symbolic of the type of high-octane scoring prowess the two brought to the U.S. After Wambach retired in 2015 as the No. 1 goal scorer in Women's National Team history, Morgan elevated to become the team's primary target up top for the next several years. The pair scored a total of 307 goals combined during their international careers and individually finished top-5 in program history in scoring.

Last fall, Morgan announced her retirement from club and country, finishing her international career with 176 combined goals and assists, the fifth most all-time. The 36-year-old is one of several notable names from a star-studded class of U.S. Women's National Team icons who have retired in the last few years including Megan Rapinoe, Julie Ertz, Becky Sauerbrunn, Meghan Klingenberg, Tobin Heath and most recently Christen Press.

“To retire around the same time and really have this be the end of an era for myself and these players that played all through the 2010s and some of the 2020s, we had a really great run,” Morgan said.

That run includes titles at the 2015 and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, where Morgan recorded a total of seven goals across those two tournaments. Among her nine World Cup goals is the epic “tea sipping” game-winner against England on her birthday that led to her taking home the Silver Boot in 2019. 

“It's the end of an era that I'm really proud of,” she said. “I think we carried the team to where we needed to get it to, and now we feel really confident in where we've left it and with who we've left it with, and that's this next team that has already done incredibly great.”

For Morgan, retirement means a plethora of new opportunities that she's primed to tackle with the same fearless tenacity she displayed on the pitch. As one of the most iconic female athletes in the world, Morgan takes pride in using her position to raise awareness for female athletes and champion women's causes.

“There are a lot of things that I'm doing now on the business side that I'm really proud of,” she said. “Having the background in sports has given me so much to be able to feel like I can accomplish a lot now in the business world.”





Her venture fund, Trybe Ventures, which she runs with her husband Servando Carrasco, invests in early-stage companies focused on sports and health technology. She is also a co-founder of Togethxr, a media company that focuses on female athletes, highlighting women's sports and creating a community for fans of women's games. 

“It's not a rinse and repeat situation,” Morgan explained when talking about looking at sports through a female lens. “You look at the demographic of the fans, you look at the companies and brands that can resonate with female athletes and the fans of female athletes are much different than the men's side. Women's sports versus men's sports are inherently different. And that goes for every sport. It doesn't matter if it's soccer, basketball, golf, lacrosse, whatever it may be.”

Morgan's advocacy for highlighting the women's game reflects the narrative driven by fellow industry leaders such as U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes and Washington Spirit majority owner Michele Kang. These thought leaders in the sport support viewing soccer through a female lens. Women's bodies are not the same as men's bodies; they should be studied differently and not lumped together. 

“The biggest thing is conversations about it,” Morgan said. “Brands having the awareness to do that and in the studies that are being looked at, in regard to them being female-specific, it is incredibly important.”

With two children of her own, Morgan is also a fierce, vocal advocate for working mothers. 

“Parental leave is a huge thing, and as we look at support for parents in the game, the things that mothers have to go through when growing a baby is different than men,” she said. “There's a lot of things that can be looked at differently, but we're in a really good place where people now acknowledge that. We're evolving when it comes to women's sports and looking at that from a different lens.”

While Morgan may be hanging up her boots, her business endeavors will now expand her reach into new areas of the sport. Accessibility is one opportunity for improvement, she noted. She also wants to see European-style academies develop at women's clubs in the United States so kids have a better steppingstone to enter the game.

With everything that she's already accomplished, the sky is the limit for Morgan, and the World Cup winner is set on accomplishing so much more. But after more than 15 years of rigorous training and constant competition, both internationally and on the club level, Morgan is also allowing herself to take a well-earned breath.

“Before retiring, I never had a weekend free – it just didn't exist as an athlete,” Morgan explained. “Now, I get to really take it slow and enjoy it. Go to my daughter's soccer game, go to the beach. Not plan anything, which is really different. Getting used to that is really nice.”

Get unrivaled matchday access

Alex Morgan scored the first of her incredible 123 goals with the U.S. Women's National Team almost exactly 15 years ago, on Oct. 6, 2010.

China was leading the U.S. Women's National Team late into the match. Following a China goal kick, the U.S. won the 50-50 ball around midfield. Defender Heather Mitts played the ball forward from her position at right back. While forward Abby Wambach chased the ball down, Morgan anticipated how the play was unfolding, as a proficient forward often does. She made an overlapping run toward goal so when Wambach flicked a header into Morgan's path, the budding star stayed composed to give herself the opportunity to score. She smashed the ball into the net.

The rest was history.

“It was one of the best moments that I can remember with the team because it was really the start of something great for me,” Morgan said. “It was a great first goal, and I'm excited to be back at that stadium and be honored in this way so many years later.”

Two Women's World Cups and an Olympic gold medal later, Morgan will have the chance to revisit that epic beginning when the U.S. Women's National Team returns to Pennsylvania for a friendly on Oct. 23. Prior to kickoff against Portugal at Subaru Park, Morgan will be honored for her illustrious career, and the first 2,000 fans through the gate will receive a limited-edition bobblehead.

Morgan and Wambach, the two players who combined for the iconic equalizer, would become two of the most prolific goal scorers in Women's National Team history. Wambach will be there at the stadium on Thursday to help celebrate her former forward line running mate. 

“To have the first assist ever be from Abby was very fitting because I had so many great years up top with her,” Morgan said. “She's one of my favorite people ever and one of the best players ever in the history of soccer.”

The goal was symbolic of the type of high-octane scoring prowess the two brought to the U.S. After Wambach retired in 2015 as the No. 1 goal scorer in Women's National Team history, Morgan elevated to become the team's primary target up top for the next several years. The pair scored a total of 307 goals combined during their international careers and individually finished top-5 in program history in scoring.

Last fall, Morgan announced her retirement from club and country, finishing her international career with 176 combined goals and assists, the fifth most all-time. The 36-year-old is one of several notable names from a star-studded class of U.S. Women's National Team icons who have retired in the last few years including Megan Rapinoe, Julie Ertz, Becky Sauerbrunn, Meghan Klingenberg, Tobin Heath and most recently Christen Press.

“To retire around the same time and really have this be the end of an era for myself and these players that played all through the 2010s and some of the 2020s, we had a really great run,” Morgan said.

That run includes titles at the 2015 and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, where Morgan recorded a total of seven goals across those two tournaments. Among her nine World Cup goals is the epic “tea sipping” game-winner against England on her birthday that led to her taking home the Silver Boot in 2019. 

“It's the end of an era that I'm really proud of,” she said. “I think we carried the team to where we needed to get it to, and now we feel really confident in where we've left it and with who we've left it with, and that's this next team that has already done incredibly great.”

For Morgan, retirement means a plethora of new opportunities that she's primed to tackle with the same fearless tenacity she displayed on the pitch. As one of the most iconic female athletes in the world, Morgan takes pride in using her position to raise awareness for female athletes and champion women's causes.

“There are a lot of things that I'm doing now on the business side that I'm really proud of,” she said. “Having the background in sports has given me so much to be able to feel like I can accomplish a lot now in the business world.”





Her venture fund, Trybe Ventures, which she runs with her husband Servando Carrasco, invests in early-stage companies focused on sports and health technology. She is also a co-founder of Togethxr, a media company that focuses on female athletes, highlighting women's sports and creating a community for fans of women's games. 

“It's not a rinse and repeat situation,” Morgan explained when talking about looking at sports through a female lens. “You look at the demographic of the fans, you look at the companies and brands that can resonate with female athletes and the fans of female athletes are much different than the men's side. Women's sports versus men's sports are inherently different. And that goes for every sport. It doesn't matter if it's soccer, basketball, golf, lacrosse, whatever it may be.”

Morgan's advocacy for highlighting the women's game reflects the narrative driven by fellow industry leaders such as U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes and Washington Spirit majority owner Michele Kang. These thought leaders in the sport support viewing soccer through a female lens. Women's bodies are not the same as men's bodies; they should be studied differently and not lumped together. 

“The biggest thing is conversations about it,” Morgan said. “Brands having the awareness to do that and in the studies that are being looked at, in regard to them being female-specific, it is incredibly important.”

With two children of her own, Morgan is also a fierce, vocal advocate for working mothers. 

“Parental leave is a huge thing, and as we look at support for parents in the game, the things that mothers have to go through when growing a baby is different than men,” she said. “There's a lot of things that can be looked at differently, but we're in a really good place where people now acknowledge that. We're evolving when it comes to women's sports and looking at that from a different lens.”

While Morgan may be hanging up her boots, her business endeavors will now expand her reach into new areas of the sport. Accessibility is one opportunity for improvement, she noted. She also wants to see European-style academies develop at women's clubs in the United States so kids have a better steppingstone to enter the game.

With everything that she's already accomplished, the sky is the limit for Morgan, and the World Cup winner is set on accomplishing so much more. But after more than 15 years of rigorous training and constant competition, both internationally and on the club level, Morgan is also allowing herself to take a well-earned breath.

“Before retiring, I never had a weekend free – it just didn't exist as an athlete,” Morgan explained. “Now, I get to really take it slow and enjoy it. Go to my daughter's soccer game, go to the beach. Not plan anything, which is really different. Getting used to that is really nice.”

FIFA has announced that more than one million tickets have already been sold for the FIFA World Cup 26™, marking a major milestone on the road to football's biggest-ever tournament.

Fans from 212 countries and territories have secured their seats following the completion of the Visa Presale Draw phase, which ran from mid-September. The surge in demand reflects the worldwide excitement surrounding the first 48-team World Cup, set to be co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico in 2026.

Unsurprisingly, residents of the three host nations — the United States, Canada, and Mexico — were the most active buyers, topping the list in that order. They were followed by fans from England, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Argentina, and France, rounding out the top ten markets for ticket sales.

With 28 national teams already qualified, the early appetite for tickets has surpassed expectations. FIFA described the figure as “an exciting step” in the buildup to what promises to be the most inclusive and wide-reaching World Cup in history.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino praised the enthusiasm shown by supporters across the world.

“What an exciting step on our journey toward 2026!” Infantino said. “As national teams compete for their place at the historic FIFA World Cup 26™, I am thrilled that so many football-loving fans also want to be part of this watershed event in North America.”

“The sale of more than one million tickets is an incredible response and a wonderful sign that the biggest, most inclusive FIFA World Cup in history is capturing the imagination of fans everywhere.”

For those who missed out during the presale, the Early Ticket Draw phase opens Monday, 27 October, offering another opportunity to secure seats. Fans will be able to apply for single-match tickets across all 104 fixtures, as well as venue- and team-specific ticket packages.

To protect supporters from unauthorised sales, FIFA's official resale platform is already available via FIFA.com/tickets, allowing eligible buyers to safely exchange tickets in compliance with local regulations. In Mexico, fans will be directed to a dedicated FIFA Ticket Exchange Platform.

Meanwhile, official hospitality packages — including premium seating, dining, and exclusive experiences — are available at FIFA.com/hospitality. FIFA reiterated that all fans should purchase tickets only through official FIFA channels, as tickets acquired elsewhere may not be valid.

With record-breaking global interest and ticket sales spanning over 200 nations, the 2026 World Cup is shaping up to be a defining chapter in football history.

The world's largest-ever World Cup will take place across 16 host cities in North America, welcoming millions of fans to experience a tournament designed to celebrate diversity, unity, and the universal love of the game.

“Football truly unites the world,” Infantino said. “And in 2026, the world will unite in North America.”

Lionel Messi and David Beckham faced accusations of receiving preferential treatment from FIFA after Inter Miami secured a place in the inaugural Club World Cup.

The sport's world governing body came under fire for awarding the host nation berth to Inter Miami – and consequently, Messi – despite the team not having clinched the Major League Soccer title. Remarks from FIFA president Gianni Infantino, apparently encouraging participating teams to recruit another footballing legend in Cristiano Ronaldo, only heightened suspicions among critics.

Miami were also granted the privilege of staging the tournament's curtain-raiser at their Hard Rock Stadium. Speaking on the pitch at an MLS fixture prior to the competition, Infantino declared: "Miami loves football, the world loves football and the world loves Miami. So I have three things to tell you.

"The first: many congratulations for winning the Supporters' Shield [the regular season league before the play-offs]. And on top, with the record of points in Major League Soccer.

"Congratulations, you are the best team of the season in America. Second, based on this outstanding performance this year, you deserve to be, and you will be, for the FIFA Club World Cup 2025.

"And third, as the host team of the FIFA Club World Cup 2025, you will have the honour of opening the tournament by hosting the opening game here in Miami at the Hard Rock Stadium in front of 65,000 people and tens of millions at home."

Many MLS fans were not impressed, believing that Miami was favoured due to having the world's best player and one of football's most recognisable faces, Beckham, as a co-owner. One disgruntled fan summed up the frustration of many, posting on X: "The criteria was always the same. Whichever team had Lionel Messi was gonna qualify."

Another concurred, posting: "Even if Miami had the worst season of their history, they would have still gotten the spot. The fact that there was no criteria to get the spot means that FIFA and the MLS intended to ask Miami to fill in the final spot, they just needed a good excuse."

Despite the controversy, Miami arguably proved their worth in the tournament, progressing from their group with one victory and two draws before being trounced 4-0 by Paris Saint-Germain in the round of 16.

Miami supporters can anticipate more mesmerising performances from Messi after the Argentine legend signed a new long-term contract with the club. It ensures the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner will be part of the team when they relocate to their new Freedom Park stadium in 2026.

Messi expressed his delight, saying: "It makes me really happy to stay here and to continue with this project that, besides being a dream, has become a beautiful reality - playing in this stadium, at Miami Freedom Park. Since I arrived in Miami, I've been very happy, so I'm truly glad to keep going here."

Lionel Messi and David Beckham were accused of benefiting from FIFA favouritism after Inter Miami were awarded a spot in the inaugural Club World Cup. Football's global governing body received considerable criticism for awarding the host nation spot to Inter Miami – and therefore Messi – without them having been crowned Major League Soccer champions.

Comments by FIFA President Gianni Infantino, seemingly urging participating clubs to sign another modern great in Cristiano Ronaldo, further alerted the cynics. Miami also had the honour of hosting the tournament's opening match at their Hard Rock Stadium.

During an on-pitch address at an MLS game ahead of the tournament, Infantino gushed: “Miami loves football, the world loves football and the world loves Miami. So I have three things to tell you.

“The first: many congratulations for winning the Supporters' Shield [the regular season league before the play-offs]. And on top, with the record of points in Major League Soccer.

“Congratulations, you are the best team of the season in America. Second, based on this outstanding performance this year, you deserve to be, and you will be, for the FIFA Club World Cup 2025.

“And third, as the host team of the FIFA Club World Cup 2025, you will have the honour of opening the tournament by hosting the opening game here in Miami at the Hard Rock Stadium in front of 65,000 people and tens of millions at home.”

That cut little ice with many MLS fans who believe Miami were favoured for having the world's best player and one of football's most famous faces as a co-owner in Beckham. One fan moaned: “The criteria was always the same. Whichever team had Lionel Messi was gonna qualify.”

Another said: “Even if Miami had the worst season of their history, they would have still gotten the spot. The fact that there was no criteria to get the spot means that FIFA and the MLS intended to ask Miami to fill in the final spot, they just needed a good excuse.”

In the end, Miami arguably justified their place in the tournament by advancing from their group with one win and two draws before being thumped by Paris Saint-Germain 4-0 in the round of 16.

Miami fans can look forward to more Messi magic after the Argentina great signed a new long-term deal with the club. It means the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner will now be with the club when they move to their new Freedom Park home in 2026.

Messi told his club's website: “It makes me really happy to stay here and to continue with this project that, besides being a dream, has become a beautiful reality — playing in this stadium, at Miami Freedom Park. Since I arrived in Miami, I've been very happy, so I'm truly glad to keep going here.”

Cristiano Ronaldo has revealed what he thinks is the "most important tool" behind his longevity after plying his trade across Europe and now in Saudi Arabia. The Portuguese icon is showing no signs of slowing down, even at 40, as he continues to chase down records with Al-Nassr and on the international stage. He has set himself the mind-boggling target of reaching 1,000 career goals before hanging up his boots, and he is just 51 short of reaching that total.

Two-time Women's World Cup champion. 

Olympic gold medalist. 

Third-place all-time in goalkeeper caps, wins, and shutouts in USWNT history. 

The 2024 U.S. Soccer Player of the Year. 

The first goalkeeper in USWNT history to make three or more saves in a penalty kick shootout. Oh, she did it twice. 

And, as of August, recipient of the NWSL Goal of the Week.

To compile the accomplished resume owned by Alyssa Naeher requires relentless training, adroit hands and a work-oriented mindset.

It also takes, according to Naeher, a village. 

“That's the fun part of sports in general is the relationships and the connections that you make,” Naeher said. “None of us can do this on our own, so it's the village that you have. It's the people that you have in your corner.”

A village will accompany Naeher for the pre-match celebration to honor her international career at the upcoming U.S. Women's National Team match on Sunday, Oct. 26 in East Hartford, Connecticut. To commemorate Naeher and her storied career with the USWNT, the first 2,000 fans through the gate at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field will receive a limited-edition collectible bobblehead.

Naeher, a Connecticut native, closed the chapter on international soccer on Dec. 3, 2024, approximately 10 years from her senior team debut. Though the goalkeeper still plays professionally for the Chicago Stars FC in the NWSL, the 37-year-old feels content about her decision to stow away her international goalie gloves.

“I was able to do everything that I had set out to do – and then some,” she said. “Honestly, it far exceeded my expectations, what I've been fortunate enough to be a part of. It just felt like the right time.”





A return to her home state to celebrate her decorated career with the U.S. Women's National Team will be a special moment. Connecticut is where Naeher first learned to play soccer and where she spent the formative years of childhood, middle school and high school. 

At the club level, she played at Yankee United (U-12 through U-15) and then South Central (for U-16 to U-19). In high school, she was a three-time All-State selection at Christian Heritage School. Those who will attend her pre-match celebration include her devoted family. Her parents, John and Donna, still reside in Connecticut as do many of her early influences from her youth soccer era. She credits her sisters, twin Amanda and younger sister Abby, with wrangling together some former club teammates excited to show up and support.

“'It's a small state, but we're a proud state,” Naeher said. “I'm looking forward to being able to go back… It's been fun to see people coming out and supporting. I realize that they've kept up with my career the whole time, tracking along and sharing it with their kids and their families.”

When asked about growing up in Connecticut, Naeher spoke fondly and with gratitude, saying she never had one bad experience. On the latest episode of the U.S. Soccer Podcast, Naeher dives into more of her upbringing as a coach's kid and shares memories with longtime friend and teammate Meghan Klingenberg. Part two of their conversation drops Wednesday, Oct. 29.

One person who played a significant role in Naeher's career was the goalkeeper coach she met when she was 14 years old, Paul DelloStritto. Naeher describes him as a “big brother” who is essentially part of the family. He was one of the first people to see her talent from a young age and always encouraged Naeher, known for her self-contained confidence and serious work ethic, to also have fun on the pitch. 

“He always taught me goalkeepers stick together,” she said. “No matter what happens in the game, no matter what scores are like, the first person you need to find after [the game] and go shake hands with is the other goalkeeper. That always stuck out with me. That competitiveness, but also the camaraderie of the position and the respect that you have towards your opponents.”

In a state home to the UConn Huskies, which boasts 18 national championships combined in men's and women's college basketball, basketball played a part in Naeher's life growing up. She played basketball all the way to her senior year of high school. She credited a lot of her success to being a multi-sport athlete, saying that it helped her stay well-rounded.

She realized that soccer would potentially provide a better avenue for her future, and she ended up playing soccer collegiately at Penn State where she was a two-time First-Team All-American.

Even though she left to play college soccer a couple states away, it was during those years when she created one of her most beloved Connecticut memories. During an away trip to play against UConn, she brought her Penn State teammates to her Connecticut home. Her parents invited everyone over, and Naeher remembers the joy she felt seeing her two worlds merge for one night, evidenced by watching her grandmother sit in a rocking chair by the fire and talk to her coach for hours. 

“That memory certainly comes to mind of just where soccer had taken me,” Naeher said. “It sums up what sports can do. It mixes and blends so many different worlds and people that you would never really get to know or interact with other than this one thing that bonds you.”

On Sunday, Naeher will have another chance to merge her differing worlds together – and as someone as accomplished as she is, it will be more than just introducing her hometown to her college teammates. It will encompass an entire career's worth of supporters – her family, friends, U.S. teammates, current Chicago teammates, youth coaches, youth teammates and all the fans who rooted for her along the way.

In essence, the entire Alyssa Naeher village.

“To be able to share that moment with them and put a ribbon on such a fun part of my life is something that I'm very grateful to get to be able to do,” she said.

Morocco U17 W team made history as they won 3-1 against Costa Rica and progressed to the knockout stage of the FIFA U17 Women's World Cup. (Credits: panafricafootball.com)

Morocco's U17 women's team made history on Friday as they won 3-1 against Costa Rica and progressed to the knockout stage of the FIFA U17 Women's World Cup for the first time.

The team finished a respectable third in Group A with 3 points, ahead of Costa Rica. Maysa Baha truly led from the front with 2 goals in the 4th and 39th minutes and Morocco's third came from a bit of a surprise with a 77th-minute own goal from the Costa Rican side.

Morocco's midfield and defense had a good day out as they worked together to create the openings for the team to score. Pressing high up the pitch put pressure on Costa Rica, and when the ball did get into the final third, Morocco's composure paid off in a big way, with the team ending up with a lead that couldn't be clawed back even after Costa Rica scored in the 95th minute.

The 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup in Morocco features 24 teams spread across 6 groups, with the top two teams from each group qualifying directly. Plus, the 4 best third-placed sides qualify for the knockout stages.

With 4 goals scored and 7 conceded, Morocco outscored Ecuador and the Netherlands in the process, earning them their ticket to the Round of 16

The tournament marks a milestone for Morocco who are this year hosting their first-ever FIFA tournament and also the first time that their U17 women's side has ever made it past the group stages of a World Cup.

Making it to the knockout stage brings huge kudos to Morocco's women's football development program. Qualifying for the U-17 World Cup for the first time in 2022, and now reaching the Round of 16 as hosts in 2025, shows just how far the country has come in a short time.

Now it's on to the next stage. Morocco will need to wait and see who their opponents are going to be, with the outcome very much still to be decided.

The Real Madrid dressing has responded angrily to Lamine Yamal's comments about the club as tensions ahead of El Clasico reach boiling point. Los Blancos are supposedly frustrated with Yamal, whose off the pitch antics are beginning to get under the skin of the players in the Spanish capital. Ahead of Sunday's game, Yamal has added fuel to the fire.

Steph McCaffrey has grand plans for Leyton Orient wjt.media

Peak brunch time in Hampstead, London, and former USWNT forward Steph McCaffrey stands amid the chaos of avocado toast and hungry, unseated Londoners with her life in both hands: a miniature red poodle named Mabelline cradled in one, an iPhone clutched in the other.

The 32-year-old is mid-voice note, plotting the final touches to Racketeer, Europe's soon-to-be largest pickleball and padel facility, her latest venture with Pickle Pop, the Los Angeles-based seven-figure pickleball business she co-owns with her wife, Erin Robertson, winner of Season 15 of the U.S. reality TV show Project Runway.

Simultaneously, she is fielding text messages about the next day's FA Cup play-off match for Leyton Orient Women, the seventh-tier team she both plays for and chairs following the “significant investment” by McCaffrey Football Group, a women's sports investment firm owned by McCaffrey's mum, Gina, and co-founded with her dad, James, a 1986 NBA draftee with the Phoenix Suns and minority investor in Orient.

It's because of her association with the east London club that we're meeting: to discuss how McCaffrey managed to convince 13 of Orient's current 16-player squad to drop down from the second, third and fourth tiers into England's amateur seventh tier. Known as the Greater London Women's Football League Premier Division, it is described by the FA as a “grassroots league that is the entry level for clubs and leagues to play 11-a-side football”. 

Upon spotting The Athletic, McCaffrey mouths an exaggerated “sorry”. A hungry couple nearby is told the wait time is next week but McCaffrey clearly has strings to pull. Suddenly, we are being pulled through a small corridor before emerging to find a small table being assembled for us. Staff emerge to say hello. They give Mabelline a pat. They request updates on Racketeer's opening (“November! So soon!”) and when the Women's Super League, England's top flight, will finally come calling (“Tier five first!”).

McCaffrey may be a VIP but she wears it lightly. “I just try to treat everyone with respect, talk to them like they're human,” she says. But it's that courtesy, and approachability, which many Orient players The Athletic spoke to for this piece cite when asked about why they decamped to the seventh tier.

Not everyone in the English women's game is enjoying the Orient story. In fact, many in the lower leagues consider Orient — with their 76 goals scored and one conceded in seven matches across all competitions — Public Enemy No 1.

One opposition club, according to Orient head coach and CEO Jason Stephens, wrote to the English Football Association at the start of the season half-joking that the seventh-tier season might as well be called off after Orient's summer recruitment.

A player on a rival team, who asked to remain anonymous to protect their position, quipped to The Athletic that they'd be better off accepting a walk over (a forfeit) as it would only consign them to a 3-0 defeat, rather than the double-digit drubbings Orient have been doling out. This season's results read more like a bingo card than football scores — 13-0, 14-0, 14-0, 13-0, 5-1, 10-0, 7-0 — and each one prompts grumbles on social media that Orient are effectively ruining the league. 

Many clubs in the seventh tier are independent of an affiliated men's side and have climbed their way through the pyramid system organically, only to discover their pathways blocked by teams with bigger bank accounts.

The £20-30,000 average annual operating costs in the seventh tier, including any expenses for coaching staff, are subsidised predominantly by pay-to-play player subscriptions and unswerving volunteer energy. Players moonlight as administrative assistants, chief executives and touchline tacticians when not busy picking clumps of grass out of their boots or working 9-5.

It is illegal to pay players salaries below the fourth tier of women's football in England, according to FA rules. That means the only recompense McCaffrey can offer is travel, medical and match expenses and help with gym memberships (what she begrudgingly deems “the bare minimum the FA let me provide”).

She adds that capital has been invested into infrastructure and staff, such as hiring Stephens, assistant manager Craig Davidson and operations manager Wayne Rothon.  

“I want to pay my players, but the FA isn't letting me. Who is that hurting?” McCaffrey asks. “It's hurting the players. It's not helpful for the game. What's helpful for the game is bringing more capital into it and getting more eyeballs on it and getting me to invest in all these things.”

The FA told The Athletic that players playing in tier five and below can receive payment but “need to be of a non-contract in accordance with HMRC requirements,” adding that similar rules exist in the men's game “with restrictions preventing the contracting of players at lower levels.”

There has also been some internal criticism, notably from the club fanzine Leyton Orientear, which published an article bemoaning how many of the core players which drove the club from tier nine to tier seven in 2022 and finished fourth in Greater London Women's Football League Premier Division last season have been jettisoned. 

McCaffrey, along with former Blackburn Rovers forward Ellie Thomas-Leek and former Lewes midfielder Lucy Porter, are the only surviving players from last season's squad. McCaffrey and Stephens maintain that every player was offered a trial ahead of the new campaign but were also informed of the increase in fitness standards and time commitment. According to Stephens, many players chose not to attend the trials.

“I'm a big proponent of the notion that to grow women's football at that level, it needs investment,” McCaffrey says. “If it needs investment, you have to run it like a professional football club and make hard decisions.”

McCaffrey believes some clubs are making easy decisions. In the past two seasons, Blackburn Rovers and Reading's women's team were demoted from the second tier (known as WSL2) to the fourth and fifth tiers respectively after failing to meet player welfare and financing standards. While WSL Football is set to announce new minimum standards for the top two divisions, the standard of resourcing, from expenses to coaching staff to training facilities, in the tiers below, which are run by the FA, remains a divergent tapestry. 

Tier three allows players to be on full-time salaries but not all clubs operate that way, with many players still balancing full-time jobs alongside semi-professional contracts.

“The narrative is going to be that players have dropped down for money,” says Stephens. “Really, we were turned by the fact someone wanted to invest in the long term, that there was an opportunity to leave a legacy and change the ecosystem.”

Thomas-Leek rose through Bristol Academy (now Bristol City) and danced the delicate ballet of full-time work and football for her 10-year career in England's top two flights.

“I've gone through the grit and sacrifice to play this game for nothing,” she says. “It feels surreal I'm playing in the seventh tier. But when you find owners like the McCaffreys who care about you as a player, who hire coaches who genuinely care about you individually, who don't make you stress about doing your ACL, if you'll be out of pocket because you need to pay for gas or food to go to a game… That's all we've wanted in the women's game. Just look after us.”

McCaffrey has a dog in the fight. Two, actually. There's the one that reaches back to the mid-2010s when McCaffrey was a regular starter with the Boston Breakers and Chicago Red Stars, only for her nascent career to slam to a stop in 2018, aged 25, following her diagnosis with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder where the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, causing it to produce excessive thyroid hormones, a condition known as hyperthyroidism.

“Realistically, I should have taken a year off to recover, then come back to playing,” she says. “But I knew I was coming back to $35,000 a year for being a starter in the NWSL. If I made the national team, I'd make a bonus, but it was still five times behind what it was now.

“What I've settled on is that you can't make everything better all at once. My North Star is bringing more resources and more money to female athletes. The resources these girls are getting across the board from tier four and below are so ****ed up. Our argument is that women's football, tiers eight and above, shouldn't be amateur anymore.”

And there's the second dog: the one that is unabashed in acknowledging there is money to make. McCaffrey, who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business after retirement, describes herself as “the most liberal capitalist you'll ever meet”. It's entrepreneurship that breathes life into McCaffrey.

“The first thing I googled when I started looking at taking over Orient was what other teams are in tiers five through seven who have legitimate backing?” says McCaffrey, who was introduced to Orient after her father became a minority investor in 2023. “And the answer was none. I was surprised by that. Because I see a clear path to these teams, a 20-time multiple in value over five years. That's exciting. There's a gold rush right now going to tiers one and two but true entrepreneurship is investing in things that people haven't really thought of yet.

“But if all we cared about is money, tier seven women's football isn't where we'd start. We'd be in AI, tech, real estate. But none of that has the amazing mission behind it.”

Whether or not steamrolling the seventh tier is in the essence of the mission remains a moot point among detractors. But those within Orient remain steadfast in their mission.

McCaffrey has a five-year plan to reach tier three, an ambitious timeline that she has, characteristically, hashed out to the minute. An under-16s team was launched last season. An under-18s team is being organised now, while funding from the FA to run an Emerging Talent Centre for young girls has been approved. 

An undefeated season for the first team could see Leyton Orient skip tier six altogether next season, earning promotion directly to tier five by application if adequate infrastructure is in place.  Making it the FA Cup first-round proper this Sunday against tier six's Farnham Town would only bolster their case — as well as provide a potential windfall of £6,000 ($8,029).

“The biggest respect we can give to everyone is we play our hardest and be as ruthless as we can,” Thomas-Leek says. “We want to get people looking at us. We want people to notice the scorelines we're producing. We want people to recognise what we're doing.”

In an ideal world, Leyton Orient will be competing in tier five soon, with McCaffrey nowhere near the starting XI. She's working 80 hours a week, finding time in the morning to do “100 jumping jacks in the sunshine” to manage her Graves' disease. “I'm getting better at padel and worse at soccer every day,” she jokes.

Will hanging up her boots be bittersweet? For the first time in our hour-long brunch, McCaffrey pauses. “I think I squeezed every ounce of talent that I had. Getting capped by the national team was the top. I had to work so hard to hit that ceiling because that was just my talent level. I'm at peace with the career I had. It's about their careers now.”

La Liga

Real Madrid against Barcelona is often described as the biggest game in club football, with everyone involved always super motivated and everyone watching usually completely enthralled.

This week, the dramatic collapse of plans for Barcelona to play a La Liga game against Villarreal in Miami — first reported by The Athletic — added extra spice to the compelling and captivating Clasico.

The controversial idea to play a domestic league fixture overseas, pushed by La Liga president Javier Tebas to increase Spanish football's revenues and exposure, attracted completely opposing reactions from the two sides of the Barca-Madrid divide.

Barcelona president Joan Laporta was firmly behind his team going to Miami. He shrugged off all concerns about tradition and competitive balance, even while many of his own squad did not want to go (as per sources close to the dressing room who, like all those cited here, preferred to speak anonymously to protect relationships).

Real Madrid chief Florentino Perez was dead against the idea, with his club arguing that breaking the traditional home and away format adulterated the competition, while also expressing concern over participating teams gaining a financial advantage.

Meanwhile, Madrid's official complaints to the Spanish government's Higher Sports Council, alleging that La Liga did not have the competency to organise the Miami game within official regulations, sought to raise the possibility of Tebas being suspended from his position. Several well-placed sources said this was the most important factor behind the cancellation.

The fallout from all this has defined an especially dramatic week in Spanish football.

At last weekend's general assembly of Barcelona club members, Laporta tried to thread a delicate path when defending the plan to play a domestic game over 4,500 miles away, knowing that Tebas is not exactly popular with his team's supporters.

“About Miami, we're not enthusiastic, but we have to be in everything,” Laporta said. “The (Spanish) Supercopa in Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) provides a return for the club, we get money, the same as Miami. Villarreal and Barca will be those who benefit.”

The Madrid view was clear in captain Dani Carvajal's Instagram post on Tuesday.

“Hello Senor Javier Tebas, if you do not follow the rules, you adulterate the competition,” the Spain international wrote. “You can't ignore that rules are being broken. Your competition will be tarnished if the match goes ahead.”

Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois also spoke out against the Miami plan on the same day, at a press conference ahead of his team's Champions League game against Juventus the following evening.

“In the NFL, all the team owners voted for (overseas games), here it is the opposite,” Courtois said. “It adulterates the competition, and does not comply with the labour agreement with the players. We all have to play home and away, and Villarreal away is a difficult game.”

These comments were put to the Barca president when he spoke with reporters after having lunch with Olympiacos owner Evangelos Marinakis before their clubs met in the Champions League on Tuesday evening.

“Real Madrid can say what they want, and will do what suits them,” Laporta replied with characteristic chutzpah. “I'm Barcelona president and we will go and play in Miami on December 20.”

Such vehemence looked awkward just a few hours later, when The Athletic broke the news that, on December 20, Barca would actually be visiting Villarreal's Estadio de la Ceramica after all.

In the Bernabeu offices, there was quiet satisfaction at Tebas' plan breaking down. “Most of the football community in Spain is happy about the La Liga 180,” one source at the club said.

Madrid's players took part in last weekend's protests against the Miami game, standing still when their game at Getafe kicked off last Sunday. The Barca team also participated — in defiance of their own club hierarchy — by pausing during the first 15 seconds of their match at home to Girona the previous day.

Captains of both sides had been together in backing the resistance of their players' union to the idea of La Liga games being played outside Spain — and such unanimity was important for the players to have a chance of taking on their bosses.

At both Barca and Villarreal, sources close to the players said that the extra travel and other commitments involved (without any benefits for those actually playing the game) was a factor behind their opposition. There was “relief” among the Barca squad when the Miami game was cancelled, one source said, and a sense of vindication among their Madrid counterparts.

As part of our coverage of the story, we surveyed readers for their reaction. This is how the responses shaped up:



Real Madrid and Barcelona are globally known as bitter enemies, with Clasico meetings having greater significance and tension due to cultural and historical reasons.

But the relationship between the clubs had become more nuanced in recent years. While in some respects the emotional differences are as clear as ever, hard business logic meant they shared similar interests in many areas.

The Barca and Madrid hierarchies have battled together for common causes like the European Super League, which Perez has been pushing for decades, and which Laporta saw as a possible handy solution for Barca's financial difficulties.

Both clubs also share a commercial partner in U.S. investment firm Sixth Street, who in 2022 provided €360million (£314.8m; $418.7m at current rates) to part-fund the renovation of Madrid's Bernabeu stadium, as well as €517m in ‘lever' money for Barcelona in exchange for a share of future TV rights. Both deals were organised by Key Capital Partners, an important financial backer of the Super League project.

However, Laporta has now become closer to La Liga president Tebas, as Barca have looked for more flexibility in meeting the competition's strict financial sustainability rules. Perez, meanwhile, has remained firmly opposed to almost everything La Liga or its president proposes.

Laporta's commitment to the Super League project has also appeared to wane, with the Barcelona chief reaching out to UEFA and the rest of the European football establishment, which Madrid continue to shun.

When Barca hosted Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League group stages in September, Laporta and his counterpart Nasser Al-Khelaifi happily posed together for the cameras before lunch at the Catalan capital's swish Via Veneto restaurant. Al-Khelaifi and Perez's relationship was seriously damaged by Real Madrid's long pursuit of Mbappe, which finally ended with the player leaving PSG to join Madrid in summer 2024.

In early October, Laporta was the star invitee at an event held in Rome by the newly rebranded European Football Clubs association. Its president Al-Khelaifi opened his speech by calling the Barca chief a “special guest”, adding: “Friends can disagree but they always come back together for the greater job.”

Back in Barcelona, Laporta said, “We want peace and for the Super League clubs to return to UEFA,” and suggested he could be a peacemaker. Talks have been held between UEFA and A22, the company promoting the Super League, but sources told The Athletic that Laporta's public comments have surprised those still planning a proposed new competition.

It has also been noted in Madrid that Laporta has proudly talked about how Barca last summer were able to negotiate a reduction in a fine for breaking UEFA's financial fair play rules from €60million to €15m.

“The two clubs still have their common interests, but as Barca become more financially stable, they can voice their own opinion more, and not have to follow Madrid's line,” a source familiar with both club hierarchies said.

The Barca and Madrid reactions to the Miami game being cancelled was certainly divergent, and there will be lingering tension in the Bernabeu's VIP areas on Sunday.

A pre-match meal between directors of both clubs has been part of Clasico tradition through past decades. In recent years, for one reason or another, these lunches have become much less common.

Real Madrid told The Athletic that no official meal will take place on Sunday, pointing to the 4.15pm local kick-off time and saying both presidents would instead meet at the stadium from 3pm.

Once more, the interests and egos of the men who sit at the very top of Spanish football are clashing, in a Clasico week in which the eyes of the footballing world are upon them.

U.S. international Cameron Carter-Vickers will be sidelined for at least several months after the Celtic center back sustained an Achilles injury, manager Brendan Rodgers said Friday.

Rodgers estimated Carter-Vickers would miss three to five months, which could limit the defender's chances of making the U.S. team for next summer's World Cup.

The 27-year-old Carter-Vickers felt pain during Celtic's 2-1 victory over Sturm Graz in the Europa League on Thursday night.

Rodgers had made two first-half substitutions for injuries and made another change in the 78th minute — exhausting his three opportunities for subs.

"We wanted to take off Cameron but we could only make one substitution in the second half. Ideally we would have taken him off," Rodgers said after the match.

Rodgers told Sky Sports on Friday that it's an Achilles injury.

Auston Trusty, also a U.S. international, could be called on to replace Carter-Vickers, who played for the U.S. at the 2022 World Cup.

Stan Wawrinka made an emotional post on his social media channels Friday, bringing fans into his mindset pushing forward aged 40 on the ATP Tour.

“PASSION - A strong liking, desire, or devotion to an activity. When I started playing tennis at 8 years old, it was just a game. Then it became my passion. My dream was to one day became a professional tennis player,” Wawrinka wrote. “I know that as an athlete, people like to think they know when it's time for your to stop. People believe that when you get older, when you don't play at the same level, don't have the same ranking or same result, you should stop.”

The former No. 3 player in the PIF ATP Rankings wrote that as much as he likes to compete and to win, it is not always about that. It is moreso about testing himself.

“Passion is not always about the results - it's about pushing your limits,” Wawrinka, World No. 158 this week, said. “I'm ok not to win a Grand Slam anymore. I'm ok with not being Top 10 anymore. But I love the process of always pushing my own limits.”

Wawrinka, who reached the second round at his home ATP 500 event in Basel, has enjoyed an illustrious career so far. The Swiss star has won three major championships, 16 tour-level titles and 581 tour-level matches. 

To him, age is not most important. It is his passion. 

“I know the end of my career will come one day, but until then, I will always give my best fight, Wawrinka wrote. “To all the fans around the world who support me, to the fans in Basel this week - THANK YOU. 

“It means the world to me. That's why I keep pushing myself.”

Another tournament, another final for Jannik Sinner.

The No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings swept past Alex de Minaur 6-3, 6-4 Saturday to reach the championship match at the Erste Bank Open in Vienna. By making his eighth final of the year, the Italian became the first man to reach that many finals in back-to-back seasons since Novak Djokovic in 2015-16.

"[I] came here quite late to the tournament, tried to take every day in the best possible way and I'm happy to be here in the final," Sinner said in his post-match interview. "It was not easy to [reach] the final here, so I'm very happy."

Sinner entered the semi-finals having not faced a break point in his first three matches at the ATP 500. Although the Italian lost serve twice against the Australian, he never panicked and set a clash for the trophy against second seed Alexander Zverev or fourth seed Lorenzo Musetti.

It was always going to be a tough test for De Minaur, who walked on court with an 0-11 Lexus ATP Head2Head record against Sinner. When the top seed broke in his first return game of the match, it was clear De Minaur had a big mountain to climb.

"[I was] trying to play some good tennis, trying to serve very well. The first set was very physical, so I'm happy that I won in two sets today," Sinner said. "He changed a couple of things, which I was ready for today.

"I don't want to say [what]. He knows. He knows for sure. He knows what to do, how to put [me] under pressure and the moment when you don't serve very well, you have to play every ball and every point. He can get very physical, he changed up with the slice a bit with also the slice down the line today and opening the court. Many small things he has changed."



The third seed produced some stunning shotmaking and used his blazing speed to try to fend off Sinner and his unrelenting power baseline game. But the Australian struggled to do enough damage with his serve, winning only 52 per cent of his first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

"Generally I'm happy how I handled [the match]. I was a break up in the second, broke him back, tried to stay there mentally," Sinner said. "Very happy about today's performance and always happy again to be in the final."

Without facing that pressure, Sinner was able to swing freely to work his way into another final. After winning titles at the Australian Open, Wimbledon and Beijing this season, he will try to add another trophy to his collection Sunday.

Sinner has made the final in eight of the 10 tournaments he has played in 2025, with the only exceptions being  Halle and Shanghai. The 24-year-old is also trying to keep alive his hopes of earning ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours, with Carlos Alcaraz in firm control of that battle.

Sinner has not lost a set this year in Vienna and now owns a 16-4 record at the tournament. He lifted the trophy in his most recent appearance, in 2023.

You can't wipe the smile off Grigor Dimitrov's face these days.

After three long months on the sidelines due to a pectoral injury, the 34-year-old Bulgarian is finally back in action at the Rolex Paris Masters this week — and you can feel his relief radiating throughout La Défense Arena.

“There are a lot of good and mixed feelings in the most positive way, but it's nice to be back with the boys and starting to challenge each other again,”  Dimitrov told ATPTour.com. “It's been a good week for me so far, trying to get as many hours as possible on the court because this is what I've craved. At the same time, I'm also trying to keep things at the most basic stuff.

“Of course, my goal is coming back to full force next year, but it's a great challenge for me right now just to see how the body will respond.”

He's BAAAACK !!!#RolexParisMasters | #Dimitrov pic.twitter.com/elSuGLjKpK

Dimitrov's last appearance was at Wimbledon, where he produced some of his most inspired tennis to forge a two-sets-to-love lead against then-World No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the fourth round. He seemed destined for the quarter-finals, but it was heartbreak all over again, with the Bulgarian suffering his fifth consecutive exit at a major through retirement.

The sight of his tears said more than any press conference could. But as he returns to the bright lights in Paris, where he reached the final in 2023, Dimitrov is back to his joyous self.

The former No. 3 player in the PIF ATP Rankings practised with good friend Andrey Rublev on Friday night and then returned less than 12 hours later to train with Francisco Cerundolo.

“I've always loved these last tournaments of the year,” said Dimitrov, the 2017 Nitto ATP Finals champion. “Overall, I'm not trying to overthink anything right now, just trying to be as kind as possible to me, to my body, and to test myself to really see what else I need to be working on, especially coming into the next season.”



Whether it be physical or otherwise, Dimitrov is hoping for a week free of pain. But the emotions will run high regardless. He will take to the doubles court alongside five-time major winner Nicolas Mahut, who is playing the final tournament of his career.

For both men, it promises to be a poignant chapter. One making an anticipated return to ATP Tour action, the other taking his final bow.

“We always wanted to do a few double sessions together throughout the last years, but I was honestly never really able to commit,” Dimitrov said of Mahut. “It was the right time. It was the last tournament for him and it made sense. I have a very sentimental relationship with him.

“For so many years, we played against each other. We competed more than once on such a big occasion. So it's safe to say that it's a good ending for him.”

In his singles bid, Dimitrov faces a stern opening test against big-serving Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. The Bulgarian, however, boasts a 24-12 tournament record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, which includes that spirited 2023 run.

2025 Mexico City GP: Rookies on track in FP1

Tech Talk: How the teams are keeping cool in Mexico City

F2 racer Arvid Lindblad was amongst the rookies in action during Free Practice 1 at the Mexico City Grand Prix, with the teenager claiming P6 on the timesheets for Red Bull.

Arvid Lindblad has admitted to feeling “quite nervous” ahead of his Free Practice 1 outing at the Mexico City Grand Prix, with the British racer mindful of the championship situation as he prepared to take the wheel of title hopeful Max Verstappen's Red Bull for a session that the rookie assessed as “really good”.

Lindblad was one of nine rookie drivers to participate in the opening hour of practice at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, marking his second FP1 appearance following his debut run at Silverstone back in July.

While he ended that previous session in P14 on the timesheets, the 18-year-old fared even better this time around and claimed P6, marking the highest finish amongst the rookies.

Reflecting back on this result and his FP1 as a whole, Lindblad said: “Yeah, it was good. Going into the session I was quite nervous, obviously also because of the situation we're in at the moment with the championship and stuff, so it was even more important not to make any mistakes or do any damage.

“I focused on just trying to keep it clean and [to] give good feedback, also to be towards the front end of the timesheets, and it was really good.”

It was a session not entirely without incident for Lindblad, who was issued with a warning later on after being found to have impeded McLaren's Pato O'Ward – another rookie in action – into Turn 9.

When asked about the challenge of managing these situations in FP1, Lindblad conceded: “It was really difficult. It was super messy. I think we were quite often out of sequence and then there's guys doing long runs, and it's really not easy on a pretty short track.

“It wasn't easy and especially as a rookie there's a lot of things to deal with, so I could do it better. I think I've got a bit of work to do on that side.”

Overall, however, Lindblad reflected positively on his session and also felt that Red Bull were satisfied with the job he had done.

“I think they were quite happy,” the F2 driver explained. “I think the pace was decent, it's back in one piece. I think they thought my feedback was solid as well.

“I think from my side there's not really much more I could do, just trying to point them in a good direction. We'll see now what Max says, but it seemed like it wasn't too bad, so I think they were overall quite happy.”

2025 Mexico City GP: Rookies on track in FP1

Tech Talk: How the teams are keeping cool in Mexico City

Lawrence Barretto delves into the data after the first day of practice ahead of the Mexico City Grand Prix.

Max Verstappen kept his foot on the gas to stay in full chase mode in Mexico as he set an impressive pace in his Red Bull in Mexico – but a hot, dirty track created low-grip conditions and made it very difficult to nail down a true pecking order after two hours of practice on Friday. Here's what we know so far...

Reigning World Champion Verstappen was one of nine race drivers to miss FP1 as teams took the opportunity to run a young driver, but the Dutchman needed very little time to get comfortable on the soft tyre on lower fuel in second practice to set the quickest time.

Red Bull brought another upgrade to Mexico, which included a tweak to the new floor they introduced at Monza, and ran a set-up that gave a gain in the corners (around 0.2s in the slow stuff, about 0.1s in the medium-speed turns) and a higher straight-line aero efficiency than McLaren.

Tech Talk: How the teams are keeping cool in Mexico City

Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton were left searching for improved balance at Ferrari despite both featuring in the top five on Friday at the Mexico City Grand Prix.

Charles Leclerc believes Ferrari are "on the back foot" against Red Bull and McLaren, despite being the second fastest driver on Friday in Mexico.

Leclerc returned to the podium for the first time in six weekends last time out in Austin, and continued to show strong pace at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez, falling just 0.153s shy of Max Verstappen's benchmark.

“Friday was a positive one,” said the Ferrari driver initially, before adding: “We are still on the back foot compared to Red Bull, especially on low fuel, and McLaren, especially on high fuel. No surprises there, we expected them to be the strongest teams coming here.

“But we've done pretty good laps. I felt quite good with the car, so we've just got to build from that tomorrow, and hopefully, we can gain a bit more performance.”

Speaking after the session, Verstappen expressed a “big concern” about his long-run pace. Having conceded that Red Bull may be out of reach over a single lap, Leclerc suggested the roles could be reversed across a longer distance.

“On the high fuel, we were maybe a little bit better compared to Red Bull, but McLaren was in a league of their own, by a lot,” he said. “I don't know exactly what was going on there. I hope they were on low fuel, but I don't know. They seemed to be very strong.

“For now, it doesn't seem realistic for us to be fighting with them in the race, but we are going to try and make changes in order to get closer to them.”

Lewis Hamilton was not far back from Leclerc, going fifth fastest in the second practice session after being replaced by Antonio Fuoco for FP1.

“I'm surprised how relatively close we are, given how not great it felt,” said the seven-time World Champion. “Every time you come here, because of the altitude, we're all running really high downforce, but it feels lower than Monza, so you're sliding around trying to find grip, but it's not there.

“The car was sliding around a lot. The balance is very open. I've got a lot of work to do tonight to try to figure out how to find a more streamlined balance.”

He added: “I definitely don't want to race what we had today. The long run balance wasn't disastrous, but we just need to get more from the tyres. I know there's more pace in the car.”

	Season 2 of Nobody Wants This featured several notable guest appearances, but one pair of actors in particular kept Adam Brody on his toes.


	The actor praised the “very funny and talented” Seth Rogen‘s performance as Rabbi Neil in Season 2, now available to stream on Netflix, as well as Kate Berlant‘s portrayal of his wife Rabbi Cami after the pair “went way off-script” for the show.


	“He just let it rip,” he told People of Rogen. “He and Kate Berlant, who I'm also a huge fan of, just went way off-script, and I just got to buckle up and hang on, and yeah, that was a dynamic.”

	Brody added, “Fortunately, that was the dynamic on the page too, in those scenes, Noah's more of a bystander.”

	











	Explaining that Rabbi Neil is a “rock and roll rabbi” to his character's “more buttoned-up one,” Brody's Noah interviews for a job with the couple's temple.


	“He's incredibly gregarious, and he's identifiably Jewish, which is important. Listen, he'd be great to have in any way, shape or form,” said Brody of Rogen, adding: “I think he's just a great fit.”


	Created by Erin Foster and inspired by her own marriage, Nobody Wants This stars Brody as Rabbi Noah, who makes waves in his Jewish family when he sparks a romance with sex and relationship podcaster Joanne (Kristen Bell), a Gentile.

EXCLUSIVE: ABC is putting work into finding the next big TV music competition series — and it has turned to a maestro of the genre to test a new format.


	Deadline hears that the Disney-owned network has set Simon Cowell as a judge on a proof-of-concept taping of Who's In The Band, a talent search for the next One Direction.


	He will judge alongside a panel that includes Joe Jonas, Spice Girl Mel B (a frequent Cowell collaborator on America's Got Talent and beyond), and songwriter Savan Kotecha. Rei Ami, who provided Zoey's singing voice in Netflix sensation KPop Demon Hunters, is on hosting duties.

Who's In The Band casting materials suggest it will contain a twist on the well-trodden genre, with singers performing the same song, at the same time, in different colored tubes.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The Who's In The Band test shoot will take place on October 30 at Eastbrook Studios in London. Sources say the presentation will not air on ABC, and there is no series greenlight. It is believed to be part of the network's plan to launch a new talent competition. ABC currently has veteran reality series American Idol — which made Cowell a household name in the US with its original incarnation on Fox — returning for a new season in early 2026.


Who's In The Band hails from Yes Yes Media, the London and LA-based production company founded by Richard Bacon, the former television presenter turned format guru. The recording has generated a smattering of press in the UK, but Deadline is the first to reveal ABC's involvement. The network declined to comment.

	











	Cowell has never featured as a judge on an ABC reality series, sitting out of the network's American Idol reboot. He did collaborate with ABC on American Inventor in 2006, but only as a producer. Cowell has remained a fixture on network TV as a judge and executive producer on NBC's America's Got Talent.


	Yes Yes launched in 2023 with backers including Courteney Cox and Sister, producer of Black Doves. Deadline reported in July that the company was piloting BBC show, The Easiest Quiz Show in the World, with Strictly Come Dancing winner Chris McCausland. 


	Mark Sidaway, former The X Factor showrunner and Yes Yes Media's head of entertainment, is involved in producing Who's In The Band.


	Music reality series focused on assembling a group have been around for years. Some notable examples include Popstars, Making the Band, and most recently, Netflix's Building the Band. Popular groups that have come out of signing competitions include One Direction and Fifth Harmony, both created on Cowell's The X-Factor.

SATURDAY AM: In an autumn where prestige awards potential isn't working, nor attempted tentpoles like Tron: Ares, Sony/Crunchyroll anime proves its merit again with its latest Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc which is now looking at a $15.5M-$17M opening after an $8.5M Friday, powered by an A CinemaScore from fans. 


	It will be interesting to see if the audience expands today as the fanbase for this movie are shouting its praises to the sky with an 82% definite recommend on Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak.  


	This is the ninth anime movie to open north of $10M, which is a big deal, because not every Japanese animation IP works on the big screen. What's great about this is that Sony has a new solid franchise in the wake of Demon Slayer. Even if this drops tonight in typical front-loaded anime fashion, it's another No. 1 win for Sony this year with non-traditional motion picture fare. As studios execs remain perplexed about what exactly works this fall, it's all anime, horror and Taylor Swift. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Imax and premium large format screens are revving 58% of Chainsaw‘s weekend with the West, South and South Central its best grossing regions. There's also a great swath of diverse demos all around in 32% Caucasian, 29% Latino and Hispanic, a very strong 20% Asian American and 13% Black. The AMC Empire in NYC is the top grossing theater with close to $45K. 


	A title acquired during the Brian Robbins regime at Paramount, Regretting You, is doing its job in attracting 83% female moviegoers with a $13M 2nd place opening after a $5.2M Friday and B CinemaScore. In PostTrak exits, women love the movie giving it a 77% definite recommend. Regretting You isn' the most popular of the Colleen Hoover novels in the It Ends With Us-sense of the word, and it didn't have the whole Blake Lively-Ryan Reynolds post-Deadpool & Wolverine marketing halo effect, so take that into account. Paramount snapped up the $30 million financed production post the Hoover It Ends With Us box office fiesta in summer 2024 (that moving making $351 million worldwide); Amazon MGM Studios took the author's novel Verity (out on Oct. 2 next year with Anne Hathaway and Dakota Johnson) while Universal snapped up Reminders of Him (March 13 with Maika Monroe).

	











	Diverse demos for Regretting You are 50% Caucasian, 36% Latino and Hispanic, 6% Asian American and 5% Black. Women over 25 led at 45%, with women under 25 at 39%. 


	Distrib sources are complaining that the World Series is cutting into male moviegoers this weekend. Then why the hell are you booking movies aimed at men during a juggernaut time when guys can't come? Good on Paramount for capitalizing on the opportunity to book a female-driven title on the marquee. 


	While we're on the subject of bad release dates for what should be older skewing male movies: 20th Century Studios' Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere which has now shifted its range to $9M-$10M (many are seeing $9M) after a B+ CinemaScore in fourth with Universal/Blumhouse's Black Phone 2 second weekend ahead in 3rd with $12M (-56%). If Springsteen hits the bottom of its tracking range at $9M, it won't be “Glory Days” for this net $55M Jeremy Allen White-Jeremy Strong starring production. On the upside, the movie has a 60% definite recommend on PostTrak, so we'll see if this improves. Why isn't this brand-name rock performer movie not being released over Christmas ala last year's Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown when a bigger audience is available? While older Springsteen fans showed up last night at 40% over 55 (the pic's biggest demo) and 59% over 45, it was clearly not in bulk judging from the grosses. Also, Springsteen was largely female leaning movie at 52%. Women over 25 bought tickets at 46% and men over 25 went at 42%. Overall, this is very Caucasian leaning movie at 85% with few diverse demos showing up. We'll get into this more as the weekend goes on, but off the bat, the release date isn't doing this making-of-the-Nebraska-album any favors.  


	Premium large format screens for the Scott Cooper directed title are repping a quarter of the weekend's gross with best areas of play in the East and Midwest. AMC Lincoln Square is the top grossing location with over $32K so far. 


	NEON's Shelby Oaks gets a C+ after a $1.1M Friday on its way to around $2.3M now. Best areas for the  Chris Stuckmann directed movie are the West, South Central, and East with AMC's Boston Common 19 the top grossing venue stateside with just over $7K. Fifty-three percent guys, 74% 18-34. This is a standard NEON niche genre play. 


	Overall ticket sales are clocking an estimated $75.4M, which is +8% from last weekend, but down 20% from a year ago when Venom: The Last Dance opened to $51M. Remember, New Line's Mortal Kombat 2 was suppose to open this weekend before it moved to early May next year; a brilliant release date change by Warner Bros, sidestepping the World Series. 


	Saturday numbers:


	1. Chainsaw Man (Sony) 3,003 theaters, Fri $8.5M, 3-day $15M-$17M/Wk 1


	2 Regretting You (Par) 3,393 theaters, Fri $5.2M 3-day $13M/Wk 1


	3. Black Phone 2 (Uni) 3,460 (+49) theaters, Fri $3.7M (-66%), 3-day $12M (-56%), Total $48M/Wk 2


	4. Springsteen…(20th) 3,460 theaters, Fri $3.5M 3-day $9M-$10M/Wk 1


	5. Tron: Ares (Dis) 2,940 (-1060) theaters, Fri $1.3M (-57%), 3-day $4.7M (-58%), Total $63.1M/Wk 3


	6. Good Fortune (LG) 2,990 theaters, Fri $920K (-62%) 3-day $3.1M (-49%), Total $11.8M/Wk 2


	7. Shelby Oaks (NEON) 1,823 theaters, Fri $1.1M, 3-day $2.3M/Wk 1


	8. One Battle After Another (WB) 1,473 (-1059) theaters, Fri $650K (-43%), 3-day $2M (-47%), Total $65.4M/Wk 5

	











	9. Roofman (Par) 2,347 (-1023) theaters, Fri $600K (-47%) 3-day $1.9M (-49%), Total $19.2M/Wk 3


	10. The Mastermind (Mubi) 186 (+181) theaters, Fri $350K (+753%), 3-day $1.2M (+1054%), Total $1.3M/Wk 2


FRIDAY PM: Sony/Crunchyroll's Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc is slicing its way to the top of the box office with a good $8M today for what's shaping up to be a $14 million-plus weekend.


	While at the high end of its $11M-$14M projections, and a clear No. 1, the caution here is that it's the first night of the World Series with the Los Angeles Dodgers taking on the Toronto Blue Jays. Los Angeles is the No. 1 market for anime movies.


	RelishMix reports that the social media reach on Chainsaw Man is massive at a half billion, 6x above anime genre norms across TikTok, Facebook, X, YouTube and Instagram combined with gigantic video views counts on YouTube of 351 million and counting. Note Chainsaw Man‘s reach on social is 2.5x more than Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle before its opening which stood at 200 million.


	Reports the social media stat org, “Convo runs positive for Chainsaw Man-The Movie: Reze Arc, with fans losing their minds over animation studio MAPPA's cinematic polish, the faithfulness to the manga's art style, and Kenshi Yonezu's soundtrack. Theatrical worthiness is a recurring theme, with audiences insisting this arc had to be a movie. The chatter even positions it above competing anime events, with praise like ‘compared to the recent Infinity Castle, Reze arc was kick ass—would watch in theaters again' and ‘I absolutely love how loyal they stayed to the art style, it feels like the manga came to life.' 


	The following music video alone is racking up close to 68 million views on YouTube. 


	Second is a three-way race between 20th Century Studios' Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere (3,460 theaters), Paramount's Colleen Hoover movie Regretting You (3,393 theaters) and the second weekend of Universal/Blumhouse's Black Phone 2 (3,460 theaters) each looking at $10.8M-$12M. For Black Phone 2, that hold-range is better than -60% with at least $47M by Sunday, which would be $400K less than Black Phone at the same point in time of its ten-day run. 


	Fifth is the third weekend of Disney's Tron: Ares at 2,940 theaters with $1.3M today and $4M+ for the weekend. 


	Neon's horror thriller from Chris Stuckmann, Shelby Oaks, is spotting $1.1M today for a $2.5M take at 1,823 sites. This is in the range of Neon's summer 2024 horror title, Cuckoo which opened to $3M.


FRIDAY AM: Sony/Crunchyroll's Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc revved up $3.4 million in previews Thursday in screenings that began at 4 p.m. at 2,500 locations.


	By the way, that preview number is close to the $3.8M posted by Demon Slayer: Mugen Train back in April 2021, on its way to a three-day total f $21.2M as movie theaters were reopening from Covid. That title, released by Funimation/Aniplex, had a Friday of $9.5M.


	The Tatsuya Yoshihara-directed Chainsaw Man based on the popular manga is expected to ring up $11M+ in a weekend that might now be too close to call with Universal/Blumhouse's Black Phone 2 with an expected $12M+ second frame.


Chainsaw Man is 100% fresh from 18 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and has a 99% audience score. 


	Meanwhile, 20th Century Studios' $55M Scott Cooper-directed Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere strummed $850,000. The movie is expected to bring in $9M-$11M. Note that preview take is under the $1.4M Christmas preview gross of Searchlight's Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, which went electric over the holidays with a $7.2M opening day, $11.6M 3-day and 5-day total of $23.2M. Springsteen is opening at 3,460 theatres including 250 Imax screens and 750 Premium Large Format screens. Critics aren't wowed by this rock performer biopic at 61% fresh, but fans last night enjoyed it better at 85%.

	











	Jeremy Allen White plays Bruce Springsteen and Jeremy Strong plays his manager Jon Landau in a semi-biopic about The Boss recording the personal 1982 album Nebraska which preceded his global phenomenon Born in the U.S.A.


	Paramount is not reporting grosses on Regretting You given its limited run in under 500 theaters last night, with one showtime for the A Night of No Regrets fan event that included a Q&A with cast and director Josh Boone with a special performance by Hannah Cohen. Nonetheless, sources say the movie did better than Springsteen last night. Regretting You was forecasted at $9M-$11M this weekend in what is the second Colleen Hoover novel feature adaptation to hit the screen after the massive success of It Ends With Us. Critics don't like the schmaltziness of Regretting You at 34% on RT, but there was also never beginning with them on It Ends With Us which they threw Kleenex boxes at with 54%.


	Neon this frame has the psychological thriller Shelby Oaks, which did $515K from combined mystery screenings and last night's previews. The movie is expected to file in the low single digits.


Black Phone 2 posted $1.6M yesterday, off 11% from Wednesday, for a first week of $36M, up 3% from its 2022 first chapter.


	The rest of the top 5:


	1.) Black Phone 2 (Uni) 3,411 theaters, Thu $1.6M (-11% from Wed), Wk $36M/Wk 1 


	2.) Tron: Ares (Dis) 4,000 theaters, Thu $698K (-22%), Wk $15M (-65%), Total $58.4M/Wk 2


	3.) Good Fortune (LG) 2,990 theaters Thu $487K (-15%), Wk $8.7M/Wk 1


	4.) One Battle After Another (WB) 2,532 theaters, Thu $350K (-18%) Wk $5.5M (-45%), Total $63.4M/Wk 4

Why are all of these Japanese anime movies being released in the U.S. instead of in theaters ONLY in Japan, and only on streaming in the U.S.?

Should've at least waited until after the World Series for the Boss movie. How could they not see that his core audience has a lot of crossover with MLB's.

Hollywood lost at sea never to return again! ✌️

They sell more excuses than tickets.

Love to see this wonderful numbers. I have to talk to many people off a ledge when it comes to the box office but Hollywood is crushing it and is having an amazing year. So thankful.

Are you being serious? These numbers SUCK

These cartoons are really popular – wonder why most are sent to streaming instead of movies. People enjoying spending for them.

Because the ones released theatrically on such a wide basis are getting an upgraded level of animation (which is costly and slow). That is not the case for most of them; they are primarily consumed in Japan on television or around the world on streaming. Most of them have to reach critical mass to justify the theatrical treatment.

Not all anime films have mainstream appeal.

Their most creative collaboration, 2023's “The Last Repair Shop,” led director Ben Proudfoot and Kris Bowers to a Best Documentary Short Oscar win the next year. But it wasn't a given Bowers would compose the score for Proudfoot's feature debut, “The Eyes of Ghana.”

“Because it's a lot of work, right? It's like, ‘OK, it's six months of my life,'” Proudfoot told IndieWire during an interview at the 2025 Middleburg Film Festival. “When you decide, ‘OK, this project feels like it's part of my body of work,' it's a big decision, one that I take seriously.”

 










Though he has mostly worked as a film and TV composer on projects like “Green Book,” “Bridgerton,” and Original Score nominee “The Wild Robot,” Bowers' work with Proudfoot also includes the Oscar-nominated short “A Concerto Is a Conversation” as co-director. But joining him on this newer, longer, global venture has the composer excited “just be a part of what was already being created.”

“The Eyes of Ghana” is seen through the eyes of Chris Hesse, a Ghanaian filmmaker who documented the rise of President Kwame Nkrumah, known as the man who liberated the African continent. Furthermore, when colonizers attempted to burn all evidence of Nkrumah's time as a revolutionary leader, Hesse snuck his reels out of Ghana, and into a London vault, where the footage has spent decades inside, waiting to be digitized.

As someone who grew up in Nova Scotia, Proudfoot was completely unaware of most of this history. While in Ghana during the COVID-19 pandemic, shooting a film for UNICEF, “the whole van of us, the crew, we're driving down this main thoroughfare, and I saw this unusually shaped building and a statue of a man pointing. And I said, ‘What's that?' They said, ‘Oh, that's the mausoleum for Kwame Nkrumah.' And I said, ‘Who's Kwame Nkrumah?' Every Ghanaian in the vehicle turned around and looked at me like ‘What the hell?,” said the director. “We know Gandhi, we know Martin Luther King Jr., we know all these figures from history who are responsible for leading a movement that changed the course of a continent or hundreds of millions of people. But Kwame Nkrumah, I opened the file folder of my mind, and there's nothing there.”

Naturally curious, Proudfoot inquired whether he could speak to anyone who knew the politician, and his crew excitedly pointed him toward Hesse, a now-nonagenarian who worked as Nkrumah's personal cinematographer, shooting everything on 16mm and 35mm. Though they were 60 years and an ocean apart, Proudfoot and Hesse became fast friends united in the idea of getting the word out there to maintain this treasure trove of footage. “That's my mission in life,” Hesse told the director.

 










Nkrumah was crucial in jumpstarting the Ghanaian film industry, building a studio to produce work that conveys an Africa that defies the expectations promoted by colonizers. “If I say, ‘Oh, here's a documentary set in Africa,' you immediately have certain expectations of what that might be, based on documentaries you've seen in the past or world hunger infomercials on the TV or whatever. Which is not a broad understanding of what's going on, which was Kwame Nkrumah's whole point in the first place,” said Proudfoot. 

Through the subject of his film, the director shows how an important part of Ghana's modern history is entwined with a love of cinema. “We're making a film not about Kwame Nkrumah, not about Ghana, we're making a film about Chris Hesse and his experience and how he views it. And Chris Hesse is an extraordinary film artist, a cinematographer,” said Proudfoot. “So if you're making a film about a filmmaker, you need to bring the best of everything to the table.” The director boasted how “huge swaths of the movie are shot in IMAX 70mm,” particularly in the film's emotional conclusion, which was shot on 5-perf, 65mm celluloid on an IMAX camera. “That literal camera that we used, that came to Ghana, came from the set of ‘Sinners.' Same camera.”

 










Like Proudfoot, Bowers had not heard of Nkrumah, nor had he been to Ghana. Bower said, “I've always just been really curious about any sort of scoring of an African project.” Upon formally accepting the offer to once again work with his friend Proudfoot, Bowers said, “I'm aware of the deep history and tradition with music, and so that was my first bit of excitement as a composer, trying to figure out how to incorporate some of that into the score.”

The gyil, the atenteben, and the talking drum were the three key instruments that helped him achieve a more African sound. “I would ask about the gyil, which is a mallet instrument, and was asking, ‘What key does that play in typically?' So if I write, I can write in that key. And the musician I was speaking with was like, ‘Well, actually that's usually tuned to whomever the singer is.' And so that made me inspired to tune themes to each of the characters' speaking voices and [spend] time transcribing the way they spoke, to see what key range did they speak in.” For instance, the charismatic Hesse was in the key of F Mixolydian. 

To play the atenteben, a bamboo flute, Bowers recruited Dela Botri based on impressive videos of the Ghanaian musician performing. “You could watch him playing jazz riffs and all this stuff. So we were like, ‘OK, we've got to get that guy,'” said the composer. Bowers was hesitant to use the talking drum after the instrument's prominence in Ludwig Göransson's Oscar-winning “Black Panther” score, but ultimately, “it's such a huge part of Ghanaian history that it felt like I can't not put that in there. And also, it felt weird that ‘Black Panther' for some reason would make it so that I can't use an instrument when I'm writing a score for an African film.”

 










Bowers did, however, come to a point where inspiration began getting in the way of execution. “My first pass of writing some of the cues, taking all this information, again, I spent a month studying this stuff, I tried writing a score from a Ghanaian perspective. And it was something that wasn't quite fitting with the film,” said the composer. “The more Ben and I talked about it, the more I realized it was my own fear of not representing the country well, and music well in that way… This movie is about the power of and the love for cinema, and so [Ben] really encouraged me and helped me embrace just taking everything I know about film music, and I've learned now about Ghanaian music, and just try to make this as great as possible.”

He concluded, “I'm not Ghanaian. It actually would be more disrespectful for me to try to pretend like I could write this Ghanaian score. But more so, just try to take as much information as I can and be influenced and informed by that and write music from my heart at that point.”

Producer Moses Bwayo (and co-director of recent Best Documentary Feature nominee “Bobi Wine: The People's President”) helped convince the prolific, Oscar-winning shorts director Proudfoot to make this his feature directorial debut. 

 










“My philosophy is that it is our duty as filmmakers not to waste anybody's time. And sometimes when you make a movie, the idea is that people want to escape. Certainly, I do. When I turn on a movie before I go to bed or on a Saturday afternoon or whatever, I want to go into a world for a few hours. I'm happy that it's long,” he said. “But oftentimes with documentaries … you want to understand, you want to learn something, you want to solve the mystery, you want to meet these people, you want to come out enlightened, informed, inspired. And so if that's the reason why you're watching the movie — which is different, there's a different kind of intention — you don't want to spend more time than you need to. A lot of documentaries, especially over the last 10 years, have been designed to suck up as much of your time as possible. That's why I've been so interested in short films, because it's the opposite.”

He added, “With this film, even though it's in the category of a feature-length documentary, it's a lot packed into 89 minutes. As my career has gone on, what I'm committed to less so is format, of short form or feature film, and more just elegance and a richness. It couldn't have been any shorter. And that the audience feels like, ‘Wow, I took in a lot, I went from knowing nothing about this to knowing a lot, caring a lot,' that interests me.”

 










Ultimately, “The Eyes of Ghana” stealthily circles back to the kind of format Proudfoot is known for, making reference to producer and film subject Anita Afonu's project “Perished Diamonds,” which covers the history of Ghanaian cinema in 40 minutes, plus all of Hesse's work. “Those reels that are in the archive, they're mainly short documentaries. So at the end, it might be a feature documentary, but it's about an archive of short documentaries, so I can't escape it,” said the director.

This resurfacing of Hesse's footage is “the opposite of what's happening in America and a lot of the world, which is history being erased, not being able to talk about a war on information. And this is an opening and a blooming of new history, which I think is very exciting,” said Proudfoot. “We're very proud to be a part of that and drawing attention to that, not just in Ghana, but really across all Africa. Chris traveled all across the continent telling stories in all kinds of countries, because Kwame Nkrumah would lend out his film unit to all these other liberation movements. So it's continent-wide, really.”

“The Eyes of Ghana” is the first independent feature produced by Barack and Michelle Obama's production company Higher Ground, and has yet to find a distributor, but Proudfoot's urgency lies more with encouraging the digitization of Hesse's archive than rushing into a deal to release the film in theaters. “It's just about remembering why we made this movie and continuing to pound the pavement and find people who get it, who understand it, and who believe this is an important story that must be told,” he said. “These kinds of stories, often African narratives, they just get left off. ‘It's not relevant, it's not important.' It is important.” 

 










Proudfoot added, “Part of what we're doing with the film is helping Chris in his mission to reframe this archive, not as a nice-to-have, but as an essential piece of history.”

To Proudfoot, “The highest and best use of documentary is to get people to pay attention, and let's face it, do something about it. Not just say, ‘That's a nice documentary.' [claps] ‘Here's an award,' or ‘We think you're great.' So what? This archive, if we don't pay attention, it's going to be gone in 15 years,” he said. “That's what happens to cinema, that's what happens to celluloid. So that's our hope, whether it's the distributor or whether it's finding somebody who really cares about this, who has a connection to it, it must make a difference in the world. Entertainment, for me, it's not enough. I think it must help solve that problem.”

“The Eyes of Ghana” world-premiered at TIFF before playing Middleburg. It is currently seeking a U.S. distributor.

	The NAB Show is known in large part as a bonanza for tech geeks and engineers, and its New York edition last week was no exception.


	But the broadcast industry lobbying group made a statement by foregrounding discussion of a central challenge for its members: regaining public trust in the era of AI and misinformation. Opinions flew among broadcast and digital execs, a union chief and seasoned journalists, and top station execs weighed First Amendment concerns in the wake of ABC's suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.


	NAB CEO Curtis LeGeyt moderated a marquee panel titled “The Future of News: AI, New Revenues and Risks and the Policy Response.” About 70% of newsrooms, he noted, have already implemented AI, raising “serious concerns about copyright, consent, compensation and the credibility of the information being delivered.”

	Prior to the panel, campaign strategy firm OnMessage unveiled new survey data from 1,000 likely voters nationwide, an equal mix of Republicans and Democrats, who were asked in mid-September about the rise of AI. The results showed strikingly bipartisan consensus around the technology, with 82% of respondents saying they are “concerned” or “very concerned” about the development.


	A few other pieces of data from the poll spoke more directly to the discussions playing out on NAB stages, OnMessage VP Tommy Binion said. One was the response to the prompt, “How concerned are you about AI stealing or reproducing journalism and local news stories that are published online?” The “concerned' or “very concerned” responses added up to 76% of respondents, a level that Binion called “sky-high.” He called the number “great news” in terms of politicians or regulators feeling they have strong popular support to rein in AI companies. He also flagged the degree to which respondents mistrust AI news (68%) and would support Congressional legislation restricting it (77%).

	











	Nick Radziul, EVP of major local station owner Hearst Television, said he was surprised by the poll's findings about the lack of trust in AI as a source of information. The extent of such sentiment, he said, “highlights the challenge of how to implement AI” in his company's stations. For all of the perils of injecting it into the newsgathering process, AI tools have also come to be seen as useful and less-fraught ways to create efficiencies in editing, advertising and other areas.


	Jon Schleuss, President of NewsGuild-CWA, said the union's members build trust with readers and viewers “brick by brick,” but the adoption of AI broadly will put that standing at risk given the “garbage” proliferating online. “There's a real tension here,” LeGeyt said. The poll data “surpassed my wildest expectations,” he added. “And we're in the trust business.”


	The issue is zeroing in on specific outcomes and not inviting in the “flotsam and jetsam” of the internet, said Brad Silver, VP and Global Head of Public Policy, AI, and IP, for Condé Nast parent Advance. AI search results, namely via Google Gemini, should be delivered with “the right compensation” to news organizations being scraped for it by the large-language models. (Deadline parent Penske Media is the plaintiff in a pending lawsuit against Google for its current search practices.)


	Licensing and dealmaking is “possible,” but “we need incentives” for AI companies to participate in a licensing scheme, Silver added.


	“Leverage is in favor of the Big Tech companies,” Radziul said. “Policymakers need to step in,” LeGeyt replied. Radziul agreed, saying the scale of the tech sector has made them “anti-competitive” gatekeepers for news content. “If Congress doesn't step in, I'm not sure there is another solution that comes in time to, frankly, save local news producers.”


	Another NAB panel zoomed out to look at the trust factor more broadly – and unlike with AI, there is a yawning partisan gap.


	Patrick Healy, an assistant managing editor at the New York Times who moderated the session, noted recent examples of pushback on the media by the Trump Administration. One was White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt recently firing back, “Your mom” when a reporter asked how Budapest was picked as the site of a summit meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Another was Trump's response in Texas that “only a truly evil person” would ask him, as one reporter did, about the U.S. response to flooding in the state.


	Healy asked panelists Brian Stelter of CNN, Sara Fischer of Axios and Oliver Darcy of Status how they think news organizations should build up “resilience” in the face of such attacks. 


	There are “many, many bad-faith actors trying to tear things down,” Stelter said. “Most of trust is gained or lost in a way that is outside of our individual control. But we each individually have a lit bit of power and responsibility.”


	Darcy, who was Stelter's colleague at CNN before co-founding the independent news outlet Status, lamented the recent tendencies of many large news organizations. They are “largely led by corporations and billionaires trying to cater coverage to people who have been trained in a lot of ways to hate them,” meaning conservative viewers and readers. “You're seeing this at Paramount with CBS News, you're seeing this at the Los Angeles Times, perhaps at the Washington Post on the editorial side …. Owners are thinking, ‘How do we get the Republicans to like us?' And the fact is, the Republicans, or a lot of them, are never going to like you guys.”

	











	When networks and digital publishers are “trying to win over that audience by softening coverage of Donald Trump, or softening coverage of Charlie Kirk because you are afraid of offending them, what actually happens is you lose trust among people who rely on the New York Times” or the rest, Darcy said. CNN, he added, has lost ratings over the past year, in his opinion for the same reason.


	Healy noted that the Times gets plenty of criticism from the left. He cited a headline several weeks ago describing slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk as “charismatic.” Many readers felt “racist” would have been a more apt word, he said.


	White House reporters for the Times during Trump's second term, Healy observed, “have been pretty professional. … When we ask questions and seek information, we get a responses.” He contrasted the current state of play, despite all of the chaos surrounding it, with relations between Times staffers and the Biden Administration.


	Dealing with the previous White House was “much more difficult,” Healy said, marveling at “the amount of pressure that the Times and others came under for our reporting about the fact that Joe Biden was asking the American people to re-elect him and make him the oldest president in the history of this country, and the reporting we did about his age and his cognitive abilities came in for a hell of fire. There was enormous pressure from Biden and the Democratic Party.”


	The intensity of the squeeze on journalists has only increased, Healy added, and the stakes are likewise continuing to rise. “We all know this: When you start caving and pre-emptively bending the knee out of fear, it just hardens the determination of authority to chip away further at your independence,” he said.

Rush's Geddy Lee talked about getting prepared for the band's upcoming reunion tour — and his beloved Toronto Blue Jays making the World Series — in a new interview with CBC News.


	“Well, I'm a bit overwhelmed right now, to be honest. Alex [Lifeson] and I took a long time trying to figure out if we could actually do this ever again,” Lee said of the reaction to the 50 Something tour. 


	“When we did finally decide, of course people were optimistic, but we really didn't expect the kind of overwhelming response our announcement has brought forth out of our fanbase. It's just been a remarkable few weeks around our homes, but very exciting — very exciting.”


	Lee has only sporadically performed live since the death of Rush drummer Neil Peart in 2020, and as the reunion tour continues to expand cities and add dates due to demand, the bassist told CBC News he's “getting ready” for the rigors of touring.


	“I've been playing diligently for about a year and a half now. And it wasn't that we had planned this tour that long ago. I had just decided that after writing all these books and having the experience of doing television shows that I needed to make some music again,” Lee said. 

	











	“So I've been working out pretty regularly trying to get my fingers, these little digits, back in shape. And, of course, since we did make the decision to tour, I'm hitting the gym pretty hard, and so is Alex. But we're gonna be ready. We're working at it. We're gonna put a lot of hours into that.”

	











	Lee added that Rush won't be staging three-hour concerts like “in our younger years, but we're certainly gonna play over two hours. And we'll get a lot of songs in, for sure.”


	For the reunion tour, Rush recruited drummer Anika Nilles, who came highly recommended by Lee's bass tech after the two worked together on Jeff Beck's final tour, where Nilles served as that guitarist's drummer.


	“It was a very difficult decision to go back on the road, and [Peart's death] was the main stumbling block, obviously. How do we replace the irreplaceable, so to speak?,” Lee said.

	“And we have been fortunate to have been introduced to the name Anika Nilles through one of my road crew — my bass tech Skully, who was on tour with Jeff Beck — and she was the drummer for Jeff Beck on his last tour. And he came home from that tour raving about her. And so when we made the decision to see what it's like to play with another drummer, we contacted her, and she's just a fantastic person. And she came to Canada and we very surreptitiously snuck into a studio and worked out for about a week. And by the end of it, we were convinced that this would be a go for us. Yeah, she's just a tremendous player.”

	Lee continued, “When she first came over here [to Canada], we started playing some of the songs, trying to translate Rush music to someone who didn't really grow up as a Rush fan; she was not a Rush fan. She knew, of course, of Neil's playing — every drummer knows who Neil is, or Neil was, I should say — so it was a bit of a daunting task. And we had to go through each song and explain the nuances of the song and the idiosyncratic nature of how our songs are put together. So at times she was a bit overwhelmed, but she's an incredibly hard worker. She's got great technical facility and she's just got a really positive attitude, and that's really good for Alex and I to be around right now.”


	It hasn't been all tour prep for Lee as the bassist was photographed sitting behind home plate and enjoying a pivotal moment the Blue Jays' run to the World Series earlier this week. “I've never heard a crowd that loud, that electric, and that on cue,” Lee said of when the Blue Jays' George Springer hit a series-deciding home run to advance Toronto to the World Series.

	Jeremy Allen White's Bruce Springsteen spends the bulk of his time in Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere brooding over the songs that would become Nebraska in a Colts Neck, New Jersey, rental house. But when he — and the audience — need a joy break, Springsteen fires up his Trans Am, points it southeast to Asbury Park, and hops onstage at his safe space, the Stone Pony, to jam with the house band.


	Who just happen to look like an amalgamation of the present-day rock acts Greta Van Fleet and Rival Sons.


	That's not an accident. Dave Cobb, the Grammy-winning producer known for his work with Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell, and Brandi Carlile, serves as soundtrack producer of the film and produced Greta Van Fleet's 2023 Starcatcher album and a string of LPs by Rival Sons, including 2018's stellar Feral Roots.


	Dubbed Cats on a Smooth Surface, the Pony's house band was in fact a real group, led by frontman Bobby Bandiera, who at one point nearly joined Springsteen's E Street Band. Their repertoire consisted mostly of early rock and soul covers, like “Twist and Shout” and “Long Tall Sally.” In the film, they're shown performing Little Richard's “Lucille” and John Lee Hooker's “Boom Boom” with White.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	When putting together the Stone Pony band for Deliver Me From Nowhere, producers clearly leaned on Cobb's connections, casting GVF guitarist Jake Kiszka and bassist Sam Kiszka as the Cats' guitar and bass player, respectively, and Rival Sons' singer Jay Buchanan as Bandiera — though he's listed as “Cats on a Smooth Surface – Lead Singer” in the credits.

	











	“Our journey with this project began through Dave Cobb… Dave's involvement sparked the connection, and soon he was appointed musical director for the film,” Greta Van Fleet's Jake Kiszka tells Rolling Stone. “I was working with him at his studio, Low Country Sound in Savannah, Georgia, when he shared the project with me. Scott Cooper, the director, was searching for a ‘young, hip rock ‘n' roll band' – someone like Greta Van Fleet, he suggested. Dave's response was immediate: ‘Why not get them?' And just like that, the pieces fell into place.”

	Buchanan, while depicted as more of a Bob Seger-type figure than the real-life Bandiera, is magnetic onstage, howling and shuffling his way through “Lucille” with White's Springsteen jamming behind him. (At a recent tribute to John Fogerty in Nashville, Buchanan stole the show with his bare-foot rendition of CCR's “Fortunate Son.”) The Kiszka brothers, who make up Greta Van Fleet with sibling Josh on vocals and Danny Wagner on drums, strike their best bar-band poses onstage at the Pony, and even have a speaking line outside on the Asbury Park sidewalk following a gig.

	“Working with Jeremy was a captivating adventure on multiple levels,” Jake Kiszka adds. “His ability to embody Bruce Springsteen was a masterclass — he walked the fine line between capturing the essence of the character and infusing it with his own originality.”


	Cameos like these in Deliver Me From Nowhere, along with other inspired casting decisions like Marc Maron as studio engineer Chuck Plotkin, Yeah Yeah Yeahs drummer Brian Chase as E Street's Max Weinberg, and label impresario Jimmy Iovine as himself (that's Iovine's real voice screaming at Jon Landau over the phone) are a treat for rock fans. Or at least those who are particularly eagle-eyed.

While Oscar nominee Jeremy Strong (“The Apprentice”) could be back at the Oscars for the second year in a row for his subtle, moving performance as manager Jon Landau in “Bruce Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,” he's neither rooting for himself nor for another character actor he admires, Sean Penn in “One Battle After Another.” As a member of this year's Cannes jury, Strong is an unabashed fan of Norway's Cannes prize-winning Oscar entry, “Sentimental Value.” “Give Stellan Skarsgård the Oscar, please,” he said as we sat down at the Four Seasons in Los Angeles.

 










I can't help but notice his rusty, close-cropped haircut. He's in prep to play Mark Zuckerberg in writer/director Aaron Sorkin's sequel to 2010's “The Social Network,” “The Social Reckoning” (October 9, 2026), set 17 years later and without Jesse Eisenberg. It covers a stretch between 2018 and 2021, when Facebook moved from “move fast and break things,” said Strong, to “move fast with stable infrastructure. This also tells the story of the Wall Street Journal's reporting on the Facebook Files.” (He reunites with Jeremy Allen White, who plays Springsteen in “Deliver Me from Nowhere.”)

As soon as Strong got wind of a follow-up to “The Social Network,” he told Sorkin that he had always wanted to play Zuckerberg. Strong played Jerry Rubin in Best Picture nominee “The Trial of the Chicago 7,” which Sorkin wrote and directed, and starred in Sorkin's directorial debut “Molly's Game.” “The Social Reckoning” screenplay is “one of the best scripts I've ever read,” said Strong. “It touches the third rail, the axis of much of the issues and maladies of our time.”

Per usual, Strong is hoovering up everything he can about Zuckerberg. His prep, influenced by early mentor Daniel Day-Lewis, involves a “deep dive on everything,” he said, “trying to understand and defend a point of view of a character, what it is they believe in, what they're fighting for, maybe understand what might be blind spots. But the most important thing for me is an empathic connection to a person. We live in an age when there's a lot of judgment, a lot of maligning of people. We would all do well to walk a day in anybody's shoes before casting aspersions and judgment.”

Zuckerberg, who at 41 is still running Facebook, is “a real person with a family,” said Strong, who is 46 and has three kids. “He is someone who has shaped the world we live in. I feel an enormous responsibility for accuracy and understanding.”

 










Zuckerberg is just one of a gallery of real people that Strong has taken on, including powerbroker Roy Cohn, one of the most maligned figures in New York, who Strong not only made believable but empathetic in “The Apprentice.” “I find Roy's journey a tragic journey,” he said. “I find Kendall Roy's journey [in the Emmy-winning ‘Succession'], even though he's a composite character, a tragic journey.”

Day-Lewis gave Strong “a kind of permission,” he said, “by witnessing a level of commitment and a level of preparation and courage and a willingness to just go way the fuck out on the limb,” he said. Strong also admires Anthony Hopkins, his co-star on James Gray's “Armageddon Time,” who has played Richard Nixon, Adolf Hitler, Pablo Picasso, C.S. Lewis, and John Quincy Adams. Strong is drawn to historic characters, he said: “Those are the best stories with the most complex stories and the highest stakes.”

In “Deliver Me from Nowhere,” Strong plays a real person, Jon Landau, an influential music critic who proclaimed Springsteen as the future of rock in the pages of Rolling Stone and quietly and firmly, behind the scenes, helped his friend to manage his career and recover from debilitating depression. The film is set during the 1982 recording of “Nebraska,” a bare-bones acoustic album of dark songs that Springsteen needed to get off his chest before he could publish such rock anthems as “Born to Run,” which he had already written, that would make him a rock legend.  

 










Having gotten to work closely with Springsteen on “Deliver Me from Nowhere,” Strong is a fan: “I've just come out of this press conference with Bruce, who gives 10,000 percent. I admire him perhaps more than I admire anyone on this earth: his humility, his devotion, his commitment. It's about how much he gives, his sincerity, his generosity of spirit.” 

Movingly, “Deliver Me from Nowhere” shows how Landau cares for Springsteen and stands up for him at a time when he needs support. “At this moment in time, 1982, it is not a given that Bruce would go on to be the Bruce Springsteen we know him to be today,” said Strong, “simply because of his struggles with mental health and depression, as William Styron said, ‘a darkness visible,' and that darkness was pressing down on him, and he did not have the equipment internally to handle it. It's not something anyone can handle on their own.”

A few years older than Springsteen, Landau “was a father figure to Bruce at this time,” said Strong, “had been in therapy, had had a broader education, was steeped in literature and the history of art and the history of music, and he was able to help Bruce take this step to getting professional help. He was almost like a therapist himself, and he understood that the only way out is through. This movie that Scott Cooper has made is the story of Bruce shaking hands with his own past, his trauma, the wounds that we all carry and that often remain untreated or buried. And so this is about the album ‘Nebraska,' the unearthing of that trauma and the repairing of trauma through art.”

 










“Nebraska” also marked a moment in time before Springsteen was about to hit big. “James Baldwin once used the phrase ‘trying to find an honest place to stand,'” said Strong. “Bruce was looking to find that honest place to stand. He was lost in the vortex of this world that we're in, the pressures and expectations of success, fame. And Bruce needed to locate. Bruce said once that all of his songs are about a person trying to find and save some part of himself. And Bruce, at this time in 1982, needed to find and save some part of himself. And Jon Landau had the compassion, love, devotion, depth of understanding, and insight to support and enable that.”

Landau also had to be savvy enough to manage CBS Records. It's surprising the executives went along with “Nebraska” at all. Landau had to coax them into it. “‘The River' was a massive album,” said Strong, “but he wasn't yet in the stratosphere that he then went on to be. When Jon Landau goes into Columbia Records and sits down with Al Teller, people listen to Jon Landau. He had an authority, but he also was a bodyguard for what is sacred. Jon was perceiving what was essential in that record and why it was essential for fertilizing the growth of Bruce Springsteen, the artist. He was not perceiving in a calculated way why this would or wouldn't be a savvy career move — not that he didn't give a shit about career, because he did.”

 










Strong and Jeremy Allen White as Springsteen bonded effectively to create this close relationship. “Easily and almost without words,” said Strong. “I've admired Jeremy for a long time. Part of what you do is you create a dynamic that mirrors a dynamic, and it was easy for me to feel a devotion and a love for Jeremy, also given what was at stake, similar to Sebastian [Stan] having to play Donald Trump, a character that is an iconic, monolithic character. You are vulnerable. You are up there like Philippe Petit, walking on that high wire. So it was easy for me to feel a solicitude, a protectiveness, and an empathy and care for him. You look after him a bit without words, let him know that you're there for him, which is what Jon does. They don't talk a lot.”

One key scene between the two men involves a piece of music, instigated by Strong. “In the early '70s, they used to come over to each other's house and listen to records,” said Strong. “They would play each other music all night. And it was the night before we were shooting this scene, where Jon goes over to Bruce's house in Colts Neck, a beautifully scripted scene where they say the things that they're feeling to each other. Jon expresses his deep concern for Bruce, his wish for what the road trip will be. I felt a sense that the Jon that I had come to understand might not have worded all those things as overtly, and I had an instinct that maybe I should play him a song in the scene. I sent Bruce and Jon some texts. I asked them: ‘I'm thinking of playing a record for you in the scene tomorrow. If you were going to play a song, if you were trying to save your friend's life, what song would you play?'”

 










The three men exchanged texts for three hours. Strong listened to each song suggestion. Springsteen went to bed. About 45 minutes later, he texted Landau: Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers' “Last Mile of the Way.” “I listened to it,” said Strong, “and was floored. It's emotionally huge, and it's the story of the movie. It's about passing through a dark valley before you get to arrive somewhere.”

The next day, Scott Cooper shot the scene as scripted. Strong had secretly asked the sound mixer and prop department to prepare a cassette with the song on it and have the boom box in the room. And after they shot the scene, he said, “Scott, can I try something?” And Cooper said, “Can you tell me what it is?” And I said, “No, I'd rather not.”

Strong also asked White if he wanted to know what he was going to do. He said, “No.” “That's what's in the movie,” said Strong. “It's a big-budget Disney studio movie, but it has a Cassavetes soul. There's a spiritual dimension to that song and that sequence in the movie. It captured something about them and their essence and their journey.” 

Next up: Strong plays the lead in the remake of “The Boys from Brazil,” a limited series written by Peter Morgan (“The Crown”). “It's a five-hour film that Bob Elswit is shooting, an allegory of the rise of fascism in the world.” Also in the works is a Paramount six-hour limited series created by Tobias Lindholm about September 11 first responders. “There's an embarrassment of riches right now,” said Strong, “and I don't take it for granted.”

							By 

	Eli Thompson



	On a Friday night a few months ago, I was on a FaceTime call with some friends, other seniors in high school. We were hanging out in our rooms, scrolling through Snapchat, when a friend of mine mentioned a girl he knew from one of our sister schools. He wanted to text her, but his thumb froze. “Send it, bro,” one friend said, “but screw it up and it'll be screenshotted.” He didn't send the text.


	At the Chicago high school I graduated from in June, phones were out during private and public moments. It could be in class when someone fumbled a presentation, or the cafeteria when someone tripped. Most clips stayed in private Snapchat group chats, shared among a few dozen kids. But they could spread further, and cut deeper. Last year, a friend from another school was filmed in his attempt to ask a girl out in the hallway. Even though it was awkward, he didn't do anything crazy in the video and it was mostly just a rejection. But someone recorded him and posted it on a Snapchat story. The video had the caption, “Bro thought he had a chance,” and over 200 people saw it by the time he got to lunch. 

	











	For many young men my age, these moments aren't just embarrassing, they change how we date. The possibility of being recorded and mocked has made what would be normal interactions feel risky. 


	Trends such as “fail compilations” or “cringe challenges” — posts showing awkward mistakes or uncomfortable situations meant to make others laugh — encourage people to document embarrassing moments. Popular Instagram accounts post people's dating profiles, text conversations, and awkward pickup lines. Sometimes they're anonymous, but not always. Before long, strangers are watching, liking, and commenting on a moment that was meant to be private. 

	











	After seeing these moments play out, I realized this was no longer a far-off fear. It changed how young men conducted themselves in real life. The threat of public shaming makes normal interactions risky and at times can lessen the chance young men will pursue relationships or go on dates. Constant fear of embarrassment can leave some young men too hesitant to take the social risks needed for dating. The fear of online exposure doesn't just stop certain young men from asking girls out — it can plant seeds of resentment that threaten to fracture gender relations for a long time.

	Some young men end up developing a defensive posture, so that they can't be ashamed. It ends up fueling mistrust in many young men and can turn interactions into battlegrounds where boys feel they must protect their egos. Over time, empathy can go away and suspicion takes its place. Instead of feeling comfortable being genuine, sometimes they second-guess every word or message, wondering how it might be judged, shared, or mocked. But then it takes a turn and that's why young men may retreat into online spaces that confirm the suspicions they have and help to reinforce negative stereotypes about girls. This causes a Cold War among genders where each side is suspicious of each other and doesn't have empathy. In these divided spaces, interactions become games of defensive accusation and people grow untrustworthy of one another.

	The fear of being filmed is well and thriving in part because the people who share these videos face no real consequences. This creates an unchecked culture of humiliation, and makes the social media world for Gen Z a place where accountability is absent and cruelty is rewarded. Each viral clip brings more attention to not just the one in front of the camera, but behind the camera as well. While the person being filmed is embarrassed, the one filming walks away with a reputation and clout. Since those who post videos don't face accountability and many times get a boost in engagement, it emboldens them to film and share embarrassing moments. This creates a vicious cycle where shame is a currency, and the only person who actually pays a price is the one who is mocked. 


	We need to establish consequences for digital cruelty. Schools and communities need to treat this seriously and implement clear policies that treat online shaming the same way as they do bullying. Even if online shaming continues, this accountability will make sure that the victimizer will face social consequences as well. If schools and communities did so, it would show victims and perpetrators that integrity and respect is important online and offline. Cruelty behind a screen is no less harmful than cruelty in person and we need to send that message loud and clear.

It has been a tradition for the reigning Miss USA contestant to crown her successor. However, Miss USA 2024 Alma Cooper broke tradition by not attending the award ceremony for Miss USA 2025. The show took place on Friday, October 24, and was aired at 5 p.m. PST, straight from the Grand Sierra Resort & Casino in Reno, Nevada. 

Miss Nebraska, Audrey Eckert, was crowned Miss USA 2025. But why was Cooper missing, and what have fans said about her absence? 

A post shared by Alma Cooper (@alma.cooper)

Cooper made history when she became the first Afro-Latina woman to win the Miss USA title, and the public praised her talent and beauty. Many fans hoped to see her back on the stage where she was first crowned the winner, but she made the difficult decision not to attend.

Cooper explained her decision in an Instagram post on Friday, October 24, hours before the live show would air. “In every aspect of my life, I am always in pursuit of excellence. That relentless pursuit fueled me to graduate from West Point top 50 in my class, run three marathons in 10 months and become a Knight Hennessy Fellow at Stanford University,” she wrote in the caption of photos. The pictures show her holding her Miss USA sash. “I brought that same attitude with me when I won the title of Miss USA, energized by the opportunity to inspire youth across the globe at Miss Universe and within communities across the nation.”

She continued, “I am a firm believer that excellence means nothing if it stops with me. Instead I want my growth to be something others can build on. After much consideration, I've made the extremely difficult decision not to attend this year's Miss USA pageant and crowning ceremony. As I close this chapter, I do so with the knowledge that I finished what I started with integrity and my self-worth held high, just like the crown I was honored to wear.”

A post shared by Miss USA (@missusa)

Fans have reacted to her post with an outpouring of love, flooding the comments with supportive messages. 

“Proud of you and love you!!! Incredible person and I couldn't be more amazed by who you are,” a comment reads. “Looking forward to what's next for you queen,” another fan shared. 

A third comment reads, “Thank you Alma for your service and for truly living by your motto to serve and not be served. Your decision speaks volumes about integrity and accountability.” 

There has also been a reaction from celebrities. Shanna Moakler wrote, “You are an example of class, integrity, and strength. You should be so proud of the woman that you are. I'm so honored to be your Miss Usa sister..”

“You are the epitome of a queen. I am so proud of you for knowing your self worth and for completing a reign that was pretty much impossible. YOU kept the title ALIVE all on your own,” a supportive comment reads from model and former Miss USA 2011 Alyssa Campanella wrote. “You will go down in history as one of the hardest-working, most determined Miss USAs we have ever had. You're an inspiration not just for what you accomplished this year all by yourself with zero team behind you, but for standing your ground boldly and courageously.”

The incident took place during the band's performance of "Welcome to the Jungle" at Estadio Huracán on Oct. 18.

Guns N' Roses have issued a statement addressing frontman Axl Rose's apparent outburst during the band's Oct. 18 concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina.


	During the opening number, their 1987 hit “Welcome to the Jungle” at Estadio Huracán, Rose was visibly frustrated, kicking the bass drum, hurling his microphone toward the kit, and storming offstage after stripping off his leather jacket.

	The abrupt departure stunned the crowd, prompting confusion both in the audience and among his bandmates. Minutes later, Rose returned to the stage and addressed the situation with a terse, “So, I'll just try and wing this,” before continuing the set.


	On Tuesday (Oct. 22), the band released a statement via social media explaining the cause of the disruption. According to the post, the issue stemmed from an in-ear monitor malfunction.


	“During the opening song at our recent Buenos Aires concert, Axl's in-ear monitor pack had only the percussion in his ears versus his entire mix,” the statement read. “The issue was fixed by our tech team by the third song, and we had a great night. The situation had nothing to do with Isaac Carpenter's playing, who is top-notch and a great drummer.”


Ferrer's “amicable” departure from Guns N' Roses after 19 years behind the kit was officially announced in March, with the band thanking the longtime drummer and wishing him “success in the next chapter of his musical journey.” 

	











	Days later, Ferrer shared a statement of his own, writing, “I will have immense gratitude and love always for Axl and the band while at the same time, disappointment that this chapter came to an end.” Carpenter was confirmed as his replacement shortly after and has been on the road with the band since. 


	The band is currently in the midst of the Latin American leg of its Because What You Want & What You Get Are Two Completely Different Things Tour, which continues through Nov. 8 with stops remaining in Uruguay, Chile, Peru and Colombia.

Jon Bon Jovi is reflecting on decades of friendship and influence as he celebrates Forever (Legendary Edition), a newly expanded version of Bon Jovi's 2024 album that features fresh collaborations with Bruce Springsteen and Jelly Roll.

	Speaking on SiriusXM's Bon Jovi Radio, the frontman opened up about how his longtime New Jersey peer Bruce Springsteen ended up contributing harmonica to a new version of “Hollow Man,” a fan-favorite track from Forever.

	“As I wrote this song, I was basically asking the heavens to make me a conduit,” Bon Jovi explained. “Give me the message, where am I going with this? I am the hollow man, fill me up with information and I'll write it down. What do you sing when your song's been sung?”

	











	After hearing the demo, Springsteen called Bon Jovi the next morning. “He says, ‘I can't get that one out of my head,'” Bon Jovi recalled. “Now you know, you're talking to not only your childhood hero but one of the great American songwriters of the last half century.”




	The Boss later agreed to lend his signature harmonica sound to the track. “I want it to be like that. Come and join my story,” Bon Jovi said. “He said, ‘I got it. Just leave it to me.'”


	The full-circle moment wasn't lost on Bon Jovi, who remembered the early days when he was just a kid in the crowd watching Springsteen perform on Sunday nights in Asbury Park. “I was that kid in the crowd while [Bruce] was jumping up with the guy that became our side man,” he said, adding, “It's 45 years later and I just got to be me. So the whole thing is just kooky surreal.”


Forever (Legendary Edition) also features “Living Proof,” a duet with country star Jelly Roll. Bon Jovi first met the “Need a Favor” hitmaker at the 2024 MusiCares Person of the Year gala in Los Angeles, where Jelly Roll performed in tribute to the band.


	“I was in love with him from that moment on,” Bon Jovi said. “I've gotten to know Bunnie, his wife, and her story. I'm absolutely in awe of them.”


	The original Forever debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on Billboard's Top Album Sales chart. Its lead single “Legendary” reached No. 9 on the Adult Contemporary tally. Despite its strong debut, the album dropped off the Billboard 200 after just one week.


	The Legendary Edition arrives as the band marks four decades together and caps off a reflective season for Bon Jovi, who also premiered the Hulu docuseries Thank You, Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story earlier this year.

	As the Season 34 finale approaches, Dancing with the Stars fans rooting for Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas were met with some unfortunate news.


	One day after announcing they would give away tickets to the live show, the pair shared an update that ABC and BBC have pulled the plug on their giveaway, but they are working on another opportunity.


	“So, we have some bad news,” said Leavitt in a TikTok video. “We just got out of rehearsal, and we were both informed that we actually can't do a giveaway for the Dancing with the Stars live show.”

	Ballas noted that the decision “has come directly from ABC and BBC, and is completely out of our hands.”

	











	Leavitt added, “It just really sucks because Mark and I just want to do something really special for you guys that have shown us so much support and love, for us and the show. We're gonna get creative and we're gonna think of something else to give away.”

we're gunna get creative and find a way to make it up to you! 💕💗love you guys! 


	The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives star and her dancing partner have impressed during their Season 34 run, most recently stomping out the competition with a combined score of 72 for Weeks 5 and 6.


	Airing Tuesdays at 8 a.m. on ABC, the Dancing with the Stars live show scheduled for November 25.

Lame attempt to either generate publicity, or mess with a well oiled machine.  Either way it makes these two look like idiots.

Exactly Check you can do it first. This isn't the fault of ABC of or BBC, this is on them.

	As Donald Trump stirs up more national outrage over his demolition of the White House‘s East Wing, one of his favorite dinner guests is brushing off the controversy.


	On Friday's episode of Real Time, Bill Maher gave a flippant response when guest panelist Michael Steele mourned “the destruction of a symbol of this government” after the Trump administration had the historic structure torn down to make way for his ballroom.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“You're talking about the White House? Oh, it's a building, Mike. It's a building.”


	Steele argued that Trump “tore it down without accountability,” explaining, “It's a building, maybe to you, but to a lot of Americans, it's not. And I'm gonna tell you, as a young kid growing up in D.C., when my daddy took me by that building, it meant something to me as a 10-year-old. It meant something to me to grow up in a town where everybody in this country came and protested, and cried and screamed and laughed. So, that building, for me, was my childhood.”

	











	Maher rebutted, “First of all, I agree. I said, he should have gotten the permits. But that's how he does things. I agree. But it is just a building … that part of the building wasn't always there. Presidents do change the buildings. Nixon put in a bowling alley, Obama made the tennis court a basketball court. I can't get this mad about everything, Mike, I just can't.”


	“The symbolism is, he's not leaving. That's what bothers me about it. Who puts in a giant ballroom if you're leaving?” he added. “OK, but that's the issue, not the building.”

	











	Panelist Kate Bedingfield argued that the destruction is an example of Trump's behavior being “impulsive, reckless, driven by his own desire for self-agrandizement.”


	“If this was the only thing he had done on that front, then I would give you, ‘it's just a building,'” said Bedingfield. “But it's not. It's part of a manner of governing that's tearing at some of the institutional foundations in this country, and that's scary.”


	Maher later had to swallow his own words after his writers apparently didn't get the memo about his lack of concern for the White House demolition, joking on his ‘New Rules' segment: “Now that President Trump is redecorating the White House, building a ballroom and hosting brunches at his new rose garden club…”


	After an uncomfortable pause, Maher continued, “He has to start a new series called Queer Eye for the Authoritarian Guy.”


	Photos taken on Thursday appeared to show that the Trump administration has not only torn down the East Wing—which was built in 1902 and renovated in 1942—but the East Colonnade, which included a movie theater that has hosted screenings for decades.


	The White House has defended the project, noting that it is being privately funded and that many presidents of the past have made alterations. The area is being cleared to make way for Trump's planned $300 million ballroom, with a list of corporate donors including Comcast and Amazon providing funds.

Until Bill Maher does not have a dictator breathing down his throat, he is going to continue with his irreverent “humor” about Trump.  He lacks a true understanding of how Trump is destroying our country, and does not seem to care.  Sad all around.  Thank goodness we still have Jimmy Kimmel!

Calling the East Wing (or one-third) of the White House “just a building,” is like calling the parchment the Constitution was handwritten on just a piece of paper. Sure, it is a building, but what it represents is at issue. Forget that it's part of our history and deserves our respect, to tear it down with such irreverence and arrogantly give the national park service the middle finger, and do what you want regardless of necessary protocol is a slap in the face of all those who actually have a beating heart and a pulse. Imagine what the men and women who lost their lives defending our country would have to say about that “building.” Bill Maher's off-handed comment was ignorant and insensitive and indicative of his tunnel vision. I'm sure if one-third of his “home” was demolished willy-nilly he wouldn't see it as “just a building.” It's all relative Bill.

This is the issue we have some extremist who are hell bent on destroying this country for the rich elites. Is Bill in the Epstein files.

Bill Maher is finding it harder and harder to support his new best friend. But, Trump is no fool.  Between the ballroom demolition of the east wing; the massive build up of weapons in the Caribbean; the destruction of boats and deaths to the occupants; the government shutdown; the issues with health care; inflation; etc etc., etc… Trump has successfully taken Epstein off of the headlines…but, once the new house member is finally sworn in…Epstein should will return bigly.

Trump.  He is completely deranged.

	When accepting the Trailblazer Award from the Critics Choice Association's 5th annual Celebration of Latino Cinema & Television, America Ferrera took the opportunity to call on artists across Hollywood to use the power of storytelling to empower communities in “a day and age where discourse and conversation are failing to create connection and empathy and understanding.” 


	According to The Hollywood Reporter, the Barbie star recalled a conversation with a scholar on the history of authoritarianism who warned that the United States is “barreling towards a crisis point in our country and therefore in our world.” Ferrera pressed on: “And we [in Hollywood] are not a cute little side note to civil society — we are civil society. Artists and the stories we tell have a role to play in this moment.” 


	The ceremony took place at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles, a city where the Trump administration's  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids have caused widespread fear among immigrant communities. Many have become too afraid to go about their daily lives and leave their homes — regardless of their legal status, as both immigrants with legal status and US citizens have been detained and arrested over the past year.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Ferrera, who was presented her award by Jamie Lee Curtis, continued, “We have an obligation to point not only to what we are against, but to create and to demonstrate the world that we are for and the world that we want to live in; and to not depict one another as charity cases, as people who need us to have dignity. We are born with our dignity, and no one will take that away from us.”

	She closed out the event by urging those listening to take action. “It is time for us to find our courage, find our heroism, be as brave as the characters we write and as brave as the characters we play and stand up and use our voices and use our art — make art that inspires and calls forth the world we want to live in,” Ferrera said.


	Per THR, other figures in the industry honored that night included Andy Garcia, Oscar Isaac, Anthony Ramos, Camila Perez, Dolores Huerta, Frida Perez, Gabriel Luna, Kleber Mendonça Filho, Dolores Fonzi and Tonatiuh.

Carly Rae Jepsen finally posted photos on Instagram from her October 4 wedding, and the stunning images were definitely worth the wait. The 39-year-old Canadian singer-songwriter got married at the Chelsea Hotel in New York City, according to Vogue.

A post shared by Carly Rae Jepsen (@carlyraejepsen)

Jepsen met Cole Marsden Greif-Neill, aka Cole M.G.N., during a songwriting session in May 2021, per Vogue. Greif-Neill is a music producer and songwriter who has worked with musicians such as Beck, Snoop Dogg, and Andy Samberg's The Lonely Island.

Although Greif-Neill and Jepsen met in 2021, they didn't start dating immediately. They first built a friendship and work relationship before making things official in 2022. They got engaged on September 21, 2024, announcing the joyful news on Instagram a few days later.

A post shared by Carly Rae Jepsen (@carlyraejepsen)

On October 4, 2025, Jepsen and Greif-Neill officially tied the knot in front of 100 guests in a ceremony officiated by Jepsen's aunt and uncle.

According to Vogue, Jepsen went to at least three different bridal shops looking for the perfect dress (or two). Ultimately, she found her two dresses on opposite coasts. In Los Angeles, Jepsen selected a Toni Maticevski dress from Loho Bride. She found her second dress in New York at Danielle Frankel. She also donned pearl earring made by her mother.

Greif-Neill, meanwhile, wore a cream suit from Husbands in Paris paired with Gucci shoes. Her bridesmaids selected their own dresses in a jewel-toned color palette.

The way Jepsen describes her wedding sounds like magic. As she told Vogue, “Between the bright baby blue of the background, the wildflowers that surrounded us, and the intimate lighting, walking down the aisle felt like a fever dream. Nothing will top the moment when we first locked eyes, and to be honest, for the first half of the ceremony we couldn't see anyone else.”

Although it's hard for any event to be absolutely perfect, Jepsen wouldn't change anything about her special day. “Often in life we'll imagine things, and even though the reality can be good, it's never quite as good,” Jepsen said. “This day felt like the exception. It was better than either one of our wildest dreams. We felt connected through the whole thing, which was really important to us. In fact, we even had a few special songs planted in the DJ's setlist so that, no matter where we were at the moment, when we heard those songs, we would come find each other.”

Jepsen released her most recent album “The Loveliest Time,” in 2023. Hopefully she'll write and share a new album soon!

The Golden Globes' insistence on chopping all of fictional moviedom into two types—dramas on the one hand, comedies (and musicals!) on the other—has produced a lot of weird moments over the years. (Who doesn't remember laughing their guts out at Golden Globe Best Comedy The Martian?) Mostly, though, the Globes' ongoing category brain serves as a reminder of how weird trying to make these simple demarcations can be. Take Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another, a film that is undeniably funny (and harrowing, and occasionally shockingly violent), but much harder to slot into any one specific genre category. Not if you're the Globes, though: That sucker's a laugh riot.

This is per Variety, which reports that Warner Bros. has now officially submitted Anderson's film in the awards show's comedy categories. That includes submitting Leonardo DiCaprio and newcomer Chase Infiniti in the lead acting roles for the genre, while submitting the rest of the ensemble cast—including Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro, Regina Hall, and Teyana Taylor—for supporting nods.

Variety notes that One Battle (which has enjoyed significant critical and word-of-mouth buzz since it hit theaters last month) may have a decent chance of breaking some records this year; the addition of a new category for casting has widened the Globes' award pool out a bit, and the film is reportedly on track to score at least a nomination in most of the categories it's nominated for. It could squeeze out one more if it managed to qualify for the show's recently added “Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement,” but it probably won't quite make the cut: Films in the populist-minded category have to score at least $100 million at the American box office, and Anderson's movie is floating along about $37 million short, having made the majority of its money overseas.

'Chainsaw Man — The Movie: Reza Arc' is another major victory for Japanese anime, while 'Regretting You' is edging out 'Black Phone 2' and 'Deliver Me From Nowhere: Springsteen' in a surprise twist.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Japanese anime feature Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc is off to an impressive start at the U.S. box office, where it topped Friday's chart with $8.5 million from 3,003 theaters. The acclaimed manga pic — now on course to open to a better-than-expected $15 million to $17 million —boasts a perfect 100 percent critics score and a 99 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, a rarely seen combo, in addition to five out of five stars on exit polling service PostTrak.


	Since launching in cinemas last month in Japan, Chainsaw Man has already grossed north of $64 million at the global box office. Sony and Crunchyroll are handling the movie domestically and in select overseas markets. Produced by MAPPA, the R-rated pic is based on the hit anime TV series, available to stream on Disney+, Crunchyroll and other platforms.

Chainsaw Man — The Movie follows the adventures of Denji (Kikunosuke Toya), a teenager and demon hunter who is killed by his overlords, the yakuza. But when his beloved chainsaw-powered, devil-dog Pochita (Shiori Izawa) makes a deal and sacrifices himself, Benji is reborn with the ability to transform parts of his body into chainsaws. Along with violence, the pic doubles as a teenage romance with the arrival of the mysterious Reza. However, Reza is not quite who she seems, and a series of battles ensues that could destroy Tokyo when their love story takes a twisted turn.

	











	Directed by Tatsuya Yoshihara, the film is based on Tatsuki Fujimoto's original story, with a screenplay by Hiroshi Seko. “It's safe to say that manga and anime fans won't be disappointed, even if they'll inevitably be nitpicking about one narrative aspect or another,” writes THR in its review.


	Heading into its U.S. opening, Chainsaw Man was expected to battle Blumhouse and Universal's holdover hit Black Phone 2 for No. 1 with a debut in the $11 million to $12 million range. But it quickly pulled ahead of the pack after earning an impressive $3.4 million in Thursday previews (as with all films, preview grosses are folded into Friday's opening-day number).


	In another surprise twist, Regretting You — the second Colleen Hoover book adaptation to hit the big screen after 2024's box office blockbuster It Ends With Us — pulled ahead of holdover Black Phone 2 and Disney's new bio-drama Deliver Me From Nowhere: Springsteen to come in second on Friday with $5.2 million from 3,593 locations for a better-than-expected opening of $13 million.  


	Many expected the film to be dinged by generally withering reviews, but the female-fueled pic is garnering strong audience scores. It's also clearly benefiting from a glut of male-skewing fare that has dominated the marquee for months, as well as Hoover's popularity. (She's one of many who are caught up in the ongoing legal battle between It Ends With Us director/producer Justin Baldoni and actress/producer Blake Lively).

	











	The new film is described as a romantic drama that speaks to the aspirational theme of living life fully and with no regrets. Constantin Films produced and financed the movie, with Paramount acquiring domestic and certain overseas rights. Internationally, the film opens this week in 40 markets, including the U.K., Australia, Brazil and Mexico.


	Instead of holding Thursday previews, Constantin Films and Paramount hosted a special Regretting You fan event at AMC Lincoln Square in New York City for that was streamed live into 500 theaters across the country that included screening of the pic was accompanied by a Q&A with director Josh Boone and cast members Allison Williams, Dave Franco and Mason Thames.


	Saturday will determine whether Regretting You can hold its lead over Blumhouse and Universal's holdover hit Black Phone 2, which earned $3.8 million on Friday and is projecting a debut in the $12 million-plus range. The pic is holding in remarkably well for a horror title.


	Disney's bio-drama Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere is now expected to come in fourth with $8 million to $10 million after earning $3.5 million on Friday, including $850,000 in Thursday previews. The movie is skewing notably older, which is no surprise. Its Rotten Tomatoes critics score presently rests at 66 percent; the RT audience score is far stronger at 83 percent.


Springsteen, playing in a total of 3,460 cinemas, should see a boost from 250 IMAX runs and an additional 750  in other premium large-format auditoriums. The music-infused pic stars Jeremy Allen White in the titular role, and who is credited in THR‘s review for giving a “raw and internalized performance as The Boss.” Jeremy Strong, Stephen Graham and Odessa Young also star in director Scott Cooper's examination of a brutal comedown after a blockbuster tour, which yielded the prolific musician's most personal album.

	











	It remains to be seen how much of an impact the first two games of this year's World Series — which pits the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Toronto Blue Jays — have on the weekend box office. Generally speaking, NFL games pose far more competition. At the same time, L.A. is the largest moviegoing market alongside New York City (it is also the biggest market for anime). Friday night's opening game of the World Series, as well as Saturday's, are both in Toronto.


	At the specialty box office, Neon is launching Shelby Oaks in 1,823 locations. Marking YouTube movie critic Chris Stuckmann‘s debut feature, the found-footage pic is eyeing an opening in the $2 million to $2.5 million range. So far, it's main claim to fame is that it raised $1.4 million via a Kickstarter campaign, the highest amount ever for a horror title, per the crowd-sourcing platform. Neon later provided some additional funds.


	Focus Features' awards contender Bugonia is also making headlines in its limited debut at the specialty box office. Directed by Yargos Lanthimos, the acclaimed film stars Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons.


More to come.

'The Lost Bus' star was honored at the Critics Choice Association's Latino Celebration, alongside Andy Garcia, Anthony Ramos, Oscar Isaac, Dolores Huerta and Tonatiuh. 


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


	The Critics Choice Association held its 5th annual Celebration of Latino Cinema & Television in L.A. on Friday, coming at a particularly fraught time for a community that is being specifically targeted by the Trump administration. 


	That was the subject of several of the luncheon's acceptance speeches, as America Ferrera, Andy Garcia, Oscar Isaac, Anthony Ramos, Camila Perez, Dolores Huerta, Frida Perez, Gabriel Luna, Kleber Mendonça Filho, Dolores Fonzi and Tonatiuh were all recognized for their work. 




	Ferrera — presented her Trailblazer Award by The Lost Bus producer Jamie Lee Curtis — had a standout moment as she closed out the event by noting how “in a day and age where discourse and conversation are failing to create connection and empathy and understanding, the storytelling we do becomes more vital,” as TV and film “has the power to transport people outside of their entrenched logic and into their hearts.”

	The star, who is also heavily involved in political activism, later explained how she was recently talking to a scholar on the history of authoritarianism who said the U.S. is “barreling towards a crisis point in our country and therefore in our world. And we [in Hollywood] are not a cute little side note to civil society — we are civil society. Artists and the stories we tell have a role to play in this moment.”


	“We have an obligation to point not only to what we are against, but to create and to demonstrate the world that we are for and the world that we want to live in; and to not depict one another as charity cases, as people who need us to have dignity. We are born with our dignity, and no one will take that away from us,” Ferrera passionately continued. “Our opportunity as storytellers is to lift each other up, to give each other our humanity, to reaffirm the dignity that we all deserve — and in this moment, we have an obligation to preserve our rights as storytellers, as artists. And make no mistake, we are there, and it is time for us to find our courage, find our heroism, be as brave as the characters we write and as brave as the characters we play and stand up and use our voices and use our art — make art that inspires and calls forth the world we want to live in.” 

	











	That call to action was present from the early moments of the event, which began with giving activist Huerta the Icon Award. She celebrated the entertainment community for creating “stories that are going to let the world know we are not criminals,” but rather “the people that really feed and really nourish this nation, the United States of America. And the other thing that we have to say — the majority of the people right now that are being harassed and tormented, they're not immigrants, they're the indigenous people of the continent.” To finish her speech, she led the room in a chant of her signature rallying cry “sí se puede.” 


	Throughout the event, Garcia was presented with the Vanguard Award, The Secret Agent filmmaker Filho with the Director Award, The Studio's Frida Perez with the Showrunner Award (accompanied by a speech from Seth Rogen) and Ramos with the Supporting Actor, Film Award for A House of Dynamite. Isaac virtually accepted the Actor, Film Award for Frankenstein while Luna was presented the Supporting Actor, Film Award for Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy, Dolores Fonzi with the International Film Award, Camila Perez with the Breakthrough Actress Award and Kiss of the Spider Woman‘s Tonatiuh with the Breakthrough Actor Award.  


	In his speech, Tonatiuh revealed how when the Jennifer Lopez musical came out two weeks ago, they gave away tickets across the country to people in financial hardship — including kids at the high school he had gone to, who he brought to a screening at The Grove. 

	











	“They got to see themselves on screen, and I held them in my arms as they cried and they said that they have never seen anything like this,” Tonatiuh said. “Some of them came out to me, some of them told me that they were carrying their passports in their pockets just in case, and that this film helped them process their pain.” He concluded with echoing Huerta's call of “sí se puede” and adding, “Fuck ICE.”

	As it turns out for Netflix‘s Boots, there's no better endorsement than having the Trump administration bash your show.


	Following the Pentagon‘s statement referring to the LGBTQ military series based on Greg Cope White's memoir The Pink Marine as “woke garbage,” show creator Andy Parker expressed his gratitude as Boots climbs the streamer's charts to No. 2.


	“I guess we have to give some credit to the Pentagon there, don't we?” Parker told Vanity Fair.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Last week, Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson bashed the show in a statement shared with multiple outlets. “Under President Trump and Secretary Hegseth, the U.S. military is getting back to restoring the warrior ethos. Our standards across the board are elite, uniform, and sex neutral because the weight of a rucksack or a human being doesn't care if you're a man, a woman, gay, or straight,” she said. “We will not compromise our standards to satisfy an ideological agenda, unlike Netflix whose leadership consistently produces and feeds woke garbage to their audience and children.”

	











	Despite the pseudo-moralist outrage, Parker noted Boots isn't the “queer fantasia of sexcapade and homoerotic fantasy” some viewers expected, but it's also not “this polemical screed against the military—this really scathing takedown.”


	“I certainly never set out to make anything that was propaganda and I really reject the idea that it is. The fact that we seem to be situated between these two different sides is evidence of how the show wants to approach these really thorny, interesting questions. [Boots] is trying to navigate this in a nuanced way that isn't so overtly strident in its attacks or in its politics. I think it's after something more subtle,” said Parker.

	











	“I would be very surprised if the Pentagon actually watched the show,” he told VF. “The premise itself instigates or incites some kind of reaction or assumptions. What I would invite people to do is to watch the show, and see how they feel about the questions the show is trying to provoke.”


	Explaining that he didn't want to depict “an unblemished view of the military,” Parker said the show is “more about the human experience of what it feels like for these guys in this particular time and place to go through this experience.”


	“We were on an emotional mission,” said Parker. “There's politics involved in all of these questions—what's happening to trans people now, and the policies that are being inflicted on trans service members now. What our show shines the light on is, what is the cost of that? What's the cost to the people who are affected by those policies? What is the cost to the institution itself, when they have to inflict that on service members who want to serve honorably and with dignity?”


	In its second week on Netflix, Boots doubled its weekly audience to 9.4M, rising to No. 2 on Netflix's English TV rankings.


Boots stars Miles Heizer as 1990s closeted teen Cameron Cope, who impulsively follows his best friend Ray McAffey's (Liam Oh) lead in enlisting in the United States Marine Corps, fearing consequences if his sexuality is discovered.


	White's book was set in 1979, when he joined the USMC with his friend Dale. Gay people could not openly serve in the military until Don't Ask, Don't Tell was repealed in 2011.


	Hegseth has long been a supporter of the Trump administration's ban on transgender troops in military service, also going after pronouns and ordering the USNS Harvey Milk to remove the name of the gay activist from the naval ship.

Chrissy Chlapecka is stepping into her power again. On Friday, the Girlie Pop diva released her single “Apollo,” which she penned following a year of darkness and self-reconstruction. Now, the song is a radiant cyberpop anthem of queer resilience.


	“I wrote Apollo about the darkness I had felt throughout this year, and how I longed to chase the light I once knew myself as,” Chlapecka tells Rolling Stone in a statement. “Battling a tough road of depression, the insanity of the music industry as an independent artist, trauma therapy from previous relationships, and the rollercoaster of life… had not only stopped me in my tracks, but it also allowed me to speak directly from my heart.”


	She continues, “This song is about the return to oneself, knowing who you truly are on inside, even when darkness consumes you. This music video was made to represent how I had to completely build myself back together into the fierce diva I've always known that I am. By the end, I'm a chromatic superhero ready to leave the planet… to my next song.”

	











	The Mikey Harmon-directed video opens with Chlapecka walking out of a plastic tube at a junkyard as if she landed as a cyborg princess from outer space, before transporting to a spaceship-like backdrop. “Know where you run, go where you go/Lead and I follow, follow/Into the sun, out of the cold,” sings Chlapecka in the chorus. “I chase Apollo-pollo/Hit me with your light in the dark/I'd die to be where you are/Into the hollow of every little piece of your heart.”

	Chlapecka co-wrote the song with Dallas Caton, Alexandra Veltri, and Jesse Saint John. The singer's delivery on the track and Alec Cohen's choreography in the video have inspired fans to compare it to some of Lady Gaga's early music, in particular, Gaga's “Judas.” 


	“Today I learned that Lady Gaga had given birth to a pink-haired offspring,” commented one fan on YouTube. “This woman is literally Lady Gaga 2.0 and I'm here for it,” added another.

	The new single is set to be a part of an upcoming EP, Christine, her follow-up to last year's Girlie Pop. So far, she's released singles “Passionfruit,” “Clam Casino,” and “Cherry Do You Love Me” — all as an independent artist. The new project drops Nov. 21.

	“The EP recognizes the hurt I have dealt with and gracefully sits with it for a moment, letting it be true and raw. On the other hand, it opens a world to imagination: the girl I was as a child, dancing and singing in my bedroom, pretending it was a stage… The girl who was brave enough to follow her dreams. All of who I am comes from her,” she says. “She is why I was strong enough to pick myself up again, dream as big as I could, and let the world back in.”


	Chalpecka first made a splash with her debut single “I'm So Hot,” and led a movement to reclaim the term “bimbo” to be one of self-empowerment on social media. She has been open about her queer identity and has built a fierce fanbase that connects with her authenticity.

	“We need queer artists to be as loud, as colorful, and as fierce as possible,” Chlapecka says. “For all the queer kids who feel small right now, I hope to make you see yourself as you are. Brave, fierce, strong, and as shiny as possible. When you fall down, you can only get up stronger.”

Only second to losing, good NFL teams hate “noise” around their team, especially “noise” around a player who is not making an impact on the team. Outside of his last name, one of the reasons QB Shedeur Sanders fell to the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round was related to noise. Deserved or not, once teams evaluated him as a developmental prospect, the attention Sanders receives knocked him down a round or three.

The social media and traditional media noise around Sanders has continued to grow, with starting QB Dillon Gabriel struggling. Browns owner Jimmy Haslam addressed the team's reasonable plan around the quarterback position, noting that Gabriel needs more time and Sanders is progressing well.

Then, on Saturday, early afternoon, the team announced that Sanders was being added to the injury report due to a tight back and would be listed as questionable for Week 8 against the New England Patriots. Along with that announcement, Cleveland elevated QB Bailey Zappe from the practice squad, along with DT Sam Kamara, for Sunday.

According to Mary Kay Cabot, Sanders' back tightened up on him overnight:

This is the second injury of Sanders' NFL career. After a very good start against the Carolina Panthers in Week 1 of the preseason, Sanders was held out of joint practice and the second preseason game against the Philadelphia Eagles.

With all the noise and attention that Sanders receives, the timing of this back injury is likely to stir the conspiracy theory pot. Fans and media alike have opined on whether the Browns have Sanders' best interests in mind or are trying to sabotage him. Others are likely to point out the randomness of a tight back despite the quarterback not being listed on the injury report previously and that position never getting hit in practice.

For now, Sanders could still be cleared in time for the game with Zappe as inactive. A player elevated from the practice squad is not eligible to be the emergency quarterback, so it is also possible that Zappe is active for Cleveland's game in New England.

With the Browns flying out on Saturday, how Sanders reacts to treatment Saturday evening will decide his fate, while social media and media ponder what all of this might mean. (Probably nothing beyond what is being reported, if we are being honest.)

Mystery has always been one of the most appealing genres in movies and TV. The rush of trying to fit in the pieces of a bigger puzzle always keeps us on the edge of our seats. And that satisfaction of finally putting it all together? Amazing. But what happens when a mystery has no solution? This is the general question asked and cleverly left unanswered in Unsolved Mysteries. The late '80s-early '90s documentary series thrived for years on a variety of networks and became a staple of pre-21st century television.

Starting on NBC, continuing to CBS, having a run on Lifetime, and ending on Spike, Unsolved Mysteries totaled a run of 14 seasons and 581 episodes at the time. While it seemed the show had ended for good, it found new life in 2020, when Unsolved Mysteries entered the streaming era through Netflix. So, whether you want to complement your final run of spooky season or if you end October craving for more spooks all year long, this perfect weekend binge-watch is waiting for you right there at the streamer.

 Before Netflix, the long-running Unsolved Mysteries had aired its last episode on Spike in 2010. A joint effort between Cosgrove-Meurer Productions, which teamed up with Shawn Levy's 21 Laps Entertainment, breathed new life into the show. Throughout three new seasons, spread in five volumes that total 30 episodes, this revival unearthed new mysterious crimes, missing persons cases, and even dabbling into supernatural phenomena.

Although the Netflix continuation doesn't have a host or narrator, Robert Stack – who hosted most of the original's episodes – is honored by showcasing a picture of him in the credits. This callback to the show's legacy establishes a clear bond between the classic series and the revival. The new episodes keep up with the times, covering high-profile cases like the Nantes Massacre. The April 2011 murders of the Dupont de Ligonnès family made news worldwide as the main suspect is the patriarch: Xavier Dupont de Ligonnès. Up to this day, the search for him continues, still making news and even proposed films.

The new episodes also replicate the old-timey vibe of the first seasons of Unsolved Mysteries as it dips into the unknown. By dedicating episodes to covering well-known urban legends, the show honors what made the show so popular back then. Most notably, Unsolved Mysteries dedicates a whole hour to the Mothman apparitions and the 1947 Roswell UFO incident. The first has been in the collective minds of Americans for decades, as theories run abound on the mysterious figure's intentions. The latter is also a staple of conspiracy theories and pop culture in general. Unsolved Mysteries unearths the information through its local interviews to remind us this ordeal marked generations and is far from over.

By the very definition of the show's title, these cases expose clues that could help get answers, but not necessarily solve them. Still, each episode includes a contact card to be able to reach the Unsolved Mysteries staff and submit tips that could help solve a particular case. Executive producer Terry Dunn Meurer told USA Today that reliable pieces of information were submitted in the first 24 hours of the show's release, particularly from the “No Ride Home,” “Mystery on the Rooftop,” and “Missing Witness” episodes. As the show continued releasing its volumes, the crew received a huge amount of credible tips that were redirected to the corresponding authorities.

Going a step further, the third volume and 16th season of Unsolved Mysteries featured an episode about children being abducted by their own parents. Thanks to the exposition that these cases got, tips submitted helped find two children. Kayla Unbehaun and Aziz Khan were located and returned safely home after the release of “Abducted by a Parent.” Although they were unrelated, in both cases the children were abducted by their mothers in 2017, while fighting for custody with their fathers. This way, Unsolved Mysteries proved it not only fulfilled morbid curiosities, but it also justified its existence as a stepping stone to shed light on otherwise forgotten cases.

There is an undeniable appeal to Unsolved Mysteries that, even when it peaked during the '90s, still keeps the audience coming back for any iteration of the show. When the first volume was released, 13.7% of the total Netflix subscribers watched it. This amount is nothing short of shocking, so it's not an overstatement to say that the revival was a total triumph. Thus, if you still haven't plunged into this mystery-filled extravaganza, this show is the perfect binge-watch you need for a weekend at home. So, if you're up to face one of the greatest terrors of all — that of uncertainty and open-endedness — then Netflix's Unsolved Mysteries will fit the bill.

While plowing a wheat field in rural Washington state in the 1990s, William Wallace spotted a gray plane overhead that he believed was releasing chemicals to make him sick. The rancher began to suspect that all white vapor trails from aircraft might be dangerous.

He shared his concern with reporters, acknowledging it sounded a little like “The X Files,” a science fiction television show.

Academics cite Wallace's story as one of the catalysts behind a fringe concept that has spread among adherents to the Make America Healthy Again, or MAHA, movement and is gaining traction at the highest levels of the federal government. Its treatment as a serious issue underscores that under President Donald Trump, unscientific ideas have unusual power to take hold and shape public health policy. 

The concept posits that airplane vapor trails, or contrails, are really “chemtrails” containing toxic substances that poison people and the terrain. Another version alleges planes or devices are being deployed by the federal government, private companies, or researchers to trigger big weather changes, such as hurricanes, or to alter the Earth's climate, emitting hazardous chemicals in the process.

Several GOP lawmakers and leaders in the Trump administration remain convinced the concepts are legitimate, though scientists have sought to discredit such claims.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is planning to investigate climate and weather control, and is expected to create a task force that will recommend possible federal action, according to a former agency official, an internal agency memo obtained by KFF Health News, and a consultant who helped with the memo.

The plans, along with comments by top GOP lawmakers, show how rumors and conspiracy theories can gain an air of legitimacy due to social media and a political climate infused with falsehoods, some political scientists and researchers say.

“When we have low access to information or low trust in our sources of information, a lot of times we turn to our peer groups, the groups we are members of and we define ourselves by,” said Timothy Tangherlini, a folklorist and professor of information at the University of California-Berkeley. He added that the government's investigation of conspiracy theories “gives the impression of having some authoritative element.”

HHS is expected to appoint a special government employee to investigate climate and weather control, according to Gray Delany, the former head of the agency's MAHA agenda, who said he drafted the memo. The agency has interviewed applicants to lead a “chemtrails” task force, said Jim Lee, a blogger focused on weather and climate who Delany said helped edit the memo, which Lee confirmed.

“HHS does not comment on future or potential policy decisions and task forces,” agency spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in an email.

The memo alleges that “aerosolized heavy metals such as Aluminum, Barium, and Strontium, as well as other materials such as sulfuric acid precursors, are sprayed into the atmosphere under the auspices of combatting global warming,” through a process of stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI.

“There are serious concerns SAI spraying is leading to increased heavy metal content in the atmosphere,” the memo states.

The memo claims, without providing evidence, that the substances cause elevated heavy-metal content in the atmosphere, soil, and waterways, and that aluminum is a toxic product used in SAI linked to dementia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, asthma-like illnesses, and other chronic illnesses. The July 14 memo was addressed to White House health adviser Calley Means, who didn't respond to a voicemail left by a reporter seeking comment.

High-level federal government officials are presenting false claims as facts without evidence and referring to events that not only haven't occurred but, in many cases, are physically impossible, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California.

“That is a pretty shocking memo,” he said. “It doesn't get more tinfoil hat. They really believe toxins are being sprayed.”

Kennedy has previously promoted debunked chemtrail theories. In May, he was asked on “Dr. Phil Primetime” about chemicals being sprayed into the stratosphere to change the Earth's climate.

“It's done, we think, by DARPA,” Kennedy said, referring to a Department of Defense agency that develops emerging technology for the military's use. “And a lot of it now is coming out of the jet fuel. Those materials are put in jet fuel. I'm going to do everything in my power to stop it. We're bringing on somebody who's going to think only about that.”

DARPA officials didn't return a message seeking comment.

Deploying chemtrails to poison people is just one of many baseless conspiracy theories that have found traction among Trump administration health policy officials led by Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist before entering politics. He continues to promote a supposed link between vaccines and autism, as well as make statements connecting fluoride in drinking water to arthritis, bone fractures, thyroid disease, and cancer. The World Health Organization says fluoride is safe when used as recommended.

Delany, who was ousted in August from HHS, said Kennedy has expressed strong interest in chemtrails.

“This is an issue that really matters to MAHA,” said Delany, referring to the informal movement associated with Kennedy that is composed of people who are skeptical of evidence-based medicine.

The memo also alleges that “suspicious weather events have been occurring and have increased awareness of the issue to the public, some of which have been acknowledged to have been caused by geoengineering activities, such as the flooding in Dubai in 2024.” Geoengineering refers to intentional large-scale efforts to change the climate to counteract global warming.

“It is unconscionable that anyone should be allowed to spray known neurotoxins and environmental toxins over our nation's citizens, their land, food and water supplies,” Delany's memo states.

Scientists, meteorologists, and other branches of the federal government say these assertions are largely incorrect. Some points in the memo are accurate, including concerns that commercial aircraft contribute to acid rain.

But critics say the memo builds on kernels of truth before veering into unscientific fringe theories. Efforts to control the weather are being made, largely by states and local governments seeking to combat droughts, but the results are modest and highly localized. It isn't possible to manipulate large-scale weather events, scientists say.

Severe flooding in the United Arab Emirates in 2024 couldn't have been caused by weather manipulation because no technology could create that kind of rainfall event, Maarten Ambaum, a meteorologist at the University of Reading who studies Gulf region rainfall patterns, said in a statement on the floods. Similar debunked claims emerged this year after central Texas experienced devastating floods.

The Government Accountability Office concluded in a 2024 report that questions remain as to the effectiveness of weather modification.

Research into changing the climate has been conducted, including work by one private company that engaged in field tests. Still, federal agencies say no ongoing or large-scale projects are underway. Study of the concept remains in the research phase. The Environmental Protection Agency says there are no large-scale or government efforts to affect the Earth's climate.

“Solar geoengineering is not occurring via direct delivery by commercial aircraft and is not associated with aviation contrails,” the agency says on its website.

Misperceptions about weather, climate control, and airplane contrails extend beyond the Trump administration, scientists said.

In September, a congressional House committee hearing titled “Playing God With the Weather — A Disastrous Forecast” involved two hours of debate on the once-fringe idea. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who chaired the hearing, has introduced legislation to ban weather and climate control, with a fine of up to $100,000 and up to five years in prison.

Some Democrats objected to the nature of the discussion. Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M., accused Greene of using “the platform of Congress to proffer anti-science theories, to platform climate denialism.”

Frequently citing chemtrails, GOP lawmakers have introduced legislation in about two dozen states to ban weather modification or geoengineering. Florida passed a bill to establish an online portal so residents can report alleged violations.

“The Free State of Florida means freedom from governments or private actors unilaterally applying chemicals or geoengineering to people or public spaces,” GOP Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a press statement this spring.

Meanwhile, the chemtrail conspiracy has permeated popular culture. The title track on singer Lana Del Ray's seventh studio album is entitled “Chemtrails Over the Country Club.” Bill Maher dove into the chemtrail myth on his podcast “Club Random,” saying, “This is nuts. It's just nuts.” And “Chemtrails,” a psychological thriller, wrapped filming in July.

Social media has given wing to the chemtrails concept and other fringe ideas involving public health. They include an outlandish belief that Anthony Fauci, who advised both Trump and President Joe Biden on the government response to the COVID-19 pandemic, created the AIDS epidemic. There is no evidence of such a link, public health leaders say.

Researchers say another false belief by those on the far right holds that people who received COVID vaccines could shed the virus, causing infertility in the unvaccinated. There is no evidence of such a connection, scientists and researchers say.

More severe weather events due to global warming may be driving some of the baseless theories, scientists say. And risks occur when such ideas take hold among the general population or policymakers, some public health leaders say. Climate researchers, including Swain, say they've received death threats.

Lee, the blogger, said he disagrees with some of the more far-fetched beliefs and is aware of the harm they can cause.

“There are people wanting to shoot down planes because they think they are chemtrails,” said Lee, adding that some believers are afraid to venture outside when plane vapor trails are visible overhead.

“

There are people wanting to shoot down planes because they think they are chemtrails.” — Jim Lee, a blogger focused on weather and climate, who added that some believers are afraid to venture outside when plane vapor trails are visible overhead

There is also no evidence that plane contrails cause health problems or are related to intentional efforts to control the climate, according to the EPA and other scientists.

The memo and focus at HHS on climate and weather control are alarming because they perpetuate conspiracies, said David Keith, a professor of geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago.

“It's unmoored to reality,” he said. “I expected there were documents like this, but seeing it in print is nevertheless shocking. Our government is being driven by nonsensical dreck from dark corners of social media.”

On the night of August 14, the quiet farming town of Candioti in Argentina's Santa Fe province was shaken by a mysterious event. Around 10 PM, residents reported seeing strange white lights with violet flashes hovering above a nearby field.

Mayor Sergio Oreggioni alerted the police, and a deputy inspector was sent to investigate. On his way, a farm caretaker told him that the animals were acting wildly.

When the officer arrived, he saw cows circling the light as if hypnotised. Horses were panicking and crashing into fences. The glowing object stayed still for a few minutes before disappearing without a sound or a trace.

The animals immediately calmed down, and no damage was found. The police filed a report, but two months later, the case was sealed by national security authorities. Locals are puzzled. That silent, eerie night has now turned into a lasting mystery in Candioti.

After the mysterious light sighting in Candioti, police filed a routine report. However, the story quickly spread across the town.

Researcher Andrea Perez Simondini, head of CEFORA (the Argentine Commission for the Study of UFO Phenomena), formally requested access to the police report.

His request was justified under Argentina's Access to Information Law. To everyone's surprise, the provincial authorities denied the request. The case was classified for “public and national security” reasons, they said while citing three national and provincial security laws.

“The information cannot be provided because it falls within the exceptions provided for reasons of public and national security,” the authorities said.

This rare refusal turned a simple rural mystery into a state secret. The event added to a growing list of unexplained lights in north-central Santa Fe, often seen near farming areas.

However, what makes this case stand out is the sealed document. The internal investigation is ongoing. Also, there is a growing belief among residents that something extraordinary happened that night.

In February 2024, an elderly couple from Argentina claimed to have captured photos of a UFO while on holiday near San Pedro de Colalao. Rina Juarez, 76, and her husband Rene were taking pictures of white birds when they spotted an oval-shaped object flying near power lines before it rose higher into the sky.

At first, Rina thought it was a black bird. But, her husband said it looked like a flying saucer. Their grandchildren were amazed by the photos, and Rina told Jam Press, “You had to see it to believe it.”

There is a new way to see where and how often immigration enforcement is happening in Florida.

The state has launched an online dashboard that tracks encounters and arrests involving suspected immigrants lacking permanent legal status by agency and location. As of Oct. 24, the dashboard shows 5,966 encounters statewide in the last 90 days and 4,805 arrests. The figures update regularly. 

Your neighborhood: Local coverage from WPBF 25 News

Martin County is high on the list. 

According to the dashboard's county-by-county breakdown, the Martin County Sheriff's Office recorded 427 encounters in the past 90 days, ranking third among reporting agencies. 

Ahead of Martin County are the Polk County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.

The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office lists 86 encounters. 

Jupiter Island police note 11 encounters.

The town of Jupiter reports five.

The Okeechobee County sheriff's office and police department report five. 

The dashboard also shows the countries of origin for people encountered and a timeline of when arrests occurred, offering a broader picture of statewide enforcement patterns. 

State officials publicized the tool earlier this month as part of a push to make immigration enforcement data more accessible. Independent coverage has noted the launch and explained what the dashboard measures and how to read it.

Just in time for Halloween, HBO presents a prequel to Stephen King‘s horror classic It with Welcome to Derry. AMC expands the Anne Rice universe with Talamasca: The Secret Order. Jeremy Renner returns for a fourth season, with Edie Falco signing on as the prison's new warden. A true-crime documentary features audio recordings left by convicted serial killer Albert DeSalvo, the Boston Strangler.

SUNDAY: They're not clowning around with this prequel to the hit It franchise, derived from Stephen King's massive novel that spawned a memorable 1990 miniseries and two blockbuster movies in 2017 and 2019. Set in 1962, with nuclear-war fears and civil-rights social turbulence as context, the series from It feature-film director Andy Muschietti sets an ancient evil loose on the otherwise quaint Maine town, terrorizing the kids most susceptible to succumbing to primal fears. The military also has a stake in figuring out just what it is that's lurking in the woods and, inevitably, the sewers. The series bides its not-so-sweet time in revealing the dreaded clown Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård reprising his movie role), but until then, terror takes many grisly shapes and gruesome forms. Beware those red balloons. (See the full review.)

SUNDAY: If your tastes lean more toward the late Anne Rice's supernatural universe, AMC offers an original thriller built around the clandestine, centuries-old agency that tracks and tries to control the antics of vampires, witches, and other ghouls. Nicholas Denton stars as Guy Anatole, a young law-school grad recruited by the mysterious Helen (Elizabeth McGovern) to join the shadowy group, then sent to London on an off-the-books mission. No one's exactly who they seem to be in this twisty tale — except for devious vampire Jasper (the terrific William Fichtner), who's commandeered the London “motherhouse” HQ for his own purposes. He's the undead life of the party, proving once again that in Rice's world, vampires have more fun.

SUNDAY: Mike McLusky (Jeremy Renner) is used to running the show in Kingstown, a Michigan prison town that's the setting for Taylor Sheridan and Hugh Dillon‘s grim drama. A broker between cops and criminals, currently working both sides of a gang war, Mike faces perhaps his greatest challenge in the Season 4 premiere when a new boss arrives at the prison: The Sopranos‘ Edie Falco as Nina Hobbs, the tough new warden.

SUNDAY: Controversy continues to swirl regarding the crimes allegedly committed by Albert DeSalvo, who confessed to being the “Boston Strangler” responsible for at least 11 murders of women in the Boston area in the early 1960s. A two-hour documentary features excerpts from 16 hours of DeSalvo's audio tapes, which contradict some aspects of the official accounts, raising more questions about his true culpability. DeSalvo reportedly was preparing to recant his confession when he was stabbed and killed in prison in 1973. Will the truth ever be known?

The Heist: The Louvre's Stolen Crown Jewels (Sunday, 8/7c, CNN): CNN's FlashDocs unit delivers an hour-long special with new reporting on the brazen daylight theft last weekend of valuable Napoleonic jewels from the Louvre museum in Paris. The special explores the shocking robbery, which took less than eight minutes, with thieves disguised as construction workers as they raided the Galerie d'Apollon. The report also examines the vulnerabilities of one of the world's most iconic art institutions.

Countless online investigators are convinced a mysterious US mountain allegedly harbors a secret extraterrestrial base.

With its frozen wilderness, Alaska's massive Mount Hayes towers 8,000 feet high and stands as one of the nation's largest peaks.

At first glance, nothing would seem extraordinary about it.

However, the mountain has been the focus of several alien conspiracy theories for years due to alleged UFO encounters in the area.

These assertions have generated enough fascination for Apple TV to broadcast a limited series about it called The Secrets of Mount Hayes.



YouTube also streamed a brief documentary produced by the Travel Channel, titled 'Searching for UFO's Beneath Mount Hayes', reports the Daily Star.

A preview for the series opens with an interview featuring Jonny Enoch, a self-proclaimed Paranormal Researcher, who said, "In my opinion there are unpredictable, dangerous forces at work here."

According to LadBible, the mystery originates from historical CIA files that suggested aliens might be running concealed facilities on Earth, including deep beneath the ocean and within isolated mountain chains.

They were allegedly made public through the US Freedom of Information Act.

Mount Hayes was listed among them, alongside Monte Perdido in Spain and submerged locations off Puerto Rico's coast and near the Bahamas.

One document was labeled Description of Personnel Associated ET Bases, identifying the summit as the "primary base" utilized by extraterrestrials.

The location has allegedly also witnessed some peculiar UFO encounters, with observers documenting unexplained craft displaying unusual behavior.

This occurred throughout the 1970s and 80s, an era when the CIA conducted tests with individuals who claimed they possessed the ability to gather intelligence about remote locations.

It formed part of the CIA's STARGATE initiative, during a period when the US was engaged in a Cold War space competition with the Soviet Union.

The document notes that one individual questioned claimed they could remotely observe an "entity" possessing a "very large, round-shaped head" and a "very unhuman appearance."

The encounter was also characterized as "very pale" with a "sharp nose". However, there is allegedly no documentation of this individual undergoing drug screening.

As outlandish as these assertions appear, they continue to captivate UFO enthusiasts.

The verified History Channel, boasting 14.5million followers, posted one clip titled 'CIA Analyst Discovers UFO Base in Alaska.' Currently, it has accumulated 610,000 views.

Another clip, labeled 'Does Mount Hayes hold the dark secret to thousands of disappearances?' garnered 123,000 views.

Is it just a comet, or is it an alien 'mothership' using the Sun as a hiding spot? That is the provocative question surrounding interstellar object 3I/ATLAS.

The mysterious visitor from another star system is set to reach its perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, on 29 October. It just passed its solar conjunction, placing it on the exact opposite side of the Sun from Earth, conveniently out of sight.

While most scientists have gathered significant evidence that 3I/ATLAS is an unusual comet made of carbon dioxide ice, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb is holding fast to a more sensational theory. He has not given up his suspicion that it is an enormous spacecraft, sent to us by an intelligent extraterrestrial civilisation.

Now, Loeb has sharpened his criticism of the official narrative, accusing NASA of deliberately 'burying the evidence' while praising European counterparts for greater transparency.

Loeb has repeatedly pointed out all of the object's 'anomalies', from its enormous suspected size to its unusual trajectory that took it suspiciously close to Mars earlier this month.

In a new blog post, Loeb suggested that if 3I/ATLAS were a spacecraft, it might use its proximity to the Sun's powerful gravitational pull to either accelerate or slow itself down, all while conveniently hidden behind our star.

'If you want to take a vacation, take it before [October 29], because who knows what will happen?', Loeb told science communicator and author Mayim Bialik in a September interview.

Loeb pointed to one of the most important dynamics in space travel to support his theory that 3I/ATLAS, if it is indeed a spacecraft, may use its perihelion to boost its velocity.

'As a result of this so-called Oberth effect, it is most energy-efficient for a spacecraft engine to burn its fuel when its orbital velocity is greatest', Loeb explained, referring to a physics principle which determines that a rocket engine generates more energy when it is fired at a higher speed.

The astronomer reiterated his hypothesis that the object may release smaller probes to get a better understanding of our neighbourhood.

'If 3I/ATLAS is a massive mothership, it will likely continue along its original gravitational path and ultimately exit the Solar system', he added. 'In that case, the Oberth manoeuvre might apply to the mini-probes it releases at perihelion towards Solar system planets.'

According to Loeb, the 'optimal time' to adjust its velocity is its perihelion next week. However, to him, the timing raises even more tantalising questions.

'This opportune time happens to be during the same period when it is hidden from view to Earth-based telescopes', he posited. 'Was this a mere coincidence or a result of orbital design and basic astronautics?'

Loeb's hypothesis has prompted plenty of scepticism. Members of the scientific community have repeatedly pushed back. 'It looks like a comet,' Tom Statler, NASA's lead scientist for solar system small bodies, told The Guardian last month. 'It does comet things.'

However, Loeb has directly accused NASA of mishandling crucial data and downplaying anomalies. He has repeatedly criticised the agency for failing to release high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, suggesting they are deliberately withholding evidence that might contradict the 'comet' narrative.

In contrast, Loeb has praised European efforts. Following unverified leaks from a purported European Space Agency (ESA) insider suggesting the object emitted an 'engine-like sound,' Loeb commented that while the leak itself was unconfirmed, it reflected what he saw as a generally 'more honest' and open approach from ESA regarding potentially anomalous findings compared to NASA's perceived tendency to 'bury the evidence.'

He sees NASA's stance as overly conservative and dismissive of possibilities outside the mainstream.

However, while even Loeb recently admitted that there's only a slim chance that 3I/ATLAS was technological in origin, the astronomer isn't giving up hope.

'Science is guided by evidence and not by expectations,' he wrote in his latest blog. 'We can find the answer to the above question by monitoring the sky during November and December 2025, and searching for any unusual activity of 3I/ATLAS or any new objects that came out of it.'

'As of now, 3I/ATLAS appears most likely to be a natural comet,' Loeb added. 'But the remote possibility of an Oberth manoeuvre must be considered seriously as a black swan event with a small probability, because of its huge implications for humanity'.'

While the scientific consensus overwhelmingly points to 3I/ATLAS being a fascinating but natural comet, Avi Loeb's 'black swan' theory, now coupled with direct accusations against NASA, serves as a powerful reminder of what's at stake. The chance might be small, but the implications would be universe-altering. All we can do now is wait and watch.

Panic grips social media as whispers of an 'alien invasion 2025' spread, triggered by telescope images capturing a colossal 'giant jet' erupting from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS toward the Sun, fuelling wild theories of extraterrestrial probes amid its perihelion approach.

Discovered on 1 July 2025 by NASA's ATLAS telescope in Chile, this third interstellar visitor—racing at 58 km/s from the Milky Way's edge—has astronomers buzzing with NASA Hubble images revealing a fan-shaped plume of gas and dust stretching 10,000 km, while Harvard's Avi Loeb warns of a potential 'black swan event' with 30-40% odds of alien tech.

Astronomers spotted 3I/ATLAS, also C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), on 1 July 2025 via the ATLAS survey at Río Hurtado, Chile, when it glowed at magnitude 18, 3.50 AU from Earth and 4.51 AU from the Sun, hurtling at 61 km/s near Serpens Cauda and Sagittarius.

Confirmed as the third interstellar object after 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, its hyperbolic orbit—eccentricity 6.1374—proves unbound origins beyond our solar system, with excess velocity 58 km/s exceeding predecessors. Precovery images trace back to 7 May 2025 via NASA's TESS, revealing early activity at 6.4 AU, while Hubble's 21 July 2025 snapshot pegged the nucleus at 0.32–5.6 km wide, the largest such wanderer yet.

James Webb Space Telescope observations on 6 August 2025 detected CO2 at 129 kg/s and water at 6.6 kg/s, marking it CO2-rich and reddish from tholins, hinting at 7.6–14 billion-year age from the Milky Way's thick disk.

This galactic origins tale captivates, as 3I/ATLAS—potentially older than our Sun—nears perihelion on 29 October 2025 at 1.3561 AU, promising peak emissions for study. Amateur spotters hail its coma growth from 13,040 km on 21 June 2025 to 26,400 km by 2 July 2025, underscoring rapid activation en route.

Teide Observatory's composite image, released on 15 October 2025 via The Astronomer's Telegram, portrays 3I/ATLAS's dark nucleus amid a luminous coma, with a vivid purple fan-shaped jet propelling sunward over 10,000 km from sublimating ices.

Primarily dust and carbon dioxide, this comet jet eruption arises from asymmetric solar warming: the sunlit surface heats rapidly, vaporising volatile pockets into geyser bursts that fan out with rotation, some bolstering the coma while others form the anti-solar tail under solar wind influence.

Astrophysicist Miquel Serra-Ricart from Teide's Light Bridges stated, 'This is the usual. Jets are pointing to [the] sunward direction and [the] comet's tail in the anti-solar direction,' comparing the structure to Hubble's 2020 NEOWISE jet views.

Very Large Telescope spectra from July to August 2025 detected elevated cyanide and nickel emissions—without iron—mirroring solar system comets, while James Clerk Maxwell Telescope readings on 14 September 2025 quantified HCN at (4.5 ±1.9) ×10^25 molecules/s.

Harvard's Avi Loeb amplifies extraterrestrial speculation, positing a 30-40% likelihood that 3I/ATLAS conceals alien technology based on anomalies like its 5-11 km scale, 68 km/s velocity, and nickel alloy plumes unseen in nature, potentially a 'Trojan horse' leveraging solar gravity for manoeuvre.

In his 24 August 2025 analysis, Loeb wrote, 'The team of NASA's SPHEREx space observatory just reported tantalizing new data on the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS,' highlighting its mass and CO2 traits as red flags for artificial origins with profound human implications.

He advocates intensified International Asteroid Warning Network monitoring through January 2026, post its safe 19 December 2025 Earth approach at over 1.8 AU—more than 240 million km distant, per NASA assessments.

Countering this, Michigan State's Darryl Seligman emphasises, 'This is only the third such interstellar comet we've ever been able to study, and planetary scientists are super excited to learn about what comets in other solar systems are like,' chalking jets to perihelion-induced ice activation for compositional insights.

Consensus holds: JWST and VLT data affirm natural comet traits, no threats, as Billy Carson posted on X, sharing Gemini North's jet image amid the buzz.
