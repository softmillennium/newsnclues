When Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stormed through Santa Ana, California, in June, panicked calls flooded into the city's emergency response system. Recordings of those calls, obtained by ProPublica, captured some of the terror residents felt as they watched masked men ambush people and force them into unmarked cars. In some cases, the men wore plain clothes and refused to identify themselves. There was no way to confirm whether they were immigration agents or imposters. In six of the calls to Santa Ana police, residents described what they were seeing as kidnappings. One woman's voice shook as she asked, “What kind of police go around without license plates?” During a tense public meeting days later, Mayor Valerie Amezcua and the City Council asked their police chief whether there was anything they could do to rein in the federal agents — even if only to ban the use of masks. Plus, filing complaints with the Department of Homeland Security was likely to go nowhere because the office that once handled them had been dismantled. There was little chance of holding individual agents accountable for alleged abuses because, among other hurdles, there was no way to reliably learn their identities. Since then, Amezcua, 58, said she has reluctantly accepted the reality: There are virtually no limits on what federal agents can do to achieve President Donald Trump's goal of mass deportations. Current and former national security officials share the mayor's concerns. ICE, in their view, has become an unfettered and unaccountable national police force. Trump's DHS appointees swiftly dismantled civil rights guardrails, encouraged agents to wear masks, threatened groups and state governments that stood in their way, and then made so many arrests that the influx overwhelmed lawyers trying to defend immigrants taken out of state or out of the country. One former senior DHS official who was involved in oversight said that what is happening on American streets today “gives me goosebumps.” Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, the official rattled off scenes that once would've triggered investigations: “Accosting people outside of their immigration court hearings where they're showing up and trying to do the right thing and then hauling them off to an immigration jail in the middle of the country where they can't access loved ones or speak to counsel. “We're at an inflection point in history right now and it's frightening.” Although ICE is conducting itself out in the open, even inviting conservative social media influencers to accompany its agents on high-profile raids, the agency operates in darkness. The identities of DHS officers, their salaries and their operations have long been withheld for security reasons and generally exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The CRCL office had limited powers; former staffers say their job was to protect DHS by ensuring personnel followed the law and addressed civil rights concerns. Still, it was effective in stalling rushed deportations or ensuring detainees had access to phones and lawyers. Former staffers said around 600 complaints were open when work was suspended. What's left of it was led, at least for a while, by a 29-year-old White House appointee who helped craft Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint that broadly calls for the curtailment of civil rights enforcement. On top of its annual operating budget of $10 billion a year, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill included an added $7.5 billion a year for the next four years for recruiting and retention alone. Michelle Brané, a longtime human rights attorney who directed DHS' ombudsman office during the Biden administration, said Trump's adherence to “the authoritarian playbook is not even subtle.” Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, refuted descriptions of ICE as a secret police force. She called such comparisons the kind of “smears and demonization” that led to the recent attack on an ICE facility in Texas, in which a gunman targeted an ICE transport van and shot three detained migrants, two of them fatally, before killing himself. In a written response to ProPublica, McLaughlin dismissed the current and former national security officials and scholars interviewed by ProPublica as “far-left champagne socialists” who haven't seen ICE enforcement up close. “If they had,” she wrote, “they would know when our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs” and other criminals. She wrote that the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is ready for 11,000 new hires by the beginning of next year and that training has been streamlined and boosted by technology. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson also praised ICE conduct and accused Democrats of making “dangerous, untrue smears.” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the Trump pick who fired nearly the entire civil rights oversight staff, said the move was in response to CRCL functioning “as internal adversaries that slow down operations,” according to a DHS spokesperson. The office was resurrected after a lawsuit and court order, though it's sparsely staffed. “We might've thought that we were going to see a slide, but I don't think anybody anticipated how quickly it would transpire, and now people at all levels are scrambling to figure out how to push back.” Frantz and other scholars who study anti-democratic political systems in other countries said there are numerous examples in which ICE's activities appear cut from an authoritarian playbook. “The thing that got me into the topic of ‘maybe ICE is a secret police force'?” said Lee Morgenbesser, an Australian political science professor who studies authoritarianism. Morgenbesser was also struck by the high-profile instances of ICE detaining elected officials who attempted to stand in their way. Among them, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was detained for demanding a judicial warrant from ICE, and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a DHS press conference. And David Sklansky, a Stanford Law School professor who researches policing and democracy, said it appears that ICE's agents are allowed to operate with complete anonymity. “It's not just that people can't see faces of the officers,” Sklansky said. “The officers aren't wearing shoulder insignia or name tags.” U.S. District Judge William G. Young, a Ronald Reagan appointee, recently pointed out that use of masked law enforcement officers had long been considered anathema to American ideals. In a blistering ruling against the administration's arrests of pro-Palestinian protesters, he wrote, “To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.” The Trump administration has said it will appeal that ruling. The fallout is being felt in places like Hays County, Texas, not far from Austin, where ICE apprehended 47 people, including nine children, during a birthday celebration in the early morning of April 1. “We're not told why they took them, and we're not told where they took them,” said County Judge Ruben Becerra, a Democrat. The Texas Department of Public Safety did not respond to a request for comment. The Trump administration has yet to produce evidence supporting claims of gang involvement, said Karen Muñoz, a civil rights attorney helping families track down their relatives who were jailed or deported. “There's no evidence released at all that any person kidnapped at that party was a member of any organized criminal group,” Muñoz said. Raids of car washes and apartment buildings continue, but the community has started to “push back,” Amezcua said. On at least one occasion in nearby Downey, a citizen's intervention had some effect. The commotion was around the corner in Rivas' hometown, a Los Angeles suburb locals call “Mexican Beverly Hills” for its stately houses and affluent Hispanic families. Rivas, 31, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, belongs to Facebook groups where residents share updates about cultural festivals, church programs and, these days, the presence of Trump's deportation foot soldiers. She and her co-worker rushed toward the sound of screaming at a nearby intersection. Rivas hit “record” on her phone as a semicircle of trucks and vans came into view. Her unease deepened as she registered details that “didn't seem right,” Rivas recalled in an interview. She said the parked vans had out-of-state plates or no tags. The armed men wore only generic “police” patches, and most were in street clothes. “When is it that we just decided to do things a different way?

Immigration and Customs Enforcement has inked a new $5.7 million contract for AI-driven social media surveillance software, according to federal procurement records reviewed by The Lever. The five-year contract with government technology middleman Carahsoft Technology, made public in September, provides Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) licenses for a product called Zignal Labs, a social media monitoring platform used by the Israeli military and the Pentagon. An informational pamphlet marked confidential but publicly available online advertises that Zignal Labs “leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning” to analyze over 8 billion social media posts per day, providing “curated detection feeds” for its clients. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. The licenses will be provided to Homeland Security Investigations, ICE's intelligence unit, to provide “real-time data analysis for criminal investigations,” per the disclosure. These tools pose a particular threat as ICE, under the Trump administration, appears to be increasingly using social media to direct its immigration enforcement strategy. Several pro-Palestinian activists, including Mahmoud Khalil, were targeted and jailed by immigration authorities after being doxed online by right-wing, pro-Israel blacklist websites like Canary Mission. Just this week, immigration agents raided street vendors in New York City after a right-wing influencer posted a video of the block online, demanding action by authorities. Last week, a group of labor unions sued over the federal government's growing use of social media surveillance to target immigrants for their political speech, calling it a “mass, viewpoint-driven surveillance program.” And there are indications that ICE intends to further expand its social media surveillance capabilities. As Wired reported earlier this month, ICE has plans to develop a round-the-clock social media monitoring team to identify leads for immigration enforcers. Advocates told The Lever that ICE's purchase of Zignal Labs licenses, like its other uses of digital surveillance tech, raises civil liberty concerns. “And agencies certainly shouldn't be deploying this kind of black box technology in secret without any accountability.” Zignal Labs did not return a request for comment about its work with Israeli forces or its new contract with ICE. The unions' lawsuit over the Trump administration's use of social media surveillance details the myriad digital surveillance tools that ICE already has at its disposal, including ShadowDragon, a software that uses publicly available websites to map out an individual's online activity, and Babel X, which links social media profiles and location information to a target's Social Security number. “We've been seeing an uptick in ICE surveillance contracts,” said Julie Mao, an attorney with Just Futures Law, a legal advocacy group that closely monitors ICE's surveillance regime. This week, ICE signed a $7 million contract with the firm SOS International LLC, for “skip tracing services,” a term that refers to tracking a person's whereabouts, per federal procurement records reviewed by The Lever. The multimillion-dollar contract comes just three months after SOS International LLC, which also does business as SOSi, announced that the company had hired Andre Watson, an ICE Homeland Security Investigations intelligence chief, to “expand [the company's] business and deliver capabilities to state and federal law enforcement agencies.” Many of these services tout that their surveillance capabilities are enhanced by artificial intelligence, including Zignal. In a July post announcing the latter company's partnership with Carahsoft Technology, Zignal's CEO boasted that the latest iteration of the software used AI to scour global digital data, “helping defense and intelligence teams detect and respond to threats with greater clarity and speed.” Two months after this announcement, ICE signed its new contract with Carahsoft for Zignal licenses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reclusive Republican billionaire is descendant of gilded age industrialist and former treasury secretary Andrew Mellon A reclusive billionaire, anti-tax crusader and major financial backer of Donald Trump has been named as the anonymous private donor who gave $130m to the government to help pay US troops during the federal shutdown that is now in its fourth week, according to the New York Times. Timothy Mellon, heir to the gilded age industrialist and former treasury secretary Andrew Mellon, is the secret donor whom Trump has described as a “friend”, “great American” and “patriot”, but has refused to name, the Times reported on Saturday, citing two anonymous sources familiar with the arrangement. “He prefers that his name not be mentioned, which is pretty unusual in the world I come from, and in the world of politics, you want your name mentioned.” Still, the donation, which equates to about $100 per service member, appears to be a potential violation of the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending funds in advance or in excess of congressional appropriations – and from accepting voluntary services “except in the case of emergency involving the safety of human life or the protection of property”. Potential penalties for violations include both administrative and criminal sanctions such as suspension or removal from duty, fines and imprisonment. Mellon, 80, pumped over $165m to back Trump, Robert F Kennedy and other Republican candidates during the 2024 election cycle, making him the top donor fueling outside spending groups last year, according to the campaign finance watchdog OpenSecrets. Mellon has also given money to Kennedy's anti-vaccine group, Children's Health Defense. In 2021, the Texas Tribune reported that Mellon had donated $53m to Texas governor Greg Abbott's fund to build a wall on the state's border with Mexico. Mellon's wealth and anti-tax leanings can be traced back to his industrialist grandfather, who made his money in banking and investments in startups before serving as treasury secretary from 1921 to 1932. Timothy Mellon's individual wealth is unclear, with reported estimates ranging from $700m to $4bn.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's Mirotvorets (or Peacekeeper) extremist website has added 25 more children born in 2022 and 2023 to its database, according to the website's data, which was reviewed by TASS. The children are accused of "deliberately violating the state border" and "attempting to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity" of Ukraine. Overall, the website has added data on approximately 100 two-and three-year-old children this week. The Mirotvorets database previously included minors aged 2 to 17. In 2021, Faina Savenkova, a writer from the Lugansk People's Republic who was 12 years old at the time, was added to the list. The website's administrators claimed that the girl was "participating in anti-Ukrainian propaganda activities." Savenkova believes that "the publication of children's personal information on such websites is a violation of children's rights." Rodion Miroshnik, the Russian Foreign Ministry's ambassador-at-large tasked with overseeing the Kiev regime's crimes, told TASS earlier that the publication of the personal data of minors on such websites made it clear that the terrorist regime's militants were ready to do away with Russian children. The infamous Mirotvorets website was launched in 2014 to identify individuals allegedly posing a threat to Ukraine's national security and publish their personal data. Over the years, it has collected the personal information of journalists, artists, and politicians who visited Crimea and Donbass or drew criticism from the site's administrators for other reasons.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial intelligence is running up against hardware barriers in rendering Ukraine's drone swarms autonomous. Ukraine's drones are setting new standards for self-piloting on the battlefield. Full autonomy, however, remains well out of reach — and is likely to stay there. The broader vision of drones operating fully independently of pilots remains something of a holy grail for drone developers, even as it may seem a dystopian nightmare to many human rights activists and luminaries, including the pope himself. Ukrainian developers hope that progressively delegating more tasks to drones and software can free up pilots and their attention spans, which, in turn, can compensate for the lack of manpower relative to Russia, which is typically pegged at a ratio of about 3-to-1. Artificial intelligence (AI) is often mentioned alongside autonomy to the point that in Ukrainian weapons circles, the terms are often used interchangeably. But AI technologies and their underlying neural networks remain far from capable of making choices on the Ukrainian battlefield. “We're not going along the route of that full autonomy,” Andriy Chulyk, a co-founder of Sine Engineering, which makes drone guidance modules and software, told the Kyiv Independent. “Tesla, for example, having enormous, colossal resources, has been working on self-driving for ten years and — unfortunately — they still haven't made a product that a person can be sure of.” Beyond the moral hazards of giving any computer a license to kill, drones face a major barrier in terms of what they can carry. When it comes to consumer-facing AI applications like ChatGPT, cloud computing hides AI's insatiable appetite for computing power in distant data centers. “(AI) is in use virtually everywhere, but you have to take into account that it can make mistakes,” as Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi told RBC-Ukraine in August. One of the most promising of these applications is in interceptor drones, which aim to strike down fast-moving Russian Shahed-type drones as they criss-cross Ukraine. Given Ukraine's size and the speed of newer jet-powered Shaheds, interceptors need to be ready across a vast territory, while taking as few operators as possible. “It's just execution, where AI can be way, way more efficient than a human, because the Russians are installing these avoidance systems, and they're starting to maneuver, and it's in the air, so it will be easier for software to react on that, to adjust the flight of the interceptor, rather than relying on connection, latency, and taking into account all the factors that operator cannot feel, like wind gusts, et cetera, et cetera.” Interceptors “still rely on FPV technology,” Yaroslav Azhnyuk, founder and CEO of two companies, the Fourth Law and Odd Systems, told the Kyiv Independent. Odd Systems started off as a mass FPV producer, though it's currently testing anti-Shahed-type drone interceptors. The Fourth Law, meanwhile, produces small and cheap — roughly $70 — AI vision modules for FPVs. “The difference between most Ukrainian interceptors and, say, Merops produced by Eric Schmidt's company, is that Ukrainian solutions currently lack the AI part of it.” When it comes to FPVs, AI is fairly standard issue, largely in the form of “last-mile targeting,” which allows a pilot to select whatever object on the screen they want the drone to head towards — maybe a soldier, maybe a bunker, maybe an S-300 — while they still have a video linkage. Last-mile targeting in Ukraine's FPV drones was a big step in circumventing Russian radio-frequency jammers, but it has remained the province of fairly simple machine vision software for over a year. In other words, it's not exactly a technological revolution. Azhnyuk has not given up on full autonomy as a way of multiplying Ukrainian FPV forces “by a factor of 100.” But for the time being, the Fourth Law's impact has been primarily in streamlining the necessary neural networks to, for example, hold last-mile targeting even on Russian vehicles driving through shadows or soldiers hiding in tree cover. He touts preliminary results of one brigade using his products, which he said have boosted the rate at which drones hit their end targets from 20% to 80%. Among the biggest changes in his AI is the ability to recognize a target as it passes through shadows or treelines, rather than locking on to a set of pixels that such distortions to the visual field camouflage. Speaking with the Kyiv Independent, Azhnyuk says that full autonomy in one-off demos would already be feasible, but “massive deployment” is a whole different challenge, one that's nowhere in sight. Among the most obvious use cases for autonomy in drones is missions that go far beyond the distance at which a drone can maintain radio contact with its operator — particularly with cheaper kamikaze drones on which it's not worth mounting, for example, a Starlink. Deep strikes, however, are an illustrative example, as there is no chance Ukraine will let its deep-strike drones do their own target selection any time soon. A recent partnership between US-originated Shield AI and Ukrainian Iron Belly is illustrative of the future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Experts say there has been an 80% drop-off since serial killing peaked in the US in the 1970s – but that hasn't stopped social media speculation For the past two years, rumors of a serial killer have preoccupied residents of Austin, Texas, and beyond as body upon body kept turning up at a lake in the city. But will that be enough to put the rumors to bed, or does the broader American fascination – both in fact and in fiction – with macabre mass killers mean that facts and truth have little say in the matter? The report by Texas State University researchers in collaboration with the Austin police department that reviewed 189 cases over a 20-year period found no evidence of a serial murderer, no pattern of clustering or hotspots of similar criminal activity. “While social media speculation has suggested otherwise, the independent academic study supports the findings of APD investigations and confirms that Austin is not facing a serial killer,” the Austin police department said in statement. The study found that men are more likely to drown than women, and that could explain why more men than women were drowning in Lady Bird Lake. He told a local news outlet that social media has been “propagating something that's sensational to get a few more clicks”. “Let's not spend money and time chasing phantom serial killers,” he added. The Massachusetts state police have said there is no evidence to suggest a serial killer. Fox estimates there has been an 80% drop-off since serial killing peaked in the 1970s. At that time there were nearly 300 known active serial killers in the US. In the 2010s, there were fewer than 50 known active killers. Fox points to several factors that might collectively suggest why the numbers have fallen so dramatically. The same can be said for motorists accepting help with a flat tire, leading to a serial killer in Indiana being dubbed “The Flat Tire Killer”. Kohberger, while not strictly a serial killer, studied under DeSales university forensic psychology professor Katherine Ramsland. “Advances in DNA technology have given authorities the ability to identify killers before they assemble large body counts,” Fox says, adding that cameras, cross-jurisdiction law enforcement agency communication, and reduced street prostitution have helped to reduce opportunities for serial killers. Thus Kohberger – who killed four students in a single house in Moscow, Idaho – was caught before he could commit a second crime. Fox, who manages the Associated Press/USA Today/Northeastern University Mass Killing Database, also points out that in the 1970s there weren't so many outlets for sexual sadists to satisfy their urges. Accused Long Island serial killer Rex Heuermann, who faces trial on charges of murdering seven women next year, has already had two documentaries made about his alleged crimes. The Netflix murder series “Monster”, has looked at Dahmer and Ed Gein, the Butcher of Plainfield, who inspired Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. “It's the killers of yesteryear that are entertaining to people,” says Fox. So many, in fact, that two killers in California that were named Freeway Killer One and Freeway Killer Two.” Horrifically, the decline in serial killers has coincided with the rise of something equally horrifying and maybe even more of a threat: mass shooters, especially in schools. “Because of their bizarre and extreme nature, serial killers inspired attention but not necessarily fear, except in a particular community,” Fox argues. So now we have Americans avoiding certain places because they don't want to get caught up so it's a different kind of thing.” In a new book, The Monsters We Make, published next week, journalist Rachel Corbett threads together her own family's experience with murder with a study of criminal profiling, a pursuit that's more art than science. They are terrifying because they break down the boundaries between what we consider human and inhuman, and warn us of what we could become.” The need to create monsters where they may not exist, including the Austin, Massachusetts and Brooklyn scares, confronts a reality identified by Fox that the serial killer era, such as it ever was, has been supplanted. “Now we're catching old serial killers but the new ones are doing one-off murders here and there.” Corbett point out that the stories do serve a purpose.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has prepared new sanctions against Russia, Reuters reported on Oct. 25, citing an unnamed U.S. official and another person familiar with the matter. The sanctions could reportedly be imposed if Russian President Vladimir Putin shows no interest in meaningful negotiations and continues to delay ending Russia's war in Ukraine. Trump announced his administration's first sanctions against Moscow since taking office on Oct. 22, targeting Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, and their subsidiaries. Ukrainian officials also reportedly proposed new sanctions to Washington last week. Two sources told Reuters that U.S. officials have informed Europe that they support the EU's plan to use Russian frozen assets to buy American weapons for Kyiv, as requested by Ukraine. The EU froze about $300 billion of Russia's central bank's foreign reserves in February 2022 as part of its third sanctions package, prohibiting all transactions related to their management. Belgium, where the majority of frozen funds is parked, put the brakes on swift progress on the use of frozen Russian assets, warning that its demands related to legal worries would first need to be met.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov earlier reiterated that Russia's stance on ending hostilities along the current front lines, which Washington and Ukraine support, "has not changed." Following Trump's sanctions, India's biggest refineries are expected to reduce purchases from Rosneft and Lukoil to virtually zero, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed executives at Indian oil companies. Chinese state-owned oil companies have also suspended purchases of seaborne Russian crude following the sanctions, amid fears of potential secondary sanctions, according to Reuters. Tim Zadorozhnyy is a reporter at The Kyiv Independent, covering foreign policy, U.S.-Ukraine relations, and political developments across Europe and Russia. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa, working there for two years from the start of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. The sanctions could be imposed if Russian President Vladimir Putin shows no interest in meaningful negotiations and continues to delay ending Russia's war in Ukraine, Reuters reported. Russia launched nine Iskander-M ballistic missiles from Rostov and Kursk oblasts overnight, along with 62 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones, according to Ukraine's Air Force. The claim contradicts Moscow's actual negotiating stance, as Russia continues to reject any compromise and insists on its maximalist demands. Lithuanian Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene said a large group of "smuggling balloons" was launched from Belarus toward Lithuania. So what do the two camps stand for?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tapping Russia's frozen central-bank assets would likely prolong the Ukraine conflict via further weapon supplies rather than help rebuild the country, according to Belgian Defense Minister Theo Francken. The comment came shortly after Belgium Prime Minister Bart De Wever opposed the so-called “reparations loan” scheme under which the EU was planning to raise around €140 billion ($160 billion) to fund Ukraine using Russia's assets as collateral. The plan entails Moscow eventually paying reparations to Ukraine as part of a peace settlement. “Of course, this money will not rebuild Ukraine but will continue the war,” Francken said in a post on X on Friday, adding that war is extremely costly. The minister warned that many EU leaders, led by the bloc's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, “want to give these assets to Ukraine through a legally questionable structure.” He emphasized that “even during the Second World War, such a dubious confiscation was never carried out.” Francken reiterated that the EU proposal undermines trust in institutions such as Euroclear. He also warned that Russia could retaliate by seizing €200 billion ($172 billion) in Western assets, including both movable and immovable property, held in Russia by Belgium and countries such as the US, Germany, and France. Moscow has repeatedly said it would regard any use of its frozen assets as theft. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that channeling Russian funds to Ukraine would “boomerang,” adding that “if someone wants to steal our property, our assets, and illegally appropriate them, they will be subjected to legal prosecution one way or another.” Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amid growing calls for our pension funds to invest more at home, a hard truth must be faced: Canada has become a magnificent place to generate savings, but a difficult one to deploy them. Our capital and talent are conceived here, but perfected abroad. Benjamin Graham once observed that while markets vote on sentiment in the short run, they weigh substance in the long run. As our federal debt spirals past $1.4-trillion and infrastructure crumbles, we confront a bitter irony: Canada is now one of the world's great capital exporters precisely when we need that capital most. Pension funds are duty-bound to seek the best global returns. With Canada representing less than 3 per cent of global market capitalization, our economy simply lacks the depth to absorb their vast portfolios. That gap is widening fast: In 2024, our investment abroad grew more than twice as fast as foreign investment here. We are evolving into a sophisticated rentier nation – a country whose expertise is allocating global capital rather than creating domestic value. That same month, foreign investors sold off $11.4-billion in Canadian shares, a massive monthly capital flight from our productive economy. While Canada creates startups, we fail to grow them. According to the APEXE Nations Report, from 2021 to 2023 we produced 0.81 high-value “unicorn” firms per million people – a fraction of Israel's 5.6 and less than half the U.S. rate. This “scale-up gap” is driven by a lack of domestic growth capital, leading to the premature sale of our most promising firms to foreign buyers. Worse, a web of regulatory uncertainty actively deters investment. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ranks Canada's framework for foreign investment as the most restrictive in the Group of Seven countries, with a discretionary screening process that creates a wall of uncertainty for global investors who prize predictability above all else. Rita Trichur: This CEO says more corporate headquarters in Canada could fix our productivity crisis. In a refreshingly frank assessment, Bank of Montreal chief executive officer Darryl White recently explained why international capital remains on the sidelines. He described global investors who are interested but unwilling to commit: “At the end of the day, capital's not that sophisticated. The consequence of this capital starvation is a deep and persistent productivity gap. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, a record 29,186 Canadians permanently emigrated. The University of Waterloo's elite software engineering program exemplifies this exodus: In recent years, more than 70 per cent of its graduates have left for the United States, chasing compensation packages often more than double what Canada offers. This dynamic risks reinforcing our transformation from a country that creates new wealth to one that primarily manages existing wealth. Both the Dutch Republic and Great Britain saw their economies shift from dominating global industry to dominating global finance, transforming from dynamic workshops into passive counting houses as their domestic productive engines atrophied. Canada risks completing this same transformation at digital speed. Opinion: We need to worry more about Canada's economic growth A crucial first step is to dismantle our own barriers by reforming our uniquely restrictive foreign investment review process to prioritize speed and predictability. Concurrently, we must create the large-scale domestic opportunities our capital pools can absorb by developing investable, user-pay infrastructure frameworks. We must also tackle the scale-up gap with policies that foster a domestic venture-capital ecosystem and address the brain drain by ensuring our tax system rewards, not repels, our most productive citizens. It will return only when the complete domestic ecosystem – of regulation, opportunity and reward – makes staying home the most compelling choice of all. Change demands the political will to create a competitive domestic environment that capital – ours and the world's – will choose over exile.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Both countries are exploiting AI, robotics and unmanned systems at a high tempo. Strapped to its undercarriage was a very basic bomb. Instead of a pilot's seat, there is an additional fuel tank and batteries that power navigation and communication systems, according to a report by the Ukrainian outlet Babel that CNN has confirmed. Goronych and his group are now integrated into the 14th regiment of Ukraine's special operations forces, who spoke with CNN about their work. On Wednesday, according to the Ukrainian military, they were involved in an attack on a mechanical plant in the Russian city of Saransk – nearly 800 kilometers (497 miles) from the Ukrainian border – where detonators and mines are manufactured. As US gets tough on Moscow, has Putin's strategy of playing Trump run its course? The Goronych project represents one of dozens of adaptations made by both sides as the conflict has worn on – especially using light aircraft and drones. In September, the Ukrainian military's chief of staff, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said light aircraft mounted with machine guns were proving effective in intercepting Russian drones and the military would consider buying more. The Russians recently began deploying small planes equipped with machine guns in occupied territory to take down Ukrainian drones on their way to targets in Russia. The Ukrainian Security Service established where the planes were based and said on Tuesday that it had “neutralized two small aircraft that the occupiers stationed at airfields and used to shoot down Ukrainian long-range drones.” In recent weeks, Russia has begun deploying a new jet-powered guided bomb, adapted from its huge stocks of old “free-fall” bombs, according to Ukrainian Defense Intelligence (DI). “The range and combat radius of such bombs will be approximately 200 kilometers (124 miles),” said the deputy head of DI, Vadym Skybitski, in a statement. Ukraine could get 150 advanced Swedish fighter jets under just-signed deal The Russians had already been converting Soviet-era bombs into glide munitions with a range of some 80 kilometers (50 miles), allowing aircraft to fire them while staying well clear of Ukrainian air defenses. On just one day last week, nearly 300 such bombs were fired against Ukraine. A Russian aviation blogger posted on Monday that the weapon was “already being used against the Ukrainians… Now they will put it into production and things will really heat up.” They can also carry a multiple rocket launcher system. Trump's sanctions target Russian ‘war ATM,' but the real test is enforcement But over time, said defense analyst Dara Massicot, “Russian units grafted protective armor onto vehicles, learned new styles of camouflage, and adopted small-unit assault tactics, among many other adaptations.” The Russian Defense Ministry also set up an elite drone unit called Rubikon, “which experiments with different types of tactics that now inform how other UAV units are instructed,” Massicot wrote in Foreign Affairs. For all its innovation and a surge in domestic production of drones and missiles, Ukraine still needs a constant pipeline of weapons from its allies. Zelensky renewed calls for Western-made defenses in the wake of a deadly attack overnight on Friday into Saturday, which killed two in capital Kyiv. Ukraine is “paying special attention to the Patriot systems, so that we can protect our cities from this horror,” he said. Russia is moving toward producing more than 6,000 Shahed-type drones each month, Ukraine's Defense Intelligence told CNN in September. That's just one reason why Ukraine wants longer-range missiles – to take the war to targets such as drone factories deep inside Russia. But US President Donald Trump says that, for now, providing Tomahawk cruise missiles is off the table. “Everyone who is now helping Ukraine with air defense systems and (the) missiles for them is protecting lives,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday. Zelensky said he anticipated “a good and, in many ways, completely new agreement on our defense capabilities” in meetings with European allies this week. But, with most weapons production pipelines measured over years rather than months, rapid improvisation has an important role on the battlefield.</p>

NOVI SAD, Serbia — Paris Olympic champion Akari Fujinami struck gold in her first major tournament since moving up to the next Olympic weight class of 57 kilograms, cruising to victory at wrestling's U23 World Championships on Friday in Novi Sad, Serbia. “It was my first tournament in a while, so it was a relief, and it reminded me how much fun matches are,” Fujinami said. After an extended hiatus from the sport, she announced she would move up to 57 kgs — bypassing the non-Olympic weight of 55 kgs — in preparation for an Olympic repeat at the 2028 Los Angeles Games. She opted to skip this year's senior worlds as she continued to make the physical adjustment to the heavier weight class and work on improving her techniques, making her “global debut” at 57-kg at the world U23, a tournament she had previously missed due to injury. “From now, I'll enter a bunch of competitions.” In addition to aiming for Los Angeles, Fujinami, a native of Mie Prefecture, has her sights set on winning a gold at the neighboring Aichi-Nagoya Asian Games in October next year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford, billed by the US Navy as “the most capable, adaptable, and lethal combat platform in the world,” is being sent to the Caribbean as the Trump administration ramps up military pressure on Venezuela over alleged drug trafficking. With a displacement of more than 100,000 tons and a length of 1,100 feet (334 meters), the Ford is the largest warship the US has ever put to sea. It carries a crew of almost 4,600, including its air wing. That's about 20% less personnel than the Nimitz class, which the Navy says is possible because of more efficient systems on the Ford. Those efficiencies are what make the Ford the most advanced carrier in the world and result from its two nuclear reactors, whose exact specs are classified but that put out three times the electrical power of those on the Nimitz-class ships, according to the Navy. That extra power enables the Ford to operate the electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS). Using magnets instead of steam to power the ship's catapults gives the Ford the ability to launch aircraft faster and with heavier weapons and more fuel, increasing the range and lethality of its fighter jets. The same science applies to its 11 Advanced Weapons Elevators, which use electromagnetic motors rather than hydraulics, meaning it can move munitions more quickly from magazines to the flight deck and loaded onto aircraft. The ship also boasts the Navy's Advanced Arresting Gear, the system which essentially grabs the tailhook of aircraft with wires when they touch down on its flight deck. The Navy says the digitally controlled system allows for increased sortie rates and lower energy consumption. The Ford's flight deck is about four feet wider than the Nimitz class, and its “island” – the portion of the ship rising above the flight deck – is smaller and set farther back, giving more space for easier handling of aircraft movements. The twin-engine Boeing aircraft can carry a range of air-to-air, air-to-ground and anti-ship missiles as well as laser-guided bombs. They have a maximum combat range of 1,250 miles (2,011 kilometers), according to the Navy. Modifications needed to support the fifth-generation aircraft are not expected to be made until a yet-to-be-determined future maintenance period. Though it was commissioned in 2017, it didn't make its first deployment until 2022 as the service struggled to work out kinks in its advanced systems. The ship made its first combat deployment in 2023, an eight-month cruise that saw it spend time in the eastern Mediterranean after the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel.</p>

It was his fourth homer in two games after connecting three times and striking out 10 as a pitcher in LA's Game 4 win to clinch their NL Championship Series. Ohtani's homer Friday didn't do much for Los Angeles' chances after a flop by the Dodgers' pitchers. Starter Blake Snell was knocked out of the game before getting an out in the sixth inning, and Toronto then pummeled the bullpen during a nine-run sixth highlighted by Addison Barger's pinch-hit grand slam and Alejandro Kirk's two-run homer. Ohtani also missed an earlier chance to impact the game with his two-out, bases-loaded groundout in the second inning. Blue Jay fans booed Ohtani loudly during pregame introductions. Fans chanted “We don't need you!” at Ohtani while he batted in the ninth inning. He walked in that at-bat, then was nearly picked off a moment later by left-hander Eric Lauer with two outs. Ohtani was ruled safe after a video review. Ohtani helped lead the Dodgers to last year's title, hitting .310 with 54 homers, 130 RBIs and 59 stolen bases. Back to pitching in a limited role this season as he returned from elbow surgery, he batted .282 with 55 homers, 102 RBIs and 20 steals while going 1-1 with a 2.87 ERA in 14 starts, striking out 62 in 47 innings. He's expected to start Game 3 or 4 on the mound. Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Toronto Blue Jays' Addison Barger watches his grand slam home run take flight during the sixth inning.David J. Phillip/The Associated Press In Friday's first game of the World Series, the Los Angeles Dodgers had a clear approach to the game – they would Dodgers their way through it. Their ace, Blake Snell, came out looking like he'd gotten a ransom phone call five minutes before taking the field. Snell can sometimes be a little erratic. On Friday, he couldn't locate the plate with binoculars. But no problem, his team seemed to say. Snell gave up a single against the wall in the fourth, and then a home run – his first since August. Snell was back out in the sixth, nearing 100 pitches and looking like he could lie down on the mound and fall straight to sleep. Being allowed to face Alejandro Kirk (the to-the-wall single guy) after walking Bo Bichette was one thing. Being allowed to stay in against Daulton Varsho (the home-run guy) after putting Kirk on was another. Nine pitches into his at-bat with Varsho, Snell hit the Jays centre fielder. The likeliest explanation was some combination of exhaustion and frustration. Blue Jays' Vladimir Guerrero Jr. celebrates as Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers walks back to the dugout after Game 1.Cole Burston/Getty Images The rest of baseball can stop rushing to find their outfit for the California coronation. We have a World Series to play in the interim. If any Toronto manager had stuck with a starter the way L.A. stuck with Snell, Jays fans would currently be in a Home Hardware looking for a couple of planks and a bucket of nails. There was a moment in the second inning that spoke to this idea. Manager Dave Roberts and conflicted Canadian Freddie Freeman were standing at the top of the steps, chatting, laughing, having a good old natter. A key sequence in the game, and the two of them looked like they were waiting for a bus. The Dodgers hit this World Series like they were macrodosing muscle relaxants. It may have slapped the Dodgers awake. Addison Barger, right, celebrates after hitting a grand slam with Vladimir Guerrero Jr. during sixth inning.Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press Everything Toronto changed to start the World Series worked. The offence remains in a Grand Canyon-sized groove. If you had to describe the opener in baseball terms, you would call it Ernie Banksian. It felt like two games worth of action. Though this is the first post-season Game 1 they've dropped in two years, the Dodgers will still think they are winning this series. Toronto must allow them to think that. One aberrant Snell start doesn't change that. The stats-oriented nature of baseball does not allow for the most crucial factor in any game – luck. Throughout this run, the Jays have been so lucky they've made it seem like a skill. Even their losses have been well placed. At no point have they actually felt like losing. It happened around the time Ernie Clement tried to turn a bad L.A. throw to first from one extra base into two and got caught at third. Against New York or Seattle, that works. After being tagged out, he looked up at the third-base coach and said, ‘Yeah?' like he was talking to the arbitrating authority. Right then, Toronto had passed its luck to the other side. If someone had told you before the game that Ohtani was going to crush a seventh-inning home run and that it wouldn't matter, what would you say? Toronto can now afford to lose Game 2, but I wouldn't advise it. The Dodgers are also creatures of luck. Why else do you think they stuck with Snell when his own mother would have pulled him? It was 2-2 at the time and still too early for the Dodger luck to have appeared. Show Toronto that fate has a new boyfriend, and he lives in Hermosa Beach. That didn't work, and the Blue Jays killed them for it. We'll try it again on Saturday night. Somebody's going to win this series and when they do it won't be because they attacked left-handed pitching. It will be one of two things – because things just broke their way a few crucial times; or because they trusted luck, and luck didn't trust them back.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaking at a briefing for members of Parliament and the House of Lords on Wednesday, retired British Rear Admiral Chris Parry argued that if the UK were to lose its foothold in Northern Ireland, it would present a major opportunity for Moscow and Beijing. He noted that the waters between Northern Ireland and Scotland are essential for Britain's nuclear-armed submarines, describing it as “critical to our strategic deterrent.” “With a united Ireland, there is no guarantee we could deploy our ballistic missiles,” Parry said. He also suggested that Irish unification would enable NATO adversaries to threaten critical undersea cables. My view is that the best way to help Ireland now is to increase NATO and Allied activity in Ireland's economic zone waters,” he said. Parry even suggested that NATO should hold exercises in Irish-controlled waters “whether Dublin agreed or not,” saying the bloc must be prepared to “fish in Irish waters for our potential opponents.” He added that the republic should move toward closer military cooperation with NATO and renounce neutrality. “If anyone attacks Britain, they will attack Ireland… Neutrality cannot be seen as conscientious objection any more. The Republic needs to reduce its vulnerabilities,” he stated. Moscow has dismissed claims that it plans to attack NATO as “nonsense.” Ireland has been militarily neutral since gaining independence in 1921, and is not a NATO member but cooperates with the bloc.</p>
