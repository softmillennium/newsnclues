                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stan Wawrinka made an emotional post on his social media channels Friday, bringing fans into his mindset pushing forward aged 40 on the ATP Tour. ‚ÄúPASSION - A strong liking, desire, or devotion to an activity. When I started playing tennis at 8 years old, it was just a game. My dream was to one day became a professional tennis player,‚Äù Wawrinka wrote. ‚ÄúI know that as an athlete, people like to think they know when it's time for your to stop. People believe that when you get older, when you don't play at the same level, don't have the same ranking or same result, you should stop.‚Äù - A strong liking, desire, or devotion to an activity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings swept past Alex de Minaur 6-3, 6-4 Saturday to reach the championship match at the Erste Bank Open in Vienna. By making his eighth final of the year, the Italian became the first man to reach that many finals in back-to-back seasons since Novak Djokovic in 2015-16. "[I] came here quite late to the tournament, tried to take every day in the best possible way and I'm happy to be here in the final," Sinner said in his post-match interview. "It was not easy to [reach] the final here, so I'm very happy." Sinner entered the semi-finals having not faced a break point in his first three matches at the ATP 500. Although the Italian lost serve twice against the Australian, he never panicked and set a clash for the trophy against second seed Alexander Zverev or fourth seed Lorenzo Musetti. It was always going to be a tough test for De Minaur, who walked on court with an 0-11 Lexus ATP Head2Head record against Sinner. When the top seed broke in his first return game of the match, it was clear De Minaur had a big mountain to climb. The first set was very physical, so I'm happy that I won in two sets today," Sinner said. "He changed a couple of things, which I was ready for today. "I don't want to say [what]. He knows what to do, how to put [me] under pressure and the moment when you don't serve very well, you have to play every ball and every point. The third seed produced some stunning shotmaking and used his blazing speed to try to fend off Sinner and his unrelenting power baseline game. But the Australian struggled to do enough damage with his serve, winning only 52 per cent of his first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats. I was a break up in the second, broke him back, tried to stay there mentally," Sinner said. Without facing that pressure, Sinner was able to swing freely to work his way into another final. After winning titles at the Australian Open, Wimbledon and Beijing this season, he will try to add another trophy to his collection Sunday. Sinner clinches his 20th straight indoor hard court win to reach his 8th final of the season! The 24-year-old is also trying to keep alive his hopes of earning ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours, with Carlos Alcaraz in firm control of that battle. Sinner has not lost a set this year in Vienna and now owns a 16-4 record at the tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You can't wipe the smile off Grigor Dimitrov's face these days. After three long months on the sidelines due to a pectoral injury, the 34-year-old Bulgarian is finally back in action at the Rolex Paris Masters this week ‚Äî and you can feel his relief radiating throughout La D√©fense Arena. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of good and mixed feelings in the most positive way, but it's nice to be back with the boys and starting to challenge each other again,‚Äù  Dimitrov told ATPTour.com. ‚ÄúIt's been a good week for me so far, trying to get as many hours as possible on the court because this is what I've craved. ‚ÄúOf course, my goal is coming back to full force next year, but it's a great challenge for me right now just to see how the body will respond.‚Äù Dimitrov's last appearance was at Wimbledon, where he produced some of his most inspired tennis to forge a two-sets-to-love lead against then-World No. He seemed destined for the quarter-finals, but it was heartbreak all over again, with the Bulgarian suffering his fifth consecutive exit at a major through retirement. The sight of his tears said more than any press conference could. But as he returns to the bright lights in Paris, where he reached the final in 2023, Dimitrov is back to his joyous self. 3 player in the PIF ATP Rankings practised with good friend Andrey Rublev on Friday night and then returned less than 12 hours later to train with Francisco Cerundolo. Whether it be physical or otherwise, Dimitrov is hoping for a week free of pain. He will take to the doubles court alongside five-time major winner Nicolas Mahut, who is playing the final tournament of his career. For both men, it promises to be a poignant chapter. One making an anticipated return to ATP Tour action, the other taking his final bow. ‚ÄúWe always wanted to do a few double sessions together throughout the last years, but I was honestly never really able to commit,‚Äù Dimitrov said of Mahut. ‚ÄúFor so many years, we played against each other. We competed more than once on such a big occasion. In his singles bid, Dimitrov faces a stern opening test against big-serving Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. Whatever the outcome, one thing is certain: Grigor Dimitrov is back where he belongs ‚Äî smiling, competing and writing another chapter in his story.
