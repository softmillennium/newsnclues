                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hot flashes are a common symptom, but the effects of hormonal changes can run much more deeply and affect everyday life. The research team of the new literature review, affiliated with BRAVE Lab at Ponce Health Sciences University, noted patterns in brain changes caused by hormones that may help explain many menopause-related symptoms. Considering the impact menopause transition can have, especially throughout a decade or more of a woman's life, the researchers of the new review wanted to review existing studies to see what links they could find between menopause and brain structure changes. To do this, they searched various databases for studies published within the past five years related to menopausal symptoms and brain structure. They focused on the most recent research and only included peer-reviewed studies in their review. This indicates that the brain may adapt and reorganize itself over time. The research team also noticed a pattern in findings related to menopause and white matter hyperintensities. White matter hyperintensities show up as bright areas on MRI scans and may reflect stress or damage to the brain's communication pathways. The hyperintensities were more pronounced in women who went through early menopause and who had frequent vasomotor symptoms (also known as hot flashes and include night sweats). She cautioned against becoming overly concerned about some of the links found between menopause and gray matter volume loss. Faubion added that women who experience forgetfulness or trouble concentrating during the menopause transition should not assume it signals something more serious. “Indeed, there is no evidence that symptoms of ‘brain fog' during the menopause transition are associated with later risk of dementia, which is reassuring,” Faubion pointed out. It's important to note that people who still have a uterus will also need progesterone. Voskuhl also touched on long-term cognitive concerns for women who experience brain fog during menopause. She said that this would have to be further studied, including treating menopausal women with HRT to determine whether a “cause and effect relationship” exists. Menopause occurs when an individual hasn't had a period for one full year, a signal that the ovaries have stopped producing most of their estrogen and progesterone. The time leading up to menopause is called perimenopause, or the menopause transition, which can last for a decade or more. However, some people may reach menopause earlier, and those who undergo treatment for certain cancers or have their ovaries removed will reach medical menopause without going through perimenopause. During this time, people experience physical and emotional changes resulting from shifting hormone levels. The symptoms of menopause can vary in intensity from mild to more disruptive. Another symptom that people report is brain fog or cognitive difficulties. There are some ways to treat the symptoms caused by menopause. They can also prescribe selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), an antidepressant class that includes drugs such as escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), or sertraline (Zoloft), for mood symptoms and hot flashes. However, not everyone is a candidate for hormone therapy during menopause. Each individual can discuss their options with a doctor. A new study suggests that transdermal estradiol (patches or gels) may have different memory effects than oral estradiol when it comes to menopausal…</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at North Carolina State University have shown a link between the size of cockroach home infestations and the levels of both allergens and endotoxins in those homes, with lowering roach infestation numbers through pest control triggering significant declines in the levels of allergens and endotoxins. The study's findings suggest that eliminating cockroach infestations could help improve indoor environmental health by greatly reducing allergens and endotoxins. Endotoxins are bacterial cellular components that get released when bacteria die. As omnivores that will eat just about anything, cockroaches have a rich and diverse gut microbiome. Previous research has shown that cockroaches shed a lot of endotoxins through their fecal matter, although house pets – and humans – can also shed endotoxins. The researchers in this study found that a large amount of the endotoxins found in household dust was associated with cockroach feces. "Endotoxins are important to human health, as inhalation of these components has been shown to provoke allergic responses," said Coby Schal, the Blanton J. Whitmire Distinguished Professor of Entomology at NC State and co-corresponding author of a paper describing the research. These baseline levels were tabulated by capturing settled and airborne dust in homes. The researchers found significant amounts of endotoxins in infested homes, with female cockroaches excreting about twice the amount that males excreted. "Female cockroaches eat more than males, so more endotoxins are shed from their fecal matter," said Madhavi Kakumanu, an NC State research scholar in Schal's lab and co-corresponding author of the paper. The researchers also included a control group of homes that had no cockroaches. The results showed that infested homes without extermination had very large amounts of both endotoxins and allergens at all timepoints. Meanwhile, in most cases, infested homes that received the extermination intervention were rid of both cockroaches and their allergens, and experienced significant declines in endotoxins. Endotoxins significantly decreased in homes where cockroaches were eliminated. Coby Schal, the Blanton J. Whitmire Distinguished Professor of Entomology at NC State "We also saw that allergens and endotoxins can be airborne," Kakumanu said. Schal added that next steps include further examining interactions between cockroach allergens and endotoxins in animal models of asthma, such as mice. "There exists the implication that asthma can be worse due to interactions between allergens and endotoxins," Schal said. "We want to see if that is the case in mice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>St. Jude Children's Research Hospital scientists recently uncovered how mitochondria, the powerhouse of cells, and lysosomes, cellular recycling systems, work together to activate and deactivate these immune controllers. Their discoveries carry implications from understanding autoimmune and inflammatory diseases to improving immunotherapy for cancer. They return a tissue to normal once the threat is neutralized. Regulatory T cells play such an important role that the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in recognition of their original discovery. When regulatory T cells don't function properly, people can develop tissue damage from uncontrolled inflammation or autoimmune disorders due to the immune system being inappropriately activated. Despite their importance, the precise molecular process driving regulatory T cell activation has been unclear. We discovered how regulatory T cells are activated and become more immunosuppressive during inflammation. By defining how cellular metabolism rewires regulatory T cells through different states of activation, including their return to a resting state, we have provided a roadmap to explore future therapeutic interventions or ways to improve existing immune-related treatments." The scientists uncovered a link between metabolism and signaling and regulatory T-cell activation by performing single-cell RNA sequencing of these T cells in a mouse model of inflammation. They noted four unique 'states' that emerged from analyzing gene expression related to energy production and cellular metabolism. "We saw that these regulatory T cells undergo dynamic metabolic changes, starting out in a relatively 'quiescent' or relatively inactive metabolic state, then transition to an intermediately activated and then a highly metabolically activated state, before returning to a baseline status," said first author Jordy Saravia, PhD, St. Jude Department of Immunology. "That final subset, which re-enters metabolic quiescence, has never been described for regulatory T cells, but may explain how these immune suppressors are 'turned off' when their task is done." Additionally, mitochondria from the more activated states contained more dense cristae, or "folds", like having more generators in each power plant, suggesting that this mechanism is an important part of regulatory T cell activation during inflammation. Lysosomes recycle materials from the inside of cells, which can then be used to make energy or other building blocks. However, regulatory T cells without Opa1 still failed to generate sufficient energy or maintain their immunosuppressive function. When the researchers instead deleted a gene critical for restraining lysosomes, Flcn, regulatory T cells again became defective. They further demonstrated that this link between mitochondrial dysfunction and increased TFEB activity was due to enhancing signaling of another major pathway, AMPK signaling, presenting further evidence of intercommunication between the two organelles. "We are the first to dissect this inter-organelle signaling between mitochondria and lysosomes in regulatory T cells," Saravia said. "It shows that these metabolic signaling pathways control discrete activation states, and ultimately, how well these cells perform their immunosuppressive functions." One of the researchers' surprising findings is that without Flcn, regulatory T cells are unable to upregulate gene expression programs that let them gather in non-lymphoid tissues such as the lung and liver. Those same programs are also associated with regulatory T-cell function in tumors, which suppress the activity of anti-tumor immune cells. They found that this gene deletion enabled more effective immune responses against tumors, leading to decreased tumor size. These findings suggest that altering Flcn activity in regulatory T cells may open a new avenue to improve anti-tumor immunity and benefit cancer immunotherapies. "We now have a better understanding of how organelles direct resting versus highly activated regulatory T-cell states in inflammation and tissues, providing new insights that will help improve treatments for autoimmune disorders and cancer." Mitochondrial and lysosomal signaling orchestrates heterogeneous metabolic states of regulatory T cells.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But how the body actually feels temperature has remained an elusive mystery. Now, Northwestern University researchers have captured a detailed look at one of the body's major heat sensors, revealing how it turns on when temperatures rise. This sensor, called TRPM3, sits in the cell membrane, where it acts like a tiny gate. When TRPM3 detects heat, it allows charged particles, or ions, to flow into the cell. This triggers nerve signals, which the brain interprets as heat or pain. The finding uncovers a new way that cells sense temperature and helps explain how the nervous system distinguishes harmless warmth from dangerous heat. Because TRPM3 also is involved in pain, inflammation and epilepsy, the discovery could lead to new types of non-addictive pain treatments. The study will be published on Friday (Oct. 24) in Nature Structural & Molecular Biology. "Temperature is an ever-present environmental factor that affects how we sense the world," said Northwestern's Juan Du, who co-led the study with Wei Lü. Understanding how temperature is detected at the molecular level can help us design better treatments for pain and inflammation." Because it can't be seen or tracked directly, studying heat is notoriously difficult. Scientists often study drugs by watching them bind to proteins, but temperature has no physical shape or binding site. They also used electrophysiology, which measures electrical currents through the protein, to watch how TRPM3 behaves in living cells. Comparing these structures revealed which parts of the protein shift during activation. The team then imaged TRPM3 at low and high temperatures, finding that both heat and chemical activators trigger similar structural rearrangements inside the protein. By combining imaging and electrical recordings, the team found that TRPM3 functions as a molecular switch made of four parts. Heat or a chemical activator disrupts these connections, shifting the protein into its active state. "In contrast, the epilepsy drug jams that same switch, preventing it from changing shape." Because TRPM3 is found in both the brain and sensory neurons in the skin, tuning its activity could help manage chronic pain or neurological disorders. By learning how this sensor detects heat and how to control its activity, we may discover new pain-relief strategies that are safer and less likely to cause addiction." The study, "Structural basis for agonist and heat activation of nociceptor TRPM3," was supported by the National Institutes of Health (award numbers R01HL153219, R01NS112363, R01NS111031 and R01NS129804), a McKnight Scholar Award, Klingenstein-Simon Scholar Award, Sloan Research Fellowship and a Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences award.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emily Henders, 37, of Bushey in Hertfordshire, received her infusion at UCLH in October 2025 and is looking forward to being discharged from hospital. She said: "I hope taking part in the trial means I will never have to experience another relapse and that my MS symptoms will not progress. MS is a condition that affects nerves in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). But with a CAR T cell therapy (obecabtagene autoleucel, known as obe-cel) proven to be highly effective in blood cancer patients, researchers have turned their attention to autoimmune conditions such as lupus and now MS. CAR T cell therapy works by resetting the immune system by depleting B cells, which are thought to drive the autoimmune attack in MS. The therapy modifies the patient's own T cells to target and eliminate B cells (both types of immune cell), potentially leading to long-term remission and halting disease progression. Dr. Claire Roddie, a UCL Cancer Institute researcher and UCLH consultant hematologist who has been instrumental to the UCL/UCLH collaboration on new treatments using CAR T cell therapy, said: "It is fantastic to be involved in the development of obe-cel for patients with MS and this Phase I clinical study will help us understand how safe and effective obe-cel is for MS. Our ultimate goal is to achieve long periods of disease remission with a single, one-time CAR T treatment." Dr. Brownlee said: "Although treatments for MS have dramatically improved in recent years, none of the available medication fully stops relapses or progression of the illness. CAR T cell therapy is an exciting new frontier in the treatment of autoimmune conditions, and this trial will be essential to understanding the feasibility and safety of CAR T in people with MS." Despite the uncertainty about whether the therapy will work for her, Emily remains focused and keen to tackle her condition head on. "My journey with MS is about choice and action. While the path is often unpredictable and daunting, I refuse to let MS dictate my life and I remain hopeful, not only for myself but for others who may one day benefit from advances in treatment." Dr. Frederick Vonberg, from UCL Department of Neuromuscular Diseases and UCLH, said: "This trial is open to UK patients diagnosed with relapsing or progressive forms of MS who are not responding well to the best medications already available and whose disability is worsening. The CAR T cell therapy being tested in this clinical trial was invented by scientists from the UCL Cancer Institute, led by Dr Martin Pule, and has delivered promising results in treating patients with an aggressive blood cancer. The second-generation obe-cel CAR T cell therapy has reduced immune toxicity and persists for longer in blood cancer patients, overcoming two common limitations of earlier CAR T cell therapies. Dr. Roddie and Dr Brownlee are supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) UCLH Biomedical Research Centre (BRC). The BRC has been crucial to the development of CAR T therapy at UCL and UCLH, which has helped to lay the groundwork for this trial, with CAR T now being trialled in MS. This study is an example of how we are taking a promising new therapy, which has already been shown to work well in some cancers, and extending it into other disease areas. It is truly groundbreaking work reflecting the combined strengths of UCLH and UCL, and made possible by NIHR support through our Biomedical Research Centre. It is also a great example of our close working relationships with the biotech industry. Thanks to studies like this, many more patients could benefit from CAR T therapy in future."
