Fox News contributor Michael Pillsbury gives his thoughts on President Trump's high-stakes trip to Asia and the points of tension between China and the United States on 'America Reports.' President Donald Trump kicked off the week meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, and closed out the week jetsetting to Asia. And at home, the White House launched constructing its new ballroom — much to the ire of many Democrats. Trump said construction started Monday and that the project would be funded privately. "For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State Visits, etc. Trump said in a social media post. "The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly. This Ballroom will be happily used for Generations to come!" The deal also outlines that Australia and the U.K. will work to build additional attack submarines for Australia's fleet. However, Trump told reporters that he is looking at equipping Australia with the submarines soon, when asked if he was interested in speeding up the process. President Donald Trump, left, and Anthony Albanese, Australia's prime minister, shake hands outside the West Wing of the White House in Washington, Oct. 20, 2025. "Well we are doing that, yeah … we have them moving very, very quickly," Trump told reporters Monday. However, Trump also said that he didn't believe the deal was necessary to undermine China. "I don't think we're going to need it," Trump said about the trilateral agreement. "I think we'll be just fine with China. China doesn't want to do that. We have the best of everything, and nobody's going to mess with that. And I don't see that at all with President Xi." President Donald Trump, center, shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping, as they gather for a group photo at the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, June 28, 2019. Meanwhile, Trump departed for Asia Friday, as he is slated to meet with Xi during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit. The meeting comes amid ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries, which escalated when Beijing announced Oct. 9 it would impose export controls on rare-earth magnets. Rare earth magnets are used in products ranging from electric cars to F-35 fighter jets. As a result, Trump said the U.S. would impose a new 100% tariff on all Chinese goods, which is slated to take effect Nov. 1. However, Trump has sought to neutralize tension, and has regularly spoken highly of his relationship with Xi in recent weeks. "I think we are going to come out very well and everyone's going to be very happy," Trump said Thursday. Trump will also visit Malaysia, Japan and South Korea as part of the trip. Trump also met with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte Wednesday, just after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and after calling off a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. President Donald Trump and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte speak at the start of a NATO leaders summit in The Hague, Netherlands, June 25, 2025. Trump said that he didn't want a "wasted meeting" with Putin in Hungary, and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump didn't see enough progress toward peace from Russia. "We canceled the meeting with President Putin," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office with Rutte Wednesday. But we'll do it in the future."

Vice President JD Vance criticized New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani on Saturday, writing on X that according to the Democrat, "the real victim of 9/11" was his aunt. Vance made the remark as early voting began Saturday in New York City, where Mamdani, the frontrunner in the race, is trying to fend off challengers Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa. Who stopped taking the subway after September 11th because she did not feel safe in her hijab," Mamdani said in a clip of a Friday campaign event that Vance shared. "According to Zohran, the real victim of 9/11 was his auntie who got some (allegedly) bad looks," Vance said. Vice President JD Vance, left, criticized New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani on Saturday, Oct. 25, 2025. Mamdani also said Friday that, "I want to speak to the Muslim who works for our city, whether they teach in our schools or walk the beat for the NYPD, New Yorkers who all make daily sacrifices for the city they call home, only to see their leaders spit in their face." "I want to speak to every child who grows up here marked as the other, who is randomly selected in a way that never quite feels random, who feels that they carry a stain that can never be cleaned. Growing up in the shadow of 9/11, I have known what it means to live with an undercurrent of suspicion in this city," Mamdani added. Andrew Cuomo shakes hands with Zohran Mamdani during a mayoral debate this week. Mamdani accused Cuomo this week of "Islamophobic rhetoric" after the former governor joined a radio show and its host speculated that Mamdani would be "cheering" if New York City faced another 9/11-style attack. During an appearance on WABC's "Sid & Friends in the Morning" on Thursday, Cuomo questioned Mamdani's ability to lead the city through a crisis situation. "Any given moment, there's a crisis, and people's lives are at stake. During a Mamdani campaign event in Manhattan later on Thursday, a reporter asked Mamdani if Cuomo's comments were Islamophobic. People cast their ballots during early voting on Saturday, Oct. 25, 2025, in New York. "Yes, I believe that they were," Mamdani said, before adding, "We're speaking about a former governor who, in his final moments in public life, is engaging in rhetoric that is not only Islamophobic, not only racist, it's also disgusting."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Georgia's internal security service said on Saturday that it had arrested three Chinese citizens in the capital Tbilisi, for attempting to illegally purchase two kilograms of “nuclear material” uranium, Georgia's Interpress news agency reported. Interpress cited the deputy head of Georgia's State Security Service as saying the three detainees had been planning to buy the uranium for $400,000 and transport it to China, via Russia. The uranium was “nuclear material,” it said, without elaborating on the motive for the planned purchase. It quoted the security official as saying that the detainees faced charges that could see them imprisoned for up to 10 years. The security of nuclear materials left over from the Soviet era was one of the biggest concerns after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, of which Georgia was a member. There have been several serious incidents involving the illicit trade in nuclear materials in Georgia over recent decades. In July, Georgia arrested one Georgian and one Turkish national, charged with the illegal purchase, possession and disposal of radioactive substances, which the national security service said could have been used to make a deadly bomb.

Across the U.S., travelers are checking into spooky hotels that once held inmates, soldiers and even cult members. As travelers crave experiences over ordinary stays, hotels that have transformed grim to glam are now embracing their bizarre and sometimes haunted histories, even hosting weddings and wellness retreats. Paranormal tours and repurposed spaces built on old bones draw everyone from ghost hunters to history buffs, The New York Times recently reported. Whether it's the "most haunted hotel in America" or a jail-turned-boutique stay in Boston, these locations offer a peek into the darker corners of American history. The Algonquin Hotel has reportedly been haunted for decades. The Algonquin Hotel in Manhattan's Times Square was once the meeting place of the famed Round Table — a daily gathering of sharp-tongued writers, critics and actors whose wit helped define New York's Jazz Age. Today, guests say the laughter hasn't faded entirely, with reports of footsteps, flickering lights and phantom chatter ringing through the halls. In 2015, a reporter spent a night at the Algonquin with ghost-hunting tools and claimed that eight spirits — possibly including Dorothy Parker — answered her call. Today, McMenamins Edgefield, which sits about 15 miles outside of Portland, boasts a winery, brewery, distillery, spa and golf course. But when it opened in 1917, it served as one of the nation's first detention centers for women accused of carrying sexually transmitted infections amid a wartime health panic, according to History.com. Black Rabbit House is a small bar and restaurant on the McMenamins Edgefield property. After closing in 1923, the site became a government-run "poor farm," later housing a military academy, medical staff and elderly residents before falling into disrepair. McMenamins revived the property in 1990 with a ceremonial pipe-and-drum "cleansing," and private rooms now range from $130 to $300. Widely known as "America's most haunted hotel," guests and staff report encounters with spirits from its past, including a stonemason who died during construction and patients from the 1930s, when con man Norman Baker turned it into a fraudulent cancer hospital, examining cancer patients in the hotel's basement and draining families of their life savings, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Today, the mountaintop hotel overlooking Eureka Springs offers ghost tours through its Victorian halls and former morgue, and the price of a room ranges from about $150 to $600. Built in 1893, Milwaukee's Pfister Hotel has long been linked to flickering lights, strange noises and shadowy figures said to haunt its ornate halls. Some locals believe founder Charles Pfister still roams the property, according to reports, and even celebrities like rapper Megan Thee Stallion have gone ghost hunting there. Visiting Major League Baseball players in town to play the Brewers often share eerie stories and Los Angeles Dodgers star shortstop Mookie Betts has said he's too spooked to stay there, ESPN reported. The Pfister Hotel in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is famed for its elegant design and ghostly reputation. The property also hosts weddings, conferences and events, and is now managed by a nonprofit board dedicated to preserving the historic campus. The Art Deco building in Bozeman was originally constructed in 1941 to serve as the Montana National Guard's armory, featuring 18-inch-thick walls, a rifle range, a soundproof music room and space for military vehicles. It was reopened as a boutique hotel in 2020 and still offers much of its original structure, according to local reports, honoring its history plus modern amenities, such as a rooftop pool and a Peloton bike-stocked fitness center. The Liberty Hotel in Boston is housed in the former Charles Street Jail, a massive Gothic structure completed in 1851 that remained open until 1990. Notable inmates once held at the jail include Boston Mayor James Michael Curley, anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, civil rights leader Malcolm X and mobster Whitey Bulger, according to records. The 1886 Crescent Hotel is famed for its grand Victorian charm. The Marin County site was home to a radio receiving station in the 1910s before it was acquired by Synanon, a controversial drug rehabilitation program that evolved into a cult known for weapons stockpiling and attempted-murder allegations, according to reports. The state took over the property in 1984, incorporating it into Marconi State Historic Park, and after a multimillion-dollar renovation, it reopened in 2023 as a boutique coastal lodge where rooms start at $323.

Andrew Cuomo slammed Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani for claiming he is a "victim" as a Muslim, saying his rival has "been dividing and attacking and offending" different New York groups during his campaign. Andrew Cuomo slammed Democratic socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani for painting himself as a victim because he is a Muslim, saying the rival mayoral candidate has spent his campaign offending 9/11 families, Jews and various other groups of New Yorkers. Nothing could be further from the truth. "This entire campaign, he has been dividing and attacking and offending different New York groups." While speaking at an event in which he received the endorsements of several faith leaders, Cuomo lambasted Mamdani, who he called his "main opponent." Cuomo listed a number of groups who he says have been hurt by Mamdani, including Jews, Blacks, Italians, members of the LGBTQ community — and even some Muslims. Cuomo first addressed the Jewish community, saying that Mamdani had hurt them "in a truly painful way." The former governor recounted a recent interaction with a Jewish New Yorker who said he was afraid of wearing a Star of David in the city. The former governor took issue with Mamdani's refusal to condemn the phrase "globalize the intifada," which many see as a call for violence against Jewish people. Mamdani has faced criticism for his refusal to condemn the phrase early in the mayoral race. Cuomo added that according to the Quran, prostitution is haram, which means "forbidden" in Arabic. After condemning Mamdani's gesture toward the Columbus statue and invoking its offense to Italian-Americans, Cuomo broadened his criticism. He pointed to a photo of Mamdani with a Ugandan official who backs harsh anti-gay laws, framing it as an affront to the LGBTQ community. He didn't stop there — Mamdani's friendship with controversial Twitch streamer Hasan Piker, who once said "America deserved 9/11," also drew scrutiny from the former governor. He is the offender, and he has done a great deal of damage," Cuomo said. Fox News Digital reached out to Mamdani's campaign for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Right after setting her out-of-office email on October 1, one furloughed US Department of Agriculture worker filed for unemployment benefits to help her pay for food, rent and other necessities during the federal government shutdown. More than three weeks later, her application is still listed as pending – forcing her to borrow from family and friends as the impasse continues with no end in sight. The Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance told her she may have to wait up to three months to receive her first payment, though she will receive a lump sum for all the missed weeks of claims. “But that doesn't help me now,”  said the worker, who asked for anonymity for fear of retaliation. Initial jobless claims for federal workers have soared to their highest level since the record 35-day shutdown that ended in January 2019. Maryland and Texas have the highest number of initial claims, with more than 3,100 filings each, said Stettner, who analyzed unemployment data filed in 49 states and territories. More workers are expected to file for unemployment compensation in the coming weeks since many missed their first full paychecks on Friday and more will do so in coming days. Unlike in previous shutdowns, many are concerned that they may not receive back pay or have a job to go back to after the shutdown ends. The Trump administration has called into question a 2019 law that guarantees retroactive compensation for furloughed workers and has tried to lay off more than 4,000 workers during the impasse. Still, only a small share of the estimated 670,000 furloughed federal employees have applied for jobless benefits. Plus, the benefits are only a fraction of what many federal workers receive in compensation. The Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program is similar to traditional state jobless benefits, but it differs in significant ways that could delay getting money into the hands of furloughed staffers. State unemployment offices have the wage records of private-sector employers, but they don't have that information for the federal government. But many of the workers who would handle such requests have been furloughed themselves, said Stettner, who also served as a senior US Department of Labor official in the Biden administration. They don't know how long the shutdown is going to be,” he said, noting it's akin to an interest-free loan. Some states are trying to smooth the process for furloughed workers. Washington's Employment Security Department, which has had more than 1,800 federal employees file for benefits, held a webinar earlier this week that drew nearly 500 participants and is offering another one next week. Maryland's Department of Labor has a webpage specifically for furloughed federal staffers and contractors. Utah's Department of Workforce Services posted an FAQ for affected federal employees on its site. Ben Emmel, a senior analyst at the Government Accountability Office, decided to file for unemployment benefits two weeks ago, but the Maryland resident was only able to submit his application on Friday because he had to resolve an identity verification issue first. Even when he gets the benefits, the weekly payment will only cover a trip or two to the grocery store for Emmel, who is married with four young children. Many contractors who work for federal agencies have also been furloughed, although they don't have the same guarantee of getting their back pay that federal staffers do. Contractors can also run into issues filing for jobless benefits. Sharon, a contractor for the Drug Enforcement Administration, visited a Washington, DC, unemployment office after having difficulty applying online. After waiting in line, she still didn't get clear answers about her eligibility or next steps.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Voters in Ireland went to the polls Friday to elect one of two women as their new president for the next seven years, a largely ceremonial role in the European Union member country. Independent candidate Catherine Connolly casts her vote in the election for the next Irish president at Claddagh National School in Galway city, Ireland, Friday, Oct. 24, 2025. Independent candidate Catherine Connolly casts her vote in the election for the next Irish president at Claddagh National School in Galway city, Ireland, Friday, Oct. 24, 2025. Counting gets under way for the Irish presidential election in Dublin, Ireland, Saturday, Oct. 25, 2025. LONDON (AP) — Left-wing independent Catherine Connolly is set to become Ireland's next president after her rival conceded defeat in a presidential election Saturday. Vote counting was still underway but ahead of the official result, Heather Humphreys, of the center-right party Fine Gael, told reporters that she wanted “to congratulate Catherine Connolly on becoming the next president of Ireland.” “Catherine will be a president for all of us and she will be my president, and I really would like to wish her all the very, very best,” she said. Connolly, a former barrister and an independent lawmaker since 2016, has been outspoken in criticizing Israel over the war in Gaza. She has also warned against the European Union's growing “militarization” following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ireland has a tradition of military neutrality, but her critics have said she risks alienating the country's allies. Prime Minister Micheál Martin on Saturday congratulated Connolly on her “very comprehensive election victory,” adding “it is clear she will be the next president of Ireland.” Initial and incomplete results show Connolly taking more than 60% of votes. Martin, who heads Ireland's government, had personally backed Gavin as a presidential candidate. Though Gavin had stopped campaigning, his name remained on the ballot paper because of his late withdrawal from the race. The electoral commission said Saturday that there was a “significantly higher than normal” number of spoiled ballots, and that there will “clearly be a need for deeper and further reflection” about voter dissatisfaction. “We have seen a real appetite for the change that Catherine represents,” said Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik. “We believe this really does mean a new sort of politics is possible, that we can now realize the ambition that I talked about a year ago: The real prospect of a center-left-led government after the next general election.” Others — including musician Bob Geldof and the former mixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor — had indicated they wished to run for president but failed to receive enough backing for a nomination. Connolly will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who has been president since 2011, having served the maximum two seven-year terms. The final result will be declared later Saturday once all 43 electoral constituencies have completed counting.</p>

One of the Democratic Party's top potential 2028 figures will stump for Virginia gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger on Sunday. Josh Shapiro, who has notably made a lane to the right of far-left Democratic Party figures like New York Assemb. Zohran Mamdani, will rally with Spanberger in the crucial Hampton Roads area. The former Virginia congresswoman plans to hold multiple rallies in the Tidewater alone before Election Day, including another with former President Barack Obama across the ‘roads' in Norfolk. "Governor Shapiro this weekend is headed to New Jersey and Virginia to help elect Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger; two more Democratic governors who will focus every day on getting stuff done, delivering results for hardworking families and protecting freedom in their states," Shapiro campaign spokesman Manuel Bonder told Fox News Digital on Friday. Josh Shapiro gestures to fans at the Pitt/WVU game at Milan Puskar Stadium in Morgantown, West Virginia (Brien Aho/Getty Images) Shapiro also plans to stump for Rep. Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey as she hopes to keep Trenton in Democratic hands. Shapiro – who has announced he will run for reelection to Harrisburg in 2026 and has not officially indicated interest in a presidential bid – is one of several Democrats whose names repeatedly come up in such conversation – including Illinois Gov. He was also the reported runner-up to Minnesota Gov. Shapiro lambasted antisemitic behavior at the University of Pennsylvania following the Hamas attack on Israel, while separately adding of Mamdani's view of the Jewish State: "You have to speak and act with moral clarity, and when supporters of yours say things that are blatantly antisemitic, you can't leave room for that to just sit there." While Shapiro has faced criticism from Republicans in his own state for supporting former Gov. Tom Wolf's COVID-era shutdowns and for the current budget impasse, he's also been a rare Democrat to earn praise from some in the GOP. Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican nominee in New Jersey's sweeps, namedropped Shapiro favorably enough times that Newark Mayor Ras Baraka – then running for governor – suggested he cross the Delaware and run in the Keystone State instead. "[Pennsylvania doesn't] have a property tax crisis [like New Jersey], they don't have a business climate crisis, they don't have an energy crisis," Ciattarelli said, contrasting the two neighbors. Pennsylvania Republicans, however, disputed some of those descriptions, with state Rep. Russ Diamond, R-Lebanon, and Sen. David Argall, R-New Ringgold, recently drafting bills to eliminate property taxes altogether. State Sen. Doug Mastriano, R-Gettysburg, who challenged Shapiro in 2022 and is being urged by the conservative wing to do so again in 2026, also blasted Shapiro's budget proposals as "fantasy," warning in a statement that "eventually, the funds from ‘we the people' will run dry." Shapiro has also been vocal on election law itself, rebuking the president over a Truth Social post potentially foreshadowing an end to mail-in balloting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration often looks like a car crash. There have been car crashes between federal agents and suspects trying to flee. There have been dramatic traffic stops featuring smashed windows and law enforcement shootings. “They're the most highly visible, and I think they're so unusual that it shocks the psyche to see federal agents making administrative warrant arrests and using potential deadly force tactics,” said Thaddeus Johnson, a former law enforcement official in Tennessee and a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank. Top Border Patrol official accused of violating judge's use-of-force order by throwing tear gas at Chicago protesters The crashes show federal law enforcement's use of aggressive tactics in busy city streets, such as dangerous “PIT” maneuvers, unmarked cars and masked officers, law enforcement and immigration experts said. “Often people in their cars get scared and they try to drive away, knowing that stopping and talking to ICE might end up in a severe violation of their constitutional rights and arrest and detention,” said Nayna Gupta, policy director of the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration nonprofit group. “This kind of interaction on the streets – using traffic stops, people fearful when ICE or federal agents are following them – leads to the kinds of accidents and crashes that we're starting to see in the news.” Bill Essayli, acting US attorney for the Central District of California, noted in a post on X on Tuesday that “encouraging resistance to federal agents can lead to deadly consequences.” “Using it against law enforcement justifies their use of deadly force in self-defense. If you wish to challenge law enforcement actions, do so in court, not on the streets.” Some of these car crashes have been initiated by federal agents and show a willingness to use aggressive and potentially dangerous tactics. In Chicago on October 14, US Border Patrol agents pursued and crashed into a vehicle as part of an immigration enforcement operation, leading to an angry response from community residents. The incident unfolded when a white SUV hit the side of a red SUV, sending it backward through the intersection before it crashed into another vehicle, video captured by a nearby resident showed. Agents used “an authorized precision immobilization technique (PIT) maneuver,” which forces a vehicle to spin out and stop, said DHS. Border Patrol agents eventually arrested the two individuals, according to DHS. “There are a series of factors that agents have to take into account before they even become involved in a high-risk pursuit,” he said. “When you're involved in a high-risk pursuit, one of your main responsibilities is the general public, along with yourself and the violator.” Video of the incident shows a dark gray truck driving in circles with an unmarked beige SUV closely following him around. It is not immediately clear what happened before the video starts. He told CNN's Erin Burnett last week he is one of multiple volunteers who have been patrolling neighborhoods in Ventura County to document ICE detentions and was shocked when the SUV he says was driven by federal agents drove into his truck. Martinez told CNN he was temporarily detained him and then released from custody pending charges. Last month, an ICE officer fatally shot a man who DHS said resisted arrest and dragged the officer during a vehicle stop in a Chicago suburb, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The man, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, was an undocumented immigrant, according to DHS. In another incident, Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old US citizen, was shot five times by a US Customs and Border Protection agent after her vehicle and a federal law enforcement vehicle collided on October 4 in Chicago. Martinez has pleaded not guilty to a charge of assaulting, resisting, and impeding officers. Federal prosecutors allege Carlitos Ricardo Parias, a TikTok influencer, rammed law enforcement vehicles in an attempt to dislodge his car during an immigration arrest. Authorities said Parias is a 44-year-old Mexican national living illegally in the US. In immigration crackdown, DHS statements on arrests face a problem of credibility Parias been charged with assault on a federal officer, according to a statement from the US Attorney's Office in the Central District of California. He's very calm,” his lawyer Carlos Jurado told CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS. “A lot of the police officers here know him. Investigators believe gunfire erupted after an ICE officer confronted the suspect's vehicle and smashed a window with their service weapon, a law enforcement source said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A left-wing education nonprofit organization that the Washington Examiner recently found to be publishing classroom materials promoting political violence has received hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer funding, according to public records reviewed by the North American Values Institute. Teaching for Change, alongside allied nonprofit organization Rethinking Schools, runs the Zinn Education Project. The project, named for late socialist academic Howard Zinn, has published classroom materials containing praise of violent organizations, riots, and other illegal activity oriented toward left-wing political goals. Despite this, the D.C. municipal government and the federally-funded Smithsonian Institution have doled out large grants to Teaching for Change in recent years. Teaching for Change is linked to radical and violent politics through its work operating the Zinn Education Project. Classroom materials developed by the Zinn Education Project praised members of the Black Panther Party implicated in violence, such as Eldridge Cleaver, who organized an armed ambush of Oakland police officers in 1968, and Assata Shakur, a left-wing activist who was convicted of murdering a New Jersey state trooper in 1977. “These organizations earned teachers' trust by leading honest conversations about race and Indigenous history,” Naomi Rodriguez, an NEA member, told the Washington Examiner. But now their messaging about Jews feels like a betrayal. They built their reputation on justice and inclusion, then used that trust to spread misinformation about Jews.” “Many teachers, and even NEA leadership, still treat them as equity leaders, even as their lessons on the history of the Middle East fuel bias against a people who've endured persecution for generations,” Rodriguez continued. “When so few Americans understand Jewish identity beyond the Holocaust, those false lessons don't just misinform; they shape worldviews. Teaching for Change is very active in the D.C. metropolitan area, hosting D.C. Area Educators for Social Justice, a network of liberal educators who “seek to strengthen and deepen social justice teaching” in order to “challenge systems of oppression through anti-bias, anti-racist, and multicultural education.” It works towards this goal by disseminating documents, hosting working groups, and organizing left-of-center protests. Another NEA member accused Teaching for Change of contributing to antisemitism through its “distorted and biased lessons” in a statement to the Washington Examiner. In 2022, the two organizations joined to hold a teacher workshop for high school and middle school educators on how to teach African American history following the Civil War.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A massive AWS outage Monday that brought down some of the world's most popular apps and services all started with a glitch. The bug – which occurred when two automated systems were trying to update the same data simultaneously – snowballed into something significantly more serious that Amazon's engineers scrambled to fix, the company said Thursday in a postmortem assessment. The massive cloud service's outage meant people couldn't order food, communicate with hospital networks, access mobile banking, or connect with their security systems and smart home devices. Major global companies, including Netflix, Starbucks and United Airlines, were temporarily unable to give customers access to their online services. “We apologize for the impact this event caused our customers,” Amazon said in a statement on the AWS website. “We know this event impacted many customers in significant ways. We will do everything we can to learn from this event and use it to improve our availability even further.” You thought Monday's internet outage was bad? “The analogy of a telephone book is pretty apt in that the folks on the other line are there, but if you don't know how to reach them, then you have a problem,” Angelique Medina, head of Cisco's ThousandEyes Internet Intelligence network monitoring service, told CNN. Indranil Gupta, a professor of electrical and computing engineering at the University of Illinois, used a classroom analogy to explain Amazon's technical analysis in an email to CNN. That “empty page” brought down AWS' DynamoDB database, creating a cascading effect that impacted other AWS services like EC2, which offers virtual servers for developing and deploying apps, and Network Load Balancer, which manages demands across the network. When DynamoDB came back online, EC2 tried to bring all of its servers back online at once and couldn't keep up. Amazon is making a number of changes to its systems following the outage, including fixing the “race condition scenario,” which caused the two systems to overwrite each others' work in the first place, and adding an additional test suite for its EC2 service. Outages like Monday's, while rare, are just a reality, Gupta said. But what matters is how such issues are addressed. “Large scale outages like this, they just happen. There's nothing you can do to avoid it, just like (how) people get ill,” Gupta told CNN over the phone. “But I think how the company reacts to the outages and keeps customers informed is really, really key.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the floor of their tiny makeshift home in a refugee camp in Bangladesh, her mother Fatima Begum feeds Sofiya by rubbing her gums with a food paste designed to treat severe malnutrition. The impact is already being felt in the world's largest refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, where UNICEF reports an alarming 11% rise in the number of children with acute malnutrition between January and September this year. An ethnic Rohingya Muslim, Fatima Begum fled her home in western Myanmar's Rakhine state in 2017, after the military carried out what the US and UN experts call a genocide. Begum fled one type of hell, only to land in another – now facing a daily battle to keep her baby alive. Sofiya is currently receiving 2.5 portions of the ready-to-use therapeutic food packets (RUTF) every day, with each one providing 500 calories from the mix of powdered milk, peanuts, vegetable oil and vitamins. Over the past few decades, this simple product has helped to bring millions of children back from the brink of starvation. “Cox's Bazar is ground zero for the impact of budget cuts on people in desperate need,” said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres after he visited the camps in March, adding that “people will suffer and even people will die.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has repeatedly denied that US aid cutbacks caused any deaths, and has defended the move as a way to cut bureaucracy and prioritize “our national interests.” But a study published in The Lancet predicts the cuts will result in 14 million deaths over the next five years – and an online impact tracking tool run by a Boston University professor estimates that there are already 88 deaths per hour. At a nutrition center in Camp 15 of Cox's Bazar – run by Concern Worldwide, with programs from UNICEF and the World Food Programme (WFP) – babies are measured for malnutrition by wrapping a paper tape measure around their tiny arms. Chronic malnutrition – or stunting – has remained persistently high in the camps, at around 41%, UNICEF says. As international aid is pulled back from the US, along with reductions from other countries including the UK and France, aid agencies have slashed jobs globally to try to protect frontline operations – including nearly 5,000 job losses at the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. But life-saving projects are still being impacted, including medical services, food supplies, and vaccine programs. And the coming year looks worse – with many aid agencies facing a “funding cliff” in 2026. “People are suffering,” said Shamsud Douza, the joint secretary of the Additional Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner (RRRC) Office in Cox's Bazar. “Humanitarian aid decreased, funding is going down, some people are losing jobs, education programs, everything.” The World Food Programme said it has not made any ration cuts so far this year, but faces a $126 million funding gap in the next 12 months. “Without new contributions, food assistance for the entire Rohingya community will come to a complete halt in two months.” A lot of the new arrivals are already badly malnourished, as aid provision has largely been cut off for their homes in northern Rakhine – where the military has been accused of using hunger as a weapon of war. Further south in Sittwe – the capital of Rakhine – hundreds of Rohingya have been living in refugee camps since 2012, after previous violent attacks on their community. Hla Tin, a 39-year-old Rohingya living in a Sittwe camp, told CNN that they haven't received any aid in the camps since June – suggesting that the situation there is even more dire than in Cox's Bazar. Hla Tin has five children, and the youngest two are both suffering from malnutrition. “These days due to lack of nutritious food, both elderly people and children get sick more easily,” Hla Tin said. Among 432 families in the camp, over 300 are not eating regular meals, and people are getting into debt taking loans to buy food, he said. She was a bright student, so her family sent 7-year-old Estafa to private lessons to learn Arabic – hoping that this would give her a chance to leave the camp one day and find a better future. But things started to change this year when budgets were slashed. “We can't afford to educate our children. “If there is no budget in the future… we will suffer even more.” In the camps, 48 health facilities, along with 11 primary health care centers, have been directly affected by the US government cuts, aid agencies say. “We see long queues now in our hospitals, people waiting for treatments,” said Hasina Rahman, the Bangladesh country director for the International Rescue Committee (IRC). In February, Khatun says Estafa became suddenly ill with stomach pains, so they took her to a camp hospital, and she was then transferred to a bigger facility where she received treatment. “My child suffered and died in pain,” Khatun said, as tears rolled down her face. The grieving mother blames a lack of medical care for her child's death – although the medical team which treated her told CNN that there was no link between her death and the funding cuts. But tragedies like these also reflect the vulnerability of this refugee population – with the overall reduction in support causing a cascade effect for those already living on a knife edge of survival. “Before, we used to get support from America,” Mariam Khatun said.</p>

Russian President Vladimir Putin, poses for a photo during a visit to the judo club Turbostroitel leading by coach Anatoly Rakhlin when Putin was a boy in St. Petersburg, Russia, Wednesday, Nov. 27, 2019. (Mikhail Klimentyev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP, File) A woman with two children walks past a street exhibition of military posters named ‘Together to Victory' dedicated to Russian army in St. Petersburg, Russia, Friday, Feb. 14, 2025. For a quarter century, President Vladimir Putin has faced the specter of Russia's shrinking and aging population. In 1999, a year before he came to power, the number of babies born in Russia plunged to its lowest recorded level. In 2005, Putin said the demographic woes needed to be resolved by maintaining “social and economic stability.” Having many children and a large family must become the norm.” But those hard-won gains are crumbling against a backdrop of financial uncertainty, the war in Ukraine, an exodus of young men and opposition to immigration. Russia's population has fallen from 147.6 million in 1990 — the year before the USSR collapsed — to 146.1 million this year, according to Russia's Federal Statistics Service. Since the 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea, it has included the peninsula's population of about 2 million, as well as births and deaths there, in its data. There were only 1.22 million live births last year — marginally above the 1999 low. Russia is trying new restrictions to halt the backslide and embrace what it calls “traditional family values” with laws banning the promotion of abortion and “child-free ideology” and outlawing all LGBTQ+ activism. Officials believe such values are “a magic wand” for solving demographic problems, said Russian feminist scholar Sasha Talaver. In the government's view, women might be financially independent, but they should be “willing and very excited to take up this additional work of reproduction in the name of patriotism and Russian strength,” she said. Young couples in cramped apartments, unable to buy their own homes or who fear for their jobs, usually have less confidence they can afford raising a child. But Russia is saddled with a harsh demographic history. About 27 million Soviet citizens died in World War II, diminishing the male population dramatically. Although Russia has not said how many troops have been killed in Ukraine, Western estimates have put the dead in the hundreds of thousands. When the war began, many young Russians moved abroad — some for ideological reasons like escaping a crackdown on dissent or to avoid military service. “You've got a much-diminished pool of potential fathers in a diminished pool of potential mothers,” Mathers said. That is a particular problem for Putin, who has long linked population and national security, she said. Some family-friendly initiatives are popular, like cash certificates for parents that can go toward pensions, education or a subsidized mortgage. Others are controversial, such as one-time payments of about $1,200 for pregnant teenagers in some regions. Last year, Russia's fertility rate — the average number of children born per woman — was 1.4, state media reported. Some regions have laws making it illegal to “encourage abortions,” while national legislation in 2024 banned the promotion of “child-free propaganda.” The wording in such initiatives is often vague, leaving them open to interpretation, but the change was enough to prompt producers of a reality TV hit “16 and Pregnant” to change the show's name to “Mommy at 16.” For many women, the measures make already sensitive conversations even more fraught. “Whether I plan to have children, whether I don't plan to have children — I don't get asked about that at all,” she said, speaking on condition of anonymity because she feared repercussions. It's “a completely different story” at state-run clinics, she said. An increasing number of laws limit access to abortion. While the procedure remains legal and widely available, more private clinics no longer offer abortion services. New legislation has also curbed the sale of abortion-inducing pills, a move that also affects some emergency contraceptives. By the time patients have completed compulsory counseling and mandatory waiting periods of between 48 hours and a week, they risk surpassing the time frame for a legal abortion. Abortions have steadily decreased under these laws, although experts say the number of procedures already was falling. Still, there hasn't been a corresponding increase in births, and activists believe restricting abortion will only harm the health of women and children. “The only thing you will get from this is illegal abortions. Russia could increase its population by allowing more immigrants — something the Kremlin is unlikely to adopt. Central Asians who have traditionally traveled to Russia for work are looking elsewhere, hoping to avoid growing discrimination and economic uncertainty. When people lack confidence about their prospects, it's not a time for having children, Mathers said, adding: “An open-ended major war doesn't really encourage people to think positively about the future.” The 29-year-old woman who chose not to have children agrees. “The happiest and healthiest child will only be born in a family with healthy, happy parents,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With their distinctive bright orange fur and pale blue faces, it's hard to mistake China's endangered golden snub-nosed monkeys for anything else. This photo provided by Pairi Daiza shows golden snub-nosed monkeys from China at the zoo in Brugelette, Belgium, in July 2025. With their distinctive shaggy orange manes, pale blue faces and dense fur covering their hands and feet, it's hard to mistake China's endangered golden snub-nosed monkeys for any other animal. These rare and charismatic monkeys, unique to the frigid mountains of central China, have recently joined the country's famous pandas as furry envoys to zoos in Europe for the first time — on loan for 10 years from the same government-overseen group that coordinates official panda exchanges. As with “ panda diplomacy,” some observers cheer new opportunities for scientific and conservation collaboration, while others raise concerns about the welfare of individual animal ambassadors transported around the world. This photo provided by Pairi Daiza shows golden snub-nosed monkeys from China at the zoo in Brugelette, Belgium, in July 2025. After a monthlong quarantine, the two sets of monkeys made their public debuts. At Pairi Daiza, the habitat enclosure for Liu Yun, Lu Lu and Juan Juan includes traditional Chinese gazebos with red columns and gray-tiled roofs, where the monkeys spend much of their time jumping between logs and rope ladders and scrambling over roofs. “The diplomatic aspect comes from this cultural awareness,” said Pairi Daiza spokesperson Johan Vreys. The zoo is in discussions with China to launch joint research and conservation programs “similar to those already in place for other emblematic species like pandas,” Maury said. Both giant pandas and golden snub-nosed monkeys are endangered animals that are unique to China and they can only be moved outside the country with approval from the central government, said Elena Songster, an environmental historian at St. Mary's College of California. While both species are considered national treasures, only monkeys have deep roots in Chinese art and culture, appearing in countless paintings and as characters in classic literature, including the wily Monkey King in the 16th century novel “Journey to the West.” When pandas stepped, rolled, scratched and stumbled onto the world stage in recent decades, they quickly became symbols of modern China — in part to due to their own “cuddly cuteness” and deft diplomatic presentation, said Susan Brownell, a China historian at the University of Missouri, St. Louis. In 1972, a pair of pandas was sent to the U.S. for the first time, following President Richard Nixon's historic visit to Beijing. In 1984, China switched from gifting pandas to loaning them. Following outcry from animal-rights activists, China ended the practice of short-term loans and began longer leases, usually around a decade. In this arrangement through the China Wildlife Conservation Association, part of the money that an overseas zoo pays annually to China must be earmarked for habitat conservation or scientific research to benefit the species. Still, what benefits a species may not be beneficial to an individual animal. Transporting animals over long distances and sending their offspring back to China, as the agreements require, may highly stress animals, said Jeff Sebo, an environmental and bioethics researcher at New York University. “Animal health and welfare matters,” he said, “not just for geopolitical or strategic aims.” Within China, the golden snub-nosed monkeys today live across a swath of central and southwestern China that includes parts of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Hubei provinces. It's unclear exactly how to evaluate the diplomatic track record of furry ambassadors. Still, in an era of rising global tensions, “I think pandas are a really useful entryway,” said James Carter, a China historian at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia. “Pandas open up an opportunity for people to think something positive about China — they're cute, they don't do anything bad.” The golden snub-nosed monkeys now at zoos in France and Belgium are so far the only ones outside of Asia. “China's golden snub-nosed monkeys aren't globally iconic yet,” said Brownell, “but there may be potential for them to be in the future.” Associated Press video producer Wayne Zhang, in Shennongjia National Park, contributed to this report.

President Donald Trump greets Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney during a summit to support ending the more than two-year Israel-Hamas war in Gaza after a breakthrough ceasefire deal, Monday, Oct. 13, 2025, in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. TORONTO (AP) — The leader of Canada's most populous province said Friday he'll pull the anti-tariff ad that prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to end trade talks with Canada. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said after talking with Prime Minister Mark Carney he's decided to pause the advertising campaign effective Monday so that trade talks can resume. Trump announced he's ending “all trade negotiations” with Canada because of a television ad sponsored by Ontario that used the words of former President Ronald Reagan to criticize U.S. tariffs. “We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels,” Ford said in a statement. “Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses.” “I've directed my team to keep putting our message in front of Americans over the weekend so that we can air our commercial during the first two World Series games,” he said. On Thursday Trump posted, “The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs.” Trump doubled down on his criticism of the Ontario ads Friday and accused Canada of trying to influence an upcoming U.S. Supreme Court ruling on his global tariff regime. Trump's call for an abrupt end to negotiations has further inflamed trade tensions between the neighbors and longtime allies. Carney said this week he aims to double his country's exports to countries outside the U.S. because of the threat posed by Trump's tariffs. Carney is trying to secure a trade deal with Trump, but tariffs are taking a toll in the aluminum, steel, auto and lumber sectors. Carney spoke to Ford Thursday night and again Friday. White House spokesman Kush Desai said talks with Canada have not led to any constructive progress. “Ontario's taxpayer-funded ad campaign on American TV networks — that misleadingly edited President Reagan's 1987 radio address about trade — is the latest example of how Canadian officials would rather play games than engage with the Administration,” Desai said in a statement. “As President Trump made clear on Truth Social, further talks are a futile effort if Canada can't be serious.” The Ontario government has said it would pay about $75 million Canadian (US$54 million) for the ads to air across multiple American television stations using audio and video of Reagan speaking about tariffs in 1987. “I'm sure he wasn't too happy,” Ford said. So to my good friend Doug Ford, keep the ads on TV. They're effective, and this country is behind you,” Kinew said. Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said the ad has backfired “big time.” “The Ontario ad does not misrepresent President Reagan's anti-tariff radio address in any respect whatsoever.</p>

President Donald Trump‘s defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford and its strike group to deploy to U.S. Southern Command to “bolster U.S. capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States,” Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a social media post. Deploying an aircraft carrier is a major escalation of military power in a region that has already seen an unusually large U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean Sea and the waters off Venezuela. The pace of the strikes has quickened in recent days from one every few weeks when they first began to three this week, killing a total of at least 43 people since September. The Trump administration is rejecting the idea of using roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep food aid flowing amid the government shutdown, according to a Department of Agriculture memo that surfaced Friday. Democratic lawmakers and various advocacy groups have been calling on the administration to use the contingency fund to provide partial benefits into November though the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly referred to as SNAP. President Donald Trump pulled out of trade talks with Canada Thursday, furious over what he called a “fake'' television ad from Ontario's provincial government that quoted former President Ronald Reagan from 38 years ago criticizing tariffs -- Trump's favorite economic tool. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, earlier this month issued two temporary restraining orders prohibiting Trump from deploying troops to Portland. Circuit Court of Appeals panel put the first order on hold on Monday, but the second order remained in effect, blocking him from actually deploying them. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem speaks during a press conference Friday, Oct. 24, 2025, in Minneapolis. Trump had said he's easing off of a planned surge of federal agents to San Francisco, but Noem suggested that might change if more violence occurs. Speaking at a Minneapolis news conference, Noem said that in a discussion Friday morning the president called the incident “their one chance” and suggested that if state and local leaders “don't figure out how to protect our law enforcement officers and protect our Coast Guard members, that we would be forced to come in and protect those individuals.” Republican Jack Ciattarelli speaks during the final debate in the New Jersey governor's race with Democrat Mikie Sherrill, Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2025, in New Brunswick, N.J. (AP Photo/Heather Khalifa) Trump is urging his supporters in New Jersey to back Republican Jack Ciattarelli during a nine-day early voting period in the race for governor. Trump spoke for about 10 minutes at a telephone rally backing Ciattarelli Friday evening before the president was scheduled to leave for a trip to Asia. He said Ciattarelli will focus relentlessly on reducing energy costs, repeating the cost-of-living message he emphasized in a Truth Social post earlier this week. He noted his own ties to New Jersey, where he owns a golf club and spends many of his weekends in the summer. Trump urged voters with mail ballots to send them in, then returned to his longstanding criticism of mail ballots and cast doubt on the integrity of the election. “You got to make sure the votes are counted, because New Jersey has a little bit of a rough reputation, I must be honest.” FILE - In this Feb. 24, 2016, file photo, a member of the San Antonio Living History Association stands on the grounds on the Alamo as he waits to take part in a reenactment to deliver William B. Travis' “Victory or Death” letter, in San Antonio. Dan Patrick wrote a letter to the Alamo Trust's Board of Directors suggesting she either resign or be removed, questioning her “judgement” over an academic paper she wrote in 2023. “It was with mixed emotions that I resigned my post as President and CEO at the Alamo Trust yesterday,” Rogers said in a statement texted to The Associated Press. In an excerpt from her paper she posted online, Rogers noted the Texas Legislature's “conservative agenda” in 2023, including bills to limit what could be taught about race and slavery. Patrick's call for Rogers' ouster follows Trump's pressure to get Smithsonian museums in Washington to put less emphasis on slavery and other dishonorable parts of American history. Alameda County Sheriff Yesenia Sanchez says she's been told by federal immigration officials that an operation has been called off for the entire region. Trump said Thursday he was calling off a surge of federal forces to San Francisco after conversations with the mayor and tech leaders. Those comments came as U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents began arriving at a U.S. Coast Guard base in nearby Alameda. Trump had previously said he would send the National Guard to San Francisco. Local officials wondered if Trump would send federal agents into other parts of the Bay Area, a nine-county region of about 8 million people. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement, didn't immediately comment. A State Department statement Friday didn't specify the dollar amount affected. The Department of Homeland Security says the two planes purchased this month replace planes that were 20 years old and experiencing maintenance problems. The department said those aircraft have to have certain capabilities such as communications system that can handle top secret information that allow senior officials to manage a situation wherever they are. The ongoing government shutdown continues to disrupt flights at times and put pressure on air traffic controllers who are working without pay. While large and unusual, the gift amounts to a small contribution toward the billions needed to cover service member paychecks. The Trump administration told Congress last week that it used $6.5 billion to make payroll. Military pay is a key concern among lawmakers of both parties as well as a point of political leverage. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings pressed attorneys representing the federal government over missing the deadline for a report regarding over 1,000 potential warrantless arrests since June. Earlier this month, Cummings ruled that federal immigration agents illegally arrested 26 people in the Midwest during the early days of Trump's second term, in violation of a 2022 consent decree that bans ICE from arresting people without warrants or probable cause. Attorneys also dodged Cummings' repeated questions about the conditions people arrested without warrants may be facing while detained and if they have access to advice from lawyers. “We've got to speed this process up,” he said. Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva talks to journalists during a joint press conference with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto at Merdeka Palace in Jakarta, Indonesia, Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said Friday that countries cannot violate another nation's sovereignty or constitution in the name of fighting drug trafficking. Speaking to reporters in Jakarta, Indonesia, Lula was responding to recent comments by Trump, who recently said Latin American drug cartels were the ISIS of Western hemisphere. if each one thinks they can invade another's territory to do whatever they want , where is the respect for the sovereignty of nations?” Lula added that he intends to raise the issue with Trump during their in-person meeting Sunday in Malaysia, “if he brings it to the table.” U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, says she'll rule by Monday. She issued two temporary restraining orders earlier this month — one prohibiting Trump from calling up Oregon troops to Portland, and another blocking him from sending any Guard members to Oregon at all after he tried to evade the first order by deploying California troops instead. Now Immergut must decide whether to dissolve her second order, which the administration has not appealed. Colombian President Gustavo Petro speaks during the swearing-in ceremony of Gen. William Rincon as the new national police director in Bogota, Colombia, Friday, Oct. 24, 2025. The Treasury Department leveled the penalties against President Gustavo Petro; his wife, Veronica del Socorro Alcocer Garcia; his son, Nicolas Fernando Petro Burgos; and Colombian Interior Minister Armando Alberto Benedetti. Petro “has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. “President Trump is taking strong action to protect our nation and make clear that we will not tolerate the trafficking of drugs into our nation.” Ford said after talking with Prime Minister Mark Carney he's decided to pause the advertising campaign effective Monday so that trade talks can resume. Ford said they've achieved their goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels. “Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses,” Ford said. “We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels.” New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani speaks at the Islamic Cultural Center of the Bronx mosque in New York on Friday, Oct. 24, 2025. The Brooklyn lawmaker said Democrats have a “clear obligation to push back against” Republican extremism, even as he acknowledged he had “areas of principled disagreement” with his party's nominee for mayor. Mamdani, in a statement, said he looked forward to “fighting Trump's authoritarianism” alongside Jeffries.Jeffries has for months declined to officially throw his support behind Mamdani, a Democratic socialist state lawmaker who upended the New York political establishment when he handed former Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo a resounding and stunning defeat in the June primary. Cuomo is still running in the November general election, but as an independent. The top Democrats on congressional intelligence committees are demanding information about the Trump administration's escalating strikes on drug-running vessels, which have killed at least 43 people. “Please tell us in writing whether IC (intelligence community) attorneys have independently analyzed the legality of these strikes and the potential for legal repercussions for IC personnel who support them,” the lawmakers wrote. Gabbard's office did not immediately respond to the letter. “Who are these people, what's the plan?” Smith told AP in an interview late Thursday. “They're basically saying: Drug dealers, we killed them, trust us, end of story.” Smith said, “It has the whiff of extrajudicial killings.” Trade Representative Jamieson Greer says his office launched an investigation of China's implementation of the trade deal struck about six years ago during the first Trump administration, when Beijing agreed to buy more U.S. farm goods and other products. The announcement by Greer came on the same day Trump is scheduled to embark on a trip to Asia, where he said he will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping about trade issues. Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade official, said Washington, by taking this move, might be seeking new leverage over Beijing in trade negotiations. The event will be held Oct. 30, once Trump returns from a three-country visit to Asia. The Associated Press first reported Friday that the Department of Justice is planning to monitor polling sites in Passaic County, New Jersey, and five counties in southern and central California: Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside and Fresno in next month's off-year elections. New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin called the move “highly inappropriate” and said the DOJ “has not even attempted to identify a legitimate basis for its actions.” And Rusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic Party, said in a statement that “No amount of election interference by the California Republican Party is going to silence the voices of California voters.” In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency on Thursday, Oct 23, 2025, Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks during the fourth plenary session of the 20th Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee in Beijing. The announcement, however, didn't confirm a meeting with Trump, who is leaving Washington on Friday for his Asia trip, where he says he will meet the Chinese leader over trade issues. Beijing said Xi also would pay a state visit to South Korea. A spokesperson for Ontario's premier says the ad that prompted Trump to announce he's ending all trade negotiations with Canada will run during Game 1 of the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers series on Friday night. The Ontario government has said it would pay about $75 million Canadian ($54 million U.S.) for the ads to air across multiple American television stations. They use audio and video of former President Ronald Reagan speaking about tariffs in 1987. The Pentagon's announcement came after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the U.S. military has conducted its 10th strike on a suspected drug-running boat. The pace of the strikes has quickened in recent days from one every few weeks when they first began to three this week, killing a total of at least 43 people since September. Republican Laura Swett is the new chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas and other energy infrastructure. Rosner remains on the five-member commission, which now includes three Republicans and two Democrats. LaCerte has served as White House liaison and senior adviser in the Office of Personnel Management, prompting concerns from Democrats about his independence. Swett's appointment comes as the Trump administration seeks to boost fossil fuels and data center development. She said in a statement that she looks forward to continuing the commission's “crucial mission of ensuring reliable and affordable energy for all consumers.” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the purchases during a news conference this week, saying they were to replace 25-year old Coast Guard planes and that Congress had appropriated the money. New York Attorney General, Letitia James, speaks after pleading not guilty outside the United States District Court on Friday, Oct. 24, 2025, in Norfolk, Va. (AP Photo/John Clark) The New York attorney general addressed a crowd of supporters after appearing in court in Virginia and pleading not guilty. It “has been used as a tool of revenge, and a weapon against those individuals who simply did their job and who stood up for the rule of law,” she told the crowd. The House Democratic leader is urging the Trump administration to deploy a $5 billion emergency contingency fund to ensure that food assistance for millions of Americans continues on Nov. 1 Jeffries was asked Friday at a Capitol press conference if he was confident that SNAP recipients would be able to continue to access their benefits. He accused Republicans of “trying to weaponize hunger” and called it unconscionable. The announcement follows Friday's release of September inflation data, which showed prices ticked higher but not by as much as many economists expected. The Fed is likely to cut its key interest rate next month as it grows more concerned about sluggish hiring than inflation. “Stay tuned,” the House minority leader and Brooklyn native says. Jeffries had said he would announce his position before early voting begins, and New Yorkers head to the polls starting Saturday. I have refused to articulate my position, and I will momentarily at some point in advance of early voting,” Jeffries reiterated to reporters. Democrats are “as unified as I've seen us throughout the entirety of this year” ahead of elections in Virginia, New Jersey and California, Jeffries said. The New York attorney general pleaded not guilty on Friday to federal charges accusing her of lying on mortgage papers to secure favorable loan terms in a case pushed by Trump. Siebert was replaced with Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide and former Trump lawyer who had never previously served as a federal prosecutor and presented James' case to the grand jury herself. “The exchange was a stunning disclosure of internal government information,” lawyers for James wrote. Letitia James is set to make her first court appearance on Friday. She's the third Trump adversary to face a judge on federal charges in recent weeks. James was indicted on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection with the 2020 purchase in Norfolk, Virginia, of a home where her relatives have lived. James, a Democrat who has sued Trump and his administration dozens of times, has denied wrongdoing and decried the indictment as “nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system.” ▶ Read more about the Trump administration's case against James The federal election observers will monitor the states' off-year elections following requests from state Republican parties, at sites in Passaic County, New Jersey, and five counties in southern and central California: Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside and Fresno. Election monitoring is a routine function of the Justice Department, but California and New Jersey are holding elections with national consequences on Nov. 4. New Jersey's open seat for governor has attracted major spending by both parties, and California's special election enables voters to approve or reject a redrawing of the state's congressional map to counter Republican gerrymandering efforts elsewhere ahead of the 2026 midterms. ▶ Read more about the Trump administration's election monitoring efforts U.S. stocks are heading for records on Friday after an update on inflation came in a bit less painful than feared. The inflation data could mean less pain for lower- and middle-income households struggling with still-high increases in prices every month. Even more importantly for Wall Street, it could also clear the way for the Federal Reserve to keep cutting interest rates in hopes of giving a boost to the slowing job market. On Friday, an Associated Press reporter saw international personnel there with flags from Cyprus, Greece, France, Germany, Australia and Canada. The U.S. military has conducted its 10th strike on a suspected drug-running boat, killing six more people in the Caribbean, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Friday. In a 20-second black and white video of the strike posted to social media, a small boat can be seen apparently sitting motionless on the water when a long thin projectile descends on it, triggering an explosion. Trump said Thursday he isn't planning to ask Congress to issue a declaration of war against the cartels: “I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK? ▶ Read more about the U.S. military's deadly strikes on South American boats Jason Kenney, who served in former Prime Minister Stephen Harper's cabinet, said “The Ontario ad does not misrepresent President Reagan's anti-tariff radio address in any respect whatsoever. “Everything that Reagan said in his pro-free trade April, 1987 radio message is consistent with the ad. In fact, everything he ever said about trade, before and after becoming President, is consistent with his principled opposition to tariffs,” Kenney added in a social media post Friday. “They know perfectly well that the Ontario ad captures precisely President Reagan's opposition to tariffs, and support for free trade. Hillary Clinton's Onward Together PAC is leveraging Trump's demolition of the White House East Wing into a fundraising opportunity ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, selling hats and stickers with the message: “Not His House. “If you're hopping mad about Trump destroying the White House, we've got a new hat or sticker for you,” the 2016 Democratic nominee against Trump posted Friday on Instagram. “Your purchase supports progressive groups working to build a fairer, more inclusive America for everyone — and win elections!” Onward Together PAC says it has contributed nearly $1 million to more than 225 candidates since 2017, the majority of them women, and that 62% have won their races. It was broadcast most frequently in the New York market, with more than 530 airings, followed by Washington, D.C., at around 280. The only other markets with more than 100 airings were those around Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and West Palm Beach, Florida. Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia rounded out the markets with at least 10 airings. “When the vehicle's actions posed a direct threat to the safety of Coast Guard and security personnel, law enforcement officers discharged several rounds of live fire.” The FBI and U-Haul did not immediately respond to emails seeking further information. A crowd had gathered earlier Thursday to protest a planned surge of federal agents, which Trump called off after hearing from several billionaires and San Francisco's mayor. The former Justice Department special counsel says he's ready to testify before Congress in an open hearing, responding to Republicans' demands that he answer for investigations he led into Trump's storage of classified documents and attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Smith steadfastly adhered to established legal standards and Department of Justice guidelines.” He has come under scrutiny from GOP lawmakers after the FBI revealed that his investigation analyzed phone records for a handful of lawmakers as part of the investigation into Trump's attempt to overturn the presidential election. The foundation in Simi Valley, Calif., is perhaps best known for maintaining the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum, which has the plane Reagan used as Air Force One on display and has hosted GOP presidential primary debates. Its board includes longtime Republican Party stalwarts such as former Trump Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who resigned after the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the Capitol, and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, whose free-market philosophy often clashes with Trump's protectionist tendencies. Many Hispanic voters were motivated by economic concerns in last year's presidential election. A new AP-NORC poll shows that despite Trump's promises of economic revitalization, they continue to feel higher financial stress than Americans more broadly. I'm still getting done dirty at the grocery store. I'm still spending an insane amount of money,” said Alejandro Ochoa, 30, a warehouse worker in Adelanto, California, who said she voted for Trump in 2024. In March, 41% of Hispanic adults approved of the way Trump was handling his job as president, but now that has fallen to 27%. The poll found particularly high levels of financial stress among Hispanic adults, compared to Americans overall, and Latino communities have also been a target of the president's aggressive immigration tactics. Trump's attacks on immigration have affected low-wage and high-skilled workers alike, at a moment when the economy is already uncertain because of his erratic trade policies.</p>
