The ‘Hollywood model' of teams: “What we're seeing is this movement in teams, where we'll stand up a small squad of people who bring their own domain expertise, but also have AI added into the mix. They come together just like you would to produce a film. A group of people comes together to produce a blockbuster, and then you disperse and go back to your day job.” So it's a whole new way to think about shipping, creating, and innovating.” The fallacy of ‘AI strategy': “The idea that you just need to have an ‘AI strategy' is a bit of a fallacy. Really, you kind of want to start with the business problem and then apply AI. It's that people won't evolve fast enough with AI.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reportedly announced that it was looking into one of Tesla's automated driving modes, which is charmingly called “Mad Max.” If you haven't heard of “Mad Max,” that's probably because it's new. Ars Technica notes that it and another mode, “Sloth,” were added to cars by a firmware update issued earlier this month. Well, Reuters now reports some folks on social media have been complaining that Teslas using the driving mode were exceeding the speed limit (that certainly sounds like something Max would do). “The human behind the wheel is fully responsible for driving the vehicle and complying with all traffic safety laws.” There's not a whole lot of information available other than that, but Gizmodo reached out to Tesla for comment (although the company dissolved a majority of its communications team years ago), and to the NHTSA for more information. Not I. Sarcasm aside, Tesla's FSD function has been probed by federal regulators for years so, for that reason too, this isn't all that surprising. FSD has been criticized because, despite its name, it does still require the driver to…you know, drive. Earlier this month, the NHTSA also opened an investigation into Tesla over dozens of reports that alleged its vehicles were running stop signs while engaged with FSD, CBS previously reported. Tesla also recently lost a wrongful death lawsuit involving Autopilot that will reportedly cost them $329 million. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it has received several reports of children getting trapped in 2021 Tesla Model Y cars. Tesla is recruiting self-driving test drivers in New York City without the permits required for autonomous vehicle testing, reigniting the battle between Elon Musk's robotaxi vision and regulators' safety concerns. Apparently Tesla's robotaxi reveal is upon us, which is either a watershed moment for self-driving or a total flop. New automatic emergency braking requirements are set to go into effect in 2029.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During Friday's Halo World Championships, developer Halo Studios unveiled Campaign Evolved, a remake of the first game's single-player story. Like in the original game, players will take on Master Chief after he and his UNSC allies crash-land on a ring world teeming with the alien Covenant and parasitic Flood. Beyond being the first Halo game made in Unreal Engine—reliably used across the industry—this new version features three prequel missions centered on Chief and his friend Sgt. Johnson set before the events of the first game that are said to include new characters, gameplay, and environments. That particular mission now has “reevaluated pacing and enhanced environmental storytelling,” said creative director Max Szlagor. Over the years, Microsoft has gradually loosened its grip on first-party Xbox titles being exclusive to its platform, with the Ori games, Gears of War, and more jumping to Sony's console and the Nintendo Switch. After Gears and Forza, Halo was the last holdout of major Xbox franchises, and this won't be a one-off: studio community lead Brian Jarrard said during the reveal that the series would be on PlayStation “going forward.” Confirmed: Halo will be on PlayStation "going forward" starting with the Combat Evolved remake. “[Our] community is super excited to welcome in their friends. This means more Halo for everyone, and it's a new era,” he continued. To that end, Campaign Evolved will have four-player online co-op between PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S via crossplay when the game launches in 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Data centers are being built with unprecedented gusto all over the U.S. Every time you use an app like DALL-E to, say, make one of those dumb AI-generated images of Mickey Mouse committing the 9/11 terrorist attacks, you're apparently using as much energy as it takes to charge an iPhone. Now picture how much electricity is being used if millions of Americans do it at the same time. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) today to initiate rulemaking procedures with a proposed rule to rapidly accelerate the interconnection of large loads, including data centers, positioning the United States to lead in AI innovation and in the revitalization of domestic manufacturing.” Chris Wright is apparently such a big fan of large loads that, in a bout of deregulatory fervor, he's now helping to usher in a new era of easier data center connection. The Register notes that one proposed rule is to “limit the time taken to review connection decisions to 60 days,” ostensibly so applicants don't get bogged down in a lengthy review process. “To usher in a new era of American prosperity, we must ensure all Americans and domestic industries have access to affordable, reliable, and secure electricity. This is an urgent issue that requires prompt attention.” “This Administration is committed to revitalizing domestic manufacturing/ and driving American AI innovation.' both of which will require unprecedented and extraordinary quantities of electricity and substantial investment in the Nation's interstate transmission system. The data center industry is booming, and, despite all that “bubble” talk when it comes to the AI business, it shows no signs of slowing down. Nebius, which is an AI infrastructure provider (it operates data centers), recently netted a deal with Microsoft, and went in on a robotaxi firm with Uber. Its stock price has also erupted some 350 percent this year, so, suffice to say—for the moment—it really pays to have a lot of servers. Turns out they're not powered by hopes and dreams. Demetre Daskalakis, the former director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, argues the public health agency has been weaponized into a political tool. Anthropic wants you to know it's not pushing for “woke AI."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every few weekends, 21-year-old student Lavanya Jain opens the BlaBlaCar app to find a lift from Noida on the outskirts of New Delhi to his home in Kandhla, a small town in northern India's Uttar Pradesh state. “If you're looking for a fast, efficient, affordable, and comfortable way to travel — and you like to chat — you should basically check out BlaBlaCar,” Jain told TechCrunch, adding that he has used the app some 40 to 50 times over the past two years. For a company that shut its India office in 2017 after poor traction, the turnaround is striking. Growth has come largely without marketing or a local team, driven instead by word of mouth, expanding mobile internet access, and the rise of digital payments and car ownership among India's middle class. India is home to more than 700 million smartphone users and has seen a sharp rise in digital payments, which now account for over 99% of all transactions in the country. At the center of that shift is the Indian government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system, which processed about 19.6 billion transfers worth around ₹24.9 trillion (roughly $284 billion) in September alone. Car sales have climbed in tandem, reaching 4.73 million vehicles in 2024, up from 3.87 million a year earlier — a 5.2% year-on-year increase and an all-time high. Other factors behind BlaBlaCar's rapid growth in India include the country's limited public transport capacity relative to its over 1.4 billion population, and the steady expansion of road infrastructure that is improving connectivity between smaller towns, rural areas, and major cities. “We have lots of examples from users who say, ‘Before, I was flying to a destination or taking the train or not going at all — and now I can actually drive. The company soon faced stiff competition from Uber and local rival Ola, both of which were experimenting with carpooling services and marketing them heavily. Struggling to gain traction, BlaBlaCar withdrew its local team in 2017. Still, the app remained live — and in 2022, usage began to surge again. India now accounts for about 33% of BlaBlaCar's global carpool passengers, the company said. Trip-wise, BlaBlaCar recorded its strongest growth in India, with 13.5 million trips completed as of September 30, up from 9.1 million during the same period last year. “For us, the center of gravity has shifted away from our initial markets in Western Europe toward places like Japan, Turkey — and increasingly, India,” Brusson told TechCrunch. Although BlaBlaCar does not yet generate revenue from India, drivers on its platform earned around ₹713 million (about $8 million) in August alone, the company said. By comparison, average driver earnings are about €15 (around $17) in France and roughly €6.5 (roughly $7) in Brazil, even though trip distances are broadly similar in India and Brazil and shorter than France's average of about 250 kilometers (roughly 155 miles). The difference, BlaBlaCar said, reflects lower local purchasing power and cost-sharing expectations in India. Despite all this growth, BlaBlaCar is not looking to enable monetization in India anytime soon. Nonetheless, BlaBlaCar plans to set up its local office in India and have the first hire by the end of this year or early next year, Brusson said. Brusson described them as “demand-led” products, while BlaBlaCar, he said, is “supply-led.” Instead, the company sees people driving their own cars — or opting for readily available trains and buses — as its main substitutes. State regulations around carpooling are ambiguous, which has brought the service under scrutiny in some cities. Some users, including Jain, have complained that  it can be difficult to reach BlaBlaCar's customer support, which often replies with automated messages. The company told TechCrunch it operates a “blended model,” with an outsourced local team handling most day-to-day queries and a smaller group at its Paris headquarters managing complex issues and quality checks. BlaBlaCar introduced an ID Check feature in India to verify users' identities through government-issued documents — a tool it later rolled out globally. However, TechCrunch found that users can still book or publish a ride even if their ID check is incomplete. “This is a deliberate design choice to make it easier for new members to engage with the platform,” the company said in response. “ID verification is just one part of our broader trust and safety framework; we don't rely on a single feature, but on multiple, layered mechanisms that work together to build confidence within our community.” The company added that more than 70% of trips in India are made with drivers who have completed government ID verification. “We actively encourage members to complete all verification steps, as fully verified profiles — with photo and ID — significantly increase the chances of finding carpoolers. Profiles lacking these elements tend to receive fewer bookings,” the company said. Some BlaBlaCar users in India also report frustration when drivers or passengers cancel trips at the last minute, sometimes even after reaching the meeting point. Additionally, the app lacks a live location–sharing feature, which Jain noted limits BlaBlaCar's use for those trying to book rides on behalf of family members or friends. Unlike in countries such as France, where designated carpooling zones exist, India lacks fixed pickup areas. Drivers and passengers typically agree to meet at convenient spots along the route — a petrol station, for instance, or near a highway exit. Globally, BlaBlaCar expects to reach about 150 million passengers this year, including users of its bus services, which operate in markets such as France but are not yet available in India.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The tired wood veneer and fish tank case trends need to be disrupted, but admittedly, this might not be the idea that dislodges them. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Perhaps the PC industry, now stuck in a groove producing almost endless small variations of wood veneer and/or fish tank-style cases, needs to be disrupted. This won't do it, of course, but it shows us that ‘something else' now has a lot of appeal. The conclusion is that the Redditor has a well developed sense of humor, with their superlative description of this gaming PC, as they go on to ‘boast' that it is only capable of “15fps in Fortnite high.” Another Redditor quipped that there must be a “bottleneck.” It held 20kg of that liquid, which if a similar density of water would make it a 20 liter case (roughly 5 US Gallons). You can buy a similar translucent plastic jug in the US on Amazon for $30 (in blue), and similar-capacity translucent colorless ones here. Many folks might already have similar containers in their workshops, garages, or other areas. PC cases and water canisters are both sold in liter sizes, which might have inspired The87Player to undertake this project. However, we will only know that this is a real, established trend in the PC enthusiast world when Amazon listings for water containers start including motherboard compatibility. For example, we could eventually see listings like ‘3-gallon plastic jug, mini-ITX compatible.' Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi saw a disappointing response to its newly launched Redmi K90 range. According to a Reuters report, Xiaomi President Lu Weibing wrote in a social media post that cost pressure is being passed on to the pricing of the company's new and upcoming products. For context, Xiaomi launched its budget-centric Redmi K90 series in China on Thursday. The base configuration featuring 12GB of memory and 256GB of storage is priced at 2,599 Yuan ($364), which is about 100 Yuan ($14) more than the previous-generation Redmi K80, which launched in November 2024. Lu further stated that the rising costs of memory chips are far beyond expectations and could continue to rise. The reason has been attributed to a combination of rapid AI infrastructure development and supply chain constraints. The report further states that supply shortages forced cloud service providers to buy aggressively, with high-stack 3D NAND products nearly sold out. Due to its faster read speeds and larger die capacities, 3D NAND has seen strong demand from CSP customers. Back in September, memory and storage manufacturer SanDisk announced a 10% NAND price increase, while Micron temporarily suspended DRAM and NAND price quotations to reassess allocations after forecasts indicated shortages. Meanwhile, Samsung's next-generation V9 NAND, claimed to offer improved density and cost advantages, is nearly sold out ahead of its expected release in the first half of 2026. These developments have potential implications for consumer pricing, and it seems only the beginning. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

If you find traditional wireless earbuds uncomfortable, or maybe they just won't stay in no matter what you do, there's still hope, thanks to open-ear earbuds like Baseus's Inspire XC1. Open-ear earbuds don't sit directly in your ear, up against your ear canal, which gives them two major advantages over the more common “closed” design (think AirPods Pro with the silicone ear tips): better comfort and situational awareness. There are currently two styles of open-ear earbuds to choose from: the classic, ear hook design, and the newer clip shape, which wraps around the side of your ear and sort of resembles an earring. You may not be familiar with Baseus; it's a relative newcomer to the personal audio space. And yet, every time I try one of its products, I marvel at how it manages to get so much right, at prices that are well below the competition. The Inspire XC1, crafted in partnership with Bose, are no exception. I'm sure it's no accident that Baseus created the XC1 in Cosmic Black and Starlight Off-White (pictured here), two colors that mimic Bose's preferred hues. Once open, it provides easy access to the XC1, which firmly snap in and out of their charging nooks thanks to their strong magnets. You don't get wireless charging, but that feature seems to be a rarity among open-ear models and almost unheard of with clip styles. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Like almost every set of open-ear buds I've tried, the XC1 are very comfortable, even after three hours of constant use, and they're a better option than ear hooks if you wear glasses. Once clipped in place, they hardly budged, even when working out. An IP66 rating gives them excellent protection against both dust and water. Showers are fine, but don't take them swimming. Onboard sensors figure out the left/right balance when you put them on. This is especially useful when dealing with the controls. Baseus uses a single button on each bud, mounted on the battery/electronics pod, and you can decide if you prefer to activate it with your thumb or index finger. The buttons are a breeze to click, and unlike touch controls, they can be used while wearing gloves. The Baseus app lets you customize the click gestures, with options for single-, double-, triple-, and long-clicks—more than enough flexibility for your preferred playback, volume, calling, and voice assistant controls. As an added convenience, the earbuds have wear sensors that auto-pause and resume your music when you remove or replace them. Baseus also deserves props for its handling of Bluetooth Multipoint. In the app, you can add a new device pairing and see a list of previously paired devices, making it easy to switch between simultaneous connections. This also makes them ideal for phone calls, because you can hear your own voice without the muffling effect of regular earbuds. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. To help with the XC1's sound (or perhaps its marketing), Baseus partnered with Bose on its three-product Inspire line, which includes the XP1 ANC earbuds and XH1 ANC headphones. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. In what I've come to think of as typical for open-ears, loud locations proved challenging, especially for spoken-word content like podcasts and calls, and the low end lost some of its punch. When things were quieter, however, they wowed me with their bass response and clarity. Using a selection of some of my favorite headphone test tracks, like Billie Eilish's “Bad Guy,” Dominique Fils-Aimé's “Birds,” and Stevie Ray Vaughn's “Tin Pan Alley,” I compared the Inspire XC1 to leading clip-style models, including the Shokz OpenDots One, Bose Open Earbuds Ultra, and Soundcore AeroClip. The XC1 didn't disappoint, with bass response that goes deeper than Bose's pricey Open Earbuds Ultra, and an overall sound signature that rivals the OpenDots One for midrange and high clarity. Open-ear earbuds have an inherently wide soundstage that gives a natural, airy feel to the sound. This is true of the XC1, making them an ideal choice for those who like Dolby Atmos Music tracks. I found only subtle differences between the presets; a custom EQ with boosted lows and highs proved most satisfying. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Speaking of critical listening, the XC1 work with Sony's hi-res capable LDAC Bluetooth codec, should you happen to own a compatible Android phone (sorry, iPhone users). Using LDAC can reveal more detail, especially when listening to a source of lossless audio, but for these earbuds, I don't think the juice is worth the squeeze. Using LDAC disables your EQ settings and Bluetooth Multipoint, and the XC1 struggle to maintain a steady Bluetooth connection when LDAC is set to its highest-quality setting. Baseus also includes two Dolby Audio modes (Music and Cinema), which are meant to create a more immersive, spatial experience. I find they wash out the sound, with Cinema being downright muddy. At 60 percent volume, there was more than enough power for an engaging listening experience indoors. Whether indoors or outdoors, your callers will find it easy to understand you, and almost all background sounds are kept at bay. However, as with most clip-style open-ear earbuds, your voice won't be crystal clear—some distortion does manage to creep in, particularly when outside. Baseus assumes 50 percent volume and does not include the use of either Dolby Audio or LDAC. Open-ear earbuds aren't for everyone, but with great sound quality, a comfortable, clip-style design, and easy-to-use controls, the Baseus Inspire XC1 are an excellent choice. They check a lot of boxes for a price that's considerably less than their nearest competitors, including strong water and dust resistance, optional LDAC mode, and Bluetooth Multipoint. Sadly, that feature has yet to see widespread adoption. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Will there ever be a time when the best gaming monitors reach their maximum speed? Is there an as-yet unknown limit on frame rates? If you subscribe to Moore's Law, you know that for decades, integrated circuits doubled their transistor density about every two years. However, this progress has slowed due to the inevitable physical limitations that arise from creating components not much larger than a molecule. Monitors have a ways to go, apparently, because fresh on the heels of my first 500 Hz OLED review, I've just cracked open the box to Asus' latest screamer: the ROG Strix XG248QSG Ace. This 24-inch TN 1080p screen operates at 600 Hz and overclocks to 610 Hz, while also offering Adaptive-Sync and two types of blur reduction. You also get HDR10, accurate wide-gamut color, and brightness over 400 nits. The XG248QSG Ace is an esports tool, much like a race car with just enough bells and whistles to be a formidable gaming screen, but without any features that would reduce frame rates, such as excessive resolution. Although many gamers are gravitating towards QHD and UHD screens due to their high pixel density, FHD remains the choice for maximum frame rates. It also utilizes a TN part, which is widely regarded as the most responsive panel technology among LCDs. Although the pixel density is relatively low at 92ppi, there are some effective picture enhancements, including HDR10 support, wide gamut color, and high brightness. Backlight zone dimming (eight horizontal zones) is also available for HDR and SDR, which, in some cases, increases contrast past the point of measurability. Speaking of that backlight, Asus has upped its game with ELMB (Extreme Low Motion Blur), its form of backlight strobing, AKA black frame insertion. You get ELMB Sync, which works along with Adaptive-Sync to remove blur and prevent frame tears. Although you sacrifice some off-axis image quality with the TN panel, it remains a bright and colorful screen. Most FHD screens with a refresh rate over 360 Hz are sRGB+ at best. You also get a bright backlight, which peaks at nearly 450 nits for SDR and over 525 nits in HDR mode. Asus includes its full suite of GamePlus aids, which feature aiming points, sniper mode, timer, stopwatch, multiple frame counters, and alignment marks. You can plug headphones into a 3.5mm jack, but there are no USB ports or internal speakers here. Video inputs include two HDMI 2.1 and a DisplayPort 1.4 with Display Stream Compression (DSC). Slick styling and premium build quality are also included. The price might be an obstacle for some. To be fair, it has no exact equal at present. However, one could also purchase a 500 Hz OLED from Asus, the XG27AQDPG, which features QHD resolution and a 27-inch screen with Quantum Dot color, for around the same price. If you're wondering how the two monitors compare, I've included said OLED in my charts so you can see for yourself. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. My XG248QSG arrived with the upright already attached; I just had to put on the small but heavy metal base with a captive bolt. The package is very solid and free of any wobble or play. The zippered pouch that ships with nearly all Asus gaming monitors contains just a DisplayPort cable and a small external power supply. With a thin bezel, it nearly pulls off the border-free look. They're large and easy to operate by feel. There are also LEDs back here, in the form of a backlit ROG logo that features multiple colors and effects through Aura Sync and Aura RGB. All of this can be controlled in the OSD or with Asus' DisplayWidget Center app. Movements befit a premium display with firm positioning and no play or slop. The stand also features a quarter-inch threaded socket at the top for items such as webcams and desk lights. The input panel is very recessed, up and under, so much so that I had trouble plugging in my fat-ended cables. There are two HDMI 2.1 ports and a DisplayPort 1.4 with DSC. There are no USB ports or internal speakers. The menu is classic Asus ROG with a logical layout and a full set of gaming and image adjustment options. The overdrive has 20 possible settings, making it very precise. ELMB Sync works with Adaptive-Sync to prevent motion blur and frame tears. If you want even more blur reduction, engage ELMB 2 with its five-level pulse width option. This is the smoothest way to play, but you might see the occasional frame tear if you look closely. It depends on the frame rate you're able to achieve. Higher rates don't need as much help, but if you run closer to 200 fps, ELMB is a great choice. Finally, alignment marks help you precisely line up multiple screens. GameVisual is the XG248QSG's picture modes and there are nine in total. Minor tweaks take it to even better accuracy. The Image menu has luminance controls along with Dynamic Dimming, which employs eight horizontal zones rather than the more typical 16 vertical ones. For HDR signals, you get three dedicated modes plus an adjust toggle that opens up brightness and contrast controls. The XG248QSG is good enough to use without adjustment but a few tweaks of the RGB values bring a small but visible improvement. Here's a tip: for sRGB color, keep it in Racing mode and choose that gamut from the Display Color Space menu. Two of the control keys can be programmed to the user's wishes and you can save settings in two memory slots for later recall. It improved grayscale tracking visibly and made a small change to the gamut as well. I used the wide gamut for SDR content, but if you'd rather use sRGB, just choose it from the available color spaces. My test PC has a GeForce RTX 4090 and the fastest frame rate I saw in Doom Eternal was 525fps. But the bottom line is that you'll need something faster than an RTX 4090 to hit the XG248QSG's full 610 Hz at FHD resolution and max detail with HDR engaged. I have reviewed many monitors with this feature and with some of them, the phasing artifact is so bad that it is unusable. ELMB Sync works seamlessly with Adaptive-Sync, and there is no brightness penalty. ELMB 2 makes it pretty much flawless with no blur at all, but you will see the occasional frame tear. And brightness is reduced somewhat, depending on how much blur reduction you dial in. The most aggressive setting eliminates all blur, has no phasing, and cuts light by around 40%. The XG248QSG is super flexible and has enough video processing options to please everyone. Gameplay is super quick, even when compared against my average skills. Pro gamers will want to check out the XG248QSG for their toolkit. However, comparing it to a fast OLED like the XG27AQDPG, I prefer the look of the OLED, not just because it's QHD but also for its better contrast and richer color. The XG248QSG is certainly colorful, more so than its LCD competitors, but it won't match the saturation of a Quantum Dot OLED. For daily use, it serves well with its 93ppi pixel density. If you're spoiled by Ultra HD screens, it won't seem sharp, but for tasks like writing or spreadsheets, it's more than adequate. The XG248QSG has excellent build quality and an intuitive menu system. Takeaway: The XG248QSG is a superb monitor and also incredibly fast. If you want to see 500 or 600fps, it's the only game in town. Just make sure you have at least an RTX 4090 in your PC. I'd love to see what an RTX 5090 would look like. Christian Eberle is a Contributing Editor for Tom's Hardware US. He's a veteran reviewer of A/V equipment, specializing in monitors.

Coil whine is an irritating phenomenon where high-pitched noises can come from a graphics card, motherboard, or power supply. Sometimes it can be obvious, but sometimes it can also be difficult to track down, especially in a noisy environment. "While testing using Switch mode..." OCCT will load up the system artificially to produce one of "three pre-defined tunes", turning the noise from a consistently audible tone into a specific tune that will make the coil whine pop out above whatever other environmental noises might be hiding it. This feature takes advantage of an inherent behavior of coil-whine, where the sound will usually increase as more power is loaded onto whatever component has coil-whine. The same can also happen when power fluctuates very fast between high and low loads. This is why most people will often only hear coil whine while they are gaming, especially while running a game at an exorbitantly high frame rate (such as 300-1000 FPS). As a reminder, audible coil whine is a natural phenomenon that can exist in several computer hardware components, primarily graphics cards, PSUs, and motherboards. Not only is it annoying, but coil whine is also highly inconsistent and won't behave the same from one system component to another, even if they are the exact same make and model. Even the behavior of coil whine can be different; some system components might coil whine only during certain (medium-load) workloads, while others might produce audible coil whine only at full load or while idling. This unique addition to OCCT's feature set probably won't be beneficial for most gamers who keep their gaming PC in their bedroom. But for offices, internet cafes, or any area where a system might be located in a harsh audible environment, this tester can be beneficial for hunting down coil whine and deciphering whether or not the annoying sound you're hearing is really coil whine or something dangerous.

I first wrote about Nimo several years ago. The startup originally had a vision to build spatial computing smart glasses, very much like Sightful's Spacetop, and while Nimo chipped away at the project for several years, it finally pivoted. Launch it on macOS, and it'll take over your desktop, providing an AI canvas to space out all of your work. The idea is that you connect your favorite apps to Nimo Infinity (the browser is based on Chromium), and rather than interacting with your apps in a traditional way, you can use the AI assistant to pull information from your app and have it generate a “Dynamic App” with a custom interface you can tailor to your taste. For example, you can ask it to “Create a beautiful daily meeting prep app, ” and it can merge your Google Calendar and Gmail data into a unique interface that blends your schedule with relevant emails so you can get prepared before hopping on Zoom. There are templates to get you started, but you can also play around with the assistant (largely powered by Anthropic's Claude) to craft anything from your connected apps—say, a financial dashboard app with data from Google Sheets. I tried to give it a spin, but unfortunately, my “Dynamic App” was stuck trying to create the app for more than 30 minutes. Right now, you can sign up for early access, and Nimo founder Rohildev Nattukallingal tells me that while Nimo Infinity is free with a limited feature set, you can pay $20 per month to access many of the core features, like Dynamic Apps. It's powered by E Ink's Spectra 6 tech, which allows pixels to be one of six colors; Aura says it has an algorithm to translate photos into a newspaper-like print style to make it look vibrant and colorful with the limited color range. Thanks to the e-paper display, the Aura Ink can last up to three months on a single charge, and Aura hopes this design will finally make it possible for folks to hang an Aura frame on their walls without worrying about an unsightly power cord. I'm currently testing this frame, so stay tuned for our review. London-based Bamford's new Mayfair 2.0 is all about modular style blended with watchmaking credentials. The 40-milimeter Mayfair 2.0 is driven by a Swiss-made Ronda 3540.D quartz chronograph movement—so solid reliability and performance (with central seconds, 1/10-second counter, 30-minute counter) are delivered while allowing this piece to stay within a relatively accessible price point. But the Mayfair 2.0 is not really about that quartz center. What sets it apart is its versatility: Each watch comes with interchangeable brightly hued outer cases made from high-density polymer that let wearers click on and swap out different-colored shells and straps. This plug-and-play approach means you get a robust sports timepiece, with 100-meter water resistance, that can change to match your mood or outfit. However, at £495 ($660), this is a fair chunk more than the Blancpain X Swatch Scuba Fifty Fathoms, and that's a proper automatic diver that's just as colorful. Many outdoor security cameras rely on batteries, making it easy to install them wherever you want, without worrying about running cables. An increasingly popular solution is the inclusion of a solar panel to keep that battery topped up, enabling you to install and potentially never touch the camera again. Both Wyze and TP-Link just revealed interesting solar-powered cameras this week. It is IP65-rated, easy to mount, and sports a small solar panel that Wyze reckons can keep the camera running on just one hour of sunlight a day (we shall see as I test through the gray depths of a Scottish winter). The Solar Cam Pan also features AI-powered person tracking, two-way audio, color night vision, a spotlight, and a siren, though you need a subscription, starting from $3 per month, to unlock smart features and get cloud video storage. Wyze also announced a new, impressively affordable Battery Video Doorbell ($66). We started testing Wyze cameras again recently after it beefed up its security policies, but the repeated security breaches, exposing thousands of camera feeds to other customers, may still give you pause. Meanwhile, TP-Link is the first manufacturer to combine solar power with floodlight capability in its new Tapo C615F Kit. The similar-looking but larger Tapo C615F is another 2K camera, but it pans 360 degrees, tilts 130 degrees, and, most importantly, has an adjustable 800-lumen floodlight. TP-Link says its solar panel only needs 45 minutes of sun a day to keep the camera ticking, and it comes with a handy 13-foot cable, so you can install the solar panel in the best spot to catch those rays. Here's more you may have missed this week: The one change is that the control dial is now a film simulation dial, with three options for custom film recipes. In time for the peak shopping season, Intel is launching a variety of "AI Experience Stores" at a few key locations around the world. We don't know exactly what they'll be like, but Intel says these pop-ups will include an "AI-powered shopping experience" of some kind and are based on the initial launch of the trial run store in London last year. If it keeps that same design ethos intact, these stores will be fairly immersive experiences. There will be lots of AI-driven demos on devices from the wider Windows laptop ecosystem, presumably to help drive interest and curiosity in what PCs can do. Interestingly, it comes on the back of a significant marketing push by Microsoft with its new Windows 11 AI experiences, trying to convince buyers to upgrade and explain some of the new AI features. Here are the dates and locations below for when Intel's stores will be open.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For residents of the southeastern United States, fall signals the return of Joro spiders—huge, bright yellow arachnids from Asia—haunting porches, gardens, and just about anywhere big enough for casting enormous webs. Joros don't typically pose serious threats to humans. But their autumnal abundance does appear to be the source of significant irritation for local residents—something that David Coyle, an entomologist at Clemson University, knows better than most, as South Carolina's state advisor for invasive species. After years of fielding Joro-related complaints, Coyle and his team decided to officially investigate these inquiries—a years-long effort resulting in two studies addressing the most common questions about Joro spiders, published Wednesday, October 22, in the Journal of Medical Entomology and the Journal of Economic Entomology. The following conversation has been lightly edited for grammar and clarity. David Coyle: Joro spiders are native to China and parts of Asia. This is the fifth year of our “spider surveys,” as we call them. And, where you have high populations of Joro spiders, you have little to no native or weaving spiders of that type. It's still too early to know what their true impact will be, but we're trying to track that down. Gizmodo: Why do people consider Joros pests? Coyle: They're incredibly pestiferous, in that they are very comfortable being in and around human structures and landscapes. They're also very big and yellow, so people notice them, and we get lots of calls about these things every fall. Joro spiders are all over north Georgia this year…#spider #joro #jorospider #georgia #crawling #trichonephila #arachnophobia #arachnid #arachnids Coyle: Broadly speaking, “How do I get rid of them?” Whether that's “on my favorite bush outside” or “they put a web across the pillars to my house.” The second most common question is, “Are they dangerous? Because these webs are huge—they can be 10, 15, or 20 feet across—and you walk into them to find a big spider on your head. When the adult females, these great big yellow-and-gray striped females, appear all over the place, people think, “Holy crap, what is going on out there?” Gizmodo: And what advice are you giving the callers? We wanted to get concrete answers that weren't just anecdotal. Based on the cumulative years of our team's experience, we knew what happened here. And how did you answer these questions in the paper? That was in response to the question, “How can I get rid of them?” So we looked online because we figured this was where people go to find solutions. Then we also evaluated things that we just found online: bleach, machine lubricant, hairspray, and some of these non-pest products that people used. In a scientifically legitimate and systematic way, we tested every one of these compounds on a bunch of spiders to see if it would kill them, and if so, how long it would take. If not, will it at least make the spider leave? Because for some people, maybe they just want it off their porch—not necessarily dead. What we ended up finding was that most of the commercial products work great. I'm not going to list any specific brands, but if it's labeled as a spider control, that stuff works pretty darn good. I mean, machine lubricant works, but we do not advocate spraying that stuff all over your yard. We strongly recommend just using the stuff that's labeled for that purpose, because it works just as well. Gizmodo: The second paper is about whether Joros are dangerous, right? We did a series of tests where we looked at a spider's reaction to, basically, the human hand. And in almost every case, that spider just wants to get away. If you cup them in your hands, they just sort of sit there and freeze. The only time you can really get them to bite is when you pinch them—like, really aggravating it. Then we said, “Okay, let's say that someone does get bit. How bad is it?” We got 22 volunteers and had them get bitten by Joros. So it'll be a little swollen, red, and itchy for about 24 hours, then it pretty much goes away. So the take-home message is that, if you're going to get bit by a Joro spider, you've pretty much got to be really antagonizing the spider. Gizmodo: You probably brought it upon yourself. They would rather not be held by you. They just want to do their thing and be left alone. And if you accidentally walk into them, what's their response? Gizmodo: Having said all that, do you have any personal advice for coexisting with Joro spiders? And if you just knock them out of their web a few days in a row, they're going to take off and go somewhere else. I always tell people that using chemicals for something like this is often overkill, figuratively speaking. They don't want to be in your house. This type of spider in general puts its webs between big things outside so stuff can fly into it.

The amber fossils preserve an impressive array of ancient bugs and plants that scientists are using to piece together a previously unknown Cretaceous ecosystem. Queen Iberian harvester ants are capable of storing and cloning the sperm from a cousin species, spawning hybrid offspring to take on the hard work of keeping the colony intact. At least two different populations of a parasitic wasp native to Europe have been found on opposite coasts of North America. But no one knows how they got there. Sheetweb spiders don't immediately pounce on fireflies caught in their webs, and for good reason, according to new research. New research highlights how nonnative tick species are regularly being introduced into the country through travel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI's recently launched Atlas browser is a fascinating inversion of what users may expect from a browser, centering AI answers above traditional web links. Every click in Atlas is a chance to use ChatGPT. Just typed a question into the address bar? The Ask ChatGPT sidebar can see and analyze what's on your screen. The “agent mode” can click around on Amazon and throw some vampire fangs into your cart. He asked it to summarize GitHub code appearing on the web page in his browser. He called it “a major unlock,” since ChatGPT can now see what's happening on the page. "It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet," O'Rouke said. Here, ChatGPT shows up as another column-constrained bot on the right side of your screen, in the same vein as the AI sidebars in Perplexity's Comet browser and Microsoft's Edge. After a few days of testing OpenAI's Ask ChatGPT feature in the Atlas Browser, I'm convinced that I want to surf the web alone. The browser is built using Chromium, an open-source browser project managed by Google that provides the codebase for Chrome, Opera, and others. Because of this, Atlas looks a lot like Chrome. (As I swiped between the two browsers on my laptop during testing, I forgot which was which a couple of times.) The nascent browser's best days are still ahead of it, with a roadmap of upcoming features such as tab groups and an ad-blocker that could build it up to be a more fully realized competitor to Chrome. It's available only on macOS for the time being. Not only was it difficult to get used to, I found myself having trouble thinking of questions to ask about the news articles, online recipes, and other web pages as I scrolled around. While browsing the Xbox website for what game to potentially play next, Madden NFL 26 was one of ChatGPT's suggestions after it analyzed the page. A pretty vanilla answer, and not very in line with what the bot knows about me, despite having more than a year's worth of my ChatGPT interactions to pull from for insights. In another example of the sidebar being underwhelming in this first iteration, I was looking through my personal Gmail inbox with Ask ChatGPT open. I requested help deciding what message to answer first, and its suggestion was to prioritize one I had already answered. Next, I was on the Rotten Tomatoes website trying to decide if Bugonia would be a good date night movie to see in theaters. The oddest, and most memorable, interaction I had with ChatGPT Atlas occurred as I scrolled around on Bluesky and asked it to highlight any trends it saw. (ChatGPT listed “political anxiety” and “everyday absurdism" as two of the trends on my timeline.) I was curious what would happen if I opened my Bluesky DMs, which amounted to just a few old messages from friends. “Opening your DMs won't expose anything to me—I'll simply stop ‘seeing' the page until you go back to a public view (like your feed, profile, or a post),” read part of ChatGPT's answer. Knowing that my Bluesky DMs don't have anything sensitive, I gave it a whirl. I received a response from ChatGPT that included facts culled from the conversation, along with details about the sender. “I do not have access to your private messages or account data unless you explicitly paste or show that text to me in the chat,” read ChatGPT's response. '—temporarily surfaced part of the message context so I could answer your question. But I don't have any background or visibility into your inbox beyond what you actively bring into our conversation.” The first answer the Ask ChatGPT sidebar spit out is a potential example of an AI “hallucination,” aka error, that's common during interactions with generative AI tools. While some users may appreciate having a chatbot always pulled up on the side of their screen, ready to surface related facts or summarize details, it felt like an unreliable tour guide to me. One who was overly confident in its bland responses and taking up too much space. I'll keep testing Atlas as my main browser for the next few weeks, but for now, I'm leaving that sidebar closed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And with that, Amazon's foray into live streaming NBA games tipped off. The matchup — Celtics vs. Knicks — was part of an 11-year deal that gives Amazon exclusive rights to select regular season and playoff games. The stream ran seamlessly across Fire TV, iPhone, and MacBook. Amazon's 1080p HDR video and 5.1 surround sound were a slam dunk. The broadcast looked and felt like a traditional national telecast. The graphics mirrored what fans expect from ESPN or TNT, the commentary came from familiar voices — Eagle and Stan Van Gundy — and the pregame show from featured a slick set with former NBA stars at Amazon MGM Studios. But under the surface, Amazon quietly tested a new frontier: in-stream sports betting. Fans watching on Fire TV could log into their FanDuel accounts through Prime Video to view real-time betting information and track wagers directly within the broadcast. You can't make actual bets on Prime Video — not yet, at least— but it marks a subtle yet significant shift in how live sports may evolve on streaming platforms. And it comes at a fascinating moment: the NBA is dealing with a major betting scandal that made headlines this week and involves the FBI. I was surprised when NBA Commissioner Adam Silver joined the broadcast for a live interview. Sideline reporter Cassidy Hubbarth opened by asking about the scandal. Silver said he was “deeply disturbed” upon hearing the news. Amazon has other new tech-fueled features including advanced NBA stats powered by Amazon Web Services — but I didn't notice that during Friday's broadcast. Navigation wasn't intuitive, and the remote's button mapping made simple actions harder than expected. Bloomberg reported that Amazon is paying $1.8 billion annually for the NBA rights. As more people cut the cord, sports leagues are increasingly partnering with tech companies as their existing deals with traditional cable providers expire. Companies like Amazon, Apple, and Netflix are hungry for valuable content such as live sports to draw more subscribers to their respective platforms. Amazon also aired the Timberwolves vs. Lakers game on Friday evening. The company also separate deals to air the NFL's Thursday Night Football, WNBA, and Premier League, among other sports-related programming on its Prime Video platform. The NBA debut on Friday was a reminder of Amazon's approach to live sports: combine the reliability of broadcast TV with subtle tech layers — such as betting, data, and e-commerce — built on its AWS cloud infrastructure and Prime membership model.
