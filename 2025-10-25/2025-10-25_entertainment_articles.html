                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Season 2 of Nobody Wants This featured several notable guest appearances, but one pair of actors in particular kept Adam Brody on his toes. The actor praised the “very funny and talented” Seth Rogen‘s performance as Rabbi Neil in Season 2, now available to stream on Netflix, as well as Kate Berlant‘s portrayal of his wife Rabbi Cami after the pair “went way off-script” for the show. Brody added, “Fortunately, that was the dynamic on the page too, in those scenes, Noah's more of a bystander.” Explaining that Rabbi Neil is a “rock and roll rabbi” to his character's “more buttoned-up one,” Brody's Noah interviews for a job with the couple's temple. Listen, he'd be great to have in any way, shape or form,” said Brody of Rogen, adding: “I think he's just a great fit.” Created by Erin Foster and inspired by her own marriage, Nobody Wants This stars Brody as Rabbi Noah, who makes waves in his Jewish family when he sparks a romance with sex and relationship podcaster Joanne (Kristen Bell), a Gentile.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: ABC is putting work into finding the next big TV music competition series — and it has turned to a maestro of the genre to test a new format. Deadline hears that the Disney-owned network has set Simon Cowell as a judge on a proof-of-concept taping of Who's In The Band, a talent search for the next One Direction. He will judge alongside a panel that includes Joe Jonas, Spice Girl Mel B (a frequent Cowell collaborator on America's Got Talent and beyond), and songwriter Savan Kotecha. Rei Ami, who provided Zoey's singing voice in Netflix sensation KPop Demon Hunters, is on hosting duties.

Sources say the presentation will not air on ABC, and there is no series greenlight. ABC currently has veteran reality series American Idol — which made Cowell a household name in the US with its original incarnation on Fox — returning for a new season in early 2026. Cowell has never featured as a judge on an ABC reality series, sitting out of the network's American Idol reboot. He did collaborate with ABC on American Inventor in 2006, but only as a producer. Cowell has remained a fixture on network TV as a judge and executive producer on NBC's America's Got Talent. Mark Sidaway, former The X Factor showrunner and Yes Yes Media's head of entertainment, is involved in producing Who's In The Band. Music reality series focused on assembling a group have been around for years. Popular groups that have come out of signing competitions include One Direction and Fifth Harmony, both created on Cowell's The X-Factor. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Their most creative collaboration, 2023's “The Last Repair Shop,” led director Ben Proudfoot and Kris Bowers to a Best Documentary Short Oscar win the next year. It's like, ‘OK, it's six months of my life,'” Proudfoot told IndieWire during an interview at the 2025 Middleburg Film Festival. “When you decide, ‘OK, this project feels like it's part of my body of work,' it's a big decision, one that I take seriously.” Though he has mostly worked as a film and TV composer on projects like “Green Book,” “Bridgerton,” and Original Score nominee “The Wild Robot,” Bowers' work with Proudfoot also includes the Oscar-nominated short “A Concerto Is a Conversation” as co-director. But joining him on this newer, longer, global venture has the composer excited “just be a part of what was already being created.” Related Stories Jeremy Strong Loves Figuring Out Real People, from Mark Zuckerberg to Jon Landau in ‘Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere' ‘Boorman and the Devil' Review: This Deep Dive Into How ‘Exorcist II: The Heretic' Spiraled Out of Control Deserves a Wide Release Furthermore, when colonizers attempted to burn all evidence of Nkrumah's time as a revolutionary leader, Hesse snuck his reels out of Ghana, and into a London vault, where the footage has spent decades inside, waiting to be digitized. While in Ghana during the COVID-19 pandemic, shooting a film for UNICEF, “the whole van of us, the crew, we're driving down this main thoroughfare, and I saw this unusually shaped building and a statue of a man pointing. They said, ‘Oh, that's the mausoleum for Kwame Nkrumah.' “We know Gandhi, we know Martin Luther King Jr., we know all these figures from history who are responsible for leading a movement that changed the course of a continent or hundreds of millions of people. Naturally curious, Proudfoot inquired whether he could speak to anyone who knew the politician, and his crew excitedly pointed him toward Hesse, a now-nonagenarian who worked as Nkrumah's personal cinematographer, shooting everything on 16mm and 35mm. Though they were 60 years and an ocean apart, Proudfoot and Hesse became fast friends united in the idea of getting the word out there to maintain this treasure trove of footage. “That's my mission in life,” Hesse told the director. Nkrumah was crucial in jumpstarting the Ghanaian film industry, building a studio to produce work that conveys an Africa that defies the expectations promoted by colonizers. “If I say, ‘Oh, here's a documentary set in Africa,' you immediately have certain expectations of what that might be, based on documentaries you've seen in the past or world hunger infomercials on the TV or whatever. Which is not a broad understanding of what's going on, which was Kwame Nkrumah's whole point in the first place,” said Proudfoot. And Chris Hesse is an extraordinary film artist, a cinematographer,” said Proudfoot. Bower said, “I've always just been really curious about any sort of scoring of an African project.” Upon formally accepting the offer to once again work with his friend Proudfoot, Bowers said, “I'm aware of the deep history and tradition with music, and so that was my first bit of excitement as a composer, trying to figure out how to incorporate some of that into the score.” “I would ask about the gyil, which is a mallet instrument, and was asking, ‘What key does that play in typically?' And the musician I was speaking with was like, ‘Well, actually that's usually tuned to whomever the singer is.' And so that made me inspired to tune themes to each of the characters' speaking voices and [spend] time transcribing the way they spoke, to see what key range did they speak in.” For instance, the charismatic Hesse was in the key of F Mixolydian. To play the atenteben, a bamboo flute, Bowers recruited Dela Botri based on impressive videos of the Ghanaian musician performing. “You could watch him playing jazz riffs and all this stuff. Bowers was hesitant to use the talking drum after the instrument's prominence in Ludwig Göransson's Oscar-winning “Black Panther” score, but ultimately, “it's such a huge part of Ghanaian history that it felt like I can't not put that in there. And also, it felt weird that ‘Black Panther' for some reason would make it so that I can't use an instrument when I'm writing a score for an African film.” Bowers did, however, come to a point where inspiration began getting in the way of execution. Producer Moses Bwayo (and co-director of recent Best Documentary Feature nominee “Bobi Wine: The People's President”) helped convince the prolific, Oscar-winning shorts director Proudfoot to make this his feature directorial debut. And sometimes when you make a movie, the idea is that people want to escape. And so if that's the reason why you're watching the movie — which is different, there's a different kind of intention — you don't want to spend more time than you need to. A lot of documentaries, especially over the last 10 years, have been designed to suck up as much of your time as possible. That's why I've been so interested in short films, because it's the opposite.” He added, “With this film, even though it's in the category of a feature-length documentary, it's a lot packed into 89 minutes. As my career has gone on, what I'm committed to less so is format, of short form or feature film, and more just elegance and a richness. “Those reels that are in the archive, they're mainly short documentaries. This resurfacing of Hesse's footage is “the opposite of what's happening in America and a lot of the world, which is history being erased, not being able to talk about a war on information. And this is an opening and a blooming of new history, which I think is very exciting,” said Proudfoot. “We're very proud to be a part of that and drawing attention to that, not just in Ghana, but really across all Africa. “The Eyes of Ghana” is the first independent feature produced by Barack and Michelle Obama's production company Higher Ground, and has yet to find a distributor, but Proudfoot's urgency lies more with encouraging the digitization of Hesse's archive than rushing into a deal to release the film in theaters. “It's just about remembering why we made this movie and continuing to pound the pavement and find people who get it, who understand it, and who believe this is an important story that must be told,” he said. “These kinds of stories, often African narratives, they just get left off. Proudfoot added, “Part of what we're doing with the film is helping Chris in his mission to reframe this archive, not as a nice-to-have, but as an essential piece of history.” [claps] ‘Here's an award,' or ‘We think you're great.' This archive, if we don't pay attention, it's going to be gone in 15 years,” he said. I think it must help solve that problem.” “The Eyes of Ghana” world-premiered at TIFF before playing Middleburg.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rush's Geddy Lee talked about getting prepared for the band's upcoming reunion tour — and his beloved Toronto Blue Jays making the World Series — in a new interview with CBC News. “Well, I'm a bit overwhelmed right now, to be honest. Alex [Lifeson] and I took a long time trying to figure out if we could actually do this ever again,” Lee said of the reaction to the 50 Something tour. I had just decided that after writing all these books and having the experience of doing television shows that I needed to make some music again,” Lee said. “So I've been working out pretty regularly trying to get my fingers, these little digits, back in shape. We're gonna put a lot of hours into that.” Lee added that Rush won't be staging three-hour concerts like “in our younger years, but we're certainly gonna play over two hours. And we'll get a lot of songs in, for sure.” For the reunion tour, Rush recruited drummer Anika Nilles, who came highly recommended by Lee's bass tech after the two worked together on Jeff Beck's final tour, where Nilles served as that guitarist's drummer. How do we replace the irreplaceable, so to speak?,” Lee said. “And we have been fortunate to have been introduced to the name Anika Nilles through one of my road crew — my bass tech Skully, who was on tour with Jeff Beck — and she was the drummer for Jeff Beck on his last tour. And he came home from that tour raving about her. And so when we made the decision to see what it's like to play with another drummer, we contacted her, and she's just a fantastic person. And by the end of it, we were convinced that this would be a go for us.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jeremy Allen White's Bruce Springsteen spends the bulk of his time in Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere brooding over the songs that would become Nebraska in a Colts Neck, New Jersey, rental house. Who just happen to look like an amalgamation of the present-day rock acts Greta Van Fleet and Rival Sons. Dubbed Cats on a Smooth Surface, the Pony's house band was in fact a real group, led by frontman Bobby Bandiera, who at one point nearly joined Springsteen's E Street Band. When putting together the Stone Pony band for Deliver Me From Nowhere, producers clearly leaned on Cobb's connections, casting GVF guitarist Jake Kiszka and bassist Sam Kiszka as the Cats' guitar and bass player, respectively, and Rival Sons' singer Jay Buchanan as Bandiera — though he's listed as “Cats on a Smooth Surface – Lead Singer” in the credits. “Our journey with this project began through Dave Cobb… Dave's involvement sparked the connection, and soon he was appointed musical director for the film,” Greta Van Fleet's Jake Kiszka tells Rolling Stone. Scott Cooper, the director, was searching for a ‘young, hip rock ‘n' roll band' – someone like Greta Van Fleet, he suggested. Buchanan, while depicted as more of a Bob Seger-type figure than the real-life Bandiera, is magnetic onstage, howling and shuffling his way through “Lucille” with White's Springsteen jamming behind him. (At a recent tribute to John Fogerty in Nashville, Buchanan stole the show with his bare-foot rendition of CCR's “Fortunate Son.”) The Kiszka brothers, who make up Greta Van Fleet with sibling Josh on vocals and Danny Wagner on drums, strike their best bar-band poses onstage at the Pony, and even have a speaking line outside on the Asbury Park sidewalk following a gig. Nelly Furtado Is Stepping Away From Performing ‘For the Foreseeable Future' ‘A House of Dynamite' Is Not the Armageddon Procedural You're Looking For Ace Frehley's Solo Bandmates on What the Kiss Guitarist Was Really Like “Working with Jeremy was a captivating adventure on multiple levels,” Jake Kiszka adds. Cameos like these in Deliver Me From Nowhere, along with other inspired casting decisions like Marc Maron as studio engineer Chuck Plotkin, Yeah Yeah Yeahs drummer Brian Chase as E Street's Max Weinberg, and label impresario Jimmy Iovine as himself (that's Iovine's real voice screaming at Jon Landau over the phone) are a treat for rock fans.</p>

While Oscar nominee Jeremy Strong (“The Apprentice”) could be back at the Oscars for the second year in a row for his subtle, moving performance as manager Jon Landau in “Bruce Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,” he's neither rooting for himself nor for another character actor he admires, Sean Penn in “One Battle After Another.” As a member of this year's Cannes jury, Strong is an unabashed fan of Norway's Cannes prize-winning Oscar entry, “Sentimental Value.” “Give Stellan Skarsgård the Oscar, please,” he said as we sat down at the Four Seasons in Los Angeles. I can't help but notice his rusty, close-cropped haircut. He's in prep to play Mark Zuckerberg in writer/director Aaron Sorkin's sequel to 2010's “The Social Network,” “The Social Reckoning” (October 9, 2026), set 17 years later and without Jesse Eisenberg. It covers a stretch between 2018 and 2021, when Facebook moved from “move fast and break things,” said Strong, to “move fast with stable infrastructure.

Strong played Jerry Rubin in Best Picture nominee “The Trial of the Chicago 7,” which Sorkin wrote and directed, and starred in Sorkin's directorial debut “Molly's Game.” “The Social Reckoning” screenplay is “one of the best scripts I've ever read,” said Strong. Per usual, Strong is hoovering up everything he can about Zuckerberg. His prep, influenced by early mentor Daniel Day-Lewis, involves a “deep dive on everything,” he said, “trying to understand and defend a point of view of a character, what it is they believe in, what they're fighting for, maybe understand what might be blind spots. But the most important thing for me is an empathic connection to a person. We would all do well to walk a day in anybody's shoes before casting aspersions and judgment.” “He is someone who has shaped the world we live in. I feel an enormous responsibility for accuracy and understanding.” Zuckerberg is just one of a gallery of real people that Strong has taken on, including powerbroker Roy Cohn, one of the most maligned figures in New York, who Strong not only made believable but empathetic in “The Apprentice.” “I find Roy's journey a tragic journey,” he said. “I find Kendall Roy's journey [in the Emmy-winning ‘Succession'], even though he's a composite character, a tragic journey.” Strong also admires Anthony Hopkins, his co-star on James Gray's “Armageddon Time,” who has played Richard Nixon, Adolf Hitler, Pablo Picasso, C.S. In “Deliver Me from Nowhere,” Strong plays a real person, Jon Landau, an influential music critic who proclaimed Springsteen as the future of rock in the pages of Rolling Stone and quietly and firmly, behind the scenes, helped his friend to manage his career and recover from debilitating depression. The film is set during the 1982 recording of “Nebraska,” a bare-bones acoustic album of dark songs that Springsteen needed to get off his chest before he could publish such rock anthems as “Born to Run,” which he had already written, that would make him a rock legend. Having gotten to work closely with Springsteen on “Deliver Me from Nowhere,” Strong is a fan: “I've just come out of this press conference with Bruce, who gives 10,000 percent. Movingly, “Deliver Me from Nowhere” shows how Landau cares for Springsteen and stands up for him at a time when he needs support. “At this moment in time, 1982, it is not a given that Bruce would go on to be the Bruce Springsteen we know him to be today,” said Strong, “simply because of his struggles with mental health and depression, as William Styron said, ‘a darkness visible,' and that darkness was pressing down on him, and he did not have the equipment internally to handle it. It's not something anyone can handle on their own.” A few years older than Springsteen, Landau “was a father figure to Bruce at this time,” said Strong, “had been in therapy, had had a broader education, was steeped in literature and the history of art and the history of music, and he was able to help Bruce take this step to getting professional help. This movie that Scott Cooper has made is the story of Bruce shaking hands with his own past, his trauma, the wounds that we all carry and that often remain untreated or buried. “Nebraska” also marked a moment in time before Springsteen was about to hit big. He was lost in the vortex of this world that we're in, the pressures and expectations of success, fame. Bruce said once that all of his songs are about a person trying to find and save some part of himself. It's surprising the executives went along with “Nebraska” at all. “‘The River' was a massive album,” said Strong, “but he wasn't yet in the stratosphere that he then went on to be. When Jon Landau goes into Columbia Records and sits down with Al Teller, people listen to Jon Landau. He was not perceiving in a calculated way why this would or wouldn't be a savvy career move — not that he didn't give a shit about career, because he did.” Strong and Jeremy Allen White as Springsteen bonded effectively to create this close relationship. Part of what you do is you create a dynamic that mirrors a dynamic, and it was easy for me to feel a devotion and a love for Jeremy, also given what was at stake, similar to Sebastian [Stan] having to play Donald Trump, a character that is an iconic, monolithic character. You are up there like Philippe Petit, walking on that high wire. So it was easy for me to feel a solicitude, a protectiveness, and an empathy and care for him. One key scene between the two men involves a piece of music, instigated by Strong. “They would play each other music all night. And it was the night before we were shooting this scene, where Jon goes over to Bruce's house in Colts Neck, a beautifully scripted scene where they say the things that they're feeling to each other. About 45 minutes later, he texted Landau: Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers' “Last Mile of the Way.” “I listened to it,” said Strong, “and was floored. It's about passing through a dark valley before you get to arrive somewhere.” And after they shot the scene, he said, “Scott, can I try something?” And Cooper said, “Can you tell me what it is?” And I said, “No, I'd rather not.” “It's a five-hour film that Bob Elswit is shooting, an allegory of the rise of fascism in the world.” Also in the works is a Paramount six-hour limited series created by Tobias Lindholm about September 11 first responders. “There's an embarrassment of riches right now,” said Strong, “and I don't take it for granted.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It has been a tradition for the reigning Miss USA contestant to crown her successor. The show took place on Friday, October 24, and was aired at 5 p.m. PST, straight from the Grand Sierra Resort & Casino in Reno, Nevada. But why was Cooper missing, and what have fans said about her absence? Cooper explained her decision in an Instagram post on Friday, October 24, hours before the live show would air. That relentless pursuit fueled me to graduate from West Point top 50 in my class, run three marathons in 10 months and become a Knight Hennessy Fellow at Stanford University,” she wrote in the caption of photos. She continued, “I am a firm believer that excellence means nothing if it stops with me. Instead I want my growth to be something others can build on. After much consideration, I've made the extremely difficult decision not to attend this year's Miss USA pageant and crowning ceremony. Incredible person and I couldn't be more amazed by who you are,” a comment reads. “Looking forward to what's next for you queen,” another fan shared. A third comment reads, “Thank you Alma for your service and for truly living by your motto to serve and not be served. Shanna Moakler wrote, “You are an example of class, integrity, and strength. I'm so honored to be your Miss Usa sister..” I am so proud of you for knowing your self worth and for completing a reign that was pretty much impossible. YOU kept the title ALIVE all on your own,” a supportive comment reads from model and former Miss USA 2011 Alyssa Campanella wrote. “You will go down in history as one of the hardest-working, most determined Miss USAs we have ever had.

Speaking on SiriusXM's Bon Jovi Radio, the frontman opened up about how his longtime New Jersey peer Bruce Springsteen ended up contributing harmonica to a new version of “Hollow Man,” a fan-favorite track from Forever.

Although Greif-Neill and Jepsen met in 2021, they didn't start dating immediately. They first built a friendship and work relationship before making things official in 2022. On October 4, 2025, Jepsen and Greif-Neill officially tied the knot in front of 100 guests in a ceremony officiated by Jepsen's aunt and uncle. Ultimately, she found her two dresses on opposite coasts. In Los Angeles, Jepsen selected a Toni Maticevski dress from Loho Bride. She found her second dress in New York at Danielle Frankel. She also donned pearl earring made by her mother. Greif-Neill, meanwhile, wore a cream suit from Husbands in Paris paired with Gucci shoes. Her bridesmaids selected their own dresses in a jewel-toned color palette. The way Jepsen describes her wedding sounds like magic. Although it's hard for any event to be absolutely perfect, Jepsen wouldn't change anything about her special day. It was better than either one of our wildest dreams. We felt connected through the whole thing, which was really important to us. Jepsen released her most recent album “The Loveliest Time,” in 2023. Hopefully she'll write and share a new album soon!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(Who doesn't remember laughing their guts out at Golden Globe Best Comedy The Martian?) Mostly, though, the Globes' ongoing category brain serves as a reminder of how weird trying to make these simple demarcations can be. Take Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another, a film that is undeniably funny (and harrowing, and occasionally shockingly violent), but much harder to slot into any one specific genre category. Not if you're the Globes, though: That sucker's a laugh riot. This is per Variety, which reports that Warner Bros. has now officially submitted Anderson's film in the awards show's comedy categories. Variety notes that One Battle (which has enjoyed significant critical and word-of-mouth buzz since it hit theaters last month) may have a decent chance of breaking some records this year; the addition of a new category for casting has widened the Globes' award pool out a bit, and the film is reportedly on track to score at least a nomination in most of the categories it's nominated for.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>'Chainsaw Man — The Movie: Reza Arc' is another major victory for Japanese anime, while 'Regretting You' is edging out 'Black Phone 2' and 'Deliver Me From Nowhere: Springsteen' in a surprise twist. Japanese anime feature Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc is off to an impressive start at the U.S. box office, where it topped Friday's chart with $8.5 million from 3,003 theaters. The acclaimed manga pic — now on course to open to a better-than-expected $15 million to $17 million —boasts a perfect 100 percent critics score and a 99 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, a rarely seen combo, in addition to five out of five stars on exit polling service PostTrak. Since launching in cinemas last month in Japan, Chainsaw Man has already grossed north of $64 million at the global box office. Produced by MAPPA, the R-rated pic is based on the hit anime TV series, available to stream on Disney+, Crunchyroll and other platforms. World Series 2025: Where to Stream the L.A. Dodgers vs. Toronto Blue Jays Online Without Cable But when his beloved chainsaw-powered, devil-dog Pochita (Shiori Izawa) makes a deal and sacrifices himself, Benji is reborn with the ability to transform parts of his body into chainsaws. However, Reza is not quite who she seems, and a series of battles ensues that could destroy Tokyo when their love story takes a twisted turn. “It's safe to say that manga and anime fans won't be disappointed, even if they'll inevitably be nitpicking about one narrative aspect or another,” writes THR in its review. Heading into its U.S. opening, Chainsaw Man was expected to battle Blumhouse and Universal's holdover hit Black Phone 2 for No. But it quickly pulled ahead of the pack after earning an impressive $3.4 million in Thursday previews (as with all films, preview grosses are folded into Friday's opening-day number). In another surprise twist, Regretting You — the second Colleen Hoover book adaptation to hit the big screen after 2024's box office blockbuster It Ends With Us — pulled ahead of holdover Black Phone 2 and Disney's new bio-drama Deliver Me From Nowhere: Springsteen to come in second on Friday with $5.2 million from 3,593 locations for a better-than-expected opening of $13 million. It's also clearly benefiting from a glut of male-skewing fare that has dominated the marquee for months, as well as Hoover's popularity. (She's one of many who are caught up in the ongoing legal battle between It Ends With Us director/producer Justin Baldoni and actress/producer Blake Lively). The new film is described as a romantic drama that speaks to the aspirational theme of living life fully and with no regrets. Instead of holding Thursday previews, Constantin Films and Paramount hosted a special Regretting You fan event at AMC Lincoln Square in New York City for that was streamed live into 500 theaters across the country that included screening of the pic was accompanied by a Q&A with director Josh Boone and cast members Allison Williams, Dave Franco and Mason Thames. Saturday will determine whether Regretting You can hold its lead over Blumhouse and Universal's holdover hit Black Phone 2, which earned $3.8 million on Friday and is projecting a debut in the $12 million-plus range. The pic is holding in remarkably well for a horror title. Springsteen, playing in a total of 3,460 cinemas, should see a boost from 250 IMAX runs and an additional 750  in other premium large-format auditoriums. The music-infused pic stars Jeremy Allen White in the titular role, and who is credited in THR‘s review for giving a “raw and internalized performance as The Boss.” Jeremy Strong, Stephen Graham and Odessa Young also star in director Scott Cooper's examination of a brutal comedown after a blockbuster tour, which yielded the prolific musician's most personal album. At the specialty box office, Neon is launching Shelby Oaks in 1,823 locations. Marking YouTube movie critic Chris Stuckmann‘s debut feature, the found-footage pic is eyeing an opening in the $2 million to $2.5 million range. So far, it's main claim to fame is that it raised $1.4 million via a Kickstarter campaign, the highest amount ever for a horror title, per the crowd-sourcing platform. Focus Features' awards contender Bugonia is also making headlines in its limited debut at the specialty box office. Directed by Yargos Lanthimos, the acclaimed film stars Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>
