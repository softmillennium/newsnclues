                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defender Heather Mitts played the ball forward from her position at right back. While forward Abby Wambach chased the ball down, Morgan anticipated how the play was unfolding, as a proficient forward often does. She made an overlapping run toward goal so when Wambach flicked a header into Morgan's path, the budding star stayed composed to give herself the opportunity to score. “It was a great first goal, and I'm excited to be back at that stadium and be honored in this way so many years later.” Two Women's World Cups and an Olympic gold medal later, Morgan will have the chance to revisit that epic beginning when the U.S. Women's National Team returns to Pennsylvania for a friendly on Oct. 23. Prior to kickoff against Portugal at Subaru Park, Morgan will be honored for her illustrious career, and the first 2,000 fans through the gate will receive a limited-edition bobblehead. Wambach will be there at the stadium on Thursday to help celebrate her former forward line running mate. “To have the first assist ever be from Abby was very fitting because I had so many great years up top with her,” Morgan said. 1 goal scorer in Women's National Team history, Morgan elevated to become the team's primary target up top for the next several years. The pair scored a total of 307 goals combined during their international careers and individually finished top-5 in program history in scoring. Last fall, Morgan announced her retirement from club and country, finishing her international career with 176 combined goals and assists, the fifth most all-time. The 36-year-old is one of several notable names from a star-studded class of U.S. Women's National Team icons who have retired in the last few years including Megan Rapinoe, Julie Ertz, Becky Sauerbrunn, Meghan Klingenberg, Tobin Heath and most recently Christen Press. That run includes titles at the 2015 and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, where Morgan recorded a total of seven goals across those two tournaments. For Morgan, retirement means a plethora of new opportunities that she's primed to tackle with the same fearless tenacity she displayed on the pitch. As one of the most iconic female athletes in the world, Morgan takes pride in using her position to raise awareness for female athletes and champion women's causes. “There are a lot of things that I'm doing now on the business side that I'm really proud of,” she said. “Having the background in sports has given me so much to be able to feel like I can accomplish a lot now in the business world.” Her venture fund, Trybe Ventures, which she runs with her husband Servando Carrasco, invests in early-stage companies focused on sports and health technology. Morgan's advocacy for highlighting the women's game reflects the narrative driven by fellow industry leaders such as U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes and Washington Spirit majority owner Michele Kang. These thought leaders in the sport support viewing soccer through a female lens. “The biggest thing is conversations about it,” Morgan said. “Brands having the awareness to do that and in the studies that are being looked at, in regard to them being female-specific, it is incredibly important.” With two children of her own, Morgan is also a fierce, vocal advocate for working mothers. “Parental leave is a huge thing, and as we look at support for parents in the game, the things that mothers have to go through when growing a baby is different than men,” she said. “There's a lot of things that can be looked at differently, but we're in a really good place where people now acknowledge that. We're evolving when it comes to women's sports and looking at that from a different lens.” She also wants to see European-style academies develop at women's clubs in the United States so kids have a better steppingstone to enter the game. But after more than 15 years of rigorous training and constant competition, both internationally and on the club level, Morgan is also allowing herself to take a well-earned breath. “Before retiring, I never had a weekend free – it just didn't exist as an athlete,” Morgan explained.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA has announced that more than one million tickets have already been sold for the FIFA World Cup 26™, marking a major milestone on the road to football's biggest-ever tournament. Fans from 212 countries and territories have secured their seats following the completion of the Visa Presale Draw phase, which ran from mid-September. They were followed by fans from England, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Argentina, and France, rounding out the top ten markets for ticket sales. With 28 national teams already qualified, the early appetite for tickets has surpassed expectations. “What an exciting step on our journey toward 2026!” Infantino said. “As national teams compete for their place at the historic FIFA World Cup 26™, I am thrilled that so many football-loving fans also want to be part of this watershed event in North America.” For those who missed out during the presale, the Early Ticket Draw phase opens Monday, 27 October, offering another opportunity to secure seats. To protect supporters from unauthorised sales, FIFA's official resale platform is already available via FIFA.com/tickets, allowing eligible buyers to safely exchange tickets in compliance with local regulations. In Mexico, fans will be directed to a dedicated FIFA Ticket Exchange Platform. Meanwhile, official hospitality packages — including premium seating, dining, and exclusive experiences — are available at FIFA.com/hospitality. With record-breaking global interest and ticket sales spanning over 200 nations, the 2026 World Cup is shaping up to be a defining chapter in football history.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lionel Messi and David Beckham faced accusations of receiving preferential treatment from FIFA after Inter Miami secured a place in the inaugural Club World Cup. Remarks from FIFA president Gianni Infantino, apparently encouraging participating teams to recruit another footballing legend in Cristiano Ronaldo, only heightened suspicions among critics. So I have three things to tell you. And on top, with the record of points in Major League Soccer. Second, based on this outstanding performance this year, you deserve to be, and you will be, for the FIFA Club World Cup 2025. Many MLS fans were not impressed, believing that Miami was favoured due to having the world's best player and one of football's most recognisable faces, Beckham, as a co-owner. Whichever team had Lionel Messi was gonna qualify." Another concurred, posting: "Even if Miami had the worst season of their history, they would have still gotten the spot. Despite the controversy, Miami arguably proved their worth in the tournament, progressing from their group with one victory and two draws before being trounced 4-0 by Paris Saint-Germain in the round of 16. Miami supporters can anticipate more mesmerising performances from Messi after the Argentine legend signed a new long-term contract with the club. It ensures the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner will be part of the team when they relocate to their new Freedom Park stadium in 2026. Messi expressed his delight, saying: "It makes me really happy to stay here and to continue with this project that, besides being a dream, has become a beautiful reality - playing in this stadium, at Miami Freedom Park.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lionel Messi and David Beckham were accused of benefiting from FIFA favouritism after Inter Miami were awarded a spot in the inaugural Club World Cup. Football's global governing body received considerable criticism for awarding the host nation spot to Inter Miami – and therefore Messi – without them having been crowned Major League Soccer champions. Comments by FIFA President Gianni Infantino, seemingly urging participating clubs to sign another modern great in Cristiano Ronaldo, further alerted the cynics. So I have three things to tell you. And on top, with the record of points in Major League Soccer. Second, based on this outstanding performance this year, you deserve to be, and you will be, for the FIFA Club World Cup 2025.

Miami fans can look forward to more Messi magic after the Argentina great signed a new long-term deal with the club. It means the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner will now be with the club when they move to their new Freedom Park home in 2026.

Morocco's U17 women's team made history on Friday as they won 3-1 against Costa Rica and progressed to the knockout stage of the FIFA U17 Women's World Cup for the first time. The team finished a respectable third in Group A with 3 points, ahead of Costa Rica. Maysa Baha truly led from the front with 2 goals in the 4th and 39th minutes and Morocco's third came from a bit of a surprise with a 77th-minute own goal from the Costa Rican side. Morocco's midfield and defense had a good day out as they worked together to create the openings for the team to score. Pressing high up the pitch put pressure on Costa Rica, and when the ball did get into the final third, Morocco's composure paid off in a big way, with the team ending up with a lead that couldn't be clawed back even after Costa Rica scored in the 95th minute. The 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup in Morocco features 24 teams spread across 6 groups, with the top two teams from each group qualifying directly. The tournament marks a milestone for Morocco who are this year hosting their first-ever FIFA tournament and also the first time that their U17 women's side has ever made it past the group stages of a World Cup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Steph McCaffrey has grand plans for Leyton Orient wjt.media Peak brunch time in Hampstead, London, and former USWNT forward Steph McCaffrey stands amid the chaos of avocado toast and hungry, unseated Londoners with her life in both hands: a miniature red poodle named Mabelline cradled in one, an iPhone clutched in the other. The 32-year-old is mid-voice note, plotting the final touches to Racketeer, Europe's soon-to-be largest pickleball and padel facility, her latest venture with Pickle Pop, the Los Angeles-based seven-figure pickleball business she co-owns with her wife, Erin Robertson, winner of Season 15 of the U.S. reality TV show Project Runway. Simultaneously, she is fielding text messages about the next day's FA Cup play-off match for Leyton Orient Women, the seventh-tier team she both plays for and chairs following the “significant investment” by McCaffrey Football Group, a women's sports investment firm owned by McCaffrey's mum, Gina, and co-founded with her dad, James, a 1986 NBA draftee with the Phoenix Suns and minority investor in Orient. It's because of her association with the east London club that we're meeting: to discuss how McCaffrey managed to convince 13 of Orient's current 16-player squad to drop down from the second, third and fourth tiers into England's amateur seventh tier. Known as the Greater London Women's Football League Premier Division, it is described by the FA as a “grassroots league that is the entry level for clubs and leagues to play 11-a-side football”. Upon spotting The Athletic, McCaffrey mouths an exaggerated “sorry”. A hungry couple nearby is told the wait time is next week but McCaffrey clearly has strings to pull. Suddenly, we are being pulled through a small corridor before emerging to find a small table being assembled for us. So soon!”) and when the Women's Super League, England's top flight, will finally come calling (“Tier five first!”). McCaffrey may be a VIP but she wears it lightly. But it's that courtesy, and approachability, which many Orient players The Athletic spoke to for this piece cite when asked about why they decamped to the seventh tier. This season's results read more like a bingo card than football scores — 13-0, 14-0, 14-0, 13-0, 5-1, 10-0, 7-0 — and each one prompts grumbles on social media that Orient are effectively ruining the league. Many clubs in the seventh tier are independent of an affiliated men's side and have climbed their way through the pyramid system organically, only to discover their pathways blocked by teams with bigger bank accounts. The £20-30,000 average annual operating costs in the seventh tier, including any expenses for coaching staff, are subsidised predominantly by pay-to-play player subscriptions and unswerving volunteer energy. Players moonlight as administrative assistants, chief executives and touchline tacticians when not busy picking clumps of grass out of their boots or working 9-5. It is illegal to pay players salaries below the fourth tier of women's football in England, according to FA rules. That means the only recompense McCaffrey can offer is travel, medical and match expenses and help with gym memberships (what she begrudgingly deems “the bare minimum the FA let me provide”). She adds that capital has been invested into infrastructure and staff, such as hiring Stephens, assistant manager Craig Davidson and operations manager Wayne Rothon. “I want to pay my players, but the FA isn't letting me. What's helpful for the game is bringing more capital into it and getting more eyeballs on it and getting me to invest in all these things.” The FA told The Athletic that players playing in tier five and below can receive payment but “need to be of a non-contract in accordance with HMRC requirements,” adding that similar rules exist in the men's game “with restrictions preventing the contracting of players at lower levels.” There has also been some internal criticism, notably from the club fanzine Leyton Orientear, which published an article bemoaning how many of the core players which drove the club from tier nine to tier seven in 2022 and finished fourth in Greater London Women's Football League Premier Division last season have been jettisoned. McCaffrey, along with former Blackburn Rovers forward Ellie Thomas-Leek and former Lewes midfielder Lucy Porter, are the only surviving players from last season's squad. McCaffrey and Stephens maintain that every player was offered a trial ahead of the new campaign but were also informed of the increase in fitness standards and time commitment. “I'm a big proponent of the notion that to grow women's football at that level, it needs investment,” McCaffrey says. McCaffrey believes some clubs are making easy decisions. In the past two seasons, Blackburn Rovers and Reading's women's team were demoted from the second tier (known as WSL2) to the fourth and fifth tiers respectively after failing to meet player welfare and financing standards. While WSL Football is set to announce new minimum standards for the top two divisions, the standard of resourcing, from expenses to coaching staff to training facilities, in the tiers below, which are run by the FA, remains a divergent tapestry. Tier three allows players to be on full-time salaries but not all clubs operate that way, with many players still balancing full-time jobs alongside semi-professional contracts. “The narrative is going to be that players have dropped down for money,” says Stephens. Thomas-Leek rose through Bristol Academy (now Bristol City) and danced the delicate ballet of full-time work and football for her 10-year career in England's top two flights. “I've gone through the grit and sacrifice to play this game for nothing,” she says. “It feels surreal I'm playing in the seventh tier. There's the one that reaches back to the mid-2010s when McCaffrey was a regular starter with the Boston Breakers and Chicago Red Stars, only for her nascent career to slam to a stop in 2018, aged 25, following her diagnosis with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder where the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, causing it to produce excessive thyroid hormones, a condition known as hyperthyroidism. If I made the national team, I'd make a bonus, but it was still five times behind what it was now. “What I've settled on is that you can't make everything better all at once. The resources these girls are getting across the board from tier four and below are so ****ed up. Our argument is that women's football, tiers eight and above, shouldn't be amateur anymore.” McCaffrey, who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business after retirement, describes herself as “the most liberal capitalist you'll ever meet”. “The first thing I googled when I started looking at taking over Orient was what other teams are in tiers five through seven who have legitimate backing?” says McCaffrey, who was introduced to Orient after her father became a minority investor in 2023. There's a gold rush right now going to tiers one and two but true entrepreneurship is investing in things that people haven't really thought of yet. But none of that has the amazing mission behind it.” But those within Orient remain steadfast in their mission. McCaffrey has a five-year plan to reach tier three, an ambitious timeline that she has, characteristically, hashed out to the minute. An under-18s team is being organised now, while funding from the FA to run an Emerging Talent Centre for young girls has been approved. An undefeated season for the first team could see Leyton Orient skip tier six altogether next season, earning promotion directly to tier five by application if adequate infrastructure is in place. Making it the FA Cup first-round proper this Sunday against tier six's Farnham Town would only bolster their case — as well as provide a potential windfall of £6,000 ($8,029). “We want to get people looking at us. In an ideal world, Leyton Orient will be competing in tier five soon, with McCaffrey nowhere near the starting XI. She's working 80 hours a week, finding time in the morning to do “100 jumping jacks in the sunshine” to manage her Graves' disease. For the first time in our hour-long brunch, McCaffrey pauses.

U.S. international Cameron Carter-Vickers will be sidelined for at least several months after the Celtic center back sustained an Achilles injury, manager Brendan Rodgers said Friday.

Rodgers estimated Carter-Vickers would miss three to five months, which could limit the defender's chances of making the U.S. team for next summer's World Cup.

The 27-year-old Carter-Vickers felt pain during Celtic's 2-1 victory over Sturm Graz in the Europa League on Thursday night.

Rodgers had made two first-half substitutions for injuries and made another change in the 78th minute — exhausting his three opportunities for subs.

"We wanted to take off Cameron but we could only make one substitution in the second half. Ideally we would have taken him off," Rodgers said after the match.

Rodgers told Sky Sports on Friday that it's an Achilles injury.

Auston Trusty, also a U.S. international, could be called on to replace Carter-Vickers, who played for the U.S. at the 2022 World Cup.
