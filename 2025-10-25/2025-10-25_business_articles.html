                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Passive investing through exchange-traded funds may be losing its appeal. Tidal Financial Group Chief Revenue Officer Gavin Filmore finds many of his clients are no longer satisfied with buying popular ETFs tied to market indexes. "I think investors are looking beyond just the let's call it the 'VOO and chill approach' where you just buy the index in an ETF, which is a great approach but they're looking for diversification," Filmore told CNBC's "ETF Edge" this week." "And they're not finding it within the product or within the index, so they have to look beyond that." Filmore refers to the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which tracks the S&P 500's performance. Both are up almost 16% so far this year. Meanwhile, Strategas Securities' Todd Sohn contends investors are losing diversification by using the S&P 500 as a benchmark. He added technology now accounts for more than 35% of the index, a record high. Meanwhile, defensive sectors including consumer staples, health care, energy and utilities are at an all-time low weight of 19% in the S&P 500, according to FactSet. Sohn is seeing renewed interest in small-cap stocks. The Russell 2000, which tracks the group, hit an all-time high on Wednesday and just saw its best week since August. "I wonder if you're seeing this broadening happen outside the large cap space where investors are comfortable with their tech and AI exposure and seeking other routes," Sohn said. While there is a growing chorus of voices throwing support behind the small caps, the heavy hitters will take center stage on Wall Street next week. That's when five of the seven so-called "Magnificent 7" — Meta Platforms, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon — are due to report their latest earnings. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An astounding 35 inches (89 centimeters) of rain was anticipated in southwest Haiti. The erratic and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing. Up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain was forecast for Jamaica and the southern regions of Haiti and the Dominican Republic through Monday, with up to 35 inches (89 centimeters) of rain possible across Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. "We think it will become a hurricane later today." Melissa was located about 155 miles (245 kilometers) southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and about 235 miles (375 kilometers) southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. It had maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 kph) and was slowly moving west-northwest at 1 mph (2 kph), according to the hurricane center. "Rapid intensification is forecast to begin over the next 24 hours. Melissa is forecast to become a hurricane shortly and a major hurricane by Sunday," the center added on Saturday. A hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica and a hurricane watch remained in place for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti. The center of Melissa is expected to move near or over Jamaica early next week, forecasters said. Melissa was expected to become a major hurricane by Sunday and possibly reach Category 4 status by early Monday, U.S. forecasters said. Authorities in Jamaica warned that all airports would close within 24 hours if a hurricane warning is issued. Officials said warehouses across the island were well-stocked and thousands of food packages prepositioned for quick distribution if needed. "I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously," said Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. Melissa's slow motion brings multi-day damaging winds plus heavy rainfall, catastrophic flash flooding, landslides, damage, long-duration power communication outages, isolation," the center said. Haitian authorities said three people had died as a consequence of the hurricane and another five were injured due to a collapsed wall. There were also reports of rising river levels, flooding and a bridge destroyed due to breached riverbanks in Sainte-Suzanne, in the northeast. "The storm is causing a lot of concern with the way it's moving," said Ronald Délice, a Haitian department director of civil protection, as local authorities organized lines to distribute food kits. Many residents are still reluctant to leave their homes. The storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic and knocked out water supply systems, affecting more than half a million customers. It also downed trees and traffic lights, unleashed a couple of small landslides and left more than two dozen communities isolated by floodwaters. The Bahamas Department of Meteorology said Melissa could bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to islands in the Southeast and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by early next week. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had predicted an above-normal season with 13 to 18 named storms. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One quality separates the most successful business owners from all others, according to billionaire Jimmy John Liautaud: They work really, really hard. In that vein, the 61-year-old founder and former chairman of the Jimmy John's sandwich chain doesn't believe in work-life balance, he said in a TikTok video posted by The School of Hardknocks on Oct. 9. "Work-life balance [for entrepreneurs] is the biggest line of bulls--- that's ever been created," he said. Liautaud speaks from experience: Despite graduating second-to-last in his high school class, he created a billion-dollar brand, he said. He launched his first sandwich shop in Charleston, Illinois in 1983, as a 19-year-old with a $25,000 loan from his father — and spent the next 36 years carefully and persistently growing his business, he told the "American Optimist" podcast during an October 2024 episode. In his first 10 years of business, for example, Liautaud only opened stores that he operated himself — 10 of them, all in Illinois, he said. From that foundation, he eventually franchised out additional locations across the country. Jimmy John's now has over 2,600 locations across 45 states. In September 2016, Liautaud sold his majority stake in the company, 65% of the business, to Atlanta-based private equity firm Roark Capital Group at a valuation of "about $3.5 billion," he said in the TikTok video. He stepped down as chairman in October 2019, after Roark-owned Inspire Brands acquired the rest of Jimmy John's for an undisclosed sum. As with any business, the sandwich chain's growth path was hardly linear or straightforward, Liautaud noted. In 2002, for example, 70 of the then-200 Jimmy John's locations were struggling to become profitable, he said. His response: Teach the franchise owners a lesson in work ethic, he said. "I said, 'If you're going to go into the sandwich business, this is 24/7 365. They need to get fed on Christmas day,'" said Liautaud. Liautaud currently has an estimated net worth of $2.4 billion, according to Forbes. Other highly successful entrepreneurs built their businesses using a similar mindset. Bill Gates didn't believe in vacations or weekends during Microsoft's early days, and Elon Musk has been known to occasionally sleep at the office and work throughout the night. Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang works "from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep," he said during a May 2024 interview with Stripe CEO Patrick Collision. Now, some of them opt for more sleep and better time-management. Gates regrets his previous workaholic lifestyle, he told students at Northern Arizona University's commencement ceremony in May 2023.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For Cameron Pappas, owner of Norton's Florist in Birmingham, Alabama, the artificial intelligence boom is a world away. While companies like Nvidia, Alphabet and Broadcom are lifting the stock market to fresh highs and bolstering GDP, Pappas is experiencing what's happening in the real economy, one that's far removed from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. Small businesses like Norton's, and companies of all sizes in retail, construction and hospitality, are struggling from higher costs brought by the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs, and as downbeat consumers reduce their spending. Norton's generated $4 million in revenue last year, selling flowers, plants and gifts to locals. "If a bouquet has 25 stems in it, if you reduce that by three to four stems, then you're able to keep the price the same," Pappas said. Pappas' story and many like it are being masked in the macro data by the power of AI. In the first half of the year, AI-related capital expenditures contributed to 1.1% of GDP growth, according to a September report from JPMorgan Chase. Cushman & Wakefield said in a report this month that total project costs for construction in the fourth quarter will be up 4.6% from a year earlier because of tariffs on building materials. The stock market shows a similar disconnect between AI and everybody else. Eight tech companies are valued at $1 trillion or more and, to varying degrees, are all tied to AI. Those companies — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Broadcom — make up about 37% of the S&P 500. Nvidia, with a $4.5 trillion market cap, accounts for over 7% of the benchmark's value by itself. Investors are giddy about the massive investments they're seeing in AI infrastructure. Broadcom shares are up more than 50% this year after more than doubling in each of the prior two years, while Nvidia and Alphabet have jumped almost 40% in 2025. That explains why the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are up 15% and 20%, respectively, reaching record highs on Friday, even as the government shutdown continues to cause economic angst. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 subgroups that include consumer discretionary and consumer staples companies have increased by less than 5% year to date. The latest troubling sign in the consumer market came on Thursday, when Target said it's cutting 1,800 corporate jobs — the retailer's first major round of layoffs in a decade. "I think the message that the AI economy is sort of driving up the GDP numbers is a correct one," Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, told CNBC in an interview. "There may be weakness in the rest of the economy, or not weakness, but there may be more modest growth." Investors will hear all about AI in the coming days, the busiest stretch of the quarter for tech earnings, and will be listening closely for additional guidance on capital expenditures. The capital will help OpenAI deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems, which is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 8 million U.S. households. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices have doubled this year and soared more than 20% earlier this month after the chipmaker announced a deal with OpenAI, while Oracle has been on a tear of late due to its ties to OpenAI and the broader infrastructure buildouts. "Are we sort of inflating the economy now, thereby setting ourselves up for a crash in the future?" When it comes to local businesses, most only know about the AI gold rush from the news headlines. One in four small business owners are stuck in "survival mode" as they contend with challenges like rising costs and tariffs, according to a September KeyBank Survey. Pappas said his father, who died in 2022, reminded him that these periods were "just another season" for Norton's, and that such challenges come with the territory. But Trump's tariffs have created a whole new set of constraints, as roughly 80% of all cut flowers in the U.S. are imported from countries like Colombia and Ecuador, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. There's no way for Norton's to avoid higher import costs, but Pappas said he's started buying some flowers directly from South American growers, which saves him money versus going through distributors that charge extra. Pappas said it's part of his "tariff price management" effort. Trump's tariffs will cost global businesses more than $1.2 trillion this year, and most of those costs are being passed onto consumers, according to S&P Global. With the holiday season rapidly approaching, consumer sentiment is of particular importance. The majority of U.S. consumers, 57%, that responded to a Deloitte survey published this month said they expect the economy to weaken in the year ahead, up from 30% a year ago. Millennials, those between 29 and 44, said they expect to spend an average of 13% less this holiday season. Additionally, seasonal hiring in the retail industry is poised to fall to its lowest level since the 2009 recession, according to a September report from job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The firm released another report earlier this month that showed new hiring in the U.S. has totaled just under 205,000 so far this year, off 58% from the same period last year. Around 900 nonretail employees were laid off as part of the plan, and the company let go of another 1,100 corporate workers earlier this year. Shares of Wyndham Hotels & Resorts slumped on Thursday after the hotel chain issued disappointing third-quarter results. CEO Geoff Ballotti cited a "challenging macro backdrop" in the company's earnings release. The stock is down roughly 25% year to date. Microsoft announced plans to cut around 9,000 jobs in July, which the company partly attributed to reducing layers of management. Salesforce is one of a number of tech companies that have announced layoffs, saying that AI can now handle the work. But Hatim Rahman, an associate professor specializing in AI at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, said that most businesses using AI for efficiencies won't find them right away. "AI is not a plug-and-play solution," Rahman said. And in the aggregate, it's going to take time." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

One of them has been using his newfound free time to sell hot dogs. "This is self-expression," Isaac Stein, the 31-year-old owner of "Shyster's Dogs," told Business Insider at his hot dog stand in Washington, DC's NoMa neighborhood. Stein has a day job: He's been working for three years as a lawyer at the Internal Revenue Service, where he handles tax regulations around employee benefits. But for the last three weeks, he's been working as a full-time hot dog vendor on the corner of First and M Street NE. Stein said he invested a "five-figure sum" into buying all of the equipment. He had originally planned to operate the stand outside of work hours, on Thursday and Friday evenings and over the weekend. "To be real, Thursday was a bit ambitious," Stein said. "It's hard to function in the office without enough sleep, and I want to be good at my legal job." Then, on October 8, he was "furloughed" — essentially suspended from his job until the shutdown ends. That turned his side gig into a nearly full-time job, and he now typically sells hot dogs from noon to 5 p.m. on weekdays. Stein's hot dog stand is laden with humor. The name "shyster," a slang word referring to a deceptive or unethical lawyer," is about wanting to "bring a laugh to the legal community," he told Business Insider. "Part of what I'm doing with my expression here is there are many layers of irony," Stein said. On his menu, he offers the "SHIRT OFF MY BACK" for $1,000. And the menu itself is fairly simple: if you order "The Only Choice," you'll get a hot dog with mustard and sauerkraut for $10. "From a young age, I have wanted to punish people for putting ketchup on a hot dog. So far, Stein says his hobby has worked out well for him. He's been serving 40 to 50 customers per day, he said, and has been making $200 to $300 in profit each day. But for him, the hot dog stand has been less about making ends meet and more about taking on a creative project. "It's given me a chance to be in the community more," Stein said. Still, Stein said that he's looking forward to returning to his day job, whenever that may be. "People who are tax lawyers for the government aren't doing it for the money," he said.</p>

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amar Saurabh, a product manager at PayPal in his 30s, based in San Mateo, California. I spent the last five years of my career at Meta and later at TikTok as a product manager. While I enjoyed the high-growth, fast-paced culture at TikTok, I was looking to work for a more established company with stability in the US, so I started applying to other jobs in April. After not finding much help from ChatGPT, I came up with the idea of creating a custom GPT. It took less than two hours to create, and the tool helped me land my lead product manager job at PayPal. At the start of my job hunt, I reached out to recruiters on LinkedIn, but personalizing each message took a lot of time. I tried using ChatGPT to draft messages, but it kept making mistakes. When ChatGPT would give me an answer, it would often get mixed up or provide generic answers that weren't customized to me. It also kept asking me to reupload my résumé or share more details about myself. You can access custom GPTs through ChatGPT's free tier, though a paid subscription allows you to upload more documents. I use the paid version, which costs $20 a month. I clicked on "custom GPT" and named it "PM job search advisor." I shared my résumé, a link to my LinkedIn profile, and additional details about the projects I've worked on. Before an interview, I would input the job description, tell it the date of my job interview, and ask, "What should I highlight from my experience? What questions should I expect from the recruiter?" It saved me hours that would've been spent trying to remember everything I've done in my career. There were a couple of times when it would forget certain details about me, and I'd have to remind it, "Hey, you have all my information. Do you remember this conversation we had?" It would come back saying something like "oh yeah, sorry for not taking that into account," and it would. Overall, my custom GPT worked really well for me. The number of applications I filled out didn't change as I implemented my custom GPT, but what did change was the number of responses and interviews I got. In two months, I landed at least 7 interviews with companies like Reddit, Intuit, and PayPal. My GPT helped me write my custom email to the PayPal recruiter and prepared me for each round of interviews. The benefits of a custom GPT are confounding and will only get better as more information is added. If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.</p>

There are a lot of "lows" in the soft job market, including layoffs and unemployment. However, the not-so-good news is that job openings and hires have also dropped. Economists told Business Insider that the US hasn't had large-scale layoffs because even though the economy is still strong, uncertainties around tariffs and other issues mean that companies are hanging on to the talent they have while being reluctant to hire more. The low-fire, low-hire labor market has its pros and cons, including hindering potential career growth for workers but offering cost-saving measures for companies. "We're seeing employers and job seekers both trying to wait out any of the uncertainty," Nicole Bachaud, labor economist at ZipRecruiter, told Business Insider. Jason Draho, the head of asset allocation Americas for UBS Global Wealth Management, said growth and consumer spending remain relatively solid, making it hard to justify large-scale layoffs. "Earnings are still positive, businesses are still making money, and there's not really a catalyst for them to reevaluate their head count," said Stephen Juneau, a senior US economist at Bank of America. Juneau said that uncertainty, artificial intelligence, pockets of economic weakness — such as in construction activity — and supply issues ​​are affecting companies investing in new talent. There are likely fewer workers entering the US these days, slowing labor force growth. "This negative labor supply shock obviously contributes to a slowdown in hiring," Juneau said. Zhao said that employers are labor hoarding, or holding on to talent as a precaution, because they don't want to relive previous staffing troubles. Draho said that if next year has better growth, stimulus measures, and tariff clarity, then companies won't want to be making mass layoffs now and then have to scramble for employees. "They don't want to be caught short with a lack of labor," he said. ZipRecruiter's September survey of talent acquisition professionals showed 63% of businesses intend to hire moderately or significantly more in the next year, down from 76% last year. "However, the current macroeconomic conditions are continuing to add delays and additional layers that are going to continue to keep hiring and movement in general at this slower pace for the next couple of months," Bachaud said. But labor hoarding could crumble if the economy worsens. Zhao said labor hoarding can be good for workers because of job security, and unemployed people have less competition than if there were mass layoffs. However, many people are still actively seeking employment in the low-hiring, low-layoff environment. So, it can be tough to land a job. There were 7.4 million people unemployed in August, but only 7.2 million job openings were available; the number of job openings per unemployed person has cooled way down since the tight labor market recovery after the pandemic recession. "Many workers have to settle for jobs that are not a good fit for them, whether they don't pay commensurate with their experience or it's not in a field or industry that they're skills would best match," Zhao said. Zhao said that low hiring affects jobholders who may want to secure a new job that offers better career growth opportunities or who wish to advance or negotiate a raise internally. The Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker showed the 12-month moving averages of median wage growth were similar for job switchers and job stayers as of August. "Employers who are focusing too much on stability and keeping everything as it is, keeping the status quo, are going to risk losing out to innovation and growth that's not going to be happening if there's no movement internally in their company," Bachaud said. "Employees are going to be stuck in their role without growing and adding new skills and moving along their career paths." In the cool job market with workers staying put, Bachaud suggested people upskill within their roles so they can still grow and add to their résumé when they look for a new position.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top economic officials from the U.S. and China kickstarted talks in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday to avert an escalation of their trade war and ensure that a meeting happens next week between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The talks on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit will chart a path forward after Trump threatened new 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and other trade curbs starting on November 1, in retaliation for China's vastly expanded export controls on rare earth magnets and minerals. The recent actions, which also include an expanded U.S. export blacklist that covers thousands more Chinese firms, have disrupted a delicate trade truce crafted by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng over four previous meetings since May. China's top trade negotiator Li Chenggang is also participating in the talks. The three officials will try to pave the way for Trump and Xi to meet next Thursday at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea, a high-stakes conversation that could revolve around some interim relief on tariffs, technology controls and Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans. Minutes before the talks started, Trump left Washington for his tour of Asia and laid out several talking points for the meeting with Xi. He said farmers, hit by a Chinese freeze on U.S. soybean purchases, and the democratic island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, would be on the list of topics discussed. Trump added he does not have any plans to visit Taiwan. He also flagged the release of jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai, whose case has become the most high-profile example of China's crackdown on rights and freedoms in the Asian financial hub. "We have a lot to talk about with President Xi, and he has a lot to talk about with us. I think we'll have a good meeting," Trump said. Trump left Washington on Friday night for a five-day trip to Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, his first to the region and longest journey abroad since taking office in January. Aboard Air Force One, he told reporters that he would also like China to help Washington in its dealings with Russia. Josh Lipsky, international economics chair at the Atlantic Council in Washington, said Bessent, Greer and He must first find a way to mitigate their dispute over U.S. technology export curbs and China's rare earths controls, which Washington wants to reverse. "I'm not sure the Chinese can agree to that. It's the primary leverage that they have," Lipsky said. Some of those announcements may fall to Trump, who is due to arrive in the Malaysian capital on Sunday. "We won't know if Beijing has successfully counterbalanced the U.S.'s export controls with restrictions of their own or if they've induced a continuation of an escalatory spiral until Trump and Xi meet," said Scott Kennedy, a China economics expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies. "If they make a deal, their gambit will have paid off. The world's two largest economies are seeking to avoid a return of their tariff escalation to triple-digit levels on both sides. Bessent and Greer's first meeting with He in Geneva in May led to a 90-day truce, which brought down tariffs sharply to about 55% on the U.S. side and 30% on the Chinese side and restarted the flow of magnets. China struck back with the new global rare earth export controls on October 10, aiming to prevent their use in military systems.
