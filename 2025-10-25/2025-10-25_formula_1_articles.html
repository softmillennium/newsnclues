Reflecting back on this result and his FP1 as a whole, Lindblad said: “Yeah, it was good. It was a session not entirely without incident for Lindblad, who was issued with a warning later on after being found to have impeded McLaren's Pato O'Ward – another rookie in action – into Turn 9. When asked about the challenge of managing these situations in FP1, Lindblad conceded: “It was really difficult. I think we were quite often out of sequence and then there's guys doing long runs, and it's really not easy on a pretty short track. “It wasn't easy and especially as a rookie there's a lot of things to deal with, so I could do it better. Overall, however, Lindblad reflected positively on his session and also felt that Red Bull were satisfied with the job he had done. “I think the pace was decent, it's back in one piece. I think they thought my feedback was solid as well.</p>

2025 Mexico City GP: Rookies on track in FP1

Tech Talk: How the teams are keeping cool in Mexico City

Lawrence Barretto delves into the data after the first day of practice ahead of the Mexico City Grand Prix.

Max Verstappen kept his foot on the gas to stay in full chase mode in Mexico as he set an impressive pace in his Red Bull in Mexico – but a hot, dirty track created low-grip conditions and made it very difficult to nail down a true pecking order after two hours of practice on Friday. Here's what we know so far...

Reigning World Champion Verstappen was one of nine race drivers to miss FP1 as teams took the opportunity to run a young driver, but the Dutchman needed very little time to get comfortable on the soft tyre on lower fuel in second practice to set the quickest time.

Red Bull brought another upgrade to Mexico, which included a tweak to the new floor they introduced at Monza, and ran a set-up that gave a gain in the corners (around 0.2s in the slow stuff, about 0.1s in the medium-speed turns) and a higher straight-line aero efficiency than McLaren.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tech Talk: How the teams are keeping cool in Mexico City Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton were left searching for improved balance at Ferrari despite both featuring in the top five on Friday at the Mexico City Grand Prix. Charles Leclerc believes Ferrari are "on the back foot" against Red Bull and McLaren, despite being the second fastest driver on Friday in Mexico. Leclerc returned to the podium for the first time in six weekends last time out in Austin, and continued to show strong pace at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez, falling just 0.153s shy of Max Verstappen's benchmark. No surprises there, we expected them to be the strongest teams coming here. I felt quite good with the car, so we've just got to build from that tomorrow, and hopefully, we can gain a bit more performance.” Speaking after the session, Verstappen expressed a “big concern” about his long-run pace. Having conceded that Red Bull may be out of reach over a single lap, Leclerc suggested the roles could be reversed across a longer distance. “I don't know exactly what was going on there. Lewis Hamilton was not far back from Leclerc, going fifth fastest in the second practice session after being replaced by Antonio Fuoco for FP1. “Every time you come here, because of the altitude, we're all running really high downforce, but it feels lower than Monza, so you're sliding around trying to find grip, but it's not there. He added: “I definitely don't want to race what we had today.</p>
