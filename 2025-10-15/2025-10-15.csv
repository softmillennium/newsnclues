            An American tourist was fatally stabbed and another wounded during an attempted robbery early Wednesday in the coastal town of Cascais, west of Lisbon, according to authorities.
    


            The incident happened near the Church of the Navigators, with emergency services receiving an alert at around 3:16 a.m., CNN Portugal reported.
    


            Investigators say one of the tourists was returning to his hotel when three suspects confronted him and tried to rob him. The victim resisted, was punched, and attempted to flee while calling a friend for help. When the second tourist arrived at the scene, he was also assaulted.
    


            The attackers fatally stabbed one of the men and seriously injured the other before fleeing.
    


            The three suspects have been arrested and are now being questioned by police. One of the men faces a homicide charge, while the others are accused of taking part in the assault.
    


            The victim's death was first reported by Correio da Manhã and later confirmed by CNN Portugal.
    


            Emergency medical teams from the National Institute of Medical Emergency (INEM) attempted to resuscitate the man, but the stab wounds were deep and struck vital areas, authorities said.
    


            The second victim was taken to Santa Maria Hospital in Lisbon. Despite suffering deep cuts to his face and arms, he is no longer in critical condition, according to hospital officials.
    


            The State Department told CNN it is aware of reports of an attack on two US tourists in Cascais, and stands ready to provide consular assistance.

            Syria's interim president, Ahmed Al-Sharaa, travelled to Moscow for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, the first face-to-face contact the pair have had.
    


            The meeting was especially notable considering Putin's long-standing backing of Al-Sharaa's predecessor, Bashar al-Assad, whose dictatorial regime was ousted by rebel forces in December.
    


            After the toppling of the Assad dynasty, the former Syrian leader fled to Russia, where he and his family were granted asylum for “humanitarian reasons,” an official source in Russia told CNN at the time.
    


            However, during his meeting with Al-Sharaa on Wednesday, Putin insisted that the two countries “have been exceptionally friendly” for more than 80 years, and that his country's relationship with Syria has “never been tied to our political circumstances.”
    


            “Throughout these decades, we have always been guided by one thing: the interests of the Syrian people,” he continued.
    


            The Russian leader called the overthrowing of the Assad regime a “great success and a step toward societal consolidation” and said that Syria's most recent parliamentary elections “will strengthen cooperation between all political forces” in the country, despite the “difficult times” it is facing.
    


            Earlier this year, hundreds of people were killed in days of violence in southern Syria, which began with clashes between members of the Druze minority group and Bedouin tribes and subsequently drew a military intervention.
    


            Israel also waded into the conflict, saying it wanted to protected the Druze and striking several government buildings in Damascus before a ceasefire was agreed upon.
    


            Al-Sharaa said Wednesday that his country was “re-establishing relations with all regional and global countries, and there are bilateral relations and common interests that connect us with Russia.”
    


            “We have close relations with Russia, and a large part of the energy sector in Syria depends on Russian expertise,” he said.
    


            Russia's deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, said later Wednesday that his country was ready to support Syria in its reconstruction after years of civil war.
    


            “Today, we discussed specific projects in energy, transport, tourism, healthcare, and cultural and humanitarian areas,” Novak told reporters.
    


            “All of this will be discussed in detail, and we are ready to provide support and participate in the reconstruction of Syria,” he said.

The US State Department said on Tuesday that it has revoked the visas of several individuals who publicly celebrated the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Kirk, who co-founded Turning Point USA and rose to prominence by debating politics on college campuses, was killed by a sniper last month while speaking to students in Utah.

In a post on X on Tuesday – Kirk's birthday – the State Department said that the US “has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans.”

The department posted screenshots of messages and quotes it said were made by six people from Germany, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Paraguay, and South Africa.

An Argentinian national allegedly accused Kirk of spreading racist views and claimed he “deserved” to die, while a German national allegedly wrote, “when fascists die, democrats don't complain.” A person from Brazil was said to have written that Kirk “was the reason for a Nazi rally where they marched in homage to him” and had “died too late.”

An Argentine national said that Kirk “devoted his entire life spreading racist, xenophobic, misogynistic rhetoric” and deserves to burn in hell.Visa revoked. pic.twitter.com/4bQoXisHsz

The US State Department said the posts were “just a few examples of aliens who are no longer welcome in the US,” adding that it would continue to identify foreigners who celebrated Kirk's death.

A Mexican national said that Kirk “died being a racist, he died being a misogynist” and stated that “there are people who deserve to die. There are people who would make the world better off dead.”Visa revoked.

On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump posthumously awarded Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. Kirk's widow, Erika, received the medal on his behalf.

Dozens of people in the US have lost their jobs or been suspended for mocking or justifying Kirk's death. Although most Democrats condemned the killing, Trump and other Republicans have blamed the “radical left” for inciting political violence.

Afghanistan and Pakistan have announced a temporary ceasefire, putting an end to the fighting which broke out between their forces on Wednesday morning. Over a dozen civilian deaths have been reported in the latest exchange of fire between the two neighbors.

Pakistan's Foreign Ministry announced several hours after the clash that Kabul and Islamabad have agreed to a limited 48-hour truce, which is to begin at 6pm local time (13:00 GMT) on Wednesday. 

In its statement, the ministry said both sides “will make sincere efforts through dialogue to find a positive solution to their complex yet resolvable issues.”

Earlier in the day, Afghan Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid wrote on X that Pakistani forces had launched an attack, firing “light and heavy weapons,” killing 12 civilians and injuring more than 100. 

He claimed Afghan forces had returned fire, killing a “large number” of soldiers, seizing Pakistani weapons and tanks, and destroying military installations.

Ali Mohammad Haqmal, a press spokesman in Spin Boldak district, Afghanistan, the reported site of the altercation, put the civilian death toll at 15. AFP has also cited a local hospital official who said 80 women and children were among the wounded.

Islamabad has denied the allegations as “outrageous” and “blatant lies,” claiming it was the Afghan Taliban that initiated the hostilities by attacking a Pakistani military post and other areas near the border. The Pakistani army said its forces had repelled the assault, killing 37 Taliban fighters in two separate operations.

Reuters has reported, citing unnamed security officials, that the clash allegedly lasted around five hours.

The confrontation follows a weekend flare-up in which Afghanistan and Pakistan traded casualty claims. The Taliban said it had killed 58 Pakistani soldiers, while Islamabad claimed to have captured 19 Afghan frontier posts.

Cross-border tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have intensified in recent years as both sides have repeatedly accused each other of harboring militants.

The US War Department stands ready to do its part and “impose costs” on Russia over the Ukraine conflict, War Secretary Pete Hegseth has said.

Speaking at Ramstein military base on Wednesday ahead of a meeting of countries coordinating military support for Ukraine, he lauded NATO members' recent militarization push.

“If this war does not end, if there is no path to peace in the short term, then the United States, along with our allies, will take the steps necessary to impose costs on Russia,” Hegseth said.

“If we must take this step, the US War Department stands ready to do our part in ways that only the United States can do,” he added.

On Sunday, President Donald Trump said he could supply Ukraine with US-made Tomahawk cruise missiles if the Ukraine conflict “is not going to get settled,” and admitted that it would be “a new step of aggression.”

The longer-range variants of the cruise missile can strike targets up to 2,500km (1,550 miles) away, potentially threatening the Russian capital and other cities.

Supplies of the missiles to Ukraine would represent a “new stage of escalation,” since US troops would have to be directly involved in using them, President Vladimir Putin said earlier this month.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday that Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky wanted to use the Tomahawks to conduct “new terrorist attacks” against Russia “aimed at escalating the conflict.”

Moscow has blamed the pause in direct Russian-Ukrainian peace talks on Kiev, arguing that it lacks interest in a settlement, emboldened by Western military support.

“Russia is ready for a peaceful settlement,” but continues its military operation “due to the lack of alternatives,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday. Moscow appreciates Trump's peace efforts, and hopes he can help “encourage the Ukrainian side to be more proactive and more prepared for the peace process,” he added.

Cancellations represent escalating government-wide campaign to suppress criticism of rightwing influencer

Civil liberties advocates are warning that the Trump administration's decision to strip visas from at least six foreign nationals over social media posts about Charlie Kirk's killing represents yet another example of dangerous government crackdowns on protected speech.

On Tuesday, the state department announced it was systematically identifying visa holders who “celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk”, declaring in a social media statement that “the United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans”.

The visa cancellations represent an escalating government-wide campaign to suppress criticism of Kirk, who was killed last month. The administration cut visas for nationals from Argentina, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, Germany and Paraguay.

“You can't defend ‘our culture' by eroding the very cornerstone of what America stands for: freedom of speech and thought,” Conor Fitzpatrick, an attorney at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (Fire) said in a statement to the Guardian. “The Trump administration must stop punishing people for their opinions alone.”

Visa revocations under these parameters “are censorship, plain and simple”, Carrie DeCell, Knight First Amendment Institute's senior staff attorney and legislative adviser, said in a press release.

“Mere ‘mockery' can't be grounds for adverse government action – whether revocation of broadcast licenses or revocation of visas,” DeCell said. “While the government can revoke visas for many reasons, the First Amendment forbids it from doing so based on viewpoint.”

The crackdown has ensnared foreign nationals for posts with minimal reach, raising questions about the extent of government surveillance of social media activity. Among those whose visas were revoked was a South African national whose commentary attracted just 2,344 views. The individual “mocked Americans grieving the loss of Kirk, saying ‘they're hurt that the racist rally ended in attempted martyrdom' and alleging ‘he was used to astroturf a movement of white nationalist trailer trash'”, according to the state department.

A German national also had their visa cancelled for a post written in German that translated to: “when fascists die, democrats don't complain.” The state department characterized this as celebrating Kirk's death and attempting to justify his murder.

The Brazilian stripped of his US visa is Tiago Santineli, a far-left standup comedian and online influencer who published a series of inflammatory tweets about Charlie Kirk after his assassination.

In one 16 September post, cited by the state department on Monday, the 33-year-old comedian, who has more than 430,000 X followers, wrote: “Charlie Kirk was the reason for a Nazi demonstration where they marched in tribute to him. Good riddance!”

In a second part of the tweet, not cited by the state department, Santineli refers to the fatal shot to Kirk's neck, writing: “If only someone had given Hitler this kind of tracheostomy before he had reached power. It's too bad that Little Charlie Deep Throat was killed by another by another right-wing conservative, it takes a bit of the fun out of it, but it's still worth it.”

The controversial Brasília-born comedian, who has nearly a million YouTube subscribers, published several other incendiary messages about Kirk's 10 September assassination. In one 18 September post, Santineli wrote beneath a photo of two well-known rightwing Brazilian politicians: “When are these [two] going to get the charlie kirk treatment?”

Santineli did not reply to a request for comment but writing on X on 1 October he said he had received an email from the US embassy revoking his visa. The Brazilian boasted that that made him “the world's first comedian to be banned from entering the US because of a joke”. “I can't go to the US,” Santineli wrote. “But the worst thing is that Charlie Kirk will never be able to leave hahahahahahahahaha.”

Another person singled out by the visa restrictions was Enrique “Kike” Gamarra, a veteran talkshow host who is often critical of Paraguay's conservative government. In a recent programme, Gamarra said that Kirk's killing “doesn't absolve the way he lived his life. Charlie Kirk was a son of a bitch and died according to his own rules.” Gamarra declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian.

Pro-government media in Paraguay celebrated the travel ban imposed on the broadcaster, which comes amid deepening ties between Trump's White House and Paraguay's president, Santiago Peña. 

The state department's actions draw on a vast surveillance apparatus established in 2019, when the department began requiring nearly all visa applicants worldwide to provide social media handles from platforms including Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn and Reddit used within the past five years.

The policy, adopted under Trump's first administration as part of “extreme vetting” measures, continued under Joe Biden, and expanded dramatically in March this year. A state department cable obtained by the Guardian at the time ordered consular offices to conduct comprehensive social media investigations of student visa applicants, with officers instructed to preserve screenshots of “potentially derogatory” content to create permanent records – even if posts were altered or deleted.

The March directive established sweeping new grounds for visa denials, writing that “evidence that an applicant advocates for terrorist activity, or otherwise demonstrates a degree of public approval or public advocacy for terrorist activity or a terrorist organization” could justify rejection.

It also mandated social media reviews of all students applying for visas, with fraud prevention units directed to flag and document content the administration deems threatening to national security.

The directive followed high-profile visa revocations and arrests targeting pro-Palestinian campus activism, signaling an aggressive expansion of how immigration enforcement could be wielded against political speech.

“The supreme court has been clear that noncitizens have a right to freedom of speech” Fitzpatrick said. “In America, no one should fear a midnight knock at the door because of their political views.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

German authorities issue 204 charges against 21-year-old suspect, alleged to be part of wider network of abusers

A man accused of luring children worldwide into a sadistic online abuse network has been charged by German prosecutors with hundreds of crimes, including murder, for the livestreamed death of a 13-year-old American.

Using the pseudonym “White Tiger”, the 21-year-old man from Hamburg is alleged to have victimised more than 30 children with online sexual abuse, manipulation and exploitation as a part of a virtual network of abusers known as “764”.

He allegedly coerced a US boy, 13, into killing himself in 2022, which was broadcast via live stream.

Authorities said the crimes had occurred between January 2021, when the suspect was 16 years old, and September 2023.

Prosecutors in Hamburg announced 204 criminal charges against the German-Iranian man, including allegations of committing one murder and five attempted murders as an “indirect perpetrator”.

“White Tiger” would find vulnerable children and adolescents in online chats or games, develop a bond to groom them for abuse, then exploit them into producing sexual content and harming themselves on video, authorities said.

The man was arrested at his parents' home in June. Authorities said at the time they had identified eight victims of “White Tiger”, aged between 11 and 15 and from Germany, England, Canada and the US.

The case has prompted questions about whether German authorities could have acted sooner and prevented some of the abuse.

The Zeit newspaper reported that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the US had alerted German authorities in 2021 to an apparently Hamburg-based predator using the name “White Tiger”.

According to Zeit, NCMEC provided a roughly 40-page document containing chat transcripts from the online platform Discord in which “White Tiger” demanded photos from two young girls, urging them to harm themselves and suggesting they take their own lives.

Police questioned the suspect at the time, but he was not arrested until this year.

During the arrest, police also seized illegal weapons – knives, brass knuckles and a baton – as well as computers and hard drives, which were still being analysed, prosecutors said.

The Hamburg public prosecutor's office said the criminal proceedings would be held behind closed doors.

                                                                                In his famous tragic play Romeo and Juliet, the English playwright William Shakespeare wrote, “What's in a name?” As it turns out, there is quite a lot in a name, particularly a surname, which is commonly known as a person's last name in Western societies. A surname is written after the first name, which is also referred to as a given name or, traditionally, a Christian name. A closer look at the history of surnames reveals some fascinating insights into their origins.
  It may come as a surprise to some that up until about 1,000 years ago, surnames were                                    



                                                                                Rehearsal time is over. The world's best and most ambitious young pianists have descended on Warsaw for the Frederic Chopin International Piano Competition — for some, a gateway to classical music glory. 
Fans from around the globe snapped up tickets as much as a year ago. The lucky ones attended the opening night concert on Oct. 3 and will follow along as the contest builds to a thrilling climax on Oct. 20.
Winning the Chopin International — held every five years in the 19th-century composer's homeland — can raise the curtain to playing at venues across the globe and signing contracts                                    



                                                                                Continued from yesterday（延續自昨日）
https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang
While many early surnames in England were strongly influenced by the work people did, like Carpenter or Plumber, jobs were not the only factor. Physical characteristics, personal nicknames, geographical locations and even parents' first names also played a role.
  It's not hard to imagine how the color of a person's hair could have led to a surname like “Redhead” or “White,” while a darker complexion might have resulted in the last name “Black.” Meanwhile, someone known as a quick runner might have earned the surname “Swift,” while a clever or cunning individual could have been called “Fox”                                    ","{'href': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}","world"

When a river that winds through the mountains of central Mexico suddenly turned into a crushing wall of water over this past week, it practically wiped the 400-person village of Chapula off the map.

Residents only had time to shout, warning neighbors living along the riverbanks, and desperately seek shelter from the deadly flooding and landslides that have cut off 300 towns in central and eastern Mexico from the outside world.

Thousands of soldiers and workers on Tuesday scrambled to rescue people and unblock roads.

“There's nothing left. It wiped out houses, it wiped out the bridge, it wiped out everything. The only thing left standing was the church and the warehouse where we were seeking refuge,” said 21-year-old Stephanie Ramirez, who was part of a group of elderly people, women and children who stumbled off a rescue helicopter on Tuesday.

The Mexican government said that at least 64 people have died due to the torrential rains.

Dozens are still missing and officials warned that the full extent of the devastation in remote towns of a couple hundred to 1,000 residents remained unknown.

The rains were triggered by the convergence of two tropical storms churning off Mexico's western coast, striking at the end of an unusually heavy rainy season that has left rivers overflowing and hillsides weakened.

Ramirez and her grandmother were evacuated after days of hoping help would come. The rest of her family and dozens of their neighbors were still waiting to be evacuated.

As more rain threatened to pour down, they sought shelter on a nearby hillside on the verge of collapsing next to the still-swollen river.

“We have to get them out. They're in constant danger there,” Ramirez said.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that one of the government's priorities was to open roads and “to secure air bridges, food supplies, water and check on how each person is faring.”

Thousands of military and civilian personnel were working tirelessly on those efforts, but in Chapula, residents organized on their own.

They called their relatives in the US “and it was them who made arrangements to get us out of there little by little,” Ramirez said.

With help from residents of the nearby town of Tianguistengo, a private air bridge began operating, using a borrowed helicopter to evacuate groups of about half-a-dozen people at a time, while other residents organized bags of basic goods to carry on foot — with some soldiers— to neighboring villages that were still cut off.

“We think it's about six or seven hours walking, but we want people to know that we're working ... that they can see we also care about their situation,” local resident Neptali Rodriguez said.

The hardest-hit states were Veracruz, Hidalgo and Puebla. In Hidalgo alone, where about half of the isolated villages are, about 100,000 homes were damaged or destroyed by flooding rivers and mudslides.

In Veracruz, where at least 29 people died, rainfall reached 61cm in just four days.

Veracruz Governor Rocio Nahle said that more than 300,000 people were affected in the state alone.

On Tuesday, public officials were going door-to-door in cities such as Poza Rica, Veracruz, where water from the overflowing Cazones River on Friday reached 4m high in some areas.

They were asking residents if anyone was missing.

According to the Mexican National Civil Protection Coordination, 67 people were still unaccounted for as of Tuesday.

In Poza Rica, resident Roberto Olvera said that an oil refinery alarm alerted him to rising waters.

“It was terrifying, many people in the neighborhood couldn't escape,” he said.

Floodwaters there also left a black, oily residue believed to have come from nearby oil and gas installations, coating trees and rooftops.

Authorities in Kharkiv Oblast have expanded the mandatory evacuation zone for families with children in the Kupiansk district amid intensified Russian assaults, regional governor Oleh Syniehubov announced on Oct. 14.

The decision mandates the forced evacuation of families from 40 settlements across the area. In total, 601 children from 409 families are to be relocated to safer areas.

""This decision comes in response to the deteriorating security situation near Kupiansk,"" Syniehubov said.

On Oct. 15, the military monitoring group DeepState reported that Russian forces had captured the village of Myrne in Kupiansk district and were advancing toward the nearby village of Ivanivka.

Kupiansk itself has become a focal point of Russia's renewed offensive in Kharkiv Oblast. Since Sept. 28, it has been closed to civilians due to ongoing combat operations and the threat of Russian sabotage groups.

""Over the past few weeks, the situation has worsened. The enemy has begun clearing operations, and our positions have gradually been lost. Some were simply destroyed by artillery and drones,"" DeepState wrote on Oct. 14.

Russian gains in the Kupiansk sector follow similar advances reported in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.

Hi, this is Kateryna Hodunova reporting from Kyiv on day 1,330 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story:

At least 1,076 Cuban nationals have fought or are fighting for Russia in Ukraine, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15.

Ninety-six are known to have died or gone missing in action.

The figures come after the U.S. earlier this month circulated an unclassified cable sharing details about Cuba's support for Russia's full-scale invasion, in which it claimed an ""estimated 1,000 to 5,000 Cubans (are) fighting in Ukraine.""

The information from HUR shared with the Kyiv Independent tallies with the lower end of the U.S. estimate, but also provides further insight into the recruitment process and training of Cuban nationals.

HUR claims they receive only two weeks of training at the Avangard training center in Moscow Oblast before being sent to the front line.

The information provided by HUR suggests that some Cuban nationals are tricked into travelling to Russia after being lured by the promise of lucrative construction work advertised on Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok.

Their travel is facilitated by ""private intermediaries"" who sometimes pay for flights, with Russian diplomatic institutions issuing tourist or work visas.

The mayor of Dniproudne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Yevhenii Matvieiev, who was abducted by Russian military personnel, died in a Russian prison from multiple injuries, the Ukrainian media outlet Liga.net reported on Oct. 15, citing the Prosecutor General's Office.

According to the report, Matvieiev died on Sept. 7, 2024, while being held at Detention Center No. 3 in the city of Kizel, located in Russia's Perm Krai.

President Donald Trump holds the FIFA World Cup Trophy next to FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the White House in August.Jacquelyn Martin/The Associated Press

President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to relocate World Cup matches set to be played next year in suburban Boston, after suggesting that parts of the city had been “taken over” by unrest.

Foxborough, Mass., home to the NFL's New England Patriots and about 50 kilometres from Boston, is set to stage matches as the U.S. co-hosts the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada. Trump was asked about Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu, a Democrat whom he called “intelligent” but “radical left.”

“We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. “I love the people of Boston and I know the games are sold out. But your mayor is not good.”

He suggested “they're taking over parts of Boston” without offering details, but added “we could get them back in about two seconds.”

The Trump administration has already deployed National Guard troops to Washington and Memphis, and efforts to do so in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, have sparked legal fights.

Wu's office did not react directly to Trump's threat, issuing a statement that read, “Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions.”

Trump's comments came during his meeting with Argentina President Javier Milei and it wasn't immediately clear what he was referring to by parts of Boston having been seized. Earlier this month, however, there were multiple arrests in connection with a pro-Palestinian protest that turned violent on Boston Common. Four police officers were injured.

Trump has previously suggested he could declare cities “not safe” for the 104-game soccer tournament and alter a detailed hosting plan that FIFA confirmed in 2022. It includes games at NFL stadiums near New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

World Cup host sites aren't up to Trump. The 11 U.S. cities – plus three in Mexico and two in Canada – are contracted with FIFA, which would face significant logistical and legal issues to make changes in the eight months before the June 11 kickoff.

“It's FIFA's tournament, FIFA's jurisdiction, FIFA makes those decisions,” the soccer body's vice-president Victor Montagliani said earlier this month at a sports business conference in London.

Trump nonetheless said, “If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who's phenomenal – and I would say, ‘Let's move into another location' and they would do that.”

The President meant FIFA head Gianni Infantino, a close ally. Trump said Infantino “wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.”

Aid trucks rolled into Gaza on Wednesday and Israel resumed preparations to open the main Rafah crossing as Hamas handed over more bodies of dead hostages, following a dispute that had threatened the fragile ceasefire in the Palestinian enclave.

Israel had warned it could keep Rafah shut and reduce aid supplies because it said Hamas was returning bodies too slowly, showing the risks to a truce that has stopped two years of devastating warfare in Gaza and seen all living hostages held by Hamas freed. 

However, the militant group returned several Israeli bodies overnight and two more coffins later on Wednesday. An Israeli security official said preparations were under way to open Rafah to Gazan citizens, while a second official said that 600 aid trucks would go in.

Here's what you need to know about Gaza and the Israel-Hamas war, including the ceasefire deal, the toll of the war so far and what comes next.

Seeking to keep the pressure on Hamas, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would consider allowing Israeli forces to resume fighting in Gaza if Hamas fails to uphold its end of the ceasefire deal that he brokered.

“Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word. If Israel could go in and knock the crap of them, they'd do that,” Trump was quoted as saying to CNN in a brief telephone call when asked what would happen if Hamas refused to disarm.

Palestinians voiced ongoing struggles as they have 'no food, no housing' in Gaza City.

Hamas returned four bodies confirmed as dead hostages on Monday and another four bodies late on Tuesday, though Israeli authorities said one of those bodies was not that of a hostage.

The Israeli military said it received two more coffins from the Red Cross at a meeting point in northern Gaza Strip late on Wednesday, and the bodies were being taken for forensic identification.

The dispute over the return of bodies still has the potential to upset the ceasefire deal along with other major issues that are yet to be resolved.

Israel has said that the next phase of the truce calls for Hamas to disarm and cede power, which it has so far refused to do. It has launched a security crackdown, parading its power in Gaza through public executions and clashes with local clans. 

Longer-term elements of the ceasefire plan, including how Gaza will be governed, the makeup of an international “stabilization force” and moves toward the creation of a Palestinian state have yet to emerge.

A day after Trump warned Hamas that it must disarm or “we will disarm them,” he told reporters that the U.S. military would not be needed for the task.

The U.S. is looking to establish basic stabilization of the situation in Gaza and planning is under way for an international force to go into the enclave, said a senior U.S. adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Until the latest handover of two coffins, 21 bodies of hostages had remained in Gaza, though some may be hard to find or recover because of destruction during the conflict. An international task force is meant to find them.

“The resistance has abided by what was agreed upon and has handed over all the living captives it had, as well as the bodies it was able to retrieve,” Hamas' armed wing said. “As for the remaining bodies, locating and recovering them requires major efforts and special equipment, and we are exerting great effort to close this file.”

The deal also requires Israel to return the bodies of 360 Palestinians. The first group of 45 was handed over on Tuesday and the bodies were being identified, said Palestinian health authorities.

The war has caused a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, with nearly all inhabitants driven from their homes, a global hunger monitor confirming famine and health authorities overwhelmed.

“Our situation is utterly tragic. We went back to our homes in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood and found there are no homes at all. There is no shelter. Nothing,” said Moemen Hassanein in Gaza City, with tents and shanties behind him.

Reuters video showed trucks moving from the Egyptian side of the border into the Rafah crossing with Gaza at dawn on Wednesday, some carrying fuel and others loaded with pallets of aid.

However, it was not clear if that convoy would complete its crossing into Gaza as part of the 600 trucks that were due to enter the enclave on Wednesday – the daily number required under the ceasefire plan.

The Rafah crossing with Egypt is due to be open for people to cross on Thursday with a European Union mission deployed there, two sources said.

The Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said it was preparing to operate the crossing.

“Humanitarian aid continues to enter the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom Crossing and other crossings after Israeli security inspection,” the Israeli security official said.

The United Nations' top emergency relief co-ordinator, Tom Fletcher, told Reuters the 600 trucks approved to enter the territory was a “good base,” but not enough to meet the scale of need.

Underscoring the political challenges facing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, an opponent of the ceasefire plan, said on X that the aid delivery was a “disgrace” and accused Hamas of lies over the return of hostages' bodies.

Several other Palestinian militant factions in Gaza have backed a days-long Hamas security crackdown as it battles local clans. Hamas has executed several people that it accused of collaborating with Israel.

The U.S. military's Middle East command called on Hamas to “suspend violence and shooting at innocent Palestinian civilians” and to disarm “without delay.”

Trump this week endorsed Hamas' crackdown on gangs, while warning it would face air strikes if it did not later disarm.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the public executions after a video, authenticated by Reuters, showed masked gunmen shooting dead seven men in a Gaza street.

Israeli forces inside Gaza have pulled back to what the truce deal calls a yellow line just outside the main cities.

President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants dead hostages held in Gaza back and warns Hamas 'if they don't disarm, we will disarm them.'

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Major US news outlets reject Pentagon's new press rules","https://www.dw.com/en/major-us-news-outlets-reject-pentagons-new-press-rules/a-74358548","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 04:45:36 GMT","

Dozens of news organizations have refused to accept Pentagon's new press policy, saying it amounts to a crackdown on the media.

Several US and international news organizations on Tuesday refused to sign the new rules proposed by the Pentagon for media access.

At least 30 news outlets, including the New York Times, the Associated Press, Reuters, AFP and Fox News, rejected the Pentagon's new media policy, saying that it violates the constitutionally protected right to free speech. 

The Pentagon had warned that it would revoke press badges for news organizations that did not agree with the media access rules. 

Under the new policy, journalists have to acknowledge that they could be deemed security risks and have their Pentagon press badges revoked if they ask department employees to disclose classified and some types of unclassified information.

The new rules come after the Department of Defense has already restricted media access inside the Pentagon, forced some outlets to vacate offices in the building, and reduced the number of press briefings. 

Chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement on Monday: ""The policy does not ask for them to agree, just to acknowledge that they understand what our policy is.""

Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth called the requirements ""common sense,"" adding that ""we're trying to make sure national security is respected.""

The Pentagon Press Association (PPA) said, the media policy ""gags Pentagon employees"" by threatening retaliation against reporters who seek out information that has not been pre-approved for release.

Major broadcasting networks ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News and NBC issued a joint statement saying they will not sign the new rules, which would ""restrict journalists' ability to keep the nation and the world informed of important national security issues.""

""The policy is without precedent and threatens core journalistic protections. We will continue to cover the US military as each of our organizations has done for many decades, upholding the principles of a free and independent press,"" the five networks said in a joint statement.

In addition to Fox News, other conservative outlets are also reportedly refusing to agree to the new policy which could see a total of some 100 press passes revoked.

However, at least one news organization did sign the new policy: the far-right cable network One America News.

While a record 582 gigawatts of renewable energy was added to the grid in 2024, the international renewable energy agency IRENA said this was not enough to meet global climate targets.

Countries around the world are not on track to meet their renewable energy goals despite record growth last year, according to an interim report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) released on Tuesday.

IRENA is an intergovernmental agency that includes 169 countries and the European Union.

The newly installed capacity from renewable energies amounted to around 582 gigawatts in 2024, or around 15.1% more than the previous year.

While this was the highest amount ever recorded, in its report IRENA stressed that this was not enough for countries to reach global renewable energy goals, which target a yearly increase of 16.6%.

The UN Climate Conference in Dubai in 2023, also known as COP28, set the goal of reaching 11.2 terawatts within seven years.

According to the report, an additional 1.122 terawatts would be needed per year to reach the goal by 2030. A terawatt is equivalent to 1,000 gigawatts.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the world was not moving fast enough to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

""Renewables are deployed faster and cheaper than fossil fuels — driving growth, jobs, and affordable power. But the window to keep the 1.5°C limit within reach is rapidly closing,"" the UN chief was cited by the report as saying.

""We must step up, scale up and speed up the just energy transition — for everyone, everywhere,"" he stressed.

The target of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels was set in the Paris Agreement signed at COP21 in 2015.

The long-term global temperature increase was estimated at 1.3 degrees last year.

The next UN Climate Conference, or COP30, is due to be held on November 10 in the city of Belem in the Brazilian Amazon.

A new body comprised of Congolese, M23 and regional representatives will be formed to monitor a potential permanent ceasefire. Qatar, the US and the African Union will act as observers.

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the M23 rebel group agreed on Tuesday to establish an international body to oversee the ceasefire they agreed to in July but which has so far failed to end the fighting.

M23, which is backed by Rwanda, occupies large parts of the North Kivu and South Kivu provinces in Congo's mineral-rich east.

In a statement on X, Kinshasa reaffirmed its ""desire to achieve a cessation of hostilities, to guarantee the security of the population, and to prepare the conditions for a comprehensive and lasting peace agreement.""

Congolese officials said the deal was signed in Doha after mediation by Qatar.

Qatar's Foreign Ministry said that the mechanism will ""investigate and verify reported violations ... and communicate with relevant parties to prevent a resumption of hostilities.""

It described the deal as a ""pivotal step"" toward a comprehensive peace agreement in eastern Congo.

Qatar, the United States of America and the African Union will participate in the mechanisms as observers, the ministry said.

The body itself will consist of an equal number of representatives from the Congolese government and M23, as well as representatives from the 12-country International Conference on the Great Lakes Region.

M23 spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka described the agreement as a ""significant advancement"" in a post on X.

M23 is one of the over 100 armed groups active in eastern Congo.

Around 7 million people have been displaced in the conflict, according to the UN.

Earlier this year, the group seized the major cities of Goma, the provincial capital of North Kivu, and Bukavu, which serves as South Kivu's capital.

Congo signed a ceasefire agreement with the rebel group in Doha in July, but fighting is ongoing and the deal has yet to produce results.

M23 and Congo missed a deadline to finalize a peace deal on August 18, with both parties accusing each other of violating peace terms.

Congo also signed a peace agreement with Rwanda in June. M23, while backed by Kigali, was not a party to the deal.

			Dry statistics don't tell the full story

In his poem On The Circuit, published in 1964, and told from the perspective of a writer on a tour of the United States, WH Auden signed off with these lines: “God bless the USA, so large/So friendly, and so rich.” In the early 1960s, the difference between a Britain still recovering from the Second World War, and a booming America, was dramatically clear. It took the concerted efforts of the Thatcherite governments of the 1980s for the UK to start to narrow the gap.

And yet, six decades on from Auden's time, the gulf has widened once again. There are plenty of dry statistics that think tanks can use to illustrate how the United States has grown far wealthier than the UK, or indeed the rest of Europe, over the last 15 years. But sometimes it is the everyday details that tell the story more vividly than any chart can. Based on my own observations, here are nine different ways in which the gap has become more apparent than ever before.

Some might say it was ever thus. America is a vastly bigger country, after all. But property not only tends to be cheaper in the US than the UK, it has been getting steadily more spacious as well. The median size of a new American home has grown by 150pc since 1980, from 1,595 sq ft to 2,836 sq ft in 2018, according to a study drawing on US Census Bureau data. In the UK, by contrast, the average new home has shrunk by 20pc since the 1970s, with a recent study finding that in many cities it is little more than 700 sq ft. American homes come with home offices and cinemas, and even “man caves” or “craft rooms” as standard. True, the McMansions may all look similar, but they are incredibly comfortable to live in.

It is not just size. Apartment buildings, and even comparatively basic student accommodation, regularly come with pools and gyms. Overall, 8pc of American homes now have a pool, while 90pc of new apartment blocks built over the last decade have a gym, compared to less than 30pc in the 1970s. Of course, fitness is more important than it used to be, but as the country has become richer tenants have also demanded higher standards, along with better facilities, and landlords have to deliver to stay in business. It's quite a contrast with the UK. Perhaps the weather doesn't quite lend itself to outdoor swimming, but even as the economy has expanded, the quality of rented accommodation can hardly be said to have improved all that much since the 1950s, let alone the 1970s.

The statistics vary, but if we include take-outs and casual dining chains, the average American eats approximately two “commercially prepared” meals per week. In Britain, surveys suggest more than 70pc of people do not dine out even once a week. There are more cars per person. They even throw more stuff away, with the US generating almost twice as much “waste” per person than Britain. Sure, Americans drive more because public transport is worse, and they throw more away because they tend to be less worried about the environment. But it is also because they are richer. On any metric you care to look at, Americans consume more, mainly because they have far higher disposable incomes.

From the waitress who cheerfully explains every item on the menu to the doorman who gives directions to the gas station attendant who fills up your car with petrol, America has always had a “have a good day” service culture. But there is more to it than that. In a richer country, tips tend to be more generous, meaning that there is a far higher incentive to spend time on the customer than there is in Britain. In the UK, consumers are more often expected to be happy with whatever they are given.

Look in the window of a British bank branch (if you've still got one), and you might be greeted with a sign marketing a savings account, paying a pitiful rate of interest, designed to help you save for a holiday, or Christmas, or a “rainy day”. In the US, your bank is more likely to promise to help you build “generational wealth”. The difference exposes the gulf in ambition between middle-income families on either side of the Atlantic. In a richer country, with lower capital taxes, private fortunes grow far more quickly. America's federal version of inheritance tax doesn't kick in until you are passing on more than $13m, compared to as little as £325,000 in the UK.

While many British graduates have to rely on their parents to support them, and sleep on a friend's couch while they get some experience for their first job, in the US 60pc of all internships are now paid, according to one study. On average, an intern is paid $16-21 an hour, or £12-15, which if they do 40 hours a week is almost as much as the average weekly wage in the UK. American companies make so much more money that they can afford to be a lot more generous even to the work experience kids.

The average US household now consumes three times as much electricity as the average household in the UK. In part that is because houses are much bigger, but it is also because air conditioning is now standard and labour saving devices are even more abundant. The reason? Energy is cheaper in America and also people are richer so they don't have to watch the bills. Of course, the US burns more fossil fuels, but following the massive investment of the Biden presidency, renewables now account for 24pc of America's electricity.

Americans gave an eye-watering $592bn to charity last year, according to Giving USA. Measured as a percentage of GDP, other studies have found that charitable giving is almost three times the level of the UK. You can see the evidence of it everywhere, from lavishly endowed universities, to public libraries, to well paid orchestras, to social purpose foundations addressing every conceivable need. True, the US has a far less generous welfare system, so charities have to fill in the gaps. But it is also a mark of wealth. When you have more, you can give more away.

There are already 1,500 driverless cars on American roads, compared to zero in the UK. There are over 2,000 “vertical farms” supplying fresh vegetables from glass tower blocks compared to a handful in the UK. There are now more than 100 commercial rocket launches in the US each year. America has always been an innovative country. But as it gets richer, it can invest more, and its lead keeps getting bigger and bigger. The fruits of that innovation also become more obvious as their benefits spread to ordinary consumers.

Of course, the US is still a relatively unequal country. Healthcare is extraordinarily expensive, and there are pockets of real deprivation. And yet, middle-class lifestyles have also become lavish compared to the UK. The reason is simple. While Europe stopped growing 20 years ago, the US carried on at 2pc to 3pc a year. Over time, that really starts to add up. And the evidence of that has become most clear in the details of everyday life.

“For Trump, the leader of Argentina is more important than American families struggling with rising costs,” said Warren.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Republican Sen. Tim Scott (South Carolina) blocked a bill seeking to stop President Donald Trump's unprecedented $20 billion bailout of Argentina and its far right government on Tuesday, with Democrats criticizing Republicans' priorities as Americans languish under GOP cuts to social programs.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) tried to pass the No Argentina Bailout Act on Tuesday afternoon via unanimous consent.

In a speech on the Senate floor, she sharply criticized the Trump administration for giving far right Argentinian President Javier Milei a massive handout while gutting health care benefits for millions of Americans, causing prices to soar due to tariffs, and firing thousands of Americans working in key government agencies.

“[Treasury] Secretary [Scott] Bessent seems to be saying that the American economy can tank, and Americans can pay higher prices, but there will be no end to using American taxpayer dollars to bail out Argentina,” said Warren. “For Trump, the leader of Argentina is more important than American families struggling with rising costs for health care.”

The bill was blocked by Scott, who defended the bailout as backing “an important ally in South America” — an ally that, as Democrats pointed out, has been undercutting the U.S. on soybean exports and harming American farmers. 

As Democrats pointed out, however, Trump and Republicans may have ulterior motives for the bailout. Popular Information reported last month that hedge fund manager Rob Citrone, a billionaire ally of Bessent, has significant investments in Argentina — and thus has a large financial stake in the success of the country's economy.

The Trump administration also has political motivations for supporting Milei, a libertarian Trump supporter whose austerity measures caused poverty to skyrocket to above 50 percent in Argentina in his first six months in office.

Warren pointed out that the bailout is seemingly timed with Argentinian midterm elections coming up on October 26 which may lose Milei a majority in the country's legislature. 

“With global investors pulling their money from the country, trying to get off his sinking ship, and destabilizing its financial markets, his party's electoral chances looked really slim. So, Trump is sending 20 billion U.S. taxpayer dollars to bail out Argentina and prop up Milei so he can stay in power,” she said. 

Democrats also lambasted Republicans for supporting the bailout at the outset of the third week of the government shutdown, which is keeping thousands of federal workers in limbo and suspending crucial services supported by American taxpayers.

“Trump refuses to negotiate to keep the government open or prevent a massive spike in health care costs for Americans, but he's eager to shell out $20 billion of taxpayer money to bail out his authoritarian buddy in Argentina,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland), a cosponsor of the bill, when Democrats introduced the legislation last week. 

“All the while, Americans are stuck facing higher prices at the grocery store and higher premiums on their health insurance. We must put a stop to Trump's brazen scheme to put himself and his cronies ahead of the needs of the American people,” Van Hollen said.

“It's day 13 of the shutdown. What's Trump doing? Negotiating a budget deal? No. Preventing premiums from doubling? No. Stopping 15 million Americans from losing health care? No,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), another bill cosponsor. “He's meeting the Pres. of Argentina to reward him with a $20 billion bailout.”

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

The campaign is part of a larger $3.2 million contract that also includes paying pastors to produce content.

A newly-created firm called Show Faith by Works is embarking on a “geofencing” campaign to target Christian churches and colleges across the American Southwest with pro-Israel advertisements. The pastors and congregations themselves are seemingly unaware of this campaign, and some have concerns with Israel's methods to target Christians.

According to the firm's filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), Show Faith by Works will “geofence the actual boundaries of every Major (sic) church in California, Arizona, Nevada, and Coloardo (sic) and all Christian Colleges during worship times” and then “track attendees and continue to target [them] with ads” on behalf of Israel. The geofencing campaign is part of a larger $3.2 million contract that also includes trying to hire celebrity spokespeople and paying pastors to produce content.

RS reached out to hundreds of churches in California, Arizona, Nevada, and Colorado that were listed as potential targets of the geofencing campaign. None that responded were aware of the campaign. “We were not aware of that, no — you are the first to bring that to our attention,” said the press office for Bethel Church in Redding, California.

Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.

The project manager of the operation, Chad Schnitger, explained in an email to RS that the ads may include “invitations for Christians to visit one of our upcoming Mobile Museum exhibits, or to go to our website to learn more about the program, or to visit Israel with your church.” The firm's pitch deck describes the ads as “pro-lsreal (sic) and anti-Palestinian.”

The “Mobile Museum” Schnitger is referring to is a mobile trailer coordinated by his firm that will visit Christian colleges and churches highlighting atrocities from the Hamas attack on October 7, as well as “footage of IDF explaining the difficulty of fighting bad guys in hostile territory with civilians.” Schnitger confirmed the firm currently has one mobile museum exhibit, and that it would be ready to start travelling to churches and colleges in about a month.

Geofencing has long been a way for corporations to capture audiences by using their location services. It allows corporations to market their products using the location of mobile devices, triggering texts, in-app notifications, or mobile ads when users enter a certain physical boundary.

In an interview with RS, Megan Iorio, Senior Counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, described geofencing as a “privacy nightmare.” Iorio explained that data brokers vacuum up data from various applications that use location services, and then will either sell that data to marketing firms or offer marketing tools themselves. Then, users with location services enabled might, for instance, see an H&M advertisement if they walk within a certain radius of an H&M store.

Schnitger said that media reports covering the geofencing campaign have been “sensationalized” and pointed out that it's a common marketing tool; “It is not sending information back to a foreign entity; it's a way to deliver ads … This is a 1-way ad push using marketing tools that have been in place for over 10 years.” Iorio explained that while it is commonplace, the technique is “incredibly invasive.”

“The fact it has become so common and that foreign governments are now using it for targeted, precise influence campaigns shows how much we need regulation to stamp down on the practice. Today, it's the Israeli government looking to curry favor among Christians, but tomorrow it could be a foreign adversary looking to foment discord in a specific US city, and that has broad national security implications.” she added.

Some members of the communities listed as potential targets of Israel's geofencing campaign share these concerns about Israel using this marketing technique.

Micah, a mechanical engineer in Colorado Springs, has been conducting outreach to pastors and local newspapers in order to raise awareness that seven local churches were listed in the document as targets of the geofencing campaign. Micah circulated a document outlining his concerns, which RS obtained a copy of.

“What jumps out immediately is how the entire document talks about Christians as targets to be manipulated. This isn't respectful outreach — it's warfare language,” he wrote.

One of Micah's main concerns is that the firm is paying pastors on behalf of Israel. Show Faith by Works' pitch deck includes a plan to give stipends for “individual guest pastors, bilingual pastors, or pastors who match target demographics to record messages based on content creation targets.” Micah says that this “creates financial conflicts of interest where religious leaders become financially dependent on foreign government messaging, compromising their independence and integrity.”

Asa, Micah's brother, attends Scottsdale Bible Church in Arizona, one of the churches listed by Show Faith by Works. Asa said that Show Faith by Works' campaign is a reaction to Israel losing the support of America's youth. “This entire project is an attempt to regain the attention and hearts/support of Gen Z through the use of religious manipulation,” he said. Micah and Asa requested that RS exclude their full names to discuss the matter freely.

Schnitger is optimistic about swaying Christians' views on Israel. “For those who dislike Israel, maybe some of these exhibits and materials will change your mind.” Part of that effort is to stress anti-Palestinian talking points. The firm's pitch deck includes talking points about how “[P]alestinian and Iranian goals are not land-focused, but genocidal.”

Timothy Feldman, a software engineer in Plano, Texas, explained in an email to RS that he was upset to see his church listed as a potential target for Israel's geofencing campaign. “I am disgusted that a genocidal apartheid state is attempting to whitewash its atrocities by propagandizing the good people of Christ United Methodist Church,” said Feldman.

Despite the inclusion of Texas churches like the one in Plano in the pitch deck, Schnitger clarified in an email that the firm is currently not doing anything in Texas.

A church worker in Prescott, Arizona, saw his church on the list too and explained to RS in a phone interview that it's unclear how the pastors will respond. “The demographics in Prescott tend to be pro-Israel, so it's hard to know how the church leadership will react to this. All we can do is make people aware of it,” he said, requesting anonymity to speak freely about the issue.

The geofencing campaign will be overseen by Eran Shayovich, the Chief of Staff at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel. Shayovich is spearheading an initiative called “project 545,” which he describes as a campaign to “amplify Israel's strategic communication and public diplomacy efforts.” Shayovich is also the point of contact for Brad Parscale, Trump's former campaign manager who is coordinating efforts to train ChatGPT on behalf of Israel and integrate pro-Israel messaging into conservative media.

Some states have taken action against geofencing as a practice. In June, Oregon passed a law that prohibits the sale of precise geolocation information, following a similar provision passed by Maryland last year.

Lina Khan's FTC banned several data brokers from collecting and selling data from sensitive locations such as churches and military installations. While these companies — including Gravy Analytics and Mobilewalla — have attracted significant media attention over the last several years, there is an extensive industry of data brokers that continue to operate in the shadows buying and selling location data at places of worship.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

 To Outcompete China, Washington Must Unleash the Private Sector

 Todd Young

In September 2024, Akeso, a little-known Chinese biopharmaceutical company, announced that clinical trials had shown that its new drug could halt the progression of a type of lung cancer for nearly a full year. These results sent shock waves through the pharmaceutical industry: the previous best-in-class drug, produced by the U.S. pharmaceutical giant Merck, delayed new tumor growth for only six months.

Spurred by breakthroughs like this, China is becoming a world-leading biotechnology innovator. Western biopharmaceutical companies are clamoring to ink deals with their Chinese counterparts. Over the last five years, the number of agreements struck by Chinese companies producing cancer drugs to license their intellectual property has more than doubled. The total market capitalization of China's publicly listed biotech firms has reached $1.5 trillion, second only to that of the United States.

As China surges, many traditional American strengths have atrophied. The United States lacks a targeted federal strategy for biotechnology, and its policymaking is fragmented and uncoordinated. Federal research funding has stagnated, while skittish investors are avoiding cutting-edge projects. Regulatory burdens slow down innovators who want to go from lab to market. And the United States' research infrastructure, biological data reserves, and workforce development pipeline are not just faltering—they are being left in the dust by Beijing.

The United States cannot, and should not, try to beat China by being more like China, which relies on subsidizing handpicked firms. Instead, the United States should lean into its existing advantages, especially its private sector. By proactively remedying market failures, the federal government can help unleash private-sector capital to fuel the country's world-class biotechnology industry. If the United States successfully reasserts its biotech leadership, it can ensure that the new technology makes everyone safer, healthier, and more secure. But if the United States remains passive, China will shape how biotechnology develops, threatening not only U.S. dominance in this vital sector but also its national security.

China is gaining ground in biotechnology just as the field is entering a fundamentally new age. Thanks to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, engineering, and automation, researchers can now model extraordinarily complex biological systems without needing to fully understand how those systems work. In 2021, for instance, researchers from Google's AI lab, DeepMind, solved the previously impossible challenge of understanding and predicting how proteins fold. Before AI, enumerating all possible shapes of a single protein would have taken longer than the age of the known universe. DeepMind's AlphaFold system, in contrast, can accurately predict the shape of a protein in minutes.

Humans are now on the cusp of understanding and programming cells as easily as they program computers. AI models are learning how to become fluent in the language of DNA, just as they can communicate easily in English or Mandarin. Technology is also democratizing biotechnology, in much the way that personal computers became more affordable in the 1990s. The cost of sequencing a human genome, for example, has dropped from hundreds of millions of dollars in the early 2000s to hundreds of dollars today.

As biotechnology becomes more accessible, its applications are multiplying by the day. Noninvasive genetic testing has existed for decades; breakthroughs in genomics are now transforming how doctors treat previously incurable diseases. In 2023, for example, researchers developed the first FDA-approved gene therapy based on CRISPR-Cas9 technology, using a patient's own edited stem cells to treat sickle cell disease. Research labs are deploying AI to further develop these biotechnologies, which could lead to new treatments and medicine for a range of life-threatening diseases.

Emerging biotechnology has major ramifications for national security and geopolitical competition. It has the potential to reshape every strategic sector, including defense, agriculture, energy, and manufacturing. In the realm of the military, biotechnology could allow countries to reshore the production of chemicals used in munitions. Soldiers could synthesize food, medication, and other battlefield essentials on the frontlines by using technologies that fit inside a backpack.

Manufacturers could also use custom-designed proteins to separate critical minerals from waste in the mining process, which could lower the costs of extracting such minerals, increase their production, and reduce dependence on unreliable supply chain partners. Farmers could grow drought- and pest-resistant crops. Biotechnology could even change the future of computing power by replacing silicon-based storage hardware with a synthetic, biological alternative that could hold significantly more data in less space.

These innovations could help a country thrive—or be used to hurt a rival. A military could exploit human enhancements to outmaneuver and overwhelm an adversary. Modified pathogens could be developed and unleashed into an enemy's agricultural system, wiping out farmers' livelihoods and causing prices at the grocery store to skyrocket. And adversaries could weaponize dependencies on pharmaceuticals to disrupt a country's supplies of vital medications.

The country that leads global biotechnology will determine how and to what ends this transformative technology is used. For most of the twentieth century, the United States dominated the field. In the 1940s, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in partnership with the private sector, discovered and mass-produced new strains of penicillin. In the 1970s, American biochemists discovered how to cut and splice DNA fragments, paving the way for the development of synthetic medicines. In the 1990s, the United States led the effort to sequence the full human genome for the first time. To this day, the United States has more biotechnology patents, companies, and Nobel Prize winners than any other country.

But China is swiftly closing the gap. For nearly 20 years, China has made biotechnology a strategic priority, implementing a comprehensive package of financing, subsidies, and diplomatic support for its domestic industry. In 2020, Chinese leader Xi Jinping stressed the need to incorporate biosecurity into the country's national security system, pushing for more independent scientific innovation so that China would not need to depend on the United States.

Both the Chinese Communist Party and the army have taken Xi's charge to heart. They have launched a so-called whole-of-nation effort—centralizing control of science and technology efforts and leveraging all available state resources at their disposal—to develop cutting-edge biotechnologies to advance their military and economic objectives. Beijing is investing heavily in gene editing, bionic robots, human-machine teaming (that is, collaboration between humans and machines), and biomanufacturing. It has collapsed the barriers between civilian and defense research so that ostensibly private Chinese companies, such as the biotechnology giant BGI Group, serve the CCP's military and technology research goals. It is no coincidence that BGI also manages the China National GeneBank, which stores genetic data and biological samples.

Beijing has turned to a familiar playbook to promote its biotech goals. It lavishes subsidies on its chosen champions and helps them acquire U.S. companies that are developing promising technologies. In 2013, for instance, BGI purchased the U.S.-based company Complete Genomics, which made BGI the world leader in genetic sequencing. Market dominance and scale make it possible for BGI to box out promising U.S. startups. The Chinese company WuXi AppTec—whose market share in biotech mirrors Huawei's commanding position in telecommunications—has gobbled up U.S. firms to gain access to their intellectual property. Today, the vast majority of U.S. biopharmaceutical companies depend on WuXi and similar Chinese firms for everything from drug discovery research services to manufacturing of finished pharmaceuticals.

The Chinese government supports biotech with investments in both physical and human capital. Beijing has built and funded over 100 world-class biotechnology parks with state-of-the-art lab space for companies. China's state-owned enterprises are investing in biotech firms, and several have begun making acquisitions to expand overseas. Authorities have also urged venture capital firms to fund biotech ventures and companies. And an increasing number of Chinese students trained abroad are returning home, bolstering China's rising competitiveness in the global race for scientific talent.

Beijing's strategy is working. From 2016 to 2021, the market value of Chinese biotech firms grew 100-fold to $300 billion. By 2023, China's investment in biopharmaceutical research and development had soared to $15 billion, from $35 million in 2015. From January to July 2025, the Hang Seng Biotech Index, which tracks the top 30 biotechnology, medical device, and pharmaceutical companies listed in Hong Kong, rose more than 60 percent, far outpacing the three percent gain in the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index over the same time frame.

China's dominance goes beyond market gains. In 2024, China surpassed the United States in world-class cancer research output, as measured by the Nature index of top journals in science and health. In synthetic biology, too, China has upstaged the United States as the top source of research. In 2010, researchers based in the United States published 45 percent of the most-cited research papers in the field, while those in China accounted for 13 percent. In 2023, researchers in China published 60 percent, while their U.S. counterparts produced only seven percent.



China has now surpassed the United States in drug clinical trials, registering more than 7,100 in 2024, to the United States' 6,000. Offering government-backed scale and low prices, the global share of China's pharmaceutical output quadrupled from 2002 to 2019. U.S. and foreign drug manufacturers are increasingly dependent on Chinese sources for the raw materials and intermediate inputs for active pharmaceutical ingredients, and on fully Chinese-made active ingredients, as well.

Beijing's biotechnology success is both an impressive achievement and a cause for deep concern for the United States and its partners. China's biotech industry operates with fewer ethical guardrails, which could cause irreversible damage. In 2018, a Chinese biophysicist used the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the genomes of human embryos, which broke global norms and opened up a Pandora's box of unknown consequences. The scientist was fired and sentenced to three years in prison, but he is already back in the lab. Yet rogue scientists are not the only abusers of biotechnology. Journalists have documented how Chinese authorities are methodically collecting genomic data on millions of Uyghurs, a Muslim minority group, and using it to support a campaign of mass repression that the United States government has formally designated as genocide.

In 2021, Reuters revealed that a commercially available prenatal test developed by BGI that had been used by more than eight million women across at least 52 countries had been created in partnership with researchers connected to the Chinese military. BGI has worked closely with the People's Liberation Army and its affiliated medical universities on multiple other projects, including research that could have implications for improving the battlefield performance of Chinese soldiers. The CCP has given the world few reasons to trust that its biotechnology ambitions are benevolent.

The U.S. biotech industry is poised to grow, but it needs private capital to get off the sidelines and fuel the next wave of breakthroughs. While China provides its leading companies with cheap capital through government subsidies and investments, America's strong private markets remain its core advantage. The U.S. government needs to empower those markets to do their job by addressing the obstacles biotechnology companies face in scaling up innovations: complex regulations, underutilized capital, and insufficient protections against dangers such as intellectual property theft.

Since its creation in 2022, the bipartisan National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology, on which I serve as chairman, has searched for ways to advance U.S. leadership in biotechnology. Most important, the United States needs a private-public partnership to develop the domestic biotechnology industry so it can reach its full potential. Such an alliance would remedy the market failures that inhibit American innovators, investors, and entrepreneurs from achieving breakthroughs in the field. Supply-side actions such as research prizes and infrastructure investments can accelerate R & D, while targeted demand-side policies can reduce financial risks and regulatory bottlenecks and make the U.S. government a better customer for biotechnology products.

This spring, I helped introduce the bipartisan National Biotechnology Initiative Act of 2025, which would enshrine some of the commission's recommendations in federal law, including streamlining biotech regulations and establishing an office to coordinate national biotechnology strategy. I am also working with my colleagues to advance legislation to create an Independence Investment Fund that would invest in technology startups that strengthen U.S. national and economic security; authorize and finance a network of manufacturing facilities across the United States to scale up bioindustrial products before they are fully commercially viable; make investments to improve the effectiveness and reach of the popular Small Business Innovation Research/Technology Transfer program to support early-stage innovation; and use advance market commitments—promises to buy biotechnology products if they are successfully produced—and purchase agreements to smooth out unpredictable or inconsistent demand, among many other policies.

If the United States is to reassert its global biotechnology leadership and shape a secure, safe, and ethical biotechnology future, the U.S. government must work with allies. The United States and its likeminded partners must set the standards for how biotechnology is developed and used rather than wait for China to build a system that allows unethical gene editing and biotech-powered mass surveillance and repression.

The United States must show the world that Beijing's tactics are not aimed at mutually beneficial international partnerships, but at global biotechnological control. That pursuit of dominance will not be limited to overtaking the United States; the CCP's strategy is to use its growing biotech dominance as economic and geopolitical leverage around the world.

Whereas the Chinese party leadership appears to view other countries' bioeconomies as threats to be contained, the United States should view them as opportunities to secure and expand a shared biotechnological future. As with defense and economic alliances, the United States must work with partners to foster a collective security outlook that standardizes the approach to biotechnology protection. Specifically, the United States and its allies need to establish a unified approach to data security, export controls, and whether and how to accept investment from adversaries. Reciprocal biological data-sharing agreements would both advance collaborative research and implement and enforce secure, fair, and transparent data standards—especially when China has built its own large biodata repository, as its government has done in collaboration with BGI.



Advancing biotechnology also requires the United States to identify allies and partners that have complementary goals, capabilities, and expertise. Nearly every country has something valuable to offer, whether advanced manufacturing capabilities, computational biology prowess, or biobased chemicals and advanced therapeutics. Today, the State Department's International Technology Security and Innovation Fund, which finances partnerships to improve global supply chains, does not cover biotechnology; that must be remedied immediately. The Trump administration should also expand its diplomatic efforts to promote American biotechnology, reaching out to partners to expand market access and boost aggregate demand for U.S. biotechnology products.

The United States has learned the lesson of technological complacency before—and paid dearly for it. Semiconductors, much like biotechnology, were an American invention, first soldered together in garages in Palo Alto. For years, however, China moved aggressively to close the gap. In 2022, Congress passed the landmark CHIPS and Science Act, which aimed to spur the production of semiconductors on U.S. and allied soil and to use export controls to prevent the most advanced semiconductor technology from getting into adversaries' hands. This policy is succeeding. The United States is again becoming the leading global hub for advanced chip manufacturing, while its restrictions on adversaries' access to semiconductors have set back China's chip-making.

The United States can win the biotechnology race. By harnessing two of the United States' greatest strengths—its dynamic private sector and its unmatched network of allies and partners across the world—Congress and the Trump administration can ensure that the United States, not China, leads the biotechnology age. Strategic action now is the difference between controlling the biotechnology future or being controlled by it.

 What His Assault on the U.S. Military Means for America

 Max Boot

It might be difficult to remember now, but U.S. President Donald Trump delivered his first blow to American civil-military relations in 2017, when he first started talking about “my generals.” He had appointed a former Marine general, James Mattis, as secretary of defense, which is a position typically reserved for civilians to preserve civilian control of the military. Mattis became the first former general to serve as defense secretary since George Marshall in 1950, and he needed to secure a congressional waiver in order to take the job.

Trump also appointed other high-ranking military officers to civilian posts, including former Marine General John Kelly (who served first as secretary of homeland security and then as White House chief of staff) and his first two national security advisers: Michael Flynn, a retired three-star general, and H. R. McMaster, an active-duty three-star general. Even Vice President Mike Pence's national security adviser was a retired army lieutenant general: Keith Kellogg (who is now special envoy for Ukraine). Few, if any, previous U.S. presidents had so brazenly tried to benefit from proximity to the U.S. military. Appointing so many generals to such high offices is more typical of a military junta than of a constitutional republic. But Trump reveled in the aura of toughness conveyed by these military men; he delighted, for example, in referring to Mattis as “Mad Dog,” a nickname that the cerebral general hated.

It did not take Trump long to become disenchanted with his generals. Within two years, he fired almost all of them, insulting most on their way out the door. He later said that Army General Mark Milley, his handpicked choice for chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (and one of the few Trump kept until the end of his term), should have been executed for treason because he had called his Chinese counterpart to offer reassurances that the United States was not planning to start a war after the storming of the Capitol by Trump's supporters on January 6, 2021.

When Trump came into office for a second time this past January, he was deeply suspicious of the uniformed military, believing that the retired and active-duty generals he had appointed during his first term had stymied his unilateralist and isolationist instincts. Trump came to see all these generals as part of a “deep state” cabal frustrating his MAGA mandate, and he was determined not to fall into the same trap in his second term.

As a result, Trump went much further down the chain of command to choose his current secretary of defense, selecting Pete Hegseth, a Fox News weekend host who had never risen above the rank of major in the Army National Guard and who had never run any large organization. His chief qualification appears to be unquestioning subservience to Trump, and he has subjected the military to a culture war agenda, highlighted by his recent dressing down of admirals and generals at Quantico, Virginia, in which he promised to purge “woke garbage.”

Among other steps, Hegseth is returning Confederate names to military bases and styling himself as “secretary of war” after Trump issued an executive order to rename the Department of Defense to the less “wokey” Department of War. (Trump does not have the legal authority to rename the Department of Defense with an executive order.) Both Trump and Hegseth have subjected service members—ranging from junior troops to senior generals—to political lectures that are inappropriate in military settings. In an early October speech, for instance, to mark the navy's 250th birthday, Trump referred to Democrats as a “little gnat that's on our shoulder” while Hegseth looked on approvingly. Among the steps that Trump and Hegseth have taken to bend the armed forces to their will, the most worrisome include firing more than a dozen respected general officers (many of them women and minorities) for no good reason, imposing their ideology on military classrooms and websites, and deploying the armed forces for legally dubious missions both domestically and internationally as part of its undeclared war on crime.

By being so slavish in serving the president, Hegseth has managed to keep his job despite widespread reports of infighting and dysfunction in his office, as well as his willingness to share highly sensitive details of upcoming airstrikes in an unsecure Signal chat that included a prominent journalist. But his job tenure has come at high cost to the armed forces—and the country.

It's easy to lose sight of how radical the MAGA military agenda is when focusing on each action in isolation. Only by glancing at the entirety of what Trump and Hegseth have wrought can one see what a far-reaching assault they are mounting on the apolitical professionalism that has made the U.S. armed forces one of the most admired institutions in American society—and one of the most emulated and envied militaries around the world. Indeed, the attempt by Trump and Hegseth to roll back military professionalism and to politicize the armed forces is not just a question of degrading military morale and effectiveness, hurting recruiting and retention, and distracting the armed forces from their primary mission (such as countering Russian and Chinese aggression), although those are all real concerns. What Trump and Hegseth are doing also represents a threat to democracy—and a profound test for service members, who do not swear a personal loyalty oath to the president but swear to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States.”

The Trump administration wasted no time stamping the MAGA brand on the U.S. armed forces. On January 21, one day into the new presidency, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security fired Admiral Linda Fagan, the first female commandant of the Coast Guard, without stating a reason. Administration officials leaked on background that she was relieved for, among other offenses, a supposedly “excessive focus” on diversity and inclusion efforts. Four days later, Trump fired inspectors general at 15 federal agencies, including the Department of Defense. These are the internal watchdogs who are supposed to root out fraud, abuse, inefficiency, and other problems, thereby serving as a check on executive branch leaders. Getting rid of the incumbents signaled that scrutiny of administration actions would not be welcome in the future. Four days after that, Hegseth revoked the security detail protecting Milley, by now retired, even though Tehran had placed a price on his head after the U.S. armed forces killed the commander of Iran's Quds Force during Trump's first term.

Less than a month later, on a Friday night in February, Trump fired General C. Q. Brown, the second Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the first woman to rise to chief of naval operations. Again, no reason was given, leading to widespread suspicion that Brown's race and Franchetti's sex had a lot to do with their fate. (Trump also simultaneously fired General James Slife, a white man who was vice chief of the U.S. Air Force.) Brown, a low-key but widely respected leader, was said to have incurred the administration's wrath by making a video in 2020, during the George Floyd protests, talking about the discrimination he had faced during his rise through the ranks. Hegseth had also suggested in the past that Brown, who had previously served as chief of staff of the air force, had been promoted because of his skin color.

While the president was personally relieving these senior officers, Hegseth was firing the judge advocates general (JAGs) of the army, air force, and navy. These are the senior officers charged with ensuring that their services comply with the law. Their dismissal was to be expected given Hegseth's long-standing contempt for “jagoffs,” his derisive nickname for the JAGs. Hegseth has previously defended service members accused of war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq, convincing Trump to pardon several of them during his first term. More recently, Hegseth has said that he wants the “War Department” to focus on “maximum lethality, not tepid legality,” thereby issuing a de facto invitation to the troops to engage in unlawful conduct.



Brown's replacement as chairman of the Joint Chiefs was an unusual choice: Dan “Razin” Caine, a retired air force three-star general who was brought back to active duty and promoted to full general. He did not meet the statutory requirements to be chairman—by law that post is supposed to be filled by a four-star general who was previously vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, a service chief, or a combatant commander. But Trump convinced the Senate to waive the rules and confirm Caine because he was evidently convinced that the general was one of his political supporters. Trump often told the story—which is denied by Caine and those who know him—that the general had donned a MAGA hat and pledged unwavering loyalty when he met with Trump in Iraq in 2018.

In fact, Caine has been careful to act apolitically since being confirmed. For example, at a June 22 press conference about the U.S. airstrikes on the Iranian nuclear program, Hegseth lavished praise on Trump and echoed his unproven assertions about the Iranian nuclear program being “obliterated,” while Caine stuck to praising U.S. military personnel and offered more measured bomb-damage assessments. But Caine's very selection is a message about how Trump demands political loyalty above all else in his generals—and how little he values diversity.

In the months since the initial round of firings, the Trump purge has claimed two other well-respected female general officers: Navy Vice Admiral Shoshana Chatfield, a former president of the Navy War College, was relieved in April as the U.S. representative to the NATO Military committee, and Vice Admiral Yvette Davis was removed in July as the superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy after only a year in the job. (Superintendents typically serve three to four years.) Apparently, Chatfield's offense was saying “Our diversity is our strength,” which Hegseth has called “the single dumbest phrase in military history.”

Hegseth denies that race or gender played a role in these removals—he routinely claims that every move he makes is designed to promote “lethality”—but such claims ring hollow given how much emphasis the defense secretary has placed on removing all traces of diversity, equity, and inclusion from the military, an institution that helped lead the desegregation of American society. Hegseth, for instance, ended celebrations of Black History Month and Women's History Month and demanded that any “DEI” material be scrubbed from Department of Defense schools, military academies, and websites. This led to the removal of any mention of the Tuskegee Airmen (the Black pilots of World War II), the Navajo Code Talkers (the Native Americans who were integral to Marine Corps operations in the Pacific), and Jackie Robinson (the first Black major league baseball player, who also served in the army). A navy tanker named for Harvey Milk, the slain gay rights leader and navy veteran, was renamed. Some—but not all—of these Orwellian erasures were subsequently rescinded, such as the purging of images, presumably because of the word “gay,” of the Enola Gay, the B-29 that dropped the first atomic bomb on Japan and which was named after the pilot's mother. Many of the 381 volumes that were initially removed from the shelves of the Naval Academy library were also eventually returned. But not everything was restored, and the pressure on the military to hew to the MAGA agenda remains.

For instance, in July, Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll ordered West Point to rescind an offer of employment to Jen Easterly, an army veteran and West Point alumna who had led the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency during the Biden administration. Then, in September, the West Point alumni group canceled a ceremony to present the actor Tom Hanks with the Sylvanus Thayer Award, conferred annually on an “outstanding citizen” who exemplifies the academy's devotion to “Duty, Honor, Country.” Hanks—who has made numerous films and TV shows celebrating U.S. military valor and helped raise money for military memorials and veterans—was a supporter of former President Joe Biden and a critic of Trump. Trump, in turn, celebrated the decision on social media, writing, “We don't need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards!!!” West Point has also closed down clubs for minority cadets such as the Asian-Pacific Forum Club, the Latin Cultural Club, and the National Society of Black Engineers Club. In May, the philosophy professor Graham Parsons wrote in a New York Times op-ed that he was leaving the faculty because West Point was “eliminating courses, modifying syllabuses and censoring arguments to comport with the ideological tastes of the Trump administration.”



As part of his anti-“woke” agenda, Hegseth has also restored the Confederate names of military bases that were dropped as a result of legislation that Congress passed over Trump's veto in January 2021. Hegseth is skirting the law by renaming the bases after veterans who have the same last names as the Confederates they were originally named after. Thus, Fort Liberty again becomes Fort Bragg—this time supposedly named not for Confederate General Braxton Bragg but for Private Roland L. Bragg, a hitherto obscure infantryman who fought in the Battle of the Bulge. This legerdemain combines Hegseth's opposition to “wokeness” with his contempt for the rule of law.

That same impulse is evident in the air force's decision to grant a funeral with full military honors to Ashli Babbitt, an air force veteran who was killed by police while trying to break into the House chamber during the January 6, 2021, insurrection instigated by Trump. Retired Army Lieutenant General Mark Hertling wrote in The Bulwark that he was “infuriated” by the decision because “she did not die defending the Constitution. She died trying to overturn it.”

After the assassination of the prominent Trump supporter Charlie Kirk on September 10, Hegseth ordered his aides to find and punish any military members or Pentagon civilians who posted anything online that appeared to “celebrate or mock” his death. Online vigilantes joined in by posting on X under the hashtag #RevolutionariesintheRanks to uncover supposed offenders. Many of the highlighted comments did not actually condone the murder but simply took issue with some of Kirk's controversial statements. As of early October, The Washington Post reported, the Defense Department had investigated nearly 300 employees, both uniformed and civilian, resulting in a number of disciplinary actions, including firings.

Hegseth has also tried to stifle critical press coverage by demanding that all media organizations accredited to cover the Pentagon sign an agreement that they will not report or solicit any information they are not explicitly authorized to have by department leaders. The Pentagon press office threatened to revoke media credentials for any organizations that refused to sign this agreement, which media organizations argue impinges on their First Amendment rights.

Meanwhile, Hegseth has continued purging senior officers for blatantly political reasons. On April 3, he fired General Timothy Haugh, the head of Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, along with the civilian deputy director at the NSA, Wendy Noble. No explanation was offered, but Laura Loomer, a Trump supporter and avid conspiracy theorist, claimed credit by saying that she had denounced the two senior officials during a meeting with Trump. Loomer argued they were both “disloyal” to the president because Haugh was supposedly “handpicked” by Mark Milley in 2023, when Milley was still chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. There is no accusation that Haugh and Noble were not doing a good job and no evidence that they were subverting the president.

A few months later, in August, Hegseth got rid of more senior officers, firing Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency; Vice Admiral Nancy Lacore, the chief of the Navy Reserve; Rear Admiral Milton Sands, a Navy SEAL officer who oversees Naval Special Warfare Command; and General David Allvin, the chief of staff of the air force, who will be retiring two years into a four-year term. It wasn't clear why all these leaders were cashiered, beyond the obvious fact that Lacore is a woman and Kruse presided over an agency that issued a preliminary intelligence estimate that found that Iran's nuclear facilities were not “obliterated” by a U.S. airstrike, as Trump had claimed. That Kruse was fired for having his agency offer a good-faith intelligence estimate strongly signals that truth telling from either the armed forces or the intelligence community is not welcome in this administration—at least not when the truth conflicts with the president's spin.

Presidents, of course, have the right to fire general officers and have done so in the past. Harry Truman relieved General Douglas MacArthur for defying his decision not to extend the Korean War to China, and Barack Obama relieved General Stanley McChrystal after his staff members were quoted in a magazine article disparaging Obama and Biden, his vice president. But there is no precedent for the rapid dismissal of so many senior officers without any real explanation, evidence of failings, or misconduct. This looks like an attempt by Trump and Hegseth to install compliant general officers who will do the president's bidding, no matter what, even if the president is demanding actions that are unwise, unethical, or illegal—or all three. The message they are sending is that any officers who question the president's whims will find themselves in civilian clothes in short order.

The purge of honest and independent officials will have serious repercussions for U.S. foreign policy. In the future, when the president and his top aides are making vital national security decisions, they are less likely to have access to a full range of intelligence and opinions about the merits of various courses of action, because the professionals at the Defense Department and in the intelligence community will know they are only supposed to tell the president what he wants to hear. It is a recipe for the kind of groupthink that got the United States into the Vietnam and Iraq wars.

The worrisome impact of such moves can already be seen in the administration's dubious deployments of the military both domestically and internationally for missions far removed from traditional warfighting. One wonders, for instance, if senior military officials raised concerns about Trump's decision to send the armed forces into what the president calls “Democrat-run” cities. Since the start of his term, Trump has ordered National Guard troops into Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Memphis, and Portland, while also proposing deployments in Louisiana. In his September speech to generals and admirals, Trump said, “We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.” Trump cites as a rationale supposed crime “emergencies,” even though crime rates have been falling across the country and there is no indication that local law enforcement has lost control. In June, for instance, Trump federalized the California National Guard over the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom and deployed 4,000 National Guard troops, along with 700 active-duty marines, to Los Angeles in response to protests caused by the administration's massive immigration roundups. This was the first time since 1965 that a president had federalized the National Guard over the objections of a governor.

Newsom filed a lawsuit, and U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, in San Francisco, ruled in September that the deployment was a violation of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids the use of the military for domestic law enforcement in most situations. “There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence,” the judge wrote. “Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law.” Trump's efforts to deploy the guard to Portland and Chicago have also run into legal difficulty. When Trump tried to nationalize Oregon's guard, U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut—whom Trump himself appointed—slapped the effort down as an illegal federal power grab. When Trump then tried to send in the California guard as a workaround, Immergut issued another injunction. In the case of Chicago, U.S. District Judge April Perry issued an injunction to prevent the deployment of the National Guard—an action upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Both Immergut and Perry suggested that the administration was being less than truthful about the reasons for the deployments, with Perry citing a “potential lack of candor” among officials.

Trump, however, is undeterred. The administration is appealing all these decisions. And his Defense Department is transparently trying to find excuses to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act, which allows the White House to use the military if there is a rebellion, or if civilian law enforcement cannot enforce the law. The president, it seems, will stop at nothing to get his way with American troops. Randy Manner, a retired army two-star general and former acting vice chief of the National Guard, told The Washington Post that the moves were “absolutely nothing more than a political grab of power” by Trump.

Just as worrisome as these domestic deployments is the use of the military in Trump's undeclared war against drug cartels. On September 3, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that U.S. forces had blown up a speedboat in the Caribbean that was allegedly full of Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members and illicit drugs. Eleven people on board died. The administration claimed to have ordered the lethal strike under the president's Article 2 authority as commander in chief, with Rubio arguing that “the president has a right to eliminate immediate threats to the United States.” But it is not clear how the boat posed an “immediate threat,” even if it was full of drugs. Rubio even said that the boat was actually headed for Trinidad, and it subsequently emerged that the boat had already turned back toward Venezuela by the time it was attacked. The military sank it anyway, with a military aircraft—apparently a drone—launching multiple attacks until no one was left alive.

The administration did not provide much more information about the incident, leading some veterans of counternarcotics operations to speculate that the boat might have been carrying migrants rather than drugs. Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said after his staff received an administration briefing on the attack: “They have offered no positive identification that the boat was Venezuelan, nor that its crew were members of Tren de Aragua or any other cartel.”

Since that initial strike, the Defense Department has announced that it has blown up four more vessels that were allegedly smuggling drugs, killing 16 more people. The administration has not offered much information about any of these incidents and has not publicly released any evidence that the boats were actually full of illicit narcotics or where they were heading.



The Trump administration has designated Tren de Aragua and other drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, but that doesn't give the president permission to kill its members on sight. That would be akin to telling military personnel to shoot suspected drug dealers without benefit of trial—a crime for which former Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte is now on trial before the International Criminal Court. Trump has expressed his admiration for Duterte and advocated the death penalty for drug dealers, but Congress has not passed any authorization for the use of military force that would allow such an attack.

If this was not a lawful use of force, as many experts have concluded, then it was an extrajudicial killing—a potential war crime. Yet some senior officials are celebrating it regardless. Vice President JD Vance, posting on X, called the attack on the alleged drug smuggling boat “the highest and best use of our military.” When an online critic argued that “killing the citizens of another nation who are civilians without any due process is called a war crime,” Vance replied, “I don't give a shit what you call it.”

Vance may not care, but the service members involved and their civilian superiors should. The Supreme Court has granted presidents immunity from prosecution for official acts, but that immunity does not extend to anyone else involved in the operation—or in subsequent such attacks that the president is threatening to carry out.

It is disturbing to see the U.S. military employed in such a potentially unlawful fashion. But it is also disturbing to note that, so far, there has been no public protest from anyone in uniform.

On the one hand, this is to be expected: the U.S. military is supposed to be apolitical and does not make a habit of criticizing commanders in chief. Attempts by senior officers to fight back against improper and illegal commands may lead to an even bigger civil-military crisis and potentially draw the armed forces deeper into the political mire—the last place they want to be. The good news is that the U.S. armed forces have a long, deeply inculcated tradition of protecting and defending the Constitution, and that the military is a vast institution, most of it based mercifully far from Washington. It will be impossible for Trump and Hegseth to undo in one presidential term the principles that have been inculcated in the armed forces for centuries.

But by trying to politicize the military, the Trump administration is breaking trust with the men and women in uniform and driving talented leaders out of the force. The dearth of military pushback, then, begs the question of how effectively Trump and Hegseth have cleaned house, rooting out those who might disagree with them. It is unclear if there are senior officers still objecting behind closed doors, or if everyone is keeping silent in order to save their jobs. This uncertainty will have profound effects on the public's confidence in the nation's armed forces. Going forward, even perfectly appropriate and legal military actions may be viewed through the prism of the administration's attempts to turn the armed forces into a MAGA militia.



That is not fair to the troops, and it tampers with the fundamental principles that have made the American military such a successful fighting force for so long. Moreover, Trump's actions threaten to set off a chain reaction that will damage the armed forces long after he leaves office. If today's military leaders are perceived as “MAGA” generals, then a future Democratic administration will be tempted to appoint its own stalwarts, who in turn will be dismissed by the next Republican president. Generals and admirals may become known as political partisans, and the U.S. military could be subjected to high leadership turnover.

The most generous explanation of the silence of the general officers is that they are hoping to keep their heads down for now, hedging that they will be in a position to serve as a check on presidential overreach if and when the situation gets truly dire. And some officers may, indeed, find themselves in that position. Trump is an aspiring authoritarian who has already done much to undermine the rule of law and democracy. He is likely to up the pressure in the months and years ahead. In 2020, he asked the military to shoot peaceful protesters, according to then Defense Secretary Mark Esper. Esper and Milley refused, and the idea was abandoned. Later, after Trump lost the November election, the disgraced former general Michael Flynn reportedly advocated using troops to seize ballot boxes and overturn the election results. Even if Trump had tried to implement this idea (and there is no evidence that he did), it's extremely unlikely that Esper or Milley would have gone along.

But it is unclear if Caine and other top military officials will say no if Trump makes similar requests. Will senior leaders handpicked by Trump resist, or will they salute and obey? On that question could hang the fate of the republic.

In figuring out whether they should follow commands that undermine U.S. democracy, senior officers should consider an open letter published in 2022 by a group of eight former secretaries of defense and five former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including Mattis and Esper. Although Trump's name was never mentioned, his first term clearly informed every sentence.

The first paragraph noted: “Military professionals confront an extremely adverse environment characterized by the divisiveness of affective polarization that culminated in the first election in over a century when the peaceful transfer of political power was disrupted and in doubt.” The letter went on to lay out the “the core principles and best practices” that should govern “healthy American civil-military relations.” The first of these, naturally, was “civilian control of the military,” but the former officials emphasized that this control must be exercised “within a constitutional framework under the rule of law” and that both the legislative and judicial branches had an important role to play. Although the letter noted that “military officials are required to carry out legal orders the wisdom of which they doubt,” it also said that “civilian officials should provide the military ample opportunity to express their doubts in appropriate venues.”

In other words, if military leaders are being ordered to do things they should not be doing, they need to let the people and their elected representatives know. “Appropriate venues” can include not only internal executive branch deliberations but also congressional testimony or even media interviews. Although this option was not mentioned in the open letter, in the worst case, senior officers could threaten to resign in protest.

There is, admittedly, no tradition in U.S. history of military leaders resigning in protest, but there is also little precedent for the kinds of orders that Trump and Hegseth are now issuing. Ideally, Congress and the courts, the press, and the public will ultimately mobilize to protect the professionalism of the armed forces, but so far, the Republican-controlled Congress has been MIA in overseeing administration misconduct. In the short run, therefore, the troops will have to fend for themselves as best as they can. They should recall what Mattis used to tell his marines: “Carry out your mission and keep your honor clean.”

 How the Country Can Bring Peace to the Middle East

 Amos Yadlin and Avner Golov

In his recent speeches in Egypt and Israel, U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly invoked the word “peace” when describing his vision for a new Middle East. He is right to do so. After decades of perpetual conflict, the region may be on the precipice of a genuinely stable future. As we argued in Foreign Affairs last December, Israel's battlefield achievements against Hamas and Hezbollah—together with the collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria—had created a rare opening for the Jewish state, the United States, and key Arab countries to forge a coalition capable of stabilizing the region and countering extremism. And developments since then have only made that vision more urgent and attainable.

Earlier this month, after two years of fighting, Hamas and Israel finally agreed to a U.S.-brokered cease-fire that could both end the war in Gaza and dismantle the terror organization. Israel and the United States have decimated Iran's network of proxies and struck the country's own nuclear and missile infrastructure, breaking the Islamic Republic's grip on much of the Middle East. As a result, these two regional spoilers are on the back foot. A better future, in other words, is very much within reach. Even Israeli politicians—foremost among them Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu—are speaking of peace again, after years in which that word had virtually disappeared from their lexicons.

That does not mean the path forward is obstacle-free. Israel is diplomatically isolated and extremely unpopular on Arab streets, in European squares, and on American campuses. Hamas is still the strongest political and military force in Gaza and has maintained support in the West Bank. Iran remains dangerous, even if it is weaker. And a radical Muslim Brotherhood, backed by Qatar and Turkey, is expanding its influence. Unlike in the past, these hurdles are all surmountable. But overcoming them will require a new regional coalition. This coalition will have to offer a moderate alternative to both the Iranian axis and Sunni jihadists. It will need to eventually expand into a broader Mediterranean partnership. And it must receive dedicated American backing.

Trump may have been disappointed not to receive the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. But in the eyes of most Israelis, he has earned it. The U.S. president imposed a cease-fire framework on Netanyahu, who had resisted popular demand for a deal that would have returned all hostages and ended the war. Trump did so while simultaneously getting Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey to exert heavy pressure on Hamas, which had also been reticent to sign such an agreement. It was a display of diplomatic finesse reminiscent of the shuttle diplomacy U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger deployed to end the Yom Kippur War in the 1970s.

The agreement Trump brokered is opaque. Many of its provisions remain undefined, and it appears that Washington offered bilateral assurances—perhaps even contradictory ones—to both parties. But this ambiguity is deliberate, designed to allow each side to declare victory. Israel's claim to victory centers on the return of all hostages, the military's dismantlement of Hamas as an organized force, and the creation of an international plan to eradicate its rule and disarm its militias. Israelis also get to maintain a security zone in Gaza until Hamas's disarmament is complete. Hamas, for its part, gets to declare that it withstood Israel's army for two years, forced its withdrawal from Gaza, secured the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners, put the Palestinian issue back on the global agenda, and extracted assurances that Israel will not resume the conflict.

The war in Gaza could reignite. Trump's 20-point peace plan unfolds in three stages, and only the first is underway and well defined with numerical parameters: the release of all Israeli hostages in exchange for the liberation of convicted Palestinian militants, coupled with the redeployment of Israeli forces outside central Gaza. Hamas will likely exploit areas of ambiguity even in this stage to slow the transition to the next phase, as recent delays in the return of hostages' bodies have demonstrated.

The second phase—disarming Hamas and establishing a new governing authority in Gaza with the participation of Arab and other international forces—will be far more difficult to implement. And should the parties fail to carry it out, Gaza could come to resemble Lebanon: formally ruled by a recognized government but effectively controlled by a militant organization. (Hezbollah has long dominated the Lebanese state.) In that case, Israel may once again find itself compelled to fight in Gaza wherever Hamas continues to operate.



Then there is the third phase. This stage calls for the creation of a pathway to Palestinian statehood and self-determination, conditioned on the full demilitarization of Gaza and sweeping reforms within the Palestinian Authority. It will be Israel's most significant contribution to the Trump plan, taking place after Hamas's dismantlement in the second phase. It will take far longer to see through, if it is even achievable.

Still, there is reason to be hopeful that this war, at least, is finished. Through a combination of pressure and inducements, Trump and his talented team have succeeded in forging an Arab-Palestinian front that supports the demilitarization of Hamas—an unprecedented achievement in a region where no actor has ever voluntarily surrendered its military capabilities.

The region's broader conflicts might also simmer down, thanks to the weakening of the Iranian regime. Israel's military campaign against Tehran severely damaged core components of its strategic apparatus, including its nuclear facilities, its missile systems, its air defenses, and, critically, its network of regional proxies. Israeli fighting in Lebanon, for instance, diminished the power of Hezbollah, which now faces mounting pressure from the United States and from Lebanon's government. The Yemeni Houthis continue to pose a threat to the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, but they are limited in their ability to hit Israel because of the country's excellent air and missile defense. The survival and broad recognition of Ahmed al-Shara's government in Syria further underscores Tehran's diminishing influence, especially given that Shara clearly wants to prevent Iranian meddling in the country. Meanwhile, the Iranian regime is struggling to keep its own country's economy running in the face of widespread sanctions. France, Germany, and the United Kingdom even recently reimposed the UN Security Council's sanctions, using the snapback provisions in the 2015 nuclear deal.

Still, the Iranian regime should never be underestimated, and it remains the Middle East's most patient and determined threat. Its leadership seeks revenge against Israel, and it will almost certainly study the war's lessons alongside its partners in Beijing, Moscow, and Pyongyang. Its nuclear infrastructure is bruised, but it has effectively dismantled the International Atomic Energy Agency's oversight of its nuclear program and still has several nuclear weapons' worth of enriched uranium on hand. It frequently threatens to alter its nuclear strategy and has hinted at leaving the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty or even obtaining a bomb. Iran is driven by a desire for vengeance against Israel and will use whatever weapons and cash it can scrounge up to proliferate and foster terrorism. It remains committed to perpetual conflict—which is why it is virtually the only government that did not welcome the end of the war in Gaza.

As it navigates a new future, Israel has a major advantage: its rock-solid relationship with Washington. For all the hand-wringing about the U.S.-Israeli alliance over the past two years, the two states coordinated more closely than ever after October 7, 2023. The results were excellent. The two countries' attacks on Iran's nuclear program, for instance, improved the United States' leverage in future negotiations without prompting escalation or regional warfare: all the predictions that U.S. attacks would provoke a regional war, close the Strait of Hormuz, prompt oil prices to skyrocket, and yield a wave of terror never materialized. Meanwhile, in Gaza, American diplomatic, financial, and military support allowed Israel to degrade Hamas and thus strike a deal to bring the hostages home. That doesn't mean the two sides were perfectly aligned; in private, U.S. officials pushed their Israeli counterparts to move toward peace, resulting in this month's agreement. Yet Washington showed that genuine influence over Israeli policy derives not from public reprimands or arms embargoes but from unwavering public support and closed-door pressure.

As a result, for the first time in the twenty-first century, the United States has reasserted its leadership role in the Middle East. It has achieved military success without the loss of a single American life and facilitated a peace that has been broadly welcomed across the region. Washington has demonstrated that sustained and strategic involvement in the Middle East can, in fact, reinforce the United States' position as a leading power—in contrast with its rivals. The region is not a quagmire of endless conflicts and financial burdens from which it must disengage.

But for Israel, relations with the United States are now the diplomatic exception. Almost everywhere else in the world, the country is facing a tsunami of condemnation. The harrowing images from Gaza have overshadowed the massacre of October 7. Distorted narratives—including claims that Israel deliberately starved civilians—were fueled by anti-Semitic networks and Hamas's global propaganda machine and compounded by Israel's own diplomatic shortcomings. This prompted recrimination from both the country's longtime critics and even some of its partners, including Germany and Italy. The consequences of all this anger are real. Arab governments, for example, have put a stop to their efforts at normalizing relations with Israel because they are fearful of antagonizing their constituents. Regional officials are also worried that Israel is aiming not just for security but for regional hegemony through military dominance and territorial expansion. But Netanyahu himself has said that Israel has no designs on Gaza, Lebanon, or Syria. The voices in his coalition who have called for annexing the West Bank face resistance from both the Israeli public and the Trump administration. Yet unfair as this reputation may be, Israel is nonetheless seen as a state whose conduct is fundamentally at odds with liberal values and as an unreliable regional interlocutor.

Israel is also staring down new regional competitors. Iran may be weakened, but Muslim Brotherhood–aligned governments in Qatar and Turkey have gained influence. Both states have leveraged their personal rapport with Trump to expand their regional influence, and both now coordinate closely with Washington on Syria, increasing their foothold there. Qatar has also extended its reach into Lebanon. After Israel's failed strike on Hamas leaders in Doha, Trump even compelled Netanyahu to apologize to Qatar. The White House then offered the country defense assurances that were reminiscent of NATO commitments.

Neither of these countries threatens Israel in the same way that Iran does—or to nearly the same extent. In fact, both played central roles in securing a cease-fire in Gaza, and they currently play a central role in keeping Iran weak. But they are not friendly to the Jewish state, either. Qatar, for example, continues to act as a patron of Hamas, and it amplifies anti-Israeli messaging via its Al Jazeera media network. Israel will thus need to carefully manage its relations with the two countries and push for a shift in their hostile policies, ideally in cooperation with Washington. Otherwise, they could fill the vacuum left by Tehran by propping up Sunni radicals from East Africa to the Middle East.

For Israel, diplomatic isolation, Iran, and Sunni extremism will cause continued headaches. Yet overall, the Middle East is becoming more favorable for Israeli interests. There is now a genuine opportunity to end hostilities between Israel and both Lebanon and Syria—and even to slowly normalize relations with both countries. There is also a chance to outright expand the Abraham Accords into the broader Muslim world. Indonesia—the world's largest Muslim-majority nation—represents a particularly significant opportunity. So does Somaliland, in the Horn of Africa, which seeks international recognition and occupies a strategically vital position in the struggle against the Houthis. If Azerbaijan, a long-standing Israeli partner, formally joins this regional force, it would strengthen its own relationship with the United States and reinforce stability across Central Asia. And a political change in Israel could further promote normalization discussions with Saudi Arabia and other Arab states.

Changes in geopolitics will also facilitate such talks. Today, countries across the world, including in the Middle East, are seeking more autonomy in their relationships, diversifying partnerships, and redefining their dependencies. They are more focused on acquiring advanced technology—which has become the currency of power—and maintaining stability. That means the Middle East's future will be shaped by actors who possess the military power to defend themselves and their allies without constant American intervention; the economic capability to rebuild and stabilize destroyed areas, and the technological excellence needed to link the region's economies to Asia and Europe—all while drawing on U.S. leadership when needed. And Israel, with its powerful military, strong tech industry, and ties to Washington, is the best partner most Arab states can find for running this gauntlet.

These countries can deepen their integration even without normalization. They could build a technological ecosystem that links the United States to the Gulf's infrastructure, its energy resources, and Israel's knowledge and innovation, for example, without doing so—and it would be far less politically sensitive. But either way, Arab governments will have to overcome their fears of angering their populations and plow ahead with regional integration.



Israel can simultaneously forge an even stronger relationship with Washington. The two countries should set up a new technological partnership, codified in a bilateral memorandum of understanding, predicated on equitable Israeli-American capital contributions across important tech sectors—including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, energy, and semiconductors. As part of this initiative, the United States should also extend defense assistance to Israel for the ensuing decade.

Most of all, the United States should help facilitate Israel's integration with its Arab neighbors. That means, most obviously, pushing for normalization. But it also means that Washington should ensure Israel's innovative tech ecosystem is connected to the Gulf's and invigorating the India­–Middle East–Europe Economic Corridor (better known as IMEC). To do so, Washington could name a czar specifically tasked with making this bloc of states more cohesive. The envoy would, in turn, help catalyze a technological ecosystem that bridges the Gulf's infrastructure with India's advanced services sector, both of which fit into the Trump administration's plans to turn the Middle East into the world's second most important tech hub, after the United States.

On the military front, the United States should set up a permanent security architecture that combines both Israeli and Gulf resources. It should establish a regional air defense apparatus controlled by the U.S. military's Central Command (popularly known as CENTCOM). But Washington should also establish a broader permanent joint command structure that oversees the region's maritime, cyber, and counterterrorism operations. This structure can feature Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and even Qatar—if it recalibrates its policies.

To further their cooperation, Israel, the United States, and the Arab states should expand their regional coalition into a broader Mediterranean partnership—a kind of pax Mediterranea—that promotes stability, prosperity, and technological progress across all its members. Israel and the United States should do so by convening a leadership summit featuring Arab partners as well as Cyprus, Greece, and Italy (with planned expansions to Azerbaijan, Germany, and India). There, these countries would collectively invest in joint defense procurement and military logistics; technology and energy, with a priority on innovations that can mitigate the effects of climate change and reduce food and water insecurity; and a joint financial institution. They would also figure out ways to support regional reconstruction and plan for how to respond to the many natural disasters that can afflict their shared region. The United States can invite Qatar and Turkey to participate in the coalition if they end their anti-Israeli policies, cease financing Hamas and other terrorist groups, and generally stop spewing propaganda.

A U.S.-backed Arab-Israeli coalition has long been the most viable path toward a stable Middle East. And today, it is more achievable than ever. The challenges—regional mistrust, a resurgent Muslim Brotherhood, and an Iran and a Hamas that are itching to act as spoilers—are real. But if the United States channels its renewed assertiveness and if local actors can align their power with purpose, the Middle East may finally move from perpetual crisis management into a sustainable order.

To achieve this vision, Washington and its regional partners do not need to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But they can certainly try to shift its trajectory in a more hopeful direction. To do so, these actors will need to embrace Trump's framework for a peace committee, which conditions any Israeli concessions on genuine Palestinian reform. The Palestinian Authority (or any other Palestinian government) will need to dismantle terror networks and end Palestinian incitement in schools, religious institutions, and the international arena. Israel will need to receive the remaining hostages' bodies and retain its security primacy in Gaza in order to prevent Hamas's resurgence and ensure that whatever administration follows is effective, made up of both Palestinians and international technocrats.

But regional integration cannot hinge on the Palestinian issue. A veto from Ramallah would almost assuredly doom the rest of this project—and, with it, the region's chance at long-term stability. It is instead time to prioritize peace through strength in its truest sense: not as a slogan, but as a strategy anchored in shared interests, credible deterrence, and the conviction that stability is best secured by those prepared to defend it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Takeaways from the Supreme Court arguments on the Voting Rights Act and race-based redistricting","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/15/politics/voting-rights-act-supreme-court-takeaways","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 20:33:25 GMT","


            The Supreme Court's conservative supermajority signaled deep skepticism Wednesday over the creation of a second majority Black district in Louisiana and appeared open to at least weakening the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 in a way that could limit minority representation in Congress.
    


            On one level, the case is about a single congressional district in Louisiana – drawn after the 2020 census to ensure African American voters could elect a candidate of their choice. More fundamentally, the case is about whether governments may actively address discrimination – current or historic – by taking an action that is intended to help racial minorities.
    


            It is also about whether the Supreme Court's conservative justices view the Voting Rights Act, a crowning achievement of the civil rights era, as good law.
    


            The court's decision will almost certainly have sweeping implications beyond the Pelican State. It could potentially reduce minority representation not only in Congress but also in state legislatures and school boards across the country. Depending on the scope of the court's ruling and its timing, it could also upend the 2026 midterms.
    


            Here's what to know from oral arguments:
    


            At issue is a protracted court case that started when Louisiana drew only one congressional district out of six with an opportunity to election a Black member of Congress, despite the fact that African Americans make up about a third of the state's population.
    


            A group of Black plaintiffs sued over that district, and a lower court found the maps likely violated the Voting Rights Act. When the state responded by drawing a second majority Black district, a group of White plaintiffs argued state lawmakers had impermissibly considered race in violation of the 14th and 15th Amendments.
    


            Almost immediately, Justice Brett Kavanaugh – a member of the court's conservative wing – affirmed predictions that he would be the most important person to watch in the case. And over the course of more than two hours, Kavanaugh remained a driving force in the discussion.
    


            Just two years ago, Kavanaugh was the deciding vote to uphold the current approach to the Voting Rights Act in a similar case involving Alabama's congressional districts. At the time, however, he raised concerns about race-based remedies – that is, using race as a factor to address discrimination – that were in place indefinitely. He repeated those concerns on Wednesday. 



JD Vance epitomizes the GOP's move from morals to whataboutism



            “The issue, as you know, is that this court's cases in a variety of contexts have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period time – sometimes for a long period of time, decades in some cases – but that they should not be indefinite and should have an end point,” Kavanaugh told the attorney representing a group of Black voters who successfully challenged Louisiana's first map.
    


Chief Justice John Roberts, another important vote, also quickly tried to draw a distinction between the Louisiana case and the court's surprising decision two years ago to order Alabama to redraw its map.
    


            Roberts, who previously called Louisiana's district a “snake,” seemed to subtly question the idea that the Alabama decision should control the outcome in Louisiana.
    


            That case, Roberts said, took the “existing precedent as a given” and considered “Alabama's particular challenge.”
    


            The exchange prompted Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson to jump in and say that also at issue in the Alabama case was whether to change the way courts look at the Voting Rights Act in redistricting.
    


            “And,” Jackson said, “we chose not to.”
    


            The parties pushing back on Louisiana's second Black congressional district brought slightly different legal arguments into the Supreme Court's ornate chamber on Wednesday. Louisiana, which initially defended the new map and now rejects it, wants a broad ruling that the Constitution bars states from ever considering race when fixing a violation of the Voting Rights Act.
    


            Such a ruling would gut the landmark 1965 law.
    


            But there appeared to be interest, including from Kavanaugh and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in taking a more nuanced approach.
    


            A proposal raised by the Trump administration would require plaintiffs alleging a Voting Rights Act violation to demonstrate that voters in a state cast a ballot differently based specifically on race – decoupled from their political affiliation. Under that approach, if Black voters in a district heavily favor Democrats and White voters heavily favor Republicans, a decision not to create a Black-majority district would be based on partisan rather than motivations.
    


            It is a point that Kavanaugh repeatedly pressed attorneys to address.
    


            “I would have thought that solves a lot of the concerns that you've identified,” Kavanaugh told Benjamin Anguiñaga, Louisiana's solicitor general.
    


            Anguiñaga described that idea as a “half solution.”
    


            But while perhaps less aggressive than gutting the law entirely, DOJ's proposal would likely make it much harder to prove violations of the law, critics say.
    


            “The bottom line,” liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said, is that approach would “just get rid of” the key provision of the Voting Rights Act.
    


            “The standard that you're setting,” she said, “is a much different one.”
    


            Throughout the hearing, the court's three liberals appeared distressed about by the prospect of their colleagues chipping away at the landmark civil rights law.
    


            They focused much of their fire on Congress' intent in enacting the Voting Rights Act: to root out discrimination that targeted African American voters. They questioned the Trump administration's approach, suggesting it would require plaintiffs to meet a much higher standard than is required by the law currently to find discriminatory maps.
    


            The liberals repeatedly tussled with attorneys representing Louisiana and the White voters challenging the state's decision to create a second majority-Black congressional district, with Sotomayor at one point pressing Anguiñaga on why the state's position had changed from what it was when the case was first heard by the justices earlier this year.
    


Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the opinion legalizing same-sex marriage. Here's why he says it won't be overturned



            At the time, Aguiñaga said politics – not race – had played the predominant role in drawing the map. The districts were designed, he said, to protect House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise.
    


            “Are you walking that back?” Sotomayor asked pointedly. “We always talk about what predominates and what predominated here was politics – that's what you said the last time.”
    


            On the other hand, Louisiana had always represented that it redrew its map because of a court order finding that it likely violated the Voting Rights Act.
    


            At another point, Justice Elena Kagan zeroed in on what the “results on the ground” would be if the Supreme Court struck down Section 2 of the law.
    


            The consequences, the lawyer representing Black voters in Louisiana told Kagan, “would be pretty catastrophic.”
    


            Janai Nelson, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, explained that the VRA had paved the way for the election of every Black representative the state has sent to Washington.
    


            “We only have the diversity that we see across the South, for example, because of litigation that forced the creation of opportunity districts under the Voting Rights Act,” she said.
    


            The Voting Rights Act fight involves what has become a familiar – and increasingly fought – debate over race in recent years: whether the Constitution is colorblind, or whether policies may try to make up for past racism.
    


            That complicated question is at the heart of much of Trump's rejection of diversity and inclusion programs, for instance, as well as efforts to reform police departments and the judicial system generally.
    


            It's also squarely at issue in the question over minority representation in Congress.
    


            And in recent years, the 6-3 conservative Supreme Court has come down hard on the side of colorblindness.
    


            Louisiana in its arguments drew a line directly to the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in 2023 gutting affirmative action admissions policies in the nation's colleges.
    


            “There is no safe harbor for racial discrimination the government deems good discrimination,” Louisiana told the Supreme Court in written arguments. “These violations of basic equal protection principles ended race-based admissions programs. They should also end race-based redistricting.”
    


            Voting rights groups counter that courts and Congress have explicitly carved out an exception for race-conscious remedies for “ongoing unlawful” discriminatory policies. And that, those groups said, is precisely what happened with Louisiana's first congressional map.
    


            “The ongoing pattern of racial discrimination in voting in the state makes Louisiana the prototypical case for the ongoing need” for Voting Rights Act enforcement, the NAACP and other groups told the Supreme Court, “not for abandoning it.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","JD Vance epitomizes the GOP's move from morals to whataboutism","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/15/politics/jd-vance-young-republicans-texts-analysis","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 20:05:38 GMT","


            Politico reported Tuesday on a series of vile messages shared by prominent members of Young Republican groups that included racist, antisemitic and violent comments and praise of Adolf Hitler.
    


            And in the hours that followed, the GOP response was mostly critical.
    


            Key GOP leaders, including the national Young Republicans organization itself, denounced the Telegram messages and called for those who sent the messages to be removed from their posts in local Young Republican groups. Some officials were reportedly relieved of their duties, and Politico reported at least two apologized. Even Roger Stone, a bare-knuckle political operator if there ever was one, said he denounced such comments “in the strongest possible terms.”
    


            But then along came Vice President JD Vance. He argued for a far different approach.
    


            Pointing to recently disclosed violent messages from Democratic Virginia attorney general candidate Jay Jones, Vance basically argued Republicans should hold their tongues.
    


            “This is far worse than anything said in a college group chat, and the guy who said it could become the AG of Virginia,” Vance wrote on X. “I refuse to join the pearl clutching when powerful people call for political violence.”
    


            It's hard to find a better epitome of the MAGA movement's evolution on hateful rhetoric. The moral high ground is out; whataboutism is very much in.
    


            And perhaps nobody exemplifies that shift like Vance.
    


            The first thing to note is that the vice president  is taking liberties in minimizing these messages. This wasn't a “college group chat”; members of the Young Republicans group range in age from 18 to 40. One of the people involved is a state legislator (like Jones was in Virginia when he sent his  messages), according to Politico. Another serves in the Trump administration. Others are in their 30s and well-established in Republican politics.
    


            Despite this, Vance during a Wednesday appearance on “The Charlie Kirk Show,” repeatedly referred to the participants as “kids.”
    


            “I really don't want us to grow up in a country where a kid telling a stupid joke telling a very offensive stupid joke is cause to ruin their lives,” Vance said.
    


            The messages revealed by Politico included things like saying, “I love Hitler”; talking about raping political foes and putting them in gas chambers; labeling Black basketball players “monkeys” and “watermelon people”; and many slurs for Black and gay people.
    


            The second thing to note is that Vance is indeed pointing to some very real and ugly text messages from Jones, in which he spoke of giving a GOP leader “two bullets to the head.” Jones responded to a colleague who said Jones had hoped the GOP leader's children died by saying, “Only when people feel pain personally do they move on policy,” according to the National Review, which broke the story.
    


            But while Republicans have faulted Democrats for not abandoning Jones and pushing him out of the race, many Virginia Democrats at least denounced his words.
    


            Virginia gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger said she spoke with Jones about her “disgust.” Virginia's two Democratic senators called the comments “indefensible,” “appalling” and “unacceptable.” Democratic state lawmakers called them “deeply disturbing.” Lieutenant governor nominee Ghazala Hashmi cited “the pain that his words have caused,” and said, “We must demand better of our leaders and of each other.”
    


            Vance is basically arguing Republicans shouldn't even offer such denunciations of the Young Republicans chat.
    


            It's a remarkable entry in the GOP's long-running shift toward a no-apologies approach to politics. The attitude seems to be  that as long as the other side is perceived as worse, the GOP shouldn't bother with policing its own.
    


            That's a far cry from the brand of politics Vance himself once advocated.
    


            After a 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, resulted in a self-described neo-Nazi murdering a counter-protester, President Donald Trump drew widespread condemnation for declining to more forcefully repudiate the white supremacists. He equivocated and claimed there were “very fine people on both sides,” despite the rally being focused on the white supremacist cause.
    


            Vance at the time said that wasn't good enough. He urged Trump to call out racism in no uncertain terms and to establish moral leadership.
    


            “We have a president of the United States who isn't just a political leader; they're also a moral leader in some ways,” he said on CBS News. “And people want to know who is the enemy, what are they about, and what are we really fighting for.”
    


            In fact, Vance expressly rejected the kind of approach he now advocates.
    


            He was asked on CNN at the time about Trump allies who pointed to supposed extremism on the left, and he said that was “no defense.”
    


            “Unfortunately, in this country, we're suffering from a real problem of whataboutism,” Vance said, “which is, whenever something bad happens, people automatically try to point the finger at somebody else, so that the finger doesn't get pointed at themselves.”
    


            He added: “I think we need to be able to talk about that – to point the finger at that evil and name it without trying to point the finger at somebody else.”
    


            Vance is now putting forward a very different proposition.
    


            He's giving the MAGA movement license to avert its eyes from some very ugly tendencies in its underbelly – tendencies for which there was plenty of evidence even before Politico's report on Tuesday.
    


            The content of the Young Republicans' messages recalls the ugly online activities of a number of prominent young GOP activists and even some Trump administration officials and nominees in recent years, as CNN's KFILE has reported. Conservative New York Times columnist David French in 2023 argued the extremism in the ranks of young conservatives was a sleeping giant of an issue. He labeled them the “lost boys of the American right” and said they “corrupt our culture” and “poison our politics.”
    


            Whether you think the Young Republicans texts or Jones' are worse, Vance is suggesting that Republicans are unilaterally disarming if they denounce these comments by people on their side.
    


            To the extent the party adopts this sensibility, our politics are bound to get quite a bit uglier.

            US District Judge Karin Immergut has ruled to extend her temporary restraining orders barring the deployment of the National Guard troops to Portland, keeping President Donald Trump's federalization efforts in limbo as legal challenges unfold.
    


            The ruling by the Trump-appointed judge blocks the federal troops from deploying to Portland for another 14 days. The orders were originally set to expire this weekend.
    


            By extending the temporary orders, Immergut allowed the court and appeals judges time to fully consider the case as the Trump administration remains blocked from deploying federalized troops. The case is expected to go to trial on October 29.
    


            The extension comes as the federal government challenges the judge's earlier ruling on deployment in a higher court as it works to crack down on Democratic-led cities it claims are stricken by crime and disorder.
    


            “Regardless of what happens next, Oregon (Department of Justice) will continue to fight to uphold Oregon's laws and the Constitution,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a social media post Wednesday.
    


            The president has cited  protests outside Portland's Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility to justify the callups of troops in the deep blue city.
    


            Leaders in Oregon have emphatically disputed the president's characterizations of their cities as “war-ravaged” and uncontrollably violent, arguing in court that the situation on the ground in Portland is nowhere as extreme as federal officials portray it to be.
    


            Protests in Oregon's biggest city over White House immigration policies started in June, with a declared riot and arson arrests in mid-summer. The scene was largely calm until Trump had declared late September he was sending 200 Oregon National Guard troops to the city.
    


            Oregon and Portland officials jointly sued following the announcement, and Immergut granted a temporary order barring the federalization of those Oregon troops.
    


            The federal judge then expanded that ruling a day later to include barring the deployment of any US troops when the Trump administration reassigned federalized guard troops in Los Angeles to Portland in an apparent effort to get around the initial order.
    


            A three-judge panel with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is still weighing whether the Trump administration should be blocked from deploying the Oregon National Guard to respond to ICE protests in Portland. They have yet to release a decision. The panel last week granted an administrative stay that allowed for the federalization of the Oregon National Guard.
    


            If the Ninth Circuit rules against the temporary order on deployment, Immergut said during the hearing Wednesday that she will file an order to end her extension.
    


Trump has had his sights on Portland, Oregon, for years. This is how we got here



            As Trump continues efforts to federalize National Guard members across the US for deployment to Democratic-led cities, the administration faces mounting legal pushback from states saying they don't need — or want — any federal help.
    


            After the state of Illinois and its largest city sued the administration last week, calling plans to move troops from the Illinois and Texas National Guards into Chicago “illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional,” a federal appeals court ruled that the troops in Illinois can remain under federal control but can't be deployed as the appeals process continues in the ongoing showdown between the Trump administration and the state.

            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed US military leaders to verify that every member of the department watched the speech he delivered at an unusual gathering of senior officers in Quantico, Virginia, last month and reviews the policy changes he announced in the wake of that event, according to a memo reviewed by CNN.
    


            “Leaders at every level will ensure all personnel will either watch the full recording or read the official transcript of the speech, and review the policy changes no later than 31 October 2025,” the October 6 memo from Hegseth states.
    


            Hegseth's memo comes after he ordered senior officers to travel to Quantico for what amounted to a largely political speech that asserted his vision for how the military will physically look and act.
    


            He also offered a stark ultimatum during his speech: If you don't agree, resign.
    


            While Hegseth delivered his speech, in person, to hundreds of senior officers, the subsequent memo makes clear he wants to make sure the message reaches defense personnel at every level.
    


            Leaders “must inculcate our cultural shift and ensure every member of the Department of War understands my guidance,” Hegseth wrote in the memo, using the Trump administration's preferred name for the Defense Department.
    


            Asked about the new memo, a Pentagon spokesperson said that “The Secretary's speech was for the whole force and this memo just reinforces that guidance.”
    


            The directives that accompanied the speech largely roll back efforts made over the last decade focused on eradicating toxic culture in the military, both to decrease harmful behaviors like harassment, but also to meet practical needs of getting people in uniform and keeping them there longer.
    


            There was also a significant emphasis in Hegseth's speech on the fitness and appearance of service members. Hegseth told the room of senior officers he did not want to see any “fat” generals walking the halls of the Pentagon.
    


            Following Hegseth's speech in Quantico, the Texas Military Department removed seven National Guard troops that had been deployed to Chicago because they “did not meet mission requirements,” a Texas National Guard spokesperson told CNN.
    


            “These service members were returned to home station. The Texas National Guard echoes Secretary Hegseth's message to the force: ‘Our standards will be high, uncompromising, and clear,'” the spokesperson said.
    


            The troops, sent to Chicago as part of President Donald Trump's domestic-facing mission focused on crime, were replaced amid criticism on social media over pictures that showed some of the Guard members appearing to be overweight.

            The first known hand fossils from an extinct human relative have been unearthed in Kenya, revealing a species with unexpected dexterity and a gorilla-like grip. The hand bones, which were discovered alongside skull and teeth fossils, are leading researchers to believe these early humans may have been able to use stone tools.
    


            Paranthropus boisei was previously identified only by its distinctive skull and large teeth, with molars up to four times bigger than those of living humans, so researchers didn't know what the rest of the body looked like or how the hominin interacted with its environment. They did, however, theorize about the huge chewing muscles its jaw would have contained and its eating habits, which earned it the moniker Nutcracker Man.
    


            The remarkably well-preserved hand bones comprise a long thumb, straight fingers and a mobile pinkie finger that would have allowed the species to form a powerful grip, similar to how modern humans might grasp a hammer. Other features, such as the broad shape of the finger bones, closely resemble those of a gorilla, however.
    


            The partial skeleton, unearthed at Koobi Fora, a site on the eastern edge of Lake Turkana, is estimated to be slightly more than 1.52 million years old. The teeth and skull fossils matched previously studied P. boisei specimens, while the hand and foot bones proved to be unique among previously studied hominins, a term referring to all species that emerged after the genetic split from the ancestors of the great apes 6 million to 7 million years ago.
    


            “This is the first time we can confidently link Paranthropus boisei to specific hand and foot bones,” said Carrie Mongle, a paleoanthropologist and an assistant professor at Stony Brook University in New York. Mongle is the lead author of a study on the fossils that published in the journal Nature on Wednesday.

            The hand was “quite unexpected,” according to Tracy Kivell, director of the department of human origins at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.
    


            “It is clearly the hand of (a) human ancestor, but also has features that are remarkably similar to gorillas, which is surprising,” Kivell said via email.
    


            “No other hominin that we know of has hand morphology that is so gorilla-like, which greatly broadens our perspective on what is ‘possible' within (the) human evolutionary story of hand use,” she added. Kivell coauthored a commentary published alongside the study but was not involved in the research.
    


            P. boisei lived in eastern Africa from 1.3 million to 2.6 million years ago, coexisting with at least three other hominin species: Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus.
    


            Some researchers hypothesized that only species within the genus Homo had the ability to make stone tools, although recent discoveries have undermined that assumption. Stone artifacts unearthed in Kenya dating 2.9 million years ago suggest that tool use was more widespread in the hominin family tree than once thought.
    


            Hominins include species within the genus Homo, such as our own Homo sapiens; more recently extinct species such as Neanderthals, which disappeared 40,000 years ago; early Homo species like Homo erectus; and more distantly related species such as Australopithecus afarensis, represented by the famous Lucy skeleton in Ethiopia, which is 3.2 million years old.
    


Fossils unearthed in Grand Canyon reveal new details of evolutionary explosion of life



            Mongle said the proportions of P. boisei's hands would have allowed it to manipulate stone tools just as well as the other Homo species living in Africa at the time. “This paper is careful in not claiming that Paranthropus made and used tools, but instead they say that there is essentially nothing in the hand anatomy that would prevent that,” Ryan McRae, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC, told CNN in an email.
    


            “Without a smoking gun of stone tools found in a fossilized hand, or stone tools found at a site with only (one) hominin species represented, we may never know for sure who was and was not making these tools, but this paper is a huge step in the ‘Paranthropus the tool maker' hypothesis.”
    


            Later humans such as Neanderthals and Homo sapiens had different wrist anatomy, and P. boisei, along with its contemporaries, likely would not have been able to precisely pinch its fingers together, the study noted.
    


            The hand fossils also suggest that P. boisei shared grasping capabilities with gorillas that would have allowed it to grab and strip tough-to-eat plants, removing the indigestible parts with its hands, the study found.
    


            While its powerful hands indicate it would have been an adept climber, the hominin's feet had arches, which allowed for efficient movement.This means it was unquestioningly adapted to walking upright on two legs, Mongle said.
    


            “Because of the combined morphology of the hand and foot, the authors suggest that this species was likely not arboreal (climbing in trees), but that any convergence with gorillas in the hand is likely due to how they used their hands for processing of tough foods. This makes sense,” McRae, who was not involved in the study, added.
    


            The fossils were found during excavations between 2019 and 2021 by a team led by coauthor Louise Leakey. In the 1950s, her grandparents, the renowned paleoanthropologists Louis Leakey and Mary Leakey, found the first P. boisei skull in what is now Tanzania and gave it the nickname Nutcracker Man. However, wear marks on the species' teeth indicate that rather than cracking hard food like nuts, it chewed and ground tough foods like tubers and roots to survive.
    


            The latest fossils emerged from a layer of sandy silt just above an extraordinary trackway of hominin footprints made public last year.
    


Newly discovered fossils shed light on the origins of curious ‘hobbit' humans



            Pressed into soft mud, the footprints were attributed to P. boisei and Homo erectus, leading researchers to believe the two species crossed paths and were able to live as ﻿neighbors, not competitors, in the same habitat.
    


            Mongle said the two species would have occupied different ecological niches, but based on what's known of the hominin's face, teeth, jaws and now hands, P. boisei likely ate a specialized diet of plant foods such as grasses.

Madagascar's military seized power from the civilian government Tuesday, a high-ranking commander announced after President Andry Rajoelina fled the sprawling Indian Ocean island country for his safety.

ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) — The leader of Madagascar's military coup told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he is “taking the position of president” and that the armed forces would be in charge of the African island nation for up to two years before any elections are held.

Col. Michael Randrianirina, who led the rebellion that ousted President Andry Rajoelina on Tuesday following weeks of youth-led protests, said in his first interview with a global news outlet since taking power that he expects to be sworn in as the country's new leader in the next few days.

“There must be an oath-taking” to make his position official, Randrianirina said at his unit's barracks while flanked by fellow officers. “We are staying here for at least 18 months, at most two years.”

Randrianirina announced Tuesday that the armed forces were taking power in Madagascar, a sprawling country of about 30 million people off of Africa's east coast that is the world's leading vanilla producer and is known for its unique biodiversity. Since gaining independence from France in 1960, it also has a history of coups and political crises.




The latest military takeover capped weeks of protests against Rajoelina and his government led by youth groups calling themselves “Gen Z Madagascar.” The protesters, who also included labor unions and civic groups, have demanded better government and job opportunities, echoing youth-led protests elsewhere in the world. Among other things, the Madagascar protesters have railed against chronic water and electricity outages, limited access to higher education, government corruption and poverty, which affects roughly three out of every four Madagascans, according to the World Bank.

Although some suggest the military seized power on the backs of the civilian protesters, demonstrators cheered Randrianirina and other soldiers from his elite CAPSAT unit as they triumphantly rode through the streets of the capital, Antananarivo, on Tuesday, with one protest leader telling the AP “the military is listening to us.”

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports the Madagascar coup leader tells the AP why he has taken power in the island nation.

The takeover was “an awakening of the people. It was launched by the youth. And the military supported us,” said the protest leader, Safika, who only gave one name as has been typical with the demonstrators. “We must always be wary, but the current state of affairs gives us reason to be confident.”

The protests reached a turning point Saturday when Randrianirina and soldiers from his unit sided with the demonstrators calling for the president to resign. Rajoelina said he fled to an undisclosed country because he feared for his life.

Randrianirina explained that he is taking over as Madagascar's head of state because the country's High Constitutional Court invited him to do so in the absence of Rajoelina. He previously said the military had acted on behalf of the people and cast the coup as a move to “restore” the country. 

“We had to take responsibility yesterday because there is nothing left in the country, no president, no president in the senate, no government,” Randrianirina said. The colonel said the military leadership was “accelerating” the appointment of a new prime minister “so that the crisis in the country does not last forever.” He didn't give an exact time frame for that to happen.

Rajoelina, who first came to power as a transitional leader in a 2009 military coup, was elected president in 2018 and reelected in 2023. He fired his government last month in an attempt to appease the protesters after a crackdown by security forces left 22 people dead and more than 100 injured, according to the United Nations. Rajoelina's government disputed those figures.

The exiled Rajoelina, 51, has rejected the military takeover's legitimacy.

But Randrianirina pushed back on that, telling the AP: “What is he saying is illegal? We have an order from the High Constitutional Court. We did not force the HCC or point a gun at it to issue this.”

Randrianirina's claim that his authority to take over as president came from the country's highest court seemed to contradict his announcement Tuesday that the military council that was taking power had suspended that court's powers. 

In a statement, Rajoelina's office claimed that some of the high court's judges had been threatened so they would sign off on the colonel's ascendency.

The African Union announced Wednesday that it had suspended Madagascar from its bodies with immediate effect “until constitutional order is restored in the country.” The group previously suspended several other member states after military coups, including Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea.

U.N. Secretary General António Guterres, meanwhile, is “deeply concerned by the unconstitutional change of power in Madagascar” and hopes all stakeholders there can “work together to reach a peaceful settlement to the ongoing crisis and its root causes,” his spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said in a statement, noting that the U.N. will continue to work to “restore peace and stability in the country.”

Some analysts have described Madagascar's youth movement as an expression of understandable grievances over government failures, and condemned the military takeover.

“Gen-Zers in Madagascar have been on the streets of the country protesting the lack of essential services, especially water and electricity, and the negative impact on their lives for almost a month,” said Olufemi Taiwo, professor of Africana studies at Cornell University. “This is a civil society uprising and its resolution should not involve the military.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — After months of aggressive immigration enforcement measures from the Trump administration, Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander adults are more likely to hold a negative view of President Donald Trump's handling of immigration, a new AAPI Data/AP-NORC poll finds.

About 7 in 10 AAPI adults nationwide disapprove of Trump's approach on immigration, according to the survey from AAPI Data and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, an increase from 58% in March. The new poll also finds that a solid majority of AAPI adults say the Republican president has overstepped on deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, and most oppose several specific tactics used by the administration, such as using the military and National Guard to carry out arrests or deportations.

The findings come as federal immigration agents expand a crackdown in the Chicago area, where more than 1,000 immigrants have been arrested since last month. The escalation in Chicago is just part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to boost deportations, which has been a high priority for the president since he took office at the beginning of the year. 

This approach does not seem to be landing well among AAPI adults, a diverse and rapidly growing group where many were born outside the U.S. Even among foreign-born AAPI adults, who tend to be more conservative, most disapprove of the president's handling of immigration. 

Joie Meyer, 25, was born in China and adopted as an infant. The Miami resident, who identifies as a Democrat, supports secure borders but Trump's recent actions have made her wonder what would happen if she suddenly lost her citizenship. 

“If I was at risk of like being stripped away from my home, family, friends, everything I knew because of like a technicality, which is what some people are facing, that's just heartbreaking,” Meyer said, adding that she finds Trump's methods “punitive.”

AAPI adults are particularly likely to think Trump has crossed a line on immigration enforcement. About two-thirds say Trump has “gone too far” when it comes to deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, compared to about 6 in 10 Black and Hispanic adults in a separate AP-NORC poll conducted in September. In that survey, less than half of white adults thought Trump had overstepped on immigration. 




The finding, combined with AAPI adults' increased disapproval of Trump on immigration, signals that the president's handling of the issue over the past few months may have turned some people off. Some may be finding “a big difference in terms of what policy support looks like in theory and how it plays out,” said Karthick Ramakrishnan, AAPI Data executive director and researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.

Immigration is frequently in the local news for 38-year-old Peter Lee of Tacoma, Washington, where there is an active Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center. He sees Trump as hastily meeting deportation quotas without compassion.

“One, there doesn't seem to be a clear game plan for what he's doing in terms of immigration enforcement other than just pure numbers. Second it seems like his directives come from just gut, not fact-based,” said Lee, a Democrat, who is Korean American. “The fact that he's deporting people to third-party countries not of their origin, I think that it's ridiculous.”

American-born and foreign-born AAPI adults are equally likely to think Trump has overstepped on immigration overall. But they're more divided on issues related to illegal immigration.

Just over half of foreign-born AAPI adults, who tend to be older and more conservative than other AAPI adults, support deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who have been charged with misdemeanors, compared to 41% of American-born AAPI adults. AAPI adults who were born outside the U.S. are also more likely than American-born AAPI adults to support deporting all immigrants who are in the country illegally.

More than half of AAPI adults are foreign-born, Ramakrishnan said, adding that American-born AAPI adults may be less “attuned in terms of what it takes to maintain one's status.”

Tyrone Tai, 65, who has homes in Tampa and Lauderhill, Florida, was born in Jamaica. The half-Chinese and half-Jamaican immigrated with his parents to New York City when he was 12. He recalls how they struggled but eventually gained U.S. citizenship. He indicated Trump has “not gone far enough” when it comes to arresting those who “jump the line.” 

AAPI adults who were born outside the U.S. are more likely than American-born AAPI adults to approve of Trump's handling of immigration, although they still don't rate him especially highly on the issue. They're also more likely to approve of his handling of crime, suggesting that the president's efforts to link illegal immigration with crime may be resonating with some among this group.

Some of the Trump administration's tactics are particularly unpopular among AAPI adults, the poll found. For example, about 6 in 10 AAPI adults oppose conducting large-scale immigration enforcement operations in neighborhoods with high populations of immigrants, deploying the military or National Guard to carry out arrests and deportations, detaining immigrants at their workplaces, or allowing agents to cover their faces during arrests. 

Videos of ICE officers wearing masks and snatching people while they are at work or on a public street has rattled Michael Ida, a 56-year-old resident of Honolulu. An independent and Christian, Ida believes that some immigrants in the country illegally may deserve to stay.

“When it comes down to justice or mercy, we should err on the side of mercy. It's very disturbing to me,” Ida said. “As an Asian American especially, I feel like there's a little bit of anxiety to travel outside of Hawaii.”

Tai, however, says that ICE agents should be allowed to wear masks.

“Those poor ICE agents, they're doing their job there and people are basically threatening their families. That shouldn't be,” Tai said. 

Ida, who is half Korean and half Japanese, sees parallels with World War II, when in 1942 the U.S. government began forcing Japanese Americans from their homes and into incarceration camps. 

“History doesn't repeat but it rhymes. There's kind of echoes of what happened in the past.”

The poll of 1,027 U.S. adults who are Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders was conducted from Sept 2-9, 2025, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based Amplify AAPI Panel, designed to be representative of the Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 5.0 percentage points.

Federal employees feel the financial strain of the government shutdown that remains at a political impasse

WASHINGTON (AP) — With every passing day of the government shutdown, hundreds of thousands of federal employees furloughed or working without pay face mounting financial strain. And now they are confronting new uncertainty with the Trump administration's promised layoffs.

Little progress has been made to end the shutdown as it enters its third week, with Republicans and Democrats digging in and convinced their messaging is resonating with voters. The fate of the federal workers is among several pressure points that could eventually push the sides to agree to resolve the stalemate.

“Luckily I was able to pay rent this month,” said Peter Farruggia, a furloughed federal worker. “But for sure I am going to have bills that are going to go unpaid this month, and I really don't have many options.”

The shutdown has a familiar feel for many federal employees who endured past stalemates — including during President Donald Trump's first term — but this time, the stakes are higher. The Republican White House is leveraging federal workers' jobs to pressure Democrats to soften their demands. A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked the administration from firing workers during the shutdown, saying the human cost “cannot be tolerated.”

The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Trump and other Republican leaders have said the government must reopen before they will negotiate with Democrats on the health subsidies.




Government shutdownThe AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them?

Farruggia is the executive committee chair of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883, representing employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency that faced a wave of layoffs over the weekend. Like 8,000 other CDC employees who have been furloughed from the agency, he was already living paycheck to paycheck, and the partial pay that arrived Friday was his last until the government comes back online.

With the agency's leadership in turmoil and still rattled from a shooting, the shutdown and new firings mean “people are scared, nervous, anxious, but also really just exasperated,” Farruggia said. 

After Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said last week on social media that the “RIFs have begun,” referring to reduction-in-force plans aimed at reducing the size of the federal government, Vice President JD Vance doubled down on the threat Sunday, saying “the longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be.”

The layoffs have begun across federal agencies. Labor unions have already filed a lawsuit to stop the move by Trump's budget office.

In a court filing on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget said well over 4,000 federal employees from eight departments and agencies would be fired in conjunction with the shutdown.

Jessica Sweet, an Albany, New York, Social Security claims specialist who is a union steward of AFGE Local 3343 in New York, said, “I, myself, have a backup plan” in case she is fired during the shutdown, “but I know most people don't.” 

She says the Social Security Administration is already so short-staffed from layoffs earlier this year brought on by the Department of Government Efficiency, she doesn't fear a massive layoff during the shutdown. 

“The one thing this administration has taught me is that nothing is ever for certain, even if it's codified into law,” she said.

Having received a partial payment in her last paycheck, Sweet has begun reaching out to her local power companies to request that she not get charged late fees, since “my bills won't wait for me to eventually get paid.”

For some federal workers, this isn't their first shutdown — the last one, during Trump's first term in 2019, stretched a record 34 days. But this time, federal employees are being used more directly as leverage in the political fight over government funding.

The Republican administration last week warned that there would be no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a shutdown — a reversal of long-standing policy affecting roughly 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a White House memo. The move, which Trump later backtracked on, was widely seen as a strong-arm tactic.

Adam Pelletier, a National Labor Relations Board field examiner whose agency furloughed nearly all of its workforce on Oct. 1, going from roughly 1,100 workers to fewer than a dozen people, said he wouldn't mind if the shutdown continued if it meant meaningful progress toward gaining health care protections for Americans across the country — a key demand by Democrats for ending the stalemate. 

Pelletier, a union leader for NLRB local 3, said “right now, nothing is being investigated at the NLRB. There's no elections for unions or elections for decertifications. Basically nothing is happening.”

As for the financial strain on workers, he said workers can't even find alternate employment to weather the shutdown because “the ethics office that would approve of those requests is not staffed now.”

National Treasury Employees Union President Doreen Greenwald, which represents workers across dozens of federal agencies, said several of the union's members had been laid off as of Friday. The Treasury Department would lose 1,446 workers, according to the filing.

Greenwald said it was unfortunate that the Trump administration was using “federal employees as political pawns by furloughing and proposing to fire them all to try to cause pressure in a political game of chicken.”

“This isn't about one party or the other. It's about real people,” said Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees.

“The correction officer worrying about his next paycheck. The TSA officer who still shows up to work because he or she loves their country, even though they're not getting paid. No American should ever have to choose between serving their country and feeding their family,” Kelley said.

Kelley and other major federal worker union leaders gathered blocks from the Capitol last week, urging congressional leaders to find a solution and put “people over politics.” The event grew emotional at times, with union heads outlining the difficulties facing their members and the stakes growing daily.

Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, which represents 110,000 workers nationwide, called on both sides of Congress to find a resolution. He said Trump appeared to aim to “degrade, frighten, antagonize hardworking federal employees.”

Chris Bartley, political program coordinator for the International Association of Fire Fighters, said thousands of firefighters were showing up for work without pay out of a sense of devotion but stressed that could have broader consequences.

“Families go without income,” Bartley said. “Morale and retention suffer. Public safety is compromised.”

When the corroded pipeline burst in 2015, inky crude spread along the Southern California coast, becoming the state's worst oil spill in decades.

More than 140,000 gallons (3,300 barrels) of oil gushed out, blackening beaches for 150 miles (240 kilometers) from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles, polluting a biologically rich habitat for endangered whales and sea turtles, killing scores of pelicans, seals and dolphins, and decimating the fishing industry.

Plains All American Pipeline in 2022 agreed to a $230 million settlement with fishers and coastal property owners without admitting liability. Federal inspectors found that the Houston-based company failed to quickly detect the rupture and responded too slowly. It faced an uphill battle to build a new pipeline.

Three decades-old drilling platforms were subsequently shuttered, but another Texas-based fossil fuel company supported by the Trump administration purchased the operation and is intent on pumping oil through the pipeline again. 

Sable Offshore Corp., headquartered in Houston, is facing a slew of legal challenges but is determined to restart production, even if that means confining it to federal waters, where state regulators have virtually no say. California controls the 3 miles (5 kilometers) nearest to shore. The platforms are 5 to 9 miles (8 to 14 kilometers) offshore.

The Trump administration has hailed Sable's plans as the kind of project the president wants to increase U.S. energy production as the federal government removes regulatory barriers. President Donald Trump has directed Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to undo his predecessor's ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts. 

“This project risks another environmental disaster in California at a time when demand for oil is going down and the climate crisis is escalating,” said Alex Katz, executive director of Environmental Defense Center, the Santa Barbara group formed in response to a massive spill in 1969.

The environmental organization is among several suing Sable. 

“Our concern is that there is no way to make this pipeline safe and that this company has proven that it cannot be trusted to operate safely, responsibly or even legally,” he said.

Actor and activist Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who lives in the area, has implored officials to stop Sable, saying at a March protest: “I can smell a rat. And this project is a rat.”

The California Coastal Commission fined Sable a record $18 million for ignoring cease-and-desist orders over repair work it says was done without permits. Sable said it has permits from the previous owner, Exxon Mobil, and sued the commission while work continued on the pipeline. In June, a state judge ordered it to stop while the case proceeds through the court. The commission and Sable are due back in court Wednesday. 

“This fly-by-night oil company has repeatedly abused the public's trust, racking up millions of dollars in fines and causing environmental damage along the treasured Gaviota Coast,” a state park south of Santa Barbara, said Joshua Smith, the commission's spokesman.

So far, Sable is undeterred. 

The California Attorney General's office sued Sable this month, saying it illegally discharged waste into waterways, and disregarded state law requiring permits before work along the pipeline route that crosses sensitive wildlife habitat.

“Sable placed profits over environmental protection in its rush to get oil on the market,” the agency said in its lawsuit. 

Last month, the Santa Barbara District Attorney filed felony criminal charges against Sable, also accusing it of polluting waterways and harming wildlife.

Sable said it has fully cooperated with local and state agencies, including the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and called the district attorney's allegation “inflammatory and extremely misleading.” It said a biologist and state fire marshal officials oversaw the work, and no wildlife was harmed. 

The company is seeking $347 million for the delays, and says if the state blocks it from restarting the onshore pipeline system, it will use a floating facility that would keep its entire operation in federal waters and use tankers to transport the oil to markets outside California. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, the company updated its plan to include the option. 

The U.S. Interior Department's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said in July it was working with Sable to bring a second rig online. 

“President Trump made it clear that American energy should come from American resources,” the agency's deputy director Kenny Stevens said in a statement then, heralding the “comeback story for Pacific production.”

The agency said there are an estimated 190 million barrels (6 billion gallons) of recoverable oil reserves in the area, nearly 80% of residual Pacific reserves. It noted advancements in preventing and preparing for oil spills and said the failed pipeline has been rigorously tested. 

“Continuous monitoring and improved technology significantly reduce the risk of a similar incident occurring in the future,” the agency said. 

On May 19 — the 10th anniversary of the disaster — CEO Jim Flores announced that Sable “is proud to have safely and responsibly achieved first production at the Santa Ynez Unit” — which includes three rigs in federal waters, offshore and onshore pipelines, and the Las Flores Canyon Processing Facility.

State officials countered that the company had only conducted testing and not commercial production. Sable's stock price dropped and some investors sued, alleging they were misled.

Sable purchased the Santa Ynez Unit from Exxon Mobil in 2024 for nearly $650 million primarily with a loan from Exxon. Exxon sold the shuttered operation after losing a court battle in 2023 to truck the crude through central California while the pipeline system was rebuilt or repaired. 

Flores said well tests at the Platform Harmony rig indicate there is much oil to be extracted and that it will relieve California's gas prices — among the nation's highest — by stabilizing supplies.

“Sable is very concerned about the crumbling energy complex in California,” Flores said in a statement to The Associated Press. “With the exit of two refineries last year and more shuttering soon, California's economy cannot survive without the strong energy infrastructure it enjoyed for the last 150 years.”

California has been reducing the state's production of fossil fuels in favor of clean energy for years. The movement has been spearheaded partly by Santa Barbara County, where elected officials voted in May to begin taking steps to phase out onshore oil and gas operations.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin discusses deploying the National Guard in U.S. cities on ‘America Reports.'

An alleged Chicago gang leader living in the United States illegally and accused of soliciting the murder of a high-ranking U.S. Border Patrol commander has been indicted by a federal grand jury.

Juan Espinoza Martinez, 37, is charged with a single count of murder for hire over an alleged bounty placed on U.S. Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino, the commander at large.

The indictment states that Martinez, a Mexican citizen, ""knowingly used a facility of interstate commerce, namely, an Apple Model 16 cellular telephone... and Snapchat, with intent that a murder be committed.""

He was arrested this week and remains in federal custody.

According to a criminal complaint, Martinez is a ranking member of the Latin Kings, a gang notorious for violent crimes and drug trafficking across Chicago and other cities. DHS said Martinez is from Mexico and entered the U.S. illegally at an unknown date and time.

He allegedly sent messages via Snapchat that read, ""2k on information when you get him"" and ""10k if you take him down,"" the complaint states.

In the exchange, Martinez used the handle ""monkeys---"" and the name ""Juan,"" federal prosecutors said. The message included a photo of a senior Border Patrol officer involved in immigration enforcement operations in Chicago as part of U.S. Customs and Border Protection's ""Operation Midway Blitz.""

Martinez's lawyer, Jonathan Bedi, said last week that his client was a longtime Chicago resident and father of three who was innocent of the charge against him.

""Juan has resided in the United States for 30 years, and throughout his time in Chicago, he has had no prior criminal history or gang affiliation,"" Bedi said. ""As a dedicated union member, Juan has consistently worked to provide for his family while contributing positively to the community; he even coaches his kids' sports teams.""

""Juan is innocent of these charges. Juan, his family and supporters remain steadfast in their confidence in his innocence and his character as a hardworking, law-abiding member of society,"" he added.

President Donald Trump and FBI Director Kash Patel share results from Operation Summer Heat, an initiative focused on violent crime. 

President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced federal law enforcement will next set its eyes on San Francisco, commending the FBI's more than 23,000 violent criminal arrests, which he said is more than double the number arrested in the final year of the Biden administration.

During an Oval Office news conference at the White House, Trump said the FBI has ""destroyed or severely disrupted"" more than 170 organized criminal enterprises and gangs, 1,600 of the most violent gangs, and confiscated more than 6,000 illegal firearms since he was sworn in.

He added he wants to make every city safe, and his focus has turned to San Francisco.

""These are great cities that could be fixed,"" the president said. ""I'm going to be strongly recommending … [we] start looking at San Francisco. I think we can make San Francisco one of our great cities. … It's a mess, and we have great support in San Francisco. … Every American deserves to live in a community where they're not afraid of being mugged, murdered, robbed, raped, assaulted, or shot.""

TRUMP'S DC CRIME OPERATION ‘PUTS SAFETY OF FAMILIES FIRST' AS ARRESTS SURGE PAST 1,800: FBI DIRECTOR

During the news conference, FBI Director Kash Patel announced ""Operation Summer Heat,"" which the FBI created to target violent criminals, yielded 8,700 arrests of violent offenders in three months.

More than 2,200 guns and 421 kilograms of fentanyl seized during the operation—enough fentanyl to kill 55 million Americans, according to Patel.

TRUMP'S DC CRIME SUCCESS PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON CHICAGO'S DEADLY 'WAR ZONE'

To date, he said the FBI has seized 1900 kilograms of fentanyl—enough lethal doses to kill 127 million Americans alone to date.

""If you look at the past four years of the Biden administration, [there were] 16,000, 17,000, 15,000, 15,000 … arrests year over year of violent felons in this country,"" Patel said. ""You have 28,600 arrests of violent felons in just seven months alone because of your leadership and the dedication of the men and women at the FBI who want to go out there and do the job they were prevented from doing. … This number is historic by every metric.""

""That is a 30% increase year to date over the last administration,"" he said.

California high schoolers stepped away from their volleyball team to file a lawsuit over the state's transgender athlete policies after spending the previous three years sharing a locker room with a biological male.

Jurupa Valley High School's girls' volleyball team in California has now seen at least 10 games on its 2025 schedule forfeited amid a national controversy involving one of its players, who is transgender. 

Los Osos High School forfeited a tournament game against Jurupa Valley on Saturday, while Patriot High School forfeited its Monday varsity match, marking its second forfeit to JVHS this season. Patriot High School previously forfeited a Sept. 26 match to Jurupa Valley. 

Maribel Munoz, the mother of Jurupa Valley player Alyssa McPherson, provided Fox News Digital a copy of a message sent by JVHS head coach Liana Manu, announcing that the varsity match against Patriot was forfeited. The JV and freshman games were still played.

A California school board president close to the situation also confirmed to Fox News Digital that the Patriot High School varsity team did not play its Monday game against Jurupa Valley while the JV and freshman teams did play.

Los Osos forfeited to Jurupa Valley after the two teams were matched up in the consolation round of a neutral tournament over the weekend. That game is currently logged as a forfeit on the high school sports tracking website MaxPreps. No official reason for the forfeits has been provided by the schools. 

Fox News Digital reached out to Jurupa Unified School District, which houses Jurupa Valley and Patriot High School, and the Chaffey Joint Union High School District, which houses Los Osos, for a response. 

""Patriot will be forfeiting varsity but lower levels will be playing. We already expected it,"" Manu's text message read. 

Patriot High School shares a league and school district with JVHS, and by forfeiting for the second time this season, it keeps Jurupa Valley a perfect 9-0 in league play and in first place going into the final game of the regular season. Jurupa Valley will face Norte Vista High School on Wednesday with a chance to clinch first place going into the playoffs. JVHS has already beaten Norte Vista 3-2 in their first meeting on Oct. 1. 

Meanwhile, Patriot High School and Los Osos join fellow southern California high school girls' volleyball teams at Riverside Poly, Orange Vista, Rim of The World, AB Miller, Yucaipa, Aquinas and San Dimas in refusing to face Jurupa Valley this season. No official reason for the forfeits has been provided by any of those schools. 

Two of Jurupa Valley's senior players, McPherson and Hadeel Hazameh, stepped away from the team this season in protest of trans teammate AB Hernandez. 

McPherson and Hazameh have also filed a lawsuit against the Jurupa Unified School District citing their experience playing and sharing a locker room with Hernandez the previous three seasons. McPherson's older sister and former JVHS girls' volleyball player Madison McPherson is the third plaintiff in that lawsuit. 

EX-SJSU STAR BROOKE SLUSSER MAKES NEW ALLEGATIONS ABOUT PROBE INTO TRANS TEAMMATE'S ALLEGED PLOT TO HARM HER

Jurupa Valley is poised to play in the postseason, where forfeits may continue. Last season, a Christian high school girls' volleyball team in northern California, Stone Ridge Christian, forfeited a playoff game to San Francisco Waldorf, which had a trans athlete on its team.

Jurupa Valley won their league with Hernandez on its team in 2024, albeit with far less attention and controversy than this year. 

Hernandez then garnered national attention in the spring during a highly-publicized run to the state girls' track and field championships. The trans athlete took first place in the girls' high jump and triple jump after President Donald Trump sent a Truth Social post warning California not to allow a trans athlete to compete in the girls' events just days before the state meet on the last day of May.

Amid Trump's warning and national and local backlash, the state's high school sports league, the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) changed its rules to award any female athlete who competed in the same events to Hernandez a spot in the competition or one spot higher on the medal podium if they finished behind a biological male athlete. 

The rule change resulted in Hernandez sharing podium spots with female athletes who finished behind the trans athlete in the state finals. Hernandez also finished in second place in the long jump.

The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the CIF and California Department of Education a month later in July for refusing to change its transgender policies to comply with Trump's ""Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"" executive order. 

California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office previously provided a statement to Fox News Digital, deferring responsibility for the situation to the CIF, CDE and state legislature. 

""CIF is an independent nonprofit that governs high school sports. The California Department of Education is a separate constitutional office. Neither is under the Governor's authority. CIF and the CDE have stated they follow existing state law — a law that was passed in 2013 and signed by Governor Jerry Brown (not Newsom) and in line with 21 other states. For the law to change, the legislature would need to send the Governor a bill. They have not,"" the statement read.

On April 1, the California state legislature blocked two bills that would reverse the current law which allows males in girls' sports. Every Democrat voted against it, with Assembly member Rick Chavez Zbur arguing that one of the bills ""is really reminiscent to me of what happened in Nazi Germany in the 1930s. We are moving towards autocracy in this country. In Nazi Germany, transgender people were persecuted, barred from public life."" 

Zbur said this while in the presence of a descendant of a Holocaust survivor, who had to excuse herself from the chamber, according to GOP Assembly member Kate Sanchez. 

""She stood up and left because she was just so disgusted with the comparison,"" Sanchez told Fox News Digital. 

In July, Newsom spoke about the issue in an interview on the ""Shawn Ryan Show,"" saying he has been ""amazingly frustrated by it"" and that he regularly encounters parents who are angry about the state's policies at his children's soccer games. 

""Every parent coming up says, ‘It's so unfair.' Like ‘Whoa,' like everywhere I went, progressively-minded people, not bigots, that are champions of trans policy like I am, but didn't like the sports. They were like ‘Come on man, you got to figure this out,'"" Newsom said.

Newsom added that his allies in the LGBTQ caucus were ""furious"" with him after he made his initial comments in March while speaking to Kirk, and even recalled an alleged conversation with Trump about it. 

""And now he's suing and threatening us, and they're just, and you know, I'm the poster child,"" Newsom added. ""But I do think we have to address that issue.""

Turkey has been accused of deporting hundreds of peaceful Christians under the guise of ""national security,"" including dozens last year, in a move legal advocates warn is an ""attack"" on the freedom of religion.

In a Monday address to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), legal expert for the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) International, Lidia Rieder, warned that Turkey is systematically targeting Christians purely ""for practicing their faith.""

""Turkey's labeling of peaceful Christian residents as ‘security threats' is a clear misuse of law and an attack on freedom of religion or belief,"" Rieder said during the OSCE Warsaw Human Dimension Conference. ""When governments manipulate administrative or immigration systems to exclude people based solely on their faith, it undermines both the rule of law and the very principles of tolerance and peaceful coexistence that the OSCE was founded to protect.""

TURKEY CONVERTS ANCIENT CHURCH INTO MOSQUE, SPARKING DEBATE ON HERITAGE PRESERVATION

Since 2020, more than 350 foreign Christian workers and their family members have been expelled from Turkey, including at least 35 cases between December 2024 and January 2025, reported the ADF. 

According to the international watchdog, Turkey's Ministry of Interior has assigned the individuals targeted by Ankara ""security codes,"" like as N-82 and G-87, which effectively bars them from ever re-entering the country as it classifies them as a national security threat.  

Rieder also reminded the OSCE conference of the ""landmark case"" Wiest v. Turkey, which is currently before the European Court of Human Rights, and is ""expected to set a crucial precedent for the protection of religious freedom in Europe and beyond.""

Kenneth Wiest, a U.S. citizen and a Protestant, was born, raised and then resided legally in Turkey with his wife and three children for over 30 years before he was banned from the country in 2019 upon returning from a trip ""without evidence of wrongdoing.""

His case is just the latest in what is increasingly viewed as discriminatory policies that persecute religious minorities since President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan took office more than a decade ago.

TRUMP: ERDOGAN COULD BE ‘INFLUENTIAL' IN ENDING PUTIN'S WAR BY ENDING OIL SALES ‘IF HE WANTS'

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Rieder said that the Turkish delegation present at the OSCE conference ""itself acknowledged that discrimination against Christians is on the rise across the OSCE region and beyond,"" which she said was ""notable.""

""While Turkey emphasized its commitment to promoting tolerance through international cooperation, the same principles must be upheld within its own borders,"" she said. ""The reality on the ground remains deeply concerning for many individuals, families, and communities who continue to face restrictions on worship, deportations, and barriers to religious education. 

""Turkey's call to hear the voices of victims and to respect fundamental freedoms for all must now be translated into concrete action,"" Rieder added.

The Turkish embassy in D.C. did not directly respond to Fox News Digital's questions but pointed to a statement released on Wednesday by Ankara's office of Communications Center for Countering Disinformation, which denied the claims levied by ADF International and called them ""completely unfounded and part of a deliberate disinformation campaign.""

The office pointed to the history of Christian, Jewish and Muslim communities that have co-existed together and said Turkey is working to ""protect"" and ""restore"" places of worship.

""Respect for faiths and pluralism are indispensable elements of our country's democratic order,"" the statement read. ""Turkey, like any other sovereign state, may make administrative decisions on foreign nationals for a variety of reasons, including visa violations, disturbance of public order, or a lack of legal permits.""

The communications department said no visa-based decisions have been made based on ""identity or affiliation.""

The statement did not directly address the case involving Wiest.

""Freedom of religion cannot exist if believers live under threat of expulsion for practicing their faith,"" Rieder said. ""The OSCE and its participating States have pledged to promote tolerance and non-discrimination. These commitments must be upheld not only in word, but in action."" 

OSCE did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's questions about what steps it will take to address the growing concerns of religious persecution in Turkey.

Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich joins 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss the ongoing government shutdown and his take on Operation Arctic Frost that reportedly targeted Republican lawmakers' phone records.

A federal judge in San Francisco on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration from continuing government furloughs, granting a temporary restraining order sought by labor unions that argued layoffs were unlawful during the ongoing government shutdown.

U.S. District Court Judge Susan Illston, a Clinton appointee, ordered the administration not to issue any reduction in force notices to federal employees in ""any program, project or activity,"" including any bargaining unit or member represented by the unions during, or because of, the shutdown.

A 'Special Report' all-star panel deliberates on the government shutdown, how the peace in the Middle East could impact the Ukraine war, the posthumous awarding of the Medal of Freedom to Charlie Kirk and more.

Senate Republicans tried and failed for the ninth time to reopen the government and are starting to believe that Senate Democrats won't budge until next week.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Senate Democrats again blocked the House-passed continuing resolution (CR) in their push for an extension of expiring Obamacare subsidies.

They argue that unless congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump come to the table and negotiate an extension to the expiring tax credits, they won't provide Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., the necessary votes to reopen the government.

Democrats also contend that unless Congress acts before Nov. 1, the start of open enrollment for Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Americans who rely on the subsidies will see their healthcare premiums skyrocket. Still, their refusal to vote with Republicans to reopen the government has thrust the shutdown into its third week and is closing the window to negotiate an extension to the subsidies before the open enrollment deadline begins. 

""With open enrollment around the corner, Republicans cannot continue to kick this can down the road,"" Schumer said. ""It's happening now. The healthcare crisis is now.""

But Republicans have messaged that Senate Democrats are waiting for an upcoming ""No Kings"" protest in Washington, D.C., on Saturday before finding an off-ramp for the shutdown. 

Thune acknowledged that there are still ongoing conversations about finding a way out of the shutdown, but he believed that Senate Democrats weren't going to make a move until after Saturday, two weeks before open enrollment begins.

""It's just right now, I think the Dems, in particular, are dug in,"" he said. ""I think you got to get past this Saturday. That's a threshold issue for them. But I'm hoping that in some of their conversations, they'll get sort of more realistic. But, yeah, this needs to end.""

Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., who has engaged in talks with Republicans and Democrats on the Obamacare issue, said that the other side of the aisle likely wouldn't engage this week, ""because they've got the big protest going on this coming Saturday.""

""Once we get past that, hopefully they will come around, and they'll start actually considering the impact of keeping the government shut down,"" he said.

He noted that there were already talks among lawmakers on what to do with the expiring subsidies ""before the shutdown.""

""And it really surprised a lot of us when our Democrat colleagues decided they were going to shut down the government anyway,"" Rounds said.

In the midst of the healthcare squabble, Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo., noted that the shutdown had much deeper ramifications, particularly on air travel as air traffic controllers could go without pay should the shutdown continue.

He argued that Senate Democrats and Schumer had become beholden to the ""radical left"" of the Democratic Party.

""And they're coming to Washington this weekend,"" Barrasso said. ""And they've told us how dangerous they are by admitting that their shutdown strategy will not change until planes are falling out of the sky. Innocent people are collateral damage in this dangerous political game that the Democrats are playing.""

She's won Woman of the Year on several occasions. She's been awarded multiple Emmy awards and a Peabody. When one thinks of CNN's international coverage, she's usually the first name that comes to mind. 

Christiane Amanpour first burst onto the journalism scene on 60 Minutes in the 1980s. She would later go on to anchor ABC News and host programs on PBS while primarily doing war reporting for CNN. 

THE CLOSING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY MIND

So while the British-born star is decorated, she is anything but remotely close to being an objective, trustworthy reporter. For example, just a few months ago, she compared the United States to North Korea. 

“I must say I was afraid. I'm a foreigner. I don't have a green card. I'm not an American citizen. I'm fairly prominent, and I literally prepared to go to America as if I was going to North Korea,” she claimed. “I took a burner phone. Imagine that … not my mobile phone, not my iPad, nothing, and I had nothing on the burner phone except a few numbers.”

This is the definition of unhinged hyperbole. She also led the charge against the now-former CNN president, Chris Licht, by publicly blasting him for hosting then-candidate Donald Trump for a town hall in 2023 when he was easily leading in the polls for the Republican nomination. 

Amanpour would later argue that CNN should have taped and edited the Trump town hall to craft the proper narrative. This is exactly what CBS News did with then-Vice President Kamala Harris's infamous 60 Minutes interview last October. That stunt ended up costing the network $15 million after the network settled a lawsuit with Trump. 

“So maybe less is more,” she said. “Maybe live [television] is not always right.”

Yes, because God forbid Trump says something even a liberal audience like CNN agrees with. 

But matters really came to a head after Amanpour made the disgusting claim that Israeli hostages were actually treated relatively well during their two years in captivity under Hamas. 

“It's been a terrible, terrible two years for them because not only are they there — you know, they're probably being treated better than the average Gazan because they are the pawns and the chips that Hamas had,” Amanpour said. “Now Hamas has given up all its leverage, by the way, by giving them all up. So that is a victory for the Israeli side.”

“…treated better than the average Gazan.” Uh-huh. Was the average Gazan forced to dig their own graves in tunnels underground? Was the average Gazan starved, electrocuted, or held in chains? 

On Monday night, after overwhelming backlash, Amanpour apologized on social media for her remarks. 

“It was insensitive and wrong. From speaking to many former hostages and their families, like everyone, I've been horrified at what Hamas has subjected them to over two long years,” she wrote. 

One has to wonder about Amanpour's future at CNN at this point because apparently, she doesn't think she's biased in any way, shape, or form. 

“To be honest, Oliver, I never hear myself being called ‘partisan,” she told the hopelessly biased Oliver Darcy in an interview. “I am not an American, I don't cover U.S. elections or domestic politics. I tell the truth and the stories from around the world, including what everyone over here thinks of America at any given time.”

She doesn't cover politics? That's weird, because besides publicly rebuking her own network for hosting Trump in a town hall setting in 2023, she also once defended Hillary Clinton after collapsing at a 9/11 memorial event before the 2016 presidential election, as her just having an “off day.” 

“Surely this can't be a case of a human being having an off day,” Amanpour said sarcastically. “No, like so many things, Hillary, the media are having a field day. Off to the races with another debilitating case of indignant outrage. This must be another typical Clinton conspiracy to fool them with a total transparency breakdown.”

Nope. No bias there whatsoever. And here's Amanpour back in 2020 comparing the Trump administration to the Nazis. 

“This week, 82 years ago, Kristallnacht happened,” Amanpour said in a CNN monologue. “It was the Nazis' warning shot across the bow of our human civilization that led to genocide against a whole identity, and in that tower of burning books, it led to an attack on fact, knowledge, history, and truth. After four years of a modern-day assault on those same values by Donald Trump, the Biden-Harris team pledges a return to norms, including the truth.”

Again, Amanpour said she didn't cover U.S. elections, right? And similar to she did with the Israeli hostages, she apologized for these remarks. Sort of.

“I should not have juxtaposed the two thoughts. Hitler and his evils stand alone, of course, in history,” she explained. “I regret any pain my statement may have caused.”

But she just couldn't leave it there. Instead, she defended the thought process in the most pious way possible.

“My point was to say how democracy can potentially slip away, and how we must always zealously guard our democratic values,” she warned.

Yes. Because nothing says saving democracy quite like the Democrats weaponizing the justice system or installing candidates at the 11th hour, as the party did with Kamala Harris, without one vote from the public  

For CNN, cutting ties with Amanpour has little downside. The network is already hemorrhaging viewers at an alarming rate. In prime time, despite a dizzying news cycle largely thanks to President Donald Trump, CNN is only averaging 543,000 viewers, which is down 36% from one year ago. In contrast, Fox News averaged more than 3.3 million viewers in prime time, or more than six times the audience of CNN. Amanpour reportedly makes $5 million per year, and the return on investment is low ratings and constant PR headaches like the one she's causing this week in again showing her anti-Israel bias.

I'm often asked if CBS News can be turned around by hiring Bari Weiss, a true journalist who created The Free Press from scratch to one of the most respected and read news sites in business. My answer is that the network can only change if the faces seen on it change. And until that happens, until the culture and presentation look and sound different, one person alone can't change its failing direction.

The same goes for CNN. It tried to return to the center two years ago, but the inmates with microphones revolted against its network president in Licht. He was shown the door for having the audacity to give Trump an hour-long town hall.

“You have every right to be outraged and angry and never watch this network again,” alleged anchor Anderson Cooper told viewers the night after Trump's appearance, which he also called “disturbing.”

Licht was ousted a few weeks later. Cooper kept his job. 

DEMOCRATS WANT THE GOP TO DESTROY NORMS

If CNN truly wants to earn viewers and readers' trust, it's time to take out the trash. 

And dumping Christiane Amanpour would be a very good start. ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Arguments just began for the 2025 U.S. Supreme Court term, and there is a case that conservatives should be tracking because it could bring the first Supreme Court rebuke of the Left's ongoing campaign of woke lawfare.

Chevron v. Plaquemines Parish is a case that arises from a Louisiana parish's effort to impose massive liability on energy companies such as Chevron and Exxon for crude oil production in the Louisiana coastal zone during World War II. It is part of a cohort of related Louisiana cases, one of which already delivered a judgment for $745 million. The question Plaquemines Parish presents to the court is, on its face, very technical: whether state or federal courts have jurisdiction to handle this type of lawsuit. But what matters most about the case is what is just below the surface.

SUPREME COURT ASKED TO WEIGH IN ON WHETHER SCHOOLS CAN SECRETLY TRANSITION STUDENTS

Plaquemines Parish is representative of a growing wave of state court cases that serve as a key avenue for local governments and left-wing activists to try and obtain policy outcomes by judicial edict or because of massive monetary judgments. This aspect of the case likely was a key part of what triggered multiple Republican state attorneys general to file a brief at the Supreme Court, in which the states warned that “[t]his case exemplifies a vast and troubling trend: state courts positioning themselves as forums to override national policy through nuclear verdicts, onerous injunctions, and more.”

Said differently, Plaquemines Parish is largely indistinguishable from the rest of the Left's lawfare campaign because it uses the same tactics and seeks the same end goal from the litigation: punishment of the energy sector with massive monetary judgments alongside erasure of on-the-ground energy company operations within the pertinent jurisdictions.

This campaign of woke lawfare is a major threat to conservatives who are just trying to live a normal life free from liberal influence. It includes left-wing trial lawyers, nonprofits, and local governments, all of whom are trying to use injunctions, monetary judgments, and other court orders to control what companies can produce and what consumers can buy. While liberals might be losing at the ballot box, they see hope in this woke lawfare campaign, which can bring the Green New Deal to your home no matter what happens in Congress, reshaping our economy through the courtroom when liberals are losing influence elsewhere.

Other cases from this woke lawfare campaign have come up to the Supreme Court in connection with procedural skirmishes, but Plaquemines Parish is the first to reach the court in a posture where a loss would produce a real setback for the Left's campaign. To be sure, if the court holds that this cohort of cases properly belongs in federal court, the immediate result will be the wipeout of the $745 million judgment, alone a huge setback. But there is also a strong indication that federal courts would dismiss all the Louisiana cases under binding precedent, sending the lawfare crowd packing. And a loss on the merits would have serious implications for the Left's woke lawfare strategy overall, coming on the heels of a string of losses for the campaign in state courts in recent years. 

EIGHT CASES TO WATCH IN THE NEW SUPREME COURT TERM

If you are a follower of lawfare, or you care about who gets to decide which products you can find on store shelves, you should keep your eye on Plaquemines Parish, with oral arguments coming up, likely in December, and a final decision this spring.

Plaquemines Parish will surely attract some independent attention for the fact that it involves large energy companies that make for click-worthy headlines or because it implicates a $745 million state court judgment. But the case is far more interesting for how it serves as a stalking horse for the rest of the campaign of woke lawfare that is coursing through state courts across the country. It is that stalking horse aspect of Plaquemines Parish that should pique the interest of most conservatives and lead all of us on the ideological Right to pull for the energy companies to win in a decisive fashion before the court. Because when woke lawfare loses, we all win.

The “sanctuary” state of Illinois allocated more money in its 2025 budget to cover free healthcare for illegal immigrants than it did for the state's road repair fund, home-delivered meals for the elderly, expanding foster homes, and the arts, combined.

A Washington Examiner analysis of the state's budget, put forth in state Senate Bill 251 last year, revealed that the state put $629 million toward taxpayer-funded healthcare for illegal immigrant adults from July 1, 2024, through June 30, 2025.

That single expenditure was more than the $400 million the Illinois Department of Transportation was given for its Road Fund that pays for transportation-related projects in towns, cities, and counties; $55.3 million to cook and deliver meals to the elderly; $22.1 million to increase foster homes and specialized care of children; and $24.6 million to fund the Illinois Arts Council — combined.

Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, said programs like Illinois' incentivize illegal immigration and take away from other deserving programs.

“It is directly impacting taxpayer money that is available for other people in Illinois, for needy people in Illinois,” Vaughan said in a phone call Wednesday. “States have to balance their budgets, unlike the federal government, so when these costs of services to illegal aliens explode, as has happened with the population of people in the country illegally, generally, then that directly takes away from programs that serve Americans.”

In 2020, Illinois politicians moved to make healthcare coverage available for people who had no legal basis to be in the United States. In December 2020, the state rolled out the Health Benefits for Immigrant Seniors program to give adults over 65 years of age a government-subsidized way to obtain healthcare at low to no cost. People who are unlawfully present in the U.S. are not eligible for coverage under Medicaid.

In May 2022, the program was expanded to include adults between the ages of 55 and 64. Then in July 2022, adults 42 to 54 years old became eligible. Both groups under 65 years old were wrapped into a new program, Health Benefits for Adults. 

Between 2021 and 2024, Illinois spent $1.6 billion covering healthcare costs for illegal immigrants over the age of 42, according to a February 2025 report by the auditor general.

The massive spending was due, in part, to the state's allowing approximately twice as many people to get covered as it had planned for. Around 30,000 illegal immigrants in Illinois were covered by the state plan. 

For the fiscal 2026 budget, which began in July this year, Pritzker said the state would no longer be paying for healthcare for illegal immigrant adults — only elderly illegal immigrants who were 65 years old or above. 

The state's Department of Human Services dropped the budget by $330 million by cutting the Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults program. As of July 1, only senior citizens in the country illegally would be eligible for healthcare coverage.

Despite canceling one of the two healthcare programs for illegal immigrants, Illinois had already hit a $200 million deficit by the end of September, just a quarter of the way into fiscal 2026, according to the Governor's Office of Management and Budget.

Thirteen other states and Washington, D.C., also provide healthcare to illegal immigrants: California, New York, Washington, New Jersey, Oregon, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Rhode Island, Maine, and Vermont.

Vaughan said healthcare programs for illegal immigrants “can serve as a reason that these people don't go home,” knowing that their healthcare in blue states is better than in the country they are from.

Immigrant advocates have argued that the healthcare program was beneficial. 

REPUBLICANS SEE LEFT-WING PROTESTS AT ICE FACILITIES AS WAY TO APPEAL TO VOTERS

For example, the Embodying Race(ism) Project at the University of Chicago determined that the programs coincided with a roughly 15% drop in “bad debt” by Illinois hospitals, meaning that because more people were covered by the state programs, hospitals were not forced to take on the cost of services themselves.

“Notably, we did not observe similar reductions in Wisconsin and Indiana, our control states, suggesting that these changes may have been linked to the implementation of HBIA/HBIS,” the Embodying Race(ism) Project's website states.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Young Republicans leaders across the nation have exchanged racist texts that have been leaked in a new report, landing the New York GOP in the crossfire.

The Telegram messages, first reported by Politico, highlighted messages written by Young Republicans in New York, Kansas, Arizona, and Vermont. Among the messages, people labeled black people monkeys and “the watermelon people” and also called for rape against their political opponents, among other examples.

The New York State Young Republicans group was the most vocal in the group chat. In one instance, one of the group's leaders said, “I love Hitler,” and mused about placing their enemies in gas chambers. Another leader in the New York GOP group wondered about the possibility of the chat getting leaked.

In the hours since the report was published, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) denounced the messages and Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) over her previous praise of the state's Young Republicans. Stefanik and other New York Republicans have condemned the messages.

When asked by a reporter whether the messages reflect “some bad apples,” Hochul excoriated Republicans and suggested they are condoning the behavior.

“Some bad apples? These are the future of the Republican Party,” the Democratic governor answered. “This is so vile it is hard to find the words to put into context that these are people who are part of a political party — one of two major parties — and they believe in gas chambers and rape and discrimination based on the color of people's skin. These are racist, sexist, disgusting remarks.”

Hochul then criticized Stefanik for labeling New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani a “jihadist” and “terrorist,” called on Republicans to do a “reexamination” of their rhetoric, and floated possible punishments for the Young Republican leaders who wrote the hateful messages.

“Kick them out of the party. Take away their official roles. Stop using them as campaign advisers,” she said. “There needs to be consequences. This bulls*** has to stop.”

Stefanik previously described the New York State Young Republicans as “the backbone of our party.” The congresswoman is also tied to the group through an award she was gifted in August.

“As the proud representative of NY's 21st District, and the House Republican Leadership Chair, I am honored to receive the distinguished designation of Congresswoman of the Year!” Stefanik said in a statement at the time. “I want to thank Bobby Walker, Peter Giunta, and all of the hardworking Young Republicans who are the backbone of our party, for all the work they do to ensure Republican victories up and down the ballot in New York.”

Bobby Walker and Peter Giunta were two of the leaders who exchanged some of the texts that are now under scrutiny.

Hochul's campaign called on Stefanik to return the award following the report.

“Elise Stefanik can't hide behind staff to denounce the antisemitic, racist, hateful individuals she endorsed, funded, and praised as the ‘backbone' of the Republican Party,” a spokesperson for Hochul's campaign said, per Politico. “These are her people who said ‘I love Hitler' and named her their congresswoman of the year — an award she still hasn't returned. Stefanik's silence tells New Yorkers where she stands and who she stands with.”

In response to her connections to the group, Stefanik's campaign committee noted she has never employed any member of the group chat.

NEW YORK CITY GOP BACKS MICHAEL HENRY'S CAMPAIGN FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL AGAINST LETITIA JAMES

Alex deGrasse, a senior adviser to Stefanik, told the Washington Examiner, “Kathy Hochul's endorsed candidate Zohran Mamdani is an Antisemite Defund the Police Communist who embraces and campaigns with terrorists who say 9/11 was justified, say Israel doesn't have the right to exist as a Jewish state, and say he will arrest Netanyahu. And Kathy Hochul not only supports him, she endorsed him.”

On the subject of the Young Republicans group chat, deGrasse continued, “Congresswoman Stefanik was absolutely appalled to learn about the alleged comments made by leaders of the New York State Young Republicans and other state YRs in a large national group chat. According to the description provided by Politico, the comments were heinous, antisemitic, racist and unacceptable. While none have ever been employed  by Congresswoman Stefanik, if the description by Politico is accurate, Congresswoman Stefanik calls for any NY Young Republicans responsible for these horrific comments in this chat to step down immediately. Unlike Kathy Hochul who bends the knee and refuses to condemn the vile antisemitism spewed by leading NY Democrat candidates like Mamdani every single day, Congresswoman Stefanik will call out vile hate and demand accountability.”

Stefanik hasn't yet entered next year's race for governor of New York, although she is expected to make an announcement after next month's elections. Until then, she is raising money for a possible gubernatorial bid. Meanwhile, Hochul is preparing to launch her reelection campaign.

President Donald Trump turned his attention on Tuesday to criminal behavior in Boston after multiple deployments of National Guard troops to cities throughout the country to help reduce crime. 

Trump suggested he might order the removal of the 2026 World Cup games from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, home of the NFL's New England Patriots. 

In a Tuesday meeting with Argentine President Javier Milei at the White House, Trump cited “unsafe conditions” in Boston. He mentioned recent violent car meets in Boston earlier this month, one of which left a police department cruiser destroyed by fire. 

The car meetups have been deemed “staged attacks” and organized through social media and group messaging platforms, local prosecutors said. 

“These street takeovers are not spontaneous events but are preplanned and coordinated through social media platforms and group messaging applications,” said Lisa Deacutis, assistant district attorney at the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office. “Participants share meeting points, times, and driving routes in advance to allow large numbers to join intersections before police arrive.”

The president claimed that “they're taking over parts of Boston” before stating, “But we could get them back in about two seconds.”

Trump was also critical of Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, calling her “radical left” and saying he was not pleased with her response to the violence.

​​”I think she is hurting Boston,” Trump said. “The answer is yes. If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, let's move it to another location, if I thought Boston was going to cause safety conditions for the World Cup. I could say the same thing for the Olympics.”

Wu's office issued a statement in response to Trump's comments. It did not mention the president's remarks but emphasized its excitement about Boston holding the event.

“Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions,” the statement read.

Democrats are using a $20 billion lifeline to Argentina to claim Republicans care more about bailing out foreign governments than helping Americans at home.

The messaging, a riff on President Donald Trump's “America First” policy agenda, intensified ahead of a White House visit by Argentinian President Javier Milei on Tuesday, where Trump said the United States would “be there” for Argentina, so long as Milei succeeds in midterm elections set to take place later this month.

Democrats have variously framed the bailout as an affront to American farmers, as Argentina sells its soybean crops at “manipulative prices” to China, as well as average voters who fear rising healthcare costs.

The latter argument marks a new wrinkle in a shutdown fight with Republicans as Democrats demand an extension of premium Obamacare subsidies to reopen the government, which shuttered over the demands on Oct. 1.

“If this administration has $20 billion to spare for a MAGA-friendly foreign government, how can they say we don't have the money to lower healthcare costs?” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said on the Senate floor.

The Democratic talking point, made in the halls of Congress and a Democratic National Committee press call on Tuesday, reflects an attempt to turn Trump's signature policy doctrine against him.

Trump has used the “America First” mantra to encapsulate his agenda, from a crackdown on illegal immigration to his demands that NATO contribute more to its own self-defense. But the financial assistance for Argentina, structured in the form of a currency swap, has torn at the president's MAGA support and frustrated business groups that noted Argentina, an agricultural rival, sold shipments of soybeans to China as talk of a bailout became public.

Trump defended the economic package at the White House on Tuesday, arguing that the U.S. benefits from the Milei government staying in power. He represents a libertarian break from the socialist policies of other regional governments and has forged a closer relationship with the White House.

“It's just helping a great philosophy take over a great country,” Trump told reporters. “We don't have to do it. It's not going to make a big difference for our country, but it will in terms of South America.”

Democrats nonetheless see the issue as a liability for Trump, whose strikes on Iran and loose commitment to Ukraine have also rankled supporters.

On Tuesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) attempted to pass a bill, the “No Argentina Bailout Act,” to keep the Treasury Department from performing the currency swap, before her attempt was blocked by Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC).

“It is shameful that President Trump is propping up a foreign government, while he shuts down our own,” Warren said in a floor speech.

The message represents the latest attempt to move Republicans off their shutdown position – a clean funding extension with no policy changes attached. The House passed a bill last month that would keep the government operating through Nov. 21, but it has failed in the Senate eight times as Democrats use the funding cliff as leverage.

TRUMP BLUNTS GOP'S SHUTDOWN LEVERAGE WITH WELFARE AND MILITARY CARVEOUTS

Beyond the shutdown, Democrats have been using Trump's foreign policy to weaken his standing ahead of the midterm elections next year. His tariffs, in particular, have been wrapped into a broader critique that Republicans will send prices higher for consumers.

Trump and congressional Republicans made the same case successfully in November, when Democrats were swept out of power in the face of decades-high inflation.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Defending Trump's lawfare as just deserts misremembers what actually happened.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Sign up for Trump's Return, a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.

When Republicans find themselves unable to defend something Donald Trump has done, they tend to look for a way to turn the blame onto his opponents. So it is with the president's prosecutorial rampage against his enemies.

The anti-anti-Trump right has declared that, although a series of vindictive charges against the likes of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James may be regrettable, Democrats brought it on themselves.

“Two wrongs do not make a right, but Democrats did start this,” argued the conservative columnist and talk-radio host Erick Erickson. It “should be beyond dispute that the Biden-era lawfare campaign against Donald Trump was both a huge electoral failure and a disaster for American civics,” wrote the columnist Dan McLaughlin in the National Review. The Washington Post's now-right-of-center Opinion section similarly complained: “Many Democrats still cannot see how their legal aggression against Trump during his four years out of power set the stage for the dangerous revenge tour on which he is now embarked.”

Adam Serwer: Trump's politicized prosecutions may hit a roadblock

This attempt to rationalize Trump's push to lock up his enemies as payback suffers from two enormous flaws. The first involves the space-time continuum. Trump spent his first term desperately looking for ways to prosecute or otherwise harm his adversaries. He endlessly demanded that the Justice Department go after a long list of targets, including, among many others, every recent Democratic presidential nominee (John Kerry, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Joe Biden). His appointee at the IRS also subjected Comey himself, as well as Andrew McCabe, his successor at the FBI, to IRS audits.

Most of Trump's aspirations failed, but only because the Justice Department was run by officials who at least generally hewed to its norms of independence. Trump has since overcome this barrier.

The second problem with the karma theory is that it accepts at face value Trump's claim that he was a victim of lawfare. Trump was no victim of the legal system. If anything, he received preferential treatment.

Trump faced a wide array of legal travails during Biden's presidency. The case that Trump and his defenders usually fixate on is his conviction for campaign-finance violations stemming from the hush-money payment to the adult-film actor Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Many legal analysts argued that the case was legitimate but too marginal to merit prosecution. I agreed at the time that Trump's treatment in this case was harsher than what an average person might receive in similar circumstances. But the Manhattan case was not brought by “the Democrats,” or even an official appointed by the Biden administration. It was pursued by one elected local Democratic prosecutor, Alvin Bragg.

More important, in every other case where Trump faced prosecution, he benefited from notably lenient treatment by prosecutors, the courts, or both.

Trump faced two legal cases involving his attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election: a local case in Georgia and a federal case brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith. That Trump's effort to steal the election was unlawful was hardly a partisan view. When Senate Republicans voted not to convict Trump for it in his 2021 impeachment trial, then–Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested the matter should be left to the courts. If either party could be blamed for turning Trump's coup attempt into a legal concern rather than a political one, it was surely the Republicans.

Trump managed to skirt both raps, not because he did nothing wrong but because the courts allowed him to drag both cases out. The DOJ does not prosecute sitting presidents, so Trump's reelection ensured they were both dismissed.

Trump deployed this strategy to similarly wriggle out of a separate federal case involving his mishandling of classified documents. His violations could not have been clearer: He took a huge amount of classified material from the White House, stored it all in comically unsecured locations (such as a Mar-a-Lago bathroom), repeatedly lied to the government about it, and directed subordinates to lie on his behalf.

Quinta Jurecic: Trump's revenge tour

Yet a judge Trump had appointed while president simply dismissed the case on the first day of the Republican National Convention in 2024. The conservative Supreme Court, steered by three of Trump's own appointees, helped him further with an extraordinary party-line ruling granting presidents broad immunity from prosecution.

All of this makes it rather hard to argue that Trump was treated especially harshly by the legal system. A more parsimonious explanation for why Trump kept getting prosecuted, and why Republican presidents and candidates such as George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney never did, is that Trump has spent his entire career treating laws as unhelpful suggestions.

The evidence to support this is considerable, including his defiance of Justice Department orders to stop discriminating against Black tenants nearly five decades ago, his habitual refusal to pay his bills, and his penchant for grift. Before he was elected president the first time, Republicans regularly questioned his mob ties and called him a con artist.

If you were to have told party elites 10 years ago that Trump would go on to lose his first reelection bid, try to stay in office anyway, and then face a series of legal prosecutions, they would have likely figured Trump had been playing fast and loose with the law once again. They would have been right.

A picture book is a deceptively complex object: Ideally, it should be mind-expanding, psychologically astute, vividly illustrated, and—the most elusive criterion—fun. It must entertain the child without boring the grown-up to tears. And it should teach children to match sounds to meaning, pictures to objects, cause to effect, without feeling like homework. Finding picture books is easy; the market is glutted with them. The hard part is picking out just the right ones. What follows is an effort to bring clarity to the earliest years of literacy, and to help foster a child's lifelong relationship with books. We hope this selection will assist harried caregivers in sorting the wheat from the chaff, while also giving these formative works the respect and scrutiny they deserve.

Because children's books vary so much according to age, we decided to limit our scope to titles that lead up to the transition from listening to an adult's narration to reading independently: illustrated stories without long chapters, meant to be shared. We then asked authors, librarians, and other experts for suggestions and debated works among ourselves, stress-testing both classics and newer books to come up with our final list—of titles you know and those you should.

Over the course of our project, some trends emerged: 1955—peak Baby Boom—was an auspicious year for the genre (when Eloise, Miffy, and the crayon-wielding Harold were created). The 1960s and '70s brought bold colors and loopier styles to the fore. The 21st century delivered a wider array of stories—migrant journeys, portraits of grief, African and East Asian folktales. No single trait unifies the works below, but each represents a feat of artistry, voice, or complexity that we found exceptional. They are the kinds of books that will be cherished well into the future, worn from use and perhaps replaced more than once. Because of this, they felt essential.

Roofman stays grounded by highlighting life's mundane thrills.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Delinquent protagonists in true-crime stories tend to have a memorable MO: Young lovebirds might find the thrill of theft romantic, while a teenager might relish roping her friends into targeting their favorite celebrities' homes. But Jeffrey Manchester, the robber known as “Roofman,” made headlines for being unusually polite when he executed his misdeeds. After he surprised McDonald's employees by dropping in through the roof—hence his nickname—and holding them at gunpoint, he gently reminded one of them to breathe while they collected cash. Before he locked them in the walk-in refrigerator, he made sure that they had coats to wear so they'd be comfortable in the cold.

Roofman, a movie dramatizing Manchester's life, is similarly eager to please. Starring Channing Tatum as the titular crook, the film transforms the absurd tale of a criminal on the run into an intimate character study. It begins in 2004, with Jeffrey landing in prison—only to escape shortly afterward and find shelter inside a Toys “R” Us. The ensuing series of events incorporate elements of romance and melodrama with farce and action. Anxious to reunite with his estranged family, he ventures outdoors under a false identity; he ends up falling in love with a single mom, Leigh (played by Kirsten Dunst), who works at the store Jeffrey has turned into his hideout. Roofman deftly blends genres to create a low-key crowd-pleaser—one that avoids merely reveling in what made Manchester notorious in the first place.

Movies based on the lives of real people can easily turn into hagiographies, hyperbolizing their circumstances or papering over their scandals. Even an uplifting sports drama such as Rudy or a period piece such as Argo exaggerates scenes for added tension, treating its heroes like unassailable underdogs. But the writer-director Derek Cianfrance, who's best known for making Blue Valentine and other complex tragedies, doesn't excuse Jeffrey for his lawlessness. Cianfrance depicts the character evenly, as someone who can be as clever as he is careless. Jeffrey is resourceful enough to build a security system for his refuge by stringing up baby monitors throughout the store—but he also eats so much candy that he gives himself a toothache. The opportunities for big set pieces are similarly subdued. The closest thing to a car chase comes when Jeffrey drives a used sedan he purchased for Leigh's elder daughter, pushing it beyond the speed limit to impress her. Tatum, too, infuses Jeffrey with a disarming naivete that makes him compelling to watch.

The actor is especially charming in his scenes with Dunst; the two share a down-to-earth chemistry as a pair of single parents who are surprised to find themselves in a budding romance in their 40s. Their relationship fuels the plot, making Jeffrey delay his getaway and revealing what the story is actually about: the emotional toll of starting over. If Leigh likes his cover identity—he calls himself “John Zorn” and gives her an invented backstory—Jeffrey reasons that maybe he doesn't need to keep looking for a way back to his old life of heists. Would acceptance into a new family, even under false pretenses, be enough for him to abandon his past? Is quiet domesticity worth the risk?

Cianfrance uses these questions to explore the humor and suspense in mundanity—how everyday drama can become all-consuming. For Jeffrey, accessing the Toys “R” Us security cameras has become quotidian, but decorating Leigh's apartment for Christmas provides a genuine thrill. Cianfrance captures Jeffrey's misadventures inside the store as if his protagonist is trapped in a cage, underlining how tiny his fugitive life is compared with the immensity of his relationship with Leigh. Even Jeffrey's initial escape from prison is small in scale, his movements practiced, his expressions stoic. He seems much more engaged when he's studying the store employees on the baby monitors as if they're the cast of a reality show. These moments help the film feel lived-in, its sentimentality earned rather than maudlin.

Roofman isn't entirely devoid of more conventional big-screen beats. Tatum mines plenty of laughter from the sillier parts of Jeffrey's story—he almost gets caught while naked one night—and a third-act heist leads to an explosion. But what's most pleasing to watch is Jeffrey's search for companionship: The real Jeffrey Manchester will perhaps always be remembered for his odd behavior as a burglar, but Roofman is more interested in why he couldn't resist connecting with a stranger. In the film, he had the money and the means to flee much earlier. Yet, as Jeffrey puts it in an early scene while attempting to fill a sorry-looking kiddie pool for his daughter's birthday, “it's the trying that counts.”

People are sneaking answers from AI, and who can blame them?

“Interviews are NOT real anymore.” So reads the opening caption of a TikTok posted in September, punctuated by the skull-and-crossbones emoji. In the video, a young woman interviews for a job on a video call. She has a smartphone propped up against her laptop screen, so she can read off the responses that an AI app has composed for her: “Um, yeah, so, one of my key strengths is my adaptability.” She's got a point. Getting generative artificial intelligence to whisper into your ear during a job interview certainly counts as adaptable.

More clips from the same alleged job interview give the app a further showcase. “I prioritize clear communication and actively listen,” a woman says in one, as she reads from a phone instead of actively listening. Another such post, which has racked up 5.3 million views, is subtitled “My interviewer thought he caught me using Ai in our LIVE interview.” It shows the same potential boss from all the other videos asking her to share her screen and click through her browser tabs. After doing this, she resumes reading off her phone. “Little did he know,” the subtitle says.

AI-job-search anxiety has been growing for some time. In the past few years, employers started using AI to “read” and screen the thousands of résumés they may receive for each job posting; job searchers began to deluge HR departments (or at least their automated filters) with AI-generated applications; and companies began employing AI agents—fake people—to conduct their first-round interviews. Imagine eating a hearty breakfast, donning your best blazer, and discovering that you'll be judged by a robo-recruiter.

By this spring, the arms race had advanced to the point where, apparently, applicants were using AI assistants to supply them with material for computer-programming interviews on Zoom. In August, The Wall Street Journal reported that AI is “forcing the return of the in-person job interview,” and that big firms such as Cisco and McKinsey have been urging hiring managers to meet with candidates in person at least once on account of the technology.

The letter of these reports suggest a simple story of innocence and malfeasance. Some HR companies have even described the phenomenon as “interview fraud,” attributing something akin to criminal intent to the job seekers who might pursue it. But the more I investigated and considered the circumstances, the less that label seemed appropriate. Something weirder is taking place. In the context of a tightening economy, employers have turned a powerful technology against their prospective employees. Who could blame the job seekers for retaliating?

Is a lot of “interview fraud” even really happening? TikTok seems to show a rising trend; posts depict job candidates—especially young ones afflicted by a difficult, AI-degraded job market—who have started using AI to game the interviews themselves. But on closer look, many of these videos are not documenting a scandal so much as wishing one into existence—and monetizing the result. For instance, the ones described above, with the woman who had her phone propped up against her laptop, were posted by an account called @applicationintel, which displays a bio that urges viewers to download an AI app called “AiApply.”

I found many others of this kind. An AI-interview-software company called LockedIn AI posts on TikTok about how to “Crush Any Job Interview” with its tools. Kazuyoshi Fujimoto, a young professional engineer with a side hustle as a “career expert,” has a series of posts with subtitles like “My brother is interviewing for a $469k engineer job using AI.” Fujimoto answered my request to talk for this story, but stopped responding when I followed up to ask whether any of his posts were staged.

The fact that AI-interviewing services are being pushed by TikTok influencers suggests that there is money to be made from this idea, and that these products' customers are real. I wanted to see whether those customers were buying something useful. In one of his TikTok posts, Fujimoto recommends a tool he likes called Final Round AI, which “listens in real time” and “suggests killer responses.” I decided to sign up to see how it worked. (A basic subscription is free; one that allows unlimited live interviews and hides the app during screen sharing costs $96 a month.)

After opening the Final Round “Interview Copilot,” you have to tell it about the role for which you will be interviewing. By default, there are a few dozen options—and almost all of them are in software development or its orbit. I settled on “content writer” (ugh) as the closest match to what I'm doing here and started on a practice interview. I asked Final Round AI to supply me with an answer to this potential question: “If I assigned you a story on people using AI to cheat on job interviews, how would you approach that topic?”

It returned a lengthy, milquetoast answer that began, “First, I'd want to really understand the scope of the issue. How widespread is this? Are we talking about a few isolated incidents, or a growing trend? Also, I'd immediately flag the ethical considerations. This isn't just about tech; it's about fairness, integrity, and the future of work.” The entire thing was plausible in the way LLM responses often are; if an aspiring writer provided this response during a genuine interview, it wouldn't be wrong so much as uninspired. It is the sound of a person performing the role of a job candidate, rather than one actually pursuing a job. (Final Round AI did not respond to my request to discuss its software for this story.)

Reading the app's suggested interview response, and imagining myself actually delivering it with a straight face on a Zoom, brought to mind the opening scene from the 1990 film Joe Versus the Volcano, in which the title character arrives at work while his boss, Mr. Waturi, takes a phone call in the background. “I know he can get the job,” Mr. Waturi says into the handset. “But can he do the job?” Mr. Waturi repeats that sentence, varying his emphasis, over and over.



On its surface, Mr. Waturi's question is a good one: A person can carry out the rituals of employability—assembling a good résumé, performing effectively at an interview, even carrying out a satisfactory test-case work assignment—and still be unable to produce useful results in the workplace. Today's AI-interviewing tools would seem to make this problem worse: Now almost anyone can get the job, with automated help. Whether they can really do it is irrelevant. Just as students can now fake their way through school and college, what's to stop them from cutting corners on their way into Meta or McKinsey?

Read: AI cheating is getting worse

But the film also makes clear that Mr. Waturi's concern with job performance is vacuous. Joe's dreary, squalid workplace, called American Panascope, is described as “Home of the Rectal Probe.” Given this backdrop of hostility toward the firm's workers and its customers alike, Mr. Waturi's incantation, I know he can get the job, but can he do the job?, comes across as bureaucratic nonsense, an exercise in the mere appearance of high standards. Joe, the defeated salaryman, takes all this in as he hangs his coat and hat: What would it even mean to do the job when the job is so meaningless?

This question reemerges in a twisted form today, when the same companies that worry over being duped by AI-assisted applicants would love to have a workforce that makes use of AI in lots of other ways. The people who use Final Round AI to get their software-engineering jobs might be superbly qualified, in fact, to do those jobs in just the way their bosses would prefer. And if consulting is an industry that steals your watch to tell you the time (as the classic line goes), then a junior consultant who used AI to fake his way into the role might well be on the road to make partner.

For some time now, workers—and especially young ones—have become ever more detached from their work lives. David Graeber called the roles they end up taking for lack of any better option “bullshit jobs.” Internet culture has more recently nicknamed them “email jobs”: work whose purpose is so cryptic, its effort detaches from motivations and outcomes, personal or professional. The Millennials who graduated into the Great Recession talked about LARPing their own jobs in order to reconcile this divide. Cheating on a job interview with AI feels like a realization of that vision: You are no longer a job candidate, but a person playing the role of one.

But wait, isn't a junior-associate position at McKinsey or “a $469k engineer job” distinct from the sort of dead-end, bullshit job that produces so much workplace alienation? Yes and no. If you can land a role like that, certainly it may pay you well, and confer a degree of social status. But the pursuit of nearly every form of office job, even those that demand a particular credential and specific experience, has become a hellish ordeal. Candidates submit forms and résumés into LinkedIn or Workday, where they may be chewed up by AI processors and then consumed without response, or else advanced to interviews (which may also be conducted by AI). No matter who you are, the process of being considered for a job may be so terrible by now that any hidden edge in getting through it would be welcome.

Rewatching the AI-interview TikToks with new empathy for the young professionals who seek employment in today's chaotic marketplace, I noticed a pattern I had previously overlooked: a realpolitik of resigned desperation. Some presented themselves as using AI to generate bespoke résumés in response to specific job postings, an act that now seems necessary to get around the AI filters that may perform first-round culling. One young woman offered tips for using AI to prepare for job interviews: Instead of buying an app that listens in and tells you what to say, she suggested using the technology to generate sample questions that you might be asked, so you can practice answering them. She titled the video, “How to use AI to pass ANY interview.”

This language struck me as both incisive and honest. Passing is a contemporary life philosophy, one adopted by habit rather than duplicity. Ironic detachment has moved well beyond LARPing a career. Now one simply attempts, against the odds, to luck into a career, or at least the appearance of one. Today, students might use AI to write college-entrance essays so that they can get into college, where they use AI to complete assignments on their way to degrees, so they can use AI to cash out those degrees in jobs, so they can use AI to carry out the duties of those jobs. The best one can do—the best one can hope for—is to get to the successive stage of the process by whatever means necessary and, once there, to figure out a way to progress to the next one. Fake it 'til you make it has given way to Fake it 'til you fake it.

Nobody has time to question, nor the power to change, this situation. You need to pay rent, and buy slop bowls, and stumble forward into the murk of tomorrow. So you read what the computer tells you to say when asked why you are passionate about enterprise B2B SaaS sales or social-media marketing. This is not an earnest question, but a gate erected between one thing and the next. Using whatever mechanisms you can to get ahead is not ignoble; it's compulsory. If you can't even get the job, how can you pretend to do it?

Free speech is endangered; unbiased and trustworthy news is elusive. In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

Trump played a part — but there are also broader reasons why it happened now.

The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still new and fragile, but the arguments over who should get credit for it — or who should be blamed for it taking so long to achieve — are already heated.

Was recent pressure from President Donald Trump on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decisive? Or was it Trump's support for Netanyahu's resumption of the war earlier this year that mattered, because it forced Hamas to concede more?

Alternatively, has Hamas been completely willing to make a deal like this for a year or more — meaning Israel was the main holdout? Or did newly intense pressure on Hamas from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey in recent days spur the group into making new concessions?

Does the new ceasefire implicate President Joe Biden for not pushing Netanyahu hard enough? Or is the result functionally the same as the ceasefire reached in January while Biden was still in office — which would mean Israel's resumption of the war in March, with Trump's backing, wrecked that previous deal for no good reason?

All these dueling interpretations are floating around, pushed by people with different partisan, national, and ideological sympathies.

But if you look closely, there are some areas of overlap in these narratives — and some revealing discrepancies.

For two long years, intermittent ceasefire talks have failed (or have eventually fallen apart) due to the inability of Israel and Hamas to agree on the timing and substance of several issues. When would Israel withdraw troops and truly agree to end the war? When would Hamas return the hostages, and in return for which Palestinian prisoners held by Israel? What would a postwar Gaza look like — and would Hamas agree to disarm and relinquish power to others?

Netanyahu's critics claim that he was the one who repeatedly rejected or sabotaged efforts to end the war. Hamas, they argue, has long been willing to return its remaining hostages in return for Israel ending the war, but Israel kept refusing, for two long years, in favor of further attacks and immense suffering for Gazan civilians. This was, they say, at least in part because Netanyahu faced domestic pressure from his far-right coalition partners, who could remove him from power — and because he faced personal legal jeopardy if he was removed from office. According to this viewpoint, Netanyahu would only agree to end the war if a more powerful party — the United States — essentially forced him.

Netanyahu's defenders, meanwhile, have argued that the war was meant to ensure nothing like the horrors of October 7 could happen again, and therefore ultimately served Israel's best interests. Crucial to this, they have said, was removing Hamas from power and disarming the group. Unless that goal was achieved, they insisted, there could be no acceptable peace. It was Hamas that kept refusing to accept this — and only military degradation and defeat, as well as the weakening of its backers abroad (namely Iran and Hezbollah), would compel Hamas to compromise.

Though these narratives differ in emphasis, moral valence, and blame-casting, they essentially agree on the core point: that the war continued for so long primarily because Netanyahu hoped further Israeli military force in Gaza and elsewhere could push Hamas to make greater concessions or defeat them entirely. Ending the war required either Netanyahu or Hamas — or both — to shift.

And leading up to the ceasefire deal, both did shift.

Hamas agreed to release all remaining living hostages without a timeline for a full Israeli troop withdrawal, something the group had long been deeply reluctant to do. They made good on that promise: the hostages have been freed, but only after a partial Israeli troop withdrawal (Israeli forces still control about 53 percent of Gaza; further phases of the peace deal call for them to pull back further).

Netanyahu, meanwhile, agreed to the ceasefire even though Hamas has not been fully defeated — and despite his deep skepticism that Hamas will actually disarm and hand over power, as the deal stipulates. Indeed, Hamas's acceptance of the deal contained several caveats, and this week's scenes of Hamas fighters publicly executing purported collaborators in Gaza City have deepened doubts about the group's commitment to disarmament.

Multiple reports suggest that a crucial turning point in negotiations was Israel's unsuccessful attack on Hamas negotiators in Qatar last month, which seems to have shaken up the dynamic of the war.

Before then, Netanyahu had kept expanding the war with bold operations across the region, seemingly with success after success: the killing of a Hamas leader in Iran, the pager attacks and strikes against Hezbollah, and the “12-day war” against Iran this June.

But the Qatar strike signaled an end to this run of success. It failed to kill its targets, and only succeeded in absolutely infuriating Qatar, other Gulf nations — and, most importantly, Trump.

Eight months earlier, during the transition from the Biden administration, Trump played a role in crafting what turned out to be a short-lived ceasefire deal. Then, when Netanyahu abandoned the ceasefire in March, Trump backed him, giving him free rein, and even joining in on Israel's attack on Iran.

It turned out, though, that the Qatar strike went too far for Trump, given his good relations with the Gulf nations and interests (both diplomatic and financial) in the region. Rather than weaken Hamas, the attack seems to have spurred Trump to intensify his efforts to bring the war to a close.

To do so, Trump turned up the heat on Netanyahu, squeezing him both publicly and privately. A source told Axios that Trump called Netanyahu and told him the Trump peace plan was “take it or leave it” — but that “leave it means we walk away from you.”

This story makes Trump look bold and decisive. But was Trump truly prepared to walk away from support for Israel or its war, and was Netanyahu truly cowed by his threats?

An alternative interpretation is that, after two years of grueling war, Netanyahu, and his country, were ready to wrap things up. By all of those attacks — leading up to last month's Qatar strike and the renewed offensive in Gaza City — Netanyahu assured Israelis, and particularly his far-right coalition partners, that he'd waged the war as aggressively as anyone could want. He can also argue that the war was in fact a security success — in that it killed many Hamas leaders and badly weakened the group while scoring devastating blows against Hezbollah and Iran — despite the grave damage to Israel's international reputation.

Furthermore, Netanyahu's defenders argue that the new ceasefire agreement is in fact better than anything Hamas previously offered — because it gets the hostages back, while preserving Netanyahu's flexibility to restart the war if Hamas doesn't follow through on its commitments — perhaps with help from the US. (Trump threatened Tuesday that if Hamas doesn't disarm, “we will disarm them.”)

So did this happen solely because Trump twisted Netanyahu's arm, or because Netanyahu was, now, ready to have his arm twisted? We don't know for sure, but assessing that would be crucial in trying to assess whether previous tougher pressure from President Biden would have worked to end the war much earlier.

But Netanyahu wasn't the only one who shifted, of course. Hamas did too.

Hamas's negotiating strategy had long been to insist on a complete and final end to the war before returning the remaining Israeli hostages, Jeremy Scahill of Drop Site News reports. The group believed the hostages gave them important leverage over Israel and didn't want to give that leverage up.

In handing over all the hostages right away, Hamas abandoned this leverage.

Indeed, the Wall Street Journal's Jared Malsin and Summer Said report that Hamas was essentially coerced by Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey into accepting a deal the group didn't want.

Citing “officials familiar with the discussions,” the Journal reported that the three nations threatened that if Hamas didn't sign on to the peace deal, “Qatar and Turkey would no longer host the group's political leadership, and Egypt would stop pressing for Hamas to have a say in Gaza's postwar governance.”

If this report is correct, Hamas was squeezed. But they were in a position to be squeezed because the group and its allies have indeed been badly weakened by the war.

The killings of top Hamas officials and many rank-and-file soldiers (as well as a great many Gazan civilians), the decimation of Hezbollah, the collapse of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad's regime, and the Israeli strikes on Iran all sent the message that no cavalry was coming to save them — and that, if they continued to hold out, things would only get worse.

Hamas, then, agreed to relinquish the hostages, and signed onto a deal that called for its own disarmament, despite misgivings. And the world will soon find out whether that deal sticks.

The Republican justices hunt for a reason to gut America's most successful civil rights law.

Two things were obvious at Wednesday morning's Supreme Court argument in Louisiana v. Callais, a case asking the Court to abolish longstanding safeguards against racially gerrymandered legislative maps.

The first thing is that the Court will split along party lines, with all six Republicans voting to destroy the federal Voting Rights Act's (VRA) restrictions on racial gerrymandering, and all three Democrats in dissent. The other thing is that there is no consensus among the Republicans about how they should write an opinion gutting these protections.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

While all six Republican justices almost certainly walked into Wednesday's argument with a particular result in mind, they had wildly divergent theories of how to get there.

Justice Samuel Alito seemed to argue that maps that exclude Black voters are acceptable so long as they were enacted for the purpose of benefiting the Republican Party, rather than for explicitly white supremacist reasons.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh argued that the Voting Rights Act must sunset after an undetermined amount of time.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett proposed imposing a limit on Congress's power to remedy discrimination — one that the Court has applied in nonvoting cases — on election-related laws like the VRA.

But even if the Court's Republican majority cannot agree on a reason why they want to kill decades-old protections against racial gerrymanders, it's been obvious for a long time that they are eager to kill them. As a young lawyer, Chief Justice John Roberts was a central figure in a failed effort to convince President Ronald Reagan to veto an amendment to the Voting Rights Act that strengthened its protections and spawned its modern rules against gerrymandering.

Although Roberts shocked many Court-watchers when, in a 2023 case that is virtually identical to Callais, he wrote an opinion leaving the VRA's anti-gerrymandering provisions in place. Roberts claimed on Wednesday that the 2023 case “took the existing precedent as a given.” In Callais, by contrast, the Court specifically asked the parties to brief whether requiring states to draw maps that give more representation to racial minorities, as the VRA sometimes requires, violates the Constitution.

The Court, in other words, essentially asked the lawyers challenging Louisiana's current maps to directly challenge the precedents which, Roberts now claims, he previously “took as a given.”

The Republican justices, moreover, began the process of dismantling the Voting Rights Act a dozen years ago, in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), and they've handed down at least two other decisions since then that attacked this landmark civil rights law. So, in the almost certain event that Callais takes another bite out of the VRA, it will be a continuation of an ongoing Republican project.

Wednesday's argument was largely political theater. The outcome of this case was almost certainly determined long before the argument began.

The Voting Rights Act, as amended by the law Reagan signed in 1982, prohibits any state election law that “results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any US citizen to vote on account of race or color.” In Thornburg v. Gingles (1986), the Court held that this language requires states to redraw their legislative maps in a limited set of circumstances.

While the Gingles framework is complex, it primarily turns on two factors: whether a state is residentially segregated by race, and whether the state's voters are racially polarized — meaning that voters of one race tend to vote for one party and voters of another race tend to vote for another party.

When these two factors exist, they will produce two separate political communities within a state. And whichever racial group is in the majority can use its dominance of the state legislature to draw electoral district maps that cut the other racial group out of representation. Gingles held that courts sometimes must step in when this happens and require new maps that give additional representation to the minority groups.

In Callais, for example, Louisiana's Republican legislature initially drew maps that included only one (out of six) Black-majority congressional districts, despite the fact that Black people make up about 30 percent of the state's population. A lower court, applying Gingles, struck down this map, and the state responded by drawing new maps with a second Black district.

During Wednesday's arguments, the Court's Republicans made a hodgepodge of attacks on this Gingles framework. Alito, for example, appeared at odds with Gingles's holding that racially polarized voting is a problem. Louisiana, he argued, enacted its maps to protect Republicans, not to cut Black people out of representation. And partisan gerrymandering, as Alito has said in the past, is permissible.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, meanwhile, seemed to want to impose a catch-22 on racial gerrymandering plaintiffs that the Court recently rejected in the 2023 case.

The Gingles framework requires these plaintiffs to produce a sample map showing that it is possible to draw additional districts where a racial minority group is in the majority, because if it is not possible to draw such a map, then there is no point in litigating the question of whether the state must draw one. But Gorsuch seemed to argue that it is unconstitutional for courts to consider these sample maps, because the only way to draw one is to draw lines based on race.

Kavanaugh, meanwhile, proposed expanding a rule that the Court announced in Shelby County. In that case, the Court held that a central provision of the Voting Rights Act — requiring states with a history of racist election laws to “preclear” new election laws with the federal government — could not remain in effect any longer because the United States was less racist in 2013 than it was when the VRA was initially enacted in 1965.

Many of Kavanaugh's questions suggested that a similar rule must apply to the VRA's racial gerrymandering safeguards, and that those safeguards also must sunset after some time.

Finally, Barrett suggested that the Voting Rights Act may violate a standard, known as “congruence and proportionality,” that the Court first announced in City of Boerne v. Flores (1997). City of Boerne concerned the scope of Congress's power to enforce civil rights protections enshrined in the 14th Amendment. But the Voting Rights Act was enacted under Congress's power to enforce the 15th Amendment, which prohibits states from denying the right to vote “on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.”

The Supreme Court has never applied City of Boerne to a 15th Amendment case. And, in any event, it is unclear how Congress, which amended the VRA in 1982, could have complied with a test that the Court first announced in 1997.

Whichever argument the Court's Republican supermajority chooses to accept, there were no surprises in Wednesday's argument. The Court's Republicans proposed multiple, wildly divergent explanations for why they want to strike down the VRA's racial gerrymandering safeguards, but they were all rowing in the same direction. It's hard to imagine Callais ending well for voting rights plaintiffs.

The retro, cryptofascist aesthetic of all those ICE recruitment ads, explained.

President Donald Trump's ICE is newly flush with cash and straining to add more officers to its masked ranks. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement is papering social media with recruitment ads, flooding them onto local news stations in so-called sanctuary cities, talking up signing bonuses (up to $50,000 paid out over three years) and student debt repayment programs (up to $60,000). They want people to know they're looking for new faces.

ICE is not the only controversial agency that needs to recruit. The police need to recruit, corrections officers need to recruit, the military needs to recruit. But right now, ICE might be the most politically charged and disliked of all of them. And the story ICE is telling in those ads is markedly different from the story you see in contemporary military recruitment.

Military recruiting ads tend to sell you a character arc: You have unused potential, and the military will bring it out of you and transform you into a hero. You're joining the military for America, yes, but you're also joining for yourself, in a sort of intensified version of the American dream. America is a country where people have the freedom to be great, and the military will give you the tools and the discipline to truly make your greatness happen. That's why the famous Army slogan is “Be all you can be.”

ICE ads are doing something different. Here's the story ICE is telling about America and itself as it tries to sell itself to the more than 10,000 new recruits it plans to bring on before the end of the year.

Most of ICE's recruitment ads look as though someone typed “WWII aesthetic retro” into an AI image generator. They feature that ruddy '40s wartime color palette, cartoonish square-jawed men and sharp-eyebrowed women, stern Uncle Sam.

The vintage look helps these ads cultivate the nostalgic vibe they frequently turn to, alongside frequent calls to “recapture the America your forefathers created.” Sometimes, however, the implication is not just that America was great at some point in the hazy past, but that it was greatest specifically during your childhood, when your life was uncomplicated and your mother cooked your breakfast.

In one ad, ICE calls for viewers to “recapture our national identity” over a still image of a 1992 Apache helicopter flyover of a NASCAR race, a callback to the millennial childhood of the 30-somethings they're looking to recruit. Here, our “national identity” becomes not just loud machines going boom, but specifically the experience of being a '90s kid. If you join ICE, the implication goes, it will restore the purity of your childhood innocence to you.

Why has America lost its way since your childhood? And what is your role?

In the story ICE tells, you join up to be a hero, but, unlike with the military, you're not going through any kind of hero's journey. You already have the stuff. (Maybe that's why you don't get that much training?) The real story here is all about how America has changed — it's being invaded, and you, the hero, must protect her. That's why ICE's recruiting slogan is “Defend the homeland.”

“Which way, American man?” asks one caption, in what appears to be a reference to a meme, which is itself inspired by the infamous white nationalist text Which Way Western Man? While the meme is more recent, the book, which dates from 1978, claims there is a Jewish plot against Christians and argues that Adolf Hitler was right. The accompanying illustration on the ICE ad shows Uncle Sam, disheveled, staring at a series of signposts pointing toward “homeland,” “law & order,” versus “invasion,” and, most ominously, “cultural decline.”

“Cultural decline” makes it clear that ICE is not shy about telling its viewers exactly who those invaders are. It's one of those far-right buzzwords that means, more or less, that immigrants entering America with their own cultures are diluting American culture and making it less vital. The Western culture of classical Greece and Renaissance Europe, the argument goes, is one of humanity's greatest achievements, and allowing other cultures to amalgamate within it makes it weaken and decay. (Multiple cultures mixing together actually tends to lead to new artistic innovations and a more vital and interesting culture.)

For that reason, these ads are riddled with neoclassical imagery: America pictured as an Athena-like goddess, draped in Grecian robes and vowing to fight “for humanity and civilization.” Civilization here is specifically Western and specifically Christian. “Protect our sacred land,” says one ad over a bucolic image of a New England church steeple.

In one recruitment video, Micah Bock, a deputy assistant secretary at the US Department of Homeland Security, says: “We know what it means to be an American. Everyone knows what an American is.” He goes on to say that once the viewer joins ICE, “You'll block communists, terrorists, and globalists who dilute our culture and import their failed ideologies.”

“Keep criminal illegal aliens out,” says one recruitment ad over a photograph of shifty-looking brown men, one of whom is wearing a turban. “Want to help keep ‘Jihad' out of America?” asks an X post. Another post makes it clear that Latinos are an issue, too: “The American people gave us a mandate to rid our country of foreign invaders,” it says, over a photo of a joyous car full of Latino people waving flags for various Latin American countries.

ICE ads depict the agency as the home of uber-masculine, uber-competent men, for whom women are damsels to be protected and prizes to be won.

One ad pictures an ICE agent as a buff shirtless white man, grinning as he denies “communists, terrorists, and globalists” the chance to enter America. America itself is frequently embodied as a helpless woman who must be protected. Another ad shows officers in full gear surrounding a pretty girl who gazes up at them worshipfully. Finally, one ad just focuses on a big car. What could be manlier?

Perhaps ICE thinks it should be the home of all those strapping, big-car-buying Christian white men. Perhaps that's the kind of person the agency is trying to attract. Regardless, what data we have doesn't quite match up with the marketing angle.

ICE rarely releases internal demographics. However, as of 2017, roughly 20 percent of its agents were Hispanic or Latino. In 2018, women made up 45 percent of ICE's workforce. Meanwhile, with a base salary of $50,000 on the low end, it's unlikely that new recruits can afford one of those big $40,000 cars.

Trump's DHS communications office has always had a trollish, sadistic streak to its messaging. It saves its most appalling imagery for the posts it directs at migrants, warning them against entering the country, but a strong undercurrent to its ICE recruitment ads suggests that one of the perks of the job is getting to be violent and to humiliate the people you don't like.

Notably, that includes not just brown people but also liberal protesters, those uppity elitists who deserve to get taken down a peg or two. One X thread has the URL “join.ice.gov” printed over a series of photos of handcuffed activists with the caption “FAFO,” or “fuck around, find out.”

Another post, captioned, “We're having an All Night Revival,” shows a video montage of masked ICE officers locked in what looks like street combat with faceless figures, only to emerge victorious through the smoke of flash bombs, escorting handcuffed brown people into their vans. Some of them are shirtless, like the men Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had posing behind her at CECOT. Meanwhile, the ICE agents themselves are tricked out in combat gear that covers their faces. They are rendered more than human, larger-than-life action heroes.

Everyone's lost their identity here. There's nothing on the scale of the individual, only the clash of good vs. evil.

There's a remarkable defensiveness to the ICE ads, a kind of preemptory don't take it so seriously, it's just a joke. How else are you supposed to take a post, after all, that's just a picture of the Statue of Liberty with flashing red laser eyes?

The “if you get offended you fell for it” posture is one that the alt-right perfected in the years leading up to the first Trump administration, when they used ironic racism as a cover to inject neo-Nazi ideology into more mainstream corners of the internet. “The amount of humor and vulgarity confuses people,” admitted one prominent neo-Nazi. Still, he protested, “The true nature of the movement…is serious and idealistic” — the ideals in question being neo-Nazi ideals.

As the former alt-right crew infiltrates the federal government during the second Trump administration and loses the “alt” label, mainstream Republicans have begun to integrate their trolling 8chan-adjacent meme language into the right's standard aesthetic — namely, a Norman Rockwell image of classic Americana; American flags waving over a big blonde family eating an apple pie together, while an eagle flies in the distance. This imagery, always on the edge of self-parody, by now carries more than a whiff of insincere piety. It is the imagery of Ronald Reagan, of George W. Bush, of recessions and endless wars, that nevertheless still seems to promise something. It's an ambivalent aesthetic, which is why it melds so well with that giggling alt-right nihilism.

Combined, the two old aesthetics form a new one in which everything is plausibly a distasteful joke, and so at the same time, everything is serious. When they promise mass deportations: Why are you shocked? You didn't really take that literally, did you? When they perform mass deportations: Why are you shocked? Don't you remember they told you they would do it?

Enforcing the border doesn't require nullifying the Constitution.

When liberals denounce Donald Trump's authoritarianism, they often cast his immigration agenda as a case in point.

Back in June, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee decried the president's “mass deportation operations” as the “stepping stone” to his “radical attempts to seize absolute power.” In the same statement, they condemned the administration's deportation of noncriminal immigrants “as cruel,” lamenting the harms that it imposed on “law-abiding families.”

Personally, I agree with both of these indictments of Trump's policy. But it's important for Americans to understand that they can accept the first one, even if they reject the second: In other words, you don't need to share liberals' moral objections to large-scale deportation in order to accept that Trump's handling of that task is intolerably authoritarian.

For many liberals, the most morally horrifying aspect of Trump's immigration agenda is its consequences for undocumented people and their loved ones. Armed agents forcing children from their homes, breaking up families, and exiling hardworking people pursuing the American dream — all this seems needlessly cruel.

For precisely that reason, it strikes many progressives as evocative of fascism: The government appears to be tormenting a vulnerable minority population for the sake of tormenting a vulnerable minority population. Thus, from the left's vantage point, the humanitarian critique of deporting non-criminal immigrants — and the anti-authoritarian critique of Trump's approach to deporting them — can look like one and the same.

But not all Americans share these intuitions. A significant segment of voters (in some — though not all — polls, a majority) favor large-scale internal immigration enforcement. To them, liberals may sound as though we are equating “authoritarianism” with “the implementation of policies that I don't like.”

Indeed, some voters may feel that large-scale deportation efforts are the opposite of undemocratic. After all, immigration laws are the byproducts of democratic governance: Our elected representatives chose to put certain restrictions on migration. When people violate those laws, they undermine the electorate's sovereignty over an issue of public concern. From this viewpoint, deporting law-abiding immigrants may generate sad stories and ugly scenes. Yet if America were to adopt the rule, “if you make it past the border, you can stay forever, so long as you don't commit any crimes,” it would only encourage further subversion of its laws.

I think this line of thought puts too little weight on the welfare of the undocumented, the economic benefits of immigration, and America's capacity to deter unlawful inflows through border enforcement. But voters should know that they don't need to agree with liberals about all that in order to reject Trump's immigration policies.

The case for deeming those policies authoritarian does not hinge on the righteousness of cosmopolitan moral assumptions or economic theories. Rather, that case rests on the myriad ways that Trump's immigration agenda is egregiously undermining Americans' civil liberties and democratic freedoms.

Below, I will detail five reasons why even conservative voters should consider Trump's handling of immigration anti-democratic.

Even those who favor strict immigration enforcement should support immigrants' due process rights. After all, it is due process that prevents the government from deporting lawful US residents (either by mistake or design).

Yet Trump has explicitly called for ending due process in immigration cases and taken various actions consistent with that authoritarian ambition.

During his first term, he declared that the government should be able to deport undocumented immigrants “with no judges or court cases.” Since taking office a second time, the president has sought to curtail legal protections for those accused of being in the country illegally.

First, the Trump administration has expanded the use of “expedited removal” — a process that allows immigration authorities to deport the undocumented rapidly, without a full hearing. Historically, this process was used in a narrow set of circumstances: when an immigrant is intercepted near the US border without a valid visa, credible asylum claim, or proof that they have been in the US for longer than two weeks.

The idea here was that migrants who have just crossed the border do not possess the same legal protections as longtime residents. In some sense, they are still seeking admission into the country, rather than permission to remain in it. Therefore, Congress and the judiciary concluded that the government could deny such migrants a full court hearing, in the interests of administrative efficiency, particularly when border agents were overwhelmed by large inflows of asylum seekers.

But Trump has sought to authorize expedited removal throughout the United States. Under his guidance, the Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule that would empower Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to summarily deport any suspected immigrants who can't immediately prove that they've been in America for two years.

The risks of this policy to lawful US residents aren't merely theoretical. Even in the absence of such broad authorities, ICE and Customs and Border Protection have wrongfully detained or deported legal residents, including American citizens. According to a 2020 Government Accountability Office report, between 2015 and 2020, ICE arrested 674 potential US citizens, detained 121, and removed 70.

Courts have intervened to block Trump's expanded use of expedited removal, but the administration is appealing those rulings.

Meanwhile, Trump has sought to corrupt the independence of the immigration court system. Since taking office in January, 139 immigration judges have been fired, nudged from the bench with an early retirement offer, or involuntarily transferred. The purge is seemingly aimed at replacing neutral arbiters of immigration law with rubber stamps for Trump's enforcement agencies.

Finally, and most appallingly, the president has infamously deported longtime US residents — who'd been convicted of no crime — to a notorious prison in El Salvador, where inmates are reportedly subject to torture and indefinite detention. In the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the administration deported a resident unlawfully, and then claimed that it was powerless to reverse its mistake, since Garcia was now in the custody of a foreign power. The judiciary eventually forced the administration to return Garcia to the US. But his case illustrates the extremity of Trump's contempt for due process.

The president has also deployed federal troops to oversee immigration enforcement operations, in defiance of local political authorities.

This is a severe breach of liberal democratic norms. Immigration enforcement is a civil authority. And in the United States, responsibility for upholding civil laws is supposed to lie with civilian officials — not the military — except under the most extraordinary circumstances. This division of powers is codified in the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the use of armed forces for domestic policing absent explicit congressional authorization.

The administration has flouted this convention by invoking an obscure 1903 law, which authorizes the president to call up the National Guard if there is a “rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States” or if “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

Yet Trump has effectively defined such a rebellion as any public protest — even nonviolent ones — against immigration enforcement. In a June memorandum, Trump authorized the Guard's deployment to any “locations where protests against” ICE functions “are occurring or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments and planned operations.” In other words, the president asserted the authority to send the military anywhere in the US where a protest against his immigration policy is happening — or where his administration thinks a protest against its policy could happen.

The danger that this poses to democracy is straightforward. Unlike civilian police forces, the armed services operate at the president's command. If his use of the military for civilian functions isn't tightly constrained, there is a risk that he could exploit his martial authorities to insulate his regime from democratic control. Today, Trump is asserting the right to deploy troops to Democratic cities, to preempt protests he does not like. Tomorrow, he could do the same to obstruct the election of politicians he opposes.

Of course, that catastrophic outcome is far from guaranteed. But it is important to maintain institutional obstacles to it. Instead, Trump's immigration agenda is eroding them.

The president sees immigration policy as a tool for punishing speech he does not like.

This is not conjecture but a description of the administration's official policy.

Earlier this year, Trump declared, “To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,” further promising to “cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.”

This stance would be illiberal, even if the president were referring exclusively to genuine supporters of Hamas; the government should not revoke legal status from people on the basis of speech, no matter how reprehensible.

In reality, though, the administration's complaint was with any immigrant who advocated for a staunchly pro-Palestinian point of view.

In March 2024, Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish national residing in the US on a student visa, co-authored an op-ed in her university's newspaper, calling on it to divest from Israel and acknowledge the “Palestinian genocide.” This speech act put Öztürk on the radar of pro-Israel activists.

Upon taking office, Secretary of State Marco Rubio revoked Öztürk's visa. Six masked, plainclothes DHS agents proceeded to abduct her off the streets of Somerville, Massachusetts, and send her to an ICE processing facility in southern Louisiana.

The ostensible rationale for this was that Öztürk had engaged in pro-Hamas activities. But internal State Department documents, obtained by the Washington Post, revealed that the government possessed no evidence that Öztürk had ever publicly advocated for Hamas or participated in antisemitic activities.

The administration has similarly sought to revoke legal status from two lawful permanent residents — Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi — who participated in pro-Palestinian activism at Columbia University.

Federal courts have disputed the legality of all these actions, although Khalil presently faces a deportation order.

A core democratic freedom is protection from abuse by armed agents of the state. The Trump administration has undermined such liberty by insulating DHS officers from legal accountability.

It has done this through both formal and tacit means. On the first front, it has essentially shuttered the DHS's internal watchdog offices — the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman — which sought to protect detainees against abuse and unfair treatment. The latter office investigated more than 11,000 complaints in 2023.

Meanwhile, the administration has condoned the decision of many ICE agents to operate in masks and plainclothes. This policy enables abuse by making it harder for the mistreated to identify abusive officers and thus hold them to account.

The threat of ICE agents acting abusively is not hypothetical. Recently, an officer was caught on video shoving a woman to the ground inside a New York City courthouse. Initially, he was relieved of his duties pending an investigation. Then, just days later, he was reportedly reinstated after facing no discernible punishment.

Critically, all this is consistent with the president's own stated beliefs about how law enforcement officers should be allowed to operate. Speaking of his federal takeover of the DC police in August, Trump touted that, on his watch, cops would be “allowed to do whatever the hell they want.” He has also specifically said that when protesters throw rocks at ICE vehicles, the officers become entitled to “arrest these SLIMEBALLS” using “whatever means is necessary to do so.”

To this point, I've been outlining reasons why one should consider Trump's immigration policies anti-democratic, even if one regards mass deportation as legitimate.

But it's also true that any attempt to deport millions of noncriminal, undocumented immigrants is bound to impose costs on Americans' civil liberties.

The case for concentrating immigration enforcement on lawbreakers is not just humanitarian. Undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes are already known to the government and typically in its custody. As a result, DHS can remove them from the country without conducting sweeps that ensnare legal US residents.

Yet the Trump administration is committed to deporting as many of America's 14 million undocumented immigrants as they possibly can. And that has led them to embrace tactics like going door to door in a Chicago apartment building, demanding families prove their legal status in the middle of the night; storming car washes and throwing senior citizens to the ground; and fining legal immigrants for not carrying proof of their status on their person at all times.

To refrain from these tactics, and set narrower enforcement priorities, is not to nullify America's immigration statutes. The rule of law has never depended on perfect enforcement. Most crimes committed in the United States go unpunished, including nearly half of murders. We should obviously try to change that. But the only way to push the rate of unpunished criminality to anywhere near 0 percent would be to embrace gross violations of civil liberties: The government would need to surveil more or less all citizens more or less all of the time.

Most Americans would regard such enforcement as authoritarian. And so we instead accept that the police will prioritize the prevention and punishment of certain crimes, while acquiescing to a great deal of uncensured lawbreaking. Immigration enforcement entails similar trade-offs.

That doesn't mean that any enforcement regime broader than Joe Biden's is fascism. But I would encourage those unmoved by humanitarian objections to mass deportation to consider the inherent, civil libertarian costs of such a policy.

In any event, reasonable people can disagree about exactly how the government should balance the objectives of enforcing borders and honoring civil liberties. What should be beyond dispute, however, is that eroding Americans' most basic constitutional rights is never legitimate. And Trump's immigration agenda does precisely that.

Why A House of Dynamite is so damn scary.

There's no shortage of things that could end the world. But between climate change, risks from AI, and biological threats like pandemics, we seem to be forgetting about one human-made existential risk that has been with us for 80 years: the ever-present possibility of nuclear warfare.

But nuclear war hasn't forgotten about us.

“Because of extraordinary luck over 80 years, despite many close calls and near-misses, there hasn't been a detonation of nuclear weapons,” Elise Rowan, the deputy vice president of communications at the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), told me over email. “Every concern that is top of mind for Americans right now…could be eclipsed by a snap decision under pressure or even an accident.”

Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

That makes the new film A House of Dynamite the perfect movie for the moment.

Directed by Kathryn Bigelow for Netflix — out in select theaters now, and streaming on the service beginning October 24 — the film is divided into three acts that follow government workers, military officials, and finally the president himself (played by Idris Elba) in the roughly 18 minutes that pass between the detection of a nuclear missile launch over the Pacific and its arrival in Chicago.

The day starts like any other. Coworkers flirt and bicker. They make small talk about sports, kids, and snacking habits. A senior officer (Rebecca Ferguson) in the White House Situation Room, which provides 24/7 intelligence updates and decision support to US national security officials, chides a colleague for waiting until that night to propose marriage to his longtime girlfriend. Everything is normal until it isn't.

Even then, it takes minutes for the tension to mount, for the unthinkable to become thinkable. Soldiers in a remote Alaska base initially think it's a North Korean missile test that will land harmlessly in the Pacific.

After all, a real nuclear attack would probably involve hundreds of missiles, including decoys. That's how the Soviet air force officer Stanislov Petrov realized that the five American nuclear missiles heading toward the Soviet Union in 1983 were actually a false alarm caused by malfunctioning early-warning satellites. Petrov's good judgment — he decided not to report the finding up the military chain, which would have led to retaliation per Soviet doctrine — is how we avoided all-out nuclear war by way of Soviet retaliation.

Someone in the film naturally mentions the Petrov case. The US launches its anti-missile defense system from that base in Alaska. It's like hitting a bullet with a bullet, one character explains. “This is going to be the second-most exciting thing that happens today,” the senior officer in the Situation Room reassures the colleague planning to propose to his girlfriend.

But the interceptor fails to destroy the missile, which remains inbound for Chicago and its metro population of 10 million people. It's only after the fact that top officials learn that the defense systems charged with keeping the homeland safe from just such a strike have just a 61 percent chance of success. In real life, it's around a 55 percent success rate — and that's under controlled conditions.

“So it's a fucking coin toss?” the defense secretary (Jared Harris) exclaims. “That's what $50 billion buys us?”

That's plan A. And when it fails, there's no plan B.

What this shows, Rowan told me, is that the nuclear defense system “demands perfection from people and machines 100 percent of the time. And that's just not realistic.”

(Disclosure: I worked at NTI for two years on the Global Biological Policy and Programs team. I learned a lot about nuclear risks through osmosis, but my focus was on pandemic prevention, bioweapons deterrence, and biotechnology governance. I did not work on “nuclear pandemics,” as my uncle once asked me.)

Back to the movie. With the minutes ticking down, the military chief of the US Strategic Command advocates for a preemptive counterstrike, even though the US doesn't know who fired the missile or why, and even though doing so would mean the 10 million Americans who will die in the Chicago strike will only be the first to perish.

But it almost certainly wouldn't end there. Further retaliations could lead to the death of billions, perhaps spark nuclear winter, and potentially spell humanity's end.

What comes across in A House of Dynamite is that no one, in this most important moment in history, seems to be in control.

While it's impossible not to watch the film without nauseously picturing Donald Trump, who has the sole power to order a nuclear attack as the president, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in charge, it may not make a difference.

The experts, the president, the “other side” as far as we can tell from a brief conversation with the Russian foreign minister — everyone seems basically at a loss. It's not a matter of skill or nerve; nearly everyone does their job as best they can.

In the end, we never even learn who fired the missile. North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran are floated as possibilities. The movie doesn't tell us if the launch was a purposeful attack or an accident, an isolated incident or part of a coordinated campaign. I don't see my childhood home in the Chicago suburbs get vaporized. It's even possible that the missile doesn't detonate at all — that can happen. But even if it doesn't destroy the Chicagoland area, causing millions of deaths, the US might still respond preemptively, leading to an all-out nuclear war all the same.

The ambiguity, while narratively frustrating, is the point. It's not possible for us to know all of this in just the 18 minutes the intercontinental ballistic missile allows, just as it's not possible for the president to make a meaningfully informed decision on how to respond in that time. When presented with a menu of escalating retaliation options — “rare, medium, and well-done,” someone quips darkly — the president says he's ready to give the order. We don't see the results.

The film highlights how our approach to nuclear risks has changed since the Cold War. Things were simpler in those “us versus them” Cold War days, if not any less dangerous. But the world has since gotten multipolar. There are (at least) nine nuclear powers to keep track of, and emerging technologies like AI enhance the risks.

“I hope this film gets a new generation interested and engaged in nuclear issues,” Heather Williams, the director of the Project on Nuclear Issues at the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), told me by email. “There are still thousands of nuclear weapons in the world and some countries are still engaging in nuclear saber-rattling — the threat hasn't gone away.”

It's not all doom and gloom, though: In 1986, there were 70,000 nuclear weapons. There are 12,000 today — an 80 percent reduction of the world's total nukes. But for the first time in 40 years, that number is expected to increase. More countries want to add nukes to their arsenals, and the last verifiable limits on nuclear weapons in Russia and the US are going to expire in February.

So things are heading in the wrong direction. “We need the same level of public outcry that led to reductions and [nuclear weapon] verification measures that have made the world safer,” Rowan said. “People have power on this issue — they just have to reclaim it.”

The argument for having nukes is that they may deter conventional warfare as devastating as World War II. But you can't have deterrence in a world wiped out by nuclear apocalypse.

With support from the European Union, Valeria Zavaleta is helping to shape the digital future of El Salvador and opening doors for other young people

Based in San Salvador, Valeria Zavaleta is a digital artist who brings imaginary worlds to life. She uses a combination of 3D design, animation, and artificial intelligence to build digital experiences, and in doing so, she is opening doors for other young Salvadorans to follow in her footsteps.

Many young people in El Salvador face challenges to access work. According to the International Labour Organization, over 23% of young people in El Salvador are currently not in education, employment, or training. Digital skills and access to technology has also held young people back.

But that is changing, thanks to growing access to technology, connectivity and new opportunities.

Through initiatives like the Ilamatepec Project, the European Union is partnering with local organizations to invest in digital inclusion, education, and youth job creation across El Salvador. The project is part of the European Union's broader Global Gateway strategy, which aims to build strong, win-win partnerships with countries around the world. In El Salvador, that means helping young people with the skills and mentorship needed to compete in a global digital economy.

For Valeria, these efforts helped unlock new opportunities to share her work internationally and mentor the next generation of artists in her community. She's part of a growing movement of young Salvadorans who are transforming their futures through technology and art. With the European Union's support, that movement is gaining momentum.

Kim Dhatt, a 34-year-old recruitment specialist, was in a relationship with her ex-partner for four years. When they first got together, he earned slightly more than she did, and the difference didn't bother either of them. After a series of promotions over 18 months, her salary tripled — and then he couldn't deal, Dhatt says.

Her partner's self-worth was tied directly to his income, and it eroded as her salary grew, Dhatt tells me. He insisted on splitting costs 50-50, leaving her with a disposable income that she wanted to spend on nice things but felt like she couldn't. When she proposed booking a luxury vacation for the two of them, for example, he insisted they go on a cheaper trip and divide the cost. She felt like she was compromising. They argued often, and resentment curdled.

Dhatt's financial success soon exposed a tension that many couples face today: What happens when she earns more than him?

""I'd worked hard to achieve my income level, and I was not reaping the benefits of it,"" Dhatt says. ""When our relationship finally ended, he told me as he left that I have nothing to worry about because of my salary,"" she adds, which to her revealed how money was ""a bigger factor"" in their relationship than he'd previously admitted.

Divorce rates in heterosexual couples rise significantly when a woman is more professionally successful than the man, be that in terms of fame or, more commonly, money. Perhaps even more strikingly, studies also show that the marriages most likely to endure are those that most closely fit the traditional pattern of male breadwinner and female homemaker. A 2023 report from the Institute for Family Studies found that couples in which husbands earn more than their wives have the lowest chance of divorce, and that when a man earns upwards of $38,000-a-year more than his wife, the chances of divorce are lowest. The wider the traditional wage gap, it would seem, the stronger the marriage.

Despite recent leaps in progress toward gender equality both in the home and in the workplace, marital inequality might be the last vexing barrier to our ongoing quest for true gender parity.

No doubt one of today's highest profile wage-gap relationships with a female breadwinner is Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. The pop megastar's estimated net worth, about $1.6 billion, is about 30 times the NFL tight end's estimated $52 million.

When the pair announced their engagement in August, Lyz Lenz, a New York Times bestselling author of a memoir about her own divorce, cut through the internet's euphoria by offering some sobering stats and reflections on her own experience.

""The image they are projecting to us is that a successful woman has found a supportive partner, one who eagerly fawns over her new album cover while interviewing her for his own podcast,"" she wrote on her Substack. ""This reality is far from reality for most American women.""

Lenz noted that women who succeed as Swift has ""are often punished for it"" and that she herself has been forced to pay the price of being professionally and economically ambitious. ""Every time I succeed, there's a downside. The hate mail gets worse. The man I am dating backs away. A tabloid publishes a scathing story about me,"" she writes. ""I'm so, so tired.""

The data corroborates the vibe. A 2013 University of Chicago study of 4,000 married couples in the US found that as soon as a woman out-earns her husband, both are 6% less likely to report a ""very happy"" marriage. They're also 8% more likely to report marital troubles and 6 percent more likely to discuss separating. A Swedish study from 2016 found that a married woman is twice as likely as a man to be divorced three years after being promoted to CEO. A similar pattern follows in the public sector: Women who are elected to positions like mayor or parliamentarian double the chances of their marriages falling apart.

There are darker findings too. A 2023 study from Australia, for example, found that women who earn more than their male partners are also significantly more likely to be physically and emotionally abused by that partner. ""When women's income exceeds that of their partners,"" the authors write, ""the violation of a gender norm creates a strong negative effect.""

Scant research is available on the correlation between divorce rates and income inequality in same-sex marriages, but one paper from 2014 found that in those couples bigger earnings gaps also translate to a higher likelihood of a break-up.

More than a dozen women I spoke to for this story told me that money significantly shaped their relationship or marriage. Many men told me the same. And of the women who earned more than their male spouses, the majority said that this had a detrimental impact on their relationship. Several said that it was ""the elephant in the room"" — something that complicated their relationship but that their male partners didn't want to talk about explicitly.

Sukhy Desangh, a 41-year old management consultant, tells me she was earning more than five times what her ex-fiancé earned. ""I realized I was just bank-rolling him,"" she says. He was humiliated by her being the primary earner in their household, she says. ""When we were out for dinner with friends and family, he would message me to say, 'Give me your credit card and I'll pay with it.'""

Several other women said that their partners felt ""emasculated"" by being out-earned. Two women who asked not to be named said that they felt like their ex-husbands became depressed as a result of not being the primary financial provider. The depression, the women said, turned to bitterness and anger, and ultimately led to the breakdown of the marriages.

""Money wasn't the only reason me and my ex broke up,"" says Ali, a 34-year old who works in financial services, ""but it was a topic of conversation and there were many times he said he wouldn't be able to be with someone long-term who earns more than him. And I was making significantly more than him.""

Why have marriages not caught up to the reality of the labor market? Women now hold more managerial positions than ever, and they bring home the bulk of household income in more families than ever. The US gender pay gap, while still stuck at about 82 cents on the dollar, is close to the narrowest it's ever been. What is holding marriages back?

Dené Logan, a marriage and family therapist based in Los Angeles, says that for one, gender norms are set in childhood. ""Men are handed a very specific template early in life: protect, provide, procreate — and their worth is tied to it,"" she says. With that mindset deeply ingrained, Logan adds, when a woman in a heterosexual marriage is financially and professionally successful, it can ""trigger resentment"" within the man — whether he knows it or not.

Because of these long-standing constructs, men's sense of mission and meaning is still frequently tied up in work and money. ""And without a sense of mission or meaning, many men can feel diminished and even threatened,"" Logan says.

Muriel Wilkins, an executive coach and CEO of a leadership advisory firm, agrees. ""What's really happening here is a clash between progress and old expectations,"" she says. ""Beliefs don't change as fast as paychecks do.""

""Cultural norms are very sticky,"" says Ramit Sethi, a bestselling author and podcast host. ""We see stickiness,"" he says, in the ""amount of time spent on household chores, emotional labor, and money in relationships."" For example, he notes, even though women in urban cities out-earn men in their 20s, dating norms about who picks up the check have been glacially slow to change.

Many of the women I spoke to also said that fault lines in marriages and relationships that were initially caused by money were exacerbated by the fact that men who weren't getting paid as much were also not shouldering as much of the unpaid labor in the home. A Pew study from 2023 found that women in the US still consistently pick up more household chores and caregiving responsibilities. That's true in marriages in which the man outearns the woman, but also in those in which both spouses earn roughly the same amount, and even when the wife is the primary earner. The only marriages in which husbands devoted more time to caregiving than their wives were those in which the wife was the sole household earner. In those situations, wives and husbands spent roughly the same amount of time per week on household chores.

""It felt like a double whammy,"" one woman says of her husband, who was laid off shortly after they got married. ""He wasn't working, which made him angry and resentful, but then he refused to do almost anything around the house while I was earning for the both of us. And that made me angry and resentful,"" she says. ""If that's not a recipe for disaster, then I don't know what is.""

There are, of course, exceptions to the female breadwinner trend.

Brian Tan and his wife, who live in New York, have been married for two years and in a relationship for eight. They started their careers earning the same salary at the same financial services firm. After that, he switched employers and took a job which paid about double her salary. But since then, he's started working for a children's hospital and she's moved into tech. She now earns between 70 and 80% more than him, Tan says, and it's not an issue in their marriage.

He says there are several reasons her outearning him doesn't bother him. ""The first is that I view it as one big pool of money. The second is that this is a pendulum that swings both ways — there was a period where I made more, then we made the same amount, then she makes more now,"" says Tan. ""A third reason is that I'm truly proud of her, and to be genuinely proud of someone, all feelings of jealousy disappear from one's mindset; I want her to feel fulfilled and intellectually stimulated, and the fact that she gets paid a lot while doing her job is a win-win for me.""

One woman based in the UK who asked not to be named tells me that she has four sisters. ""We all earn more than our husbands — all six figures,"" she says. ""Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but we are all married."" The key to success, she said, is being open and communicating, especially when conflicts arise.

Natasha, a 37-year old marketing executive, says that her family is very traditional in terms of gender norms. By earning double what her husband earns, she sometimes feels like she's simultaneously living both outside of traditional gender norms and inside of them — ""a sort of double existence that can feel stressful,"" she says. But crucially, she's been happily married to her husband for seven years — they just had a baby. The pay differential doesn't bother him, she says. ""I think that's evidence of his maturity and confidence.""

Another woman told me that when she first met the man who became her husband, she was earning ""a thousand times"" more than him. They've now been together for a decade, and she's still earning about 40 percent more than him. ""It's never ever been a problem,"" she said. And he agrees: ""Unless it's a problem for my wife, I'm secure enough in myself and in our relationship for it to not even be a consideration.""

William Conrad and his girlfriend Levi Coralynn, who are both in their 20s, have garnered an enormous social media following — he has about 1.3 million TikTok followers, she about 2.3 million— for publicly and performatively living out an atypical heterosexual relationship. Coralynn, a content creator, is the primary earner, while Conrad seemingly takes care of the bulk of the domestic work.

Muriel Wilkins said that she does think things will eventually change, especially as Gen Zers like Conrad and Coralynn are questioning and pushing back against outdated norms. But it will take time, she said, and progress will only materialize if individual couples are prepared to confront these outdated norms head-on.

""Couples have to talk openly about expectations — who does what, what success means, what partnership really looks like — rather than just falling back on the old scripts,"" she says. ""They need to redefine what success looks like in their marriage. Together, they can stop asking, 'Who's the breadwinner?' and start asking, 'How do we win together?'""

Dené Logan put it more bluntly: ""Your husband is not the patriarchy."" In other words, frustration over inequality in marriage often has roots beyond the individual relationship. And recognizing that distinction is key to avoiding misplaced resentment.

Progress won't come from paychecks alone. It will come, says Wilkins, ""when we stop treating money as the measure of power in a marriage, and start seeing partnership as a balance of respect, care, and shared responsibility."" Equality doesn't necessarily mean sameness, says Logan, it means rewriting the story of marriage for a new era.

In August, Harvey said it would give six law schools access to the platform as part of a new ""alliance."" The next month, it onboarded 11 more law schools. Now, Harvey has added Duke Law and Northwestern Pritzker Law to the roster, the company tells Business Insider. Participation in the program is available to the law schools free of charge.

""What we're trying to do is make it so they can start integrating that into their training as early as possible,"" Winston Weinberg, Harvey's cofounder and chief executive, said from a conference room in the company's Manhattan office.

He imagines a not-so-distant future where a private-equity class conducts a mock leveraged buyout inside Harvey; students draft and refine arguments with its tools before a moot court. The simulations he describes aren't live yet.

Harvey's program borrows from the ""Wexis"" playbook. For decades, LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters, which both supply case law to legal professionals, blanketed law schools with free or nearly free access. Students spend years getting fluent in one system and then carry that muscle memory into practice.

Harvey is betting that prompting and directing virtual agents will be the next habits that stick.

Inside firms, Weinberg says Harvey is stripping the drudgery from legal work, and clients are starting to notice. Faster is becoming the expectation. He compares it to the advent of email. ""The biggest change it made,"" he said, is that ""you've got to respond way faster.""

That's the incentive problem at the heart of legal tech: many lawyers are paid by the hour, and saving time can result in a loss of revenue. Weinberg thinks that Harvey's efficiency gains will prompt firms to move more work off the billable hour and onto flat-fee menus to protect their profits. The price of services depends on the specific legal matter, and doesn't decrease even as labor costs fall.

Weinberg said law firms could also pass along the cost of using Harvey and other tools to their clients, a familiar move in the legal world. Many firms already include a line item on their invoices for research databases, such as LexisNexis or Westlaw, showing how many queries a matter requires. Asked if Harvey might one day appear the same way, Weinberg said the company is ""exploring that right now.""

The caveat is that uptake today skews towards the big corporates and law firms, and even there, Harvey is still seen as an efficiency booster, not a requirement for practice.

Law schools aren't entirely analog. They've long run on enterprise tools like Lexis and Westlaw. Where they diverge is on policies around generative artificial intelligence. Some prohibit it. Others allow it with disclosure. A few are weaving it into clinics and practice labs.

Notably, the list of Harvey's launch partners was missing a few giants, Yale and Harvard among them. Company lore says the name ""Harvey"" is partly a nod to Harvard.

Asked what he would change about legal education if he were rewriting the first-year curriculum today, Weinberg, a trained lawyer who graduated from the USC Gould School of Law, said his answer would have been the same, even before the arrival of ChatGPT. He argues law schools can do far more to prepare students for the realities of practice.

He has no quarrel with the traditional first-year curriculum. ""I think where things actually break down,"" he said, ""is that there is almost no hands-on stuff in the second and third year."" Summer jobs help. But, in his view, a three-year legal education should more closely resemble the workplace.

Harvey aims to help fix that, though its law school partnership remains light on details. To land on campus, it has to navigate a live debate inside faculties, where purists who want to prohibit the tech to protect core skills are squaring off against pragmatists who want supervised use.

If Harvey can get a foothold in law schools now, the payoff could arrive when today's second-year lawyers become tomorrow's associates and in-house counsel.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nian Yang-yi, 34, a barista turned quality control specialist at a coffee trading firm in Taiwan. The following has been translated and edited for length and clarity.

I chose to study computer science and information engineering in college because I didn't like interacting with people.

Programming seemed perfect: I could spend all day on a computer, coding and debugging. At the time, I was happy with this choice and imagined my future would follow that path.

But life is unexpected. In my third year of college, I had a sports accident that caused a retinal detachment. I went through surgery, and afterward, the doctor told me to rest and not overuse my eyes.

If I became an engineer right away, the pressure on my eyes would be even greater. So my plan was simple: work somewhere else for two or three years, let my eyes recover, and then return to writing code.

That's how I ended up at a café. At first, I didn't drink coffee at all, and I didn't like it. But my boss and coworkers encouraged me to try it. They brewed me a cup every day.

At first, I refused, but eventually I tried a cup — and something clicked. It felt like coding: Could I make this more precise, more efficient? Could I describe what I tasted so others could understand?

So, I started studying sensory skills and how to communicate flavors. That was how I became absorbed in coffee.

I worked as a barista at that café for 10 years.

Outside of work, I was still involved in coffee — going to tastings, events, and classes.

At first, I thought coffee was straightforward — as long as I could brew drinks that customers enjoyed and my coworkers liked, it felt like I had already learned everything there was to learn.

But once I started going out and experiencing more, I realized coffee is something you can never fully master. People often say the more you study a subject, the more you realize how little you understand — and that was exactly how I felt about coffee.

It was partly why I left the café to join a coffee trading firm. I had met the boss in a coffee course, and he asked years later if I wanted to try working there.

I felt I had to do it because coffee is not just about making drinks. It is a whole supply chain — farmers, importers, roasters — and I wanted to learn more.

I'm now in my third year as a quality control specialist.

In the café, my skills were in brewing and serving customers. But upstream, the needs are different: evaluating beans, checking consistency, and thinking about market demand.

When I moved, my salary dropped from nearly 50,000 Taiwan dollars a month, about $1,600, to about 35,000 Taiwan dollars. Now, I earn about 42,000 Taiwan dollars.

This job has broadened my perspective on the coffee supply chain. In my fourth month, I earned the internationally recognized Arabica Q Grader certification.

Coffee changed me as a person. I used to avoid human interaction, but being a barista meant I had to understand customers, chat, and connect with them.

At first, it was a big challenge. Conversations often dropped awkwardly. But over time, I developed ways to interact more comfortably, learned to listen, and sense how people were feeling.

In 2022, I started volunteering at a community café for Believe in Next Generation, a nonprofit, where I regularly serve as a barista when the café offers coffee for a donation.

The nonprofit is located in a military village, and some elderly residents would come early, wait for me, and smile when I arrived. They didn't directly say they needed companionship, but I could feel it.

Sometimes, they stayed in the café and told me their life stories and memories, many from Taiwan's martial law years or the Japanese colonial era.

This is one of coffee's meanings: It gives people a chance to gather and share their stories.

Some of my engineering friends have told me they envy me for turning my interest into a job — until the topic of salary comes up, because their salaries can be two to three times mine.

I have wondered whether I should continue doing what I want to do or return to a more practical job.

At this stage of life — from your twenties into your early thirties — many people are buying cars and houses. But coffee is the industry that makes me feel the happiest and most at ease.

Now, I live with my parents in New Taipei City and share a mortgage with my sister for our family home. I pay about 15,000 Taiwan dollars a month toward it.

To manage, I spend less on recreation, like traveling once every three or four years. Since coffee is also my hobby, most of my discretionary spending goes to coffee courses or activities.

I can usually save 10,000 to 15,000 Taiwan dollars a month.

I also look for ways to increase my income through side hustles, such as judging coffee competitions and teaching courses. These can add about 5% to 10% to my monthly income.

Some people choose high-paying jobs and use their salaries to fund hobbies. Others, like me, turned their passion into work, even with less money.

The first step is to imagine the kind of life you want, and then decide if your passion is strong enough to carry you there.

If I could start over, my choice probably wouldn't change — it would still be coffee.

Former Ford CEO Mark Fields said on Tuesday that US automakers overestimated consumer demand when they started ramping up production of electric vehicles.

""Over the last couple of years, the automakers really went full bore in putting in capacity for EVs,"" Fields, 64, told CNBC's ""Power Lunch.""

""They really didn't have a good discussion on the consumer, in terms of what it was going to take to get the consumer to buy these EV products,"" Fields said.

Representatives for Fields did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Fields started his career at Ford in 1989 after graduating with an MBA from Harvard Business School. He held a variety of senior leadership positions at Ford, and was the company's chief operating officer from 2012 to 2014 and its CEO from 2014 to 2017.

Some of the big bets automakers made on EVs have come undone ""over the last 18 months or so,"" Fields told CNBC.

General Motors said in an exchange filing on Tuesday that it was taking a $1.6 billion charge ""based on a planned strategic realignment of our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint to consumer demand.""

The company said it expected the ""adoption rate of EVs to slow"" after the Trump administration eliminated federal EV incentives.

Under the Biden administration, EV buyers were entitled to a $7,500 consumer tax credit if they bought a new EV and a $4,000 consumer tax credit for a used EV. Both schemes expired on September 30.

""This is clearly an issue where the market didn't develop the way automakers thought. A lot of them, particularly in GM's case, boasted that they had the full lineup of EVs,"" Fields said on Tuesday.

""And what was an advantage, at least they thought at the time, has now probably turned into a bit of an albatross as the market take-up of EVs is going to be lower, at least in the near to medium term, than they plan for,"" he continued.

Auto chiefs have expressed mixed views on whether the rollback of federal EV incentives would hurt the US EV market.

Ford's current CEO, Jim Farley, said last month that the expiry of federal EV incentives could halve US EV sales.

""I think it's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought,"" Farley said on September 30.

Former Tesla president Jon McNeill, however, thought otherwise. McNeill said in an interview with CNBC on October 2 that the market can continue to ""grow without subsidies.""

""In Europe, France and Germany in particular rolled subsidies off a couple of years ago, and what happened after that, surprisingly, was the market continued to grow,"" McNeill said.

""That's largely because the models continue to roll out from other OEMs, much like they have here,"" McNeill added, using the acronym for original equipment manufacturers.

As South Korea's beauty giant Olive Young gears up to land on US shores, American retailers are jostling for a share of the K-beauty pie.

US beauty retailers like Sephora and Ulta Beauty are snapping up South Korean beauty brands and inking exclusive sales partnerships to capitalize on the K-beauty trend.

Skincare brand Hanyul announced in May that it was exclusively launching in the US via Sephora. Aestura, a sensitive skincare brand, said the same in February.

And Ulta Beauty is the only major US retailer selling products from Medicube, a beauty tech company whose skincare devices have been touted by celebrities like Kylie Jenner and Hailey Bieber.

This turf war over K-beauty in the US is unfolding before Olive Young, South Korea's answer to Ulta Beauty, makes its much-awaited US debut in 2026. The retailer, which has over 1,300 stores in South Korea, is known for stocking top-ranking K-beauty brands and focusing on trendy and affordable products.

K-beauty, known for its innovative formulations, gentle ingredients, and multi-step routines, means big money. According to data from marketing research firm NielsenIQ, it was a $2 billion industry in the US in the year leading up to July 2025 — up 37% from the same period the year before.

Sephora stocks many big-name Korean brands, such as Beauty of Joseon, Dr. Jart+, Laneige, Aestura, Hanyul, and others.

Ulta Beauty execs said on an earnings call in August that the company is expanding its K-beauty assortment, with new additions like Anua and Peach & Lily joining its existing portfolio of Korean brands like Medicube, Belif, COSRX, and others.

Ashley Kang, the global beauty director of Chicago-based market research company Worldpanel, said K-beauty is still a niche product category. Its core audience consists of Asian consumers and younger demographics, ranging from Gen Alpha to millennials.

""Until the rise of K-culture, Asian beauty outside of Japan had little global recognition,"" Kang said. ""The growing influence of Korean pop culture and dramas allowed people to see the flawless skin of Korean celebrities, building trust and belief in K-beauty products.""

K-beauty differs from clean skincare brands from the US, like Hailey Bieber's Rhode, in several ways.

Larissa Jensen, the global beauty industry advisor of Chicago-based market research firm Circana, said brands like Rhode home in on ethical ingredient sourcing. In contrast, K-beauty brands have carved out a niche in preventive care and long-term skin health.

Anna Keller, a principal analyst from London-based market research firm Mintel, told Business Insider that K-beauty has a price advantage over US brands.

""They're super affordable, so you're getting high-quality, effective products without breaking the bank,"" Keller said.

Sephora and Ulta Beauty are choosing K-beauty brands that have already proven themselves to US consumers, she said. These brands, like Beauty of Joseon and Medicube, have been popular on online platforms like Amazon.

""A lot of this success comes from social media buzz — think TikTok trends like 'glass skin' and the hype around ingredients like snail mucin,"" Keller said. ""Sephora and Ulta are essentially riding the wave of this existing demand, bringing in brands that are already popular and have a strong following in the US.""

With US retailers snapping up K-beauty brands before Olive Young's debut next year, the Korean company is set to enter a competitive landscape.

""Unlike Sephora and Ulta, which focus on a handful of big-name brands, Olive Young is more about discovery,"" Keller said. ""They're known for curating a mix of well-known and up-and-coming Korean brands, which makes them a go-to for people who want to explore beyond the mainstream.""

Kang from Worldpanel said Olive Young needs to ""position itself as a K-beauty specialist, ensuring that its competition does not directly overlap with Sephora or Ulta.""

She said that the retailer can take advantage of the tariff turmoil. Olive Young can provide US consumers easy access to a broad range of K-beauty brands now that there are fewer ways to obtain them.

Kang said that K-beauty is a trend that is set to get even stronger in the US market.

She added, ""This trend is not limited to skincare — it is expected to extend into hair care, makeup, fragrance, beauty devices, and beyond.""

In a world glued to screens, Aziz Ansari is choosing the analog life.

During an appearance on Tuesday's episode of the ""Good Hang with Amy Poehler"" podcast, the comedian spoke about his Luddite ways and why he isn't a fan of ChatGPT.

""I don't have email. I haven't had email for, like, 10 years. But I have an assistant,"" Ansari told podcast host Amy Poehler.

And it's not just his inbox that he's abandoned.

""I have a flip phone. If I get really lost, I've got to either ask people or just call my wife and be like 'Hey.' I've had to do that before, like, call my wife, and to the point where she's kind of used to it,"" Ansari said.

Instead of using an app to call for an Uber, Ansari says he hails a taxi. If there isn't one, he'll call, he added.

Living a low-tech lifestyle has its benefits, Ansari said.

""It just gives me more space to think. I mean, I heard something about, like, Tarantino doesn't even have a phone. Chris Nolan doesn't have a phone. I was like, 'Whoa, those guys are able to get a lot of stuff done. Maybe there's something to it,'"" he said.

The comedian says he is also wary of ChatGPT.

""It's outsourcing critical thinking. It's making everyone's opinions kind of the same,"" Ansari said.

Not only is AI prone to making mistakes, it reinforces what people already think, he added.

The comedian said he once saw a commercial in which someone asked ChatGPT how to make dinner for a date.

""I would rather call someone and ask someone, or maybe have some sort of conversation, a human thing. It just seems like it's like outsourcing thinking, and it's like killing some bit of humanity,"" Ansari said.

Speaking to People in September, Ansari said he knows that his ability to live offline comes with a certain level of privilege and isn't realistic for everyone.

""But for me, it helps me keep a clear head to help me write and do what's more important for my job,"" he said.

A representative for Ansari did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.

Ansari isn't the only celebrity who has spoken about preferring an analog lifestyle.

In July 2023, Christopher Nolan said he doesn't carry a smartphone or use email. The filmmaker said he writes scripts on a computer without the internet.

""If I'm generating my material and writing my own scripts, being on a smartphone all day wouldn't be very useful for me,"" Nolan told The Hollywood Reporter.

Dolly Parton said during an October 2023 appearance on ""The View"" that she still prefers communicating via fax because otherwise, she'd be overwhelmed by all the messages she gets.

""So I never did get into getting involved in all that because it'll take up too much of my time if I talked to everybody who is trying to get in touch with me,"" Parton said.

In January, Christopher Walken told The Wall Street Journal that his relationship with technology is nearly nonexistent.

""I only have a satellite dish on my house. So I've seen 'Severance' on DVDs that they're good enough to send me. I don't have a cellphone. I've never emailed or, what do you call it, Twittered,"" Walken said.

It's not just Hollywood: In a May story, regular people told Business Insider that they swapped smartphones for dumb phones to wean themselves off their screens and social media.

Some Gen Zs are even chaining their smartphones to a wall — creating a makeshift landline —and freeing themselves from the urge to scroll.

Six AI startups are part of Jensen Huang's vision for human-digital workforces.

""Future workforces in enterprise will be a combination of humans and digital humans. Some of them will be OpenAI-based, and some of it would be Harvey-based or Open Evidence or Cursor or Replit or Lovable,"" the Nvidia CEO said in an interview with Citadel Securities published on Tuesday.

Huang's wide-ranging list included OpenAI, which makes large language models, legal tech darling Harvey, and AI healthcare tool OpenEvidence. Replit, Cursor, and Lovable offer AI-powered coding or ""vibe coding"" tools.

Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI to build data centers running the chipmaker's systems, the companies said last month.

In his Citadel talk, Huang specifically highlighted Anysphere-owned Cursor. He said that 100% of Nvidia's software engineers and chip designers use Cursor.

""We now have AIs for all of our engineers,"" he said. ""Productivity gains, the work that we do is so much better.""

Nvidia declined to comment further.

In June, Business Insider reported that Amazon was in talks with Cursor to adopt the AI coding tool internally after employees demanded it.

Huang has long said that AI and ""biological"" employees will work together in the future. AI agents break down a task into multiple smaller steps, each tackling a specific part to achieve a broader objective.

In Huang's January keynote at CES, one of the world's largest tech trade shows, he proclaimed, ""The age of agentic AI is here.""

In a podcast last October, Huang explained how the human and AI employees would work together. He described a future where the technology giant would mass-deploy AI assistants, also called agents, across every division to improve output.

""I'm hoping that Nvidia someday will be a 50,000-employee company with a 100 million, you know, AI assistants, in every single group,"" Huang said.

Human-AI integration is gaining venture capital attention, too.

Late last month, General Catalyst's CEO Hemant Taneja said that true AI integration has four non-negotiables, and one of them is planning for how humans and AI will work together.

""Some humans are going to manage AI agents. Some AI agents are going to manage humans,"" he said on a podcast appearance. ""Imagine how the org charts have to change.""

Cathie Wood says Wall Street is overlooking AI's biggest payoff.

The CEO of Ark Invest said at the All-In Summit 2025 in September that the real AI revolution is happening in hospitals and labs — and investors are barely paying attention.

""The most profound application of AI is in healthcare,"" Wood said in a discussion posted Tuesday.

She added that combining AI with advances in gene sequencing and CRISPR technology — a technology scientists use to selectively modify the DNA of living organisms — could spark a medical transformation.

""This is the sleeper. It's the most inefficiently priced part of the market,"" Wood said.

Wood said that five major technologies — AI, robotics, energy storage, blockchain, and genomics — are each entering their steep growth phase. When one advances, it accelerates the others.

That convergence is why healthcare could deliver massive gains for investors willing to bet early, Wood said. Smarter algorithms make gene sequencing faster; cheaper sequencing gives AI more data to learn from; and breakthroughs in gene editing can open the door to new treatments.

It's not the first time Wood has gone against the grain — her funds became famous for early bets on Tesla and Roku.

Wood also said some of the so-called ""MAG 6"" tech giants — Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet — could see slower growth in the next five years. These giants tripled in valuation in market cap from 2019 to 2024 ""because investors were playing it safe, and they were investing only in the largest, most cash-rich stocks.""

""That was a very difficult time for innovation for venture capital generally,"" Wood said, referring to the years when investors stuck with Big Tech. ""Now we think it is truly disruptive innovation's time to shine in the market,"" she added.

Wood did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Her firm managed over $13 billion in May, according to its most recent filing.

AI is quickly reshaping the healthcare industry, and tech's biggest players are racing to stake their claims.

Microsoft has been integrating AI into its cloud solutions to automate hospital operations. Earlier this year, Microsoft said its medical AI system diagnosed cases more accurately than human doctors by a wide margin in a study.

Nvidia is also pushing deeper into the sector. Its VP of healthcare, Kimberly Powell, told Business Insider in April that medical imaging was one of Nvidia's entry points into healthcare. The company has notched a number of medical imaging partnerships powered by its AI platforms, most recently with GE Healthcare in March.

Healthcare startups are rushing in, too. Founders told Business Insider in July that AI could be the breakthrough that helps clinicians multiply their caseloads and earn extra cash without sacrificing care quality.

Marc Benioff doesn't think enough companies have figured out how to adopt AI.

""Customers are getting their head around how to deploy AI,"" Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, told CNBC host Jim Cramer on Tuesday.

Earlier on Tuesday, Benoiff kicked off the Dreamforce conference at San Francisco's Moscone Center with a keynote, where he touted how clients such as Williams-Sonoma and Dutch jewelry maker Pandora have adopted Salesforce's AI products.

""The speed of innovation is far exceeding the speed of customer adoption,"" said Benioff to Cramer. ""These customers have to go back and modify massive architectures they have and systems they're running.""

The comments on AI adoption come as Salesforce shares are down more than 28% compared to the same time last year and around 34% compared to their peak in December 2024. The company said in August that it cut its support staff from 9,000 to 5,000 employees, thanks to the adoption of AI agents.

When asked about the stock decline, Benioff said that the Agentforce platform has rapidly grown since the company first introduced it a little over a year ago, but there is little understanding of how the company is using autonomous bots to drive efficiency.

""People don't understand that Agentforce is part and parcel of Salesforce,"" said Benioff. ""It is the core of every product we make now, it is the platform.""

The Dreamforce conference is set to bring tens of thousands of guests to San Francisco this week as Benoiff attempts to sell software like Tableau and Slack, powered by AI. Tickets typically run from $999 to $2,299. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Dario Amodei, CEO of AI lab Anthropic, are both scheduled to have chat sessions with Benoiff throughout the week, topped off with music performances from Metallica and Benson Boone.

A federal jury is set to hear opening statements in Manhattan on Tuesday in the fraud and conspiracy trial of two MIT-educated brothers accused in a lightning-fast, $25 million cryptocurrency heist.

The defendants — Anton Peraire-Bueno, 25, of Boston, and James Peraire-Bueno, 29, of New York City — will face a jury of their peers in the complicated case, at least in terms of education.

The daylong jury selection on Monday resulted in a four-woman, eight-man panel consisting entirely of individuals with college degrees.

Half of the jurors hold master's degrees, including in finance, the sciences, medicine, and education.

The jurors, almost all of whom are middle- or retirement-aged, will return to court on Tuesday morning, when they'll be sworn in, listen to opening statements, and hear the first government witnesses by the end of the day.

The openings promise to describe a complex, multi-step transaction on the Ethereum blockchain that left the brothers $25 million richer, while a trio of traders were left holding a pile of worthless, illiquid junk crypto.

Prosecutors say the ""first-of-its-kind"" fraud scheme took months of meticulous planning and was executed in just 12 seconds on a day in April 2023.

Before and after the alleged exploit, prosecutors say, the brothers typed in internet searches that included: ""how to wash crypto,"" ""top crypto lawyers,"" ""fraudulent Ethereum addresses database,"" and ""money laundering statue [sic] of limitations.""

Prosecutors allege that the brothers studied the trading behaviors of the victim traders before the heist, then took steps afterward to hide their identities and the location of the pilfered cryptocurrency. They've promised to reveal a web of shell companies, private cryptocurrency addresses, and foreign cryptocurrency exchanges.

""Using the specialized skills developed during their education, as well as their expertise in cryptocurrency trading,"" the brothers ""exploited the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain,"" prosecutors said in a 19-page indictment last year.

The brothers, who remain free on $250,000 bail each, have strongly contested the prosecution's accusations.

Their defense attorneys have argued that there was no fraud at all and that they merely outsmarted some ""predatory"" automated trading bots.

The alleged victims lost their cryptocurrency ""through pre-programmed trades without ever interacting with the Peraire-Buenos, directly or indirectly,"" the defense lawyers argued earlier this year, in a failed motion to dismiss the indictment.

In a blow to the defense last week, US District Judge Jessica G. L. Clarke barred the Peraire-Bueno's lawyers from arguing, as she put it, ""that the victims deserved this.""

The judge also barred defense experts from testifying about the lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency market.

The trial is expected to last into early November.

A federal judge on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration, for now, from firing federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown.

The order came five days after the administration issued reduction-in-force notifications to more than 4,000 federal workers.

""The activities that are being undertaken here are contrary to the laws,"" San Francisco U.S. District Court Judge Susan Yvonne Illston told lawyers for the administration on Wednesday at a hearing where she issued the temporary restraining order.

""You can't do this in a nation of laws,"" Illston said, according to NBC News. ""And we have laws here, and the things that are being articulated here are not within the law.""

The judge cited comments by President Donald Trump and White House Budget Director Russell Vought that have indicated the workers were being laid off explicitly to target programs favored by Democrats.

Two unions representing tens of thousands of federal workers had asked Illston to block the RIFs.

The Trump administration had warned that it would lay off workers during the shutdown, and President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that the cuts were aimed at ""Democrat agencies"" or initiatives.

Shortly before Illston issued her order blocking layoffs, White House Budget Director Russell Vought, during an interview on ""The Charlie Kirk Show,"" said that he expected that ""north of 10,000"" federal jobs would be cut because of their shutdown.

Illston said that the Trump administration took ""advantage of the lapse in government spending and government functioning to assume that all bets are off, the laws don't apply to them anymore, and they can impose the structures that they like on the government situation that they don't like,"" according to NBC.

The judge also said that she believed the unions would be able to prove that the Trump administration's actions were illegal and ""arbitrary and capricious.""

Illston's order came on the 15th day of the government shutdown, and shortly before a stopgap funding bill that would end the shutdown failed in the Senate for the ninth time.

Democracy Forward, an advocacy group representing the unions in court, praised the judge's order.

""The president seems to think his government shutdown is distracting people from the harmful and lawlessness actions of his administration, but the American people are holding him accountable, including in the courts,"" said Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward.

""The statements today by the court make clear that the President's targeting of federal workers — a move straight out of Project 2025's playbook — is unlawful,"" Perryman said.

""Our civil servants do the work of the people, and playing games with their livelihoods is cruel and unlawful and a threat to everyone in our nation.""

The Trump administration could slash more than 10,000 federal jobs during the government shutdown, White House budget director Russell Vought said Wednesday.

""We want to be very aggressive where we can be in shuttering the bureaucracy, not just the funding,"" said Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget.

""We now have an opportunity to do that, and that's where we're going to be looking for our opportunities,"" he said during an appearance on ""The Charlie Kirk Show,"" which was broadcasting from the White House.

The comments came shortly before a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from firing federal workers during the shutdown.

Vought listed a number of government entities that could be targeted for cuts, including so-called Green New Deal programs at the Department of Energy and environmental justice efforts at the Environmental Protection Agency. He also pointed to the Commerce Department's Minority Business Development Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA.

Vought also said he aims to close the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which he currently leads as acting director, within ""the next two, three months.""

He said that the agency has ""the DNA of [Democratic Sen.] Elizabeth Warren,"" and that it has tried to ""weaponize"" the law against small financial institutions.

The Trump administration has warned that the shutdown, which has now stretched into its third week with no end in sight, will lead to mass firings of federal workers.

The White House said it sent layoff announcements, known as reduction-in-force notices or RIFs, to around 4,200 federal employees on Friday. That number was revised slightly downward on Tuesday.

But Vought, in Wednesday's talk show appearance, said he expects the number of RIFs to grow. 

""It could grow higher,"" he said. ""I think we'll probably end up being north of 10,000.""

The White House has shared its rolling RIF estimates in court documents as part of a federal lawsuit filed by unions representing government workers who are challenging the Trump administration's cuts.

In a hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Susan Illston issued a temporary restraining order blocking the firings for now.

""The activities that are being undertaken here are contrary to the laws,"" Illston told lawyers for the administration as she issued the order, according to NBC News.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Vought said the RIF numbers provided in the lawsuit are ""just a snapshot.""

""I think it'll get much higher, and we're going to keep those RIFs rolling throughout this shutdown, because we think it's important,"" he said.

Government employees who are furloughed during the shutdown, as well as those deemed ""excepted"" who are still required to work, are going without pay while the lapse in federal funds drags on.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday afternoon issued a presidential memorandum directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to use any remaining congressional funds to continue to pay active-duty military personnel.

Anthropic on Wednesday announced Claude Haiku 4.5, a small artificial intelligence model that's available as a lower-cost offering for all of the company's users. 

The model is fast and can outperform other larger models that were considered cutting edge just months ago, Anthropic said. 

Claude Haiku 4.5 is better at using computers than Claude Sonnet 4, for instance, which is a midsized model the company launched in May. It performs similarly to Claude Sonnet 4 and OpenAI's most recent model, GPT-5, at coding, according to SWE-bench Verified, a test set that measures an AI system's software coding abilities.

""It punches way above its weight,"" Mike Krieger, Anthropic's chief product officer, told CNBC in an interview. 

Claude Haiku 4.5 is available to Anthropic's free users, and it's now the cheapest model available to paid users.

Anthropic is an AI startup that develops a family of large language models called Claude. The company assigns new numbers to the models as they advance across generations, but the smallest model in the family is typically called Haiku, the midsized model is called Sonnet and the largest model is Opus. 

After OpenAI burst onto the scene with the launch of its chatbot ChatGPT in 2022, Anthropic launched a rival product, Claude, the following year. It's powered by Anthropic's family of models, and users can choose between free and paid tiers. 

The launch of Claude Haiku 4.5 comes just weeks after the company announced Claude Sonnet 4.5 in September and Claude Opus 4.1 in August. Anthropic is working to release another model, likely an updated version of Opus, by the end of this year or early next year, Krieger said.

For paid users, Haiku models are typically around one-third of the cost of Anthropic's Sonnet models, while Sonnet models are one-fifth of the cost of its Opus models, Krieger said. Anthropic's free users can still choose to use Claude Sonnet 4.5, but they'll get more capacity out of Claude Haiku 4.5 since it's smaller, he added. 

Claude Sonnet 4.5 is still Anthropic's best-performing model, but the company said Claude Haiku 4.5 is ideal for users looking for fast, accurate answers.

""Even for my own use, even though it is not as smart as Sonnet, I've started defaulting to it on Claude, especially in the mobile app, because it's just much faster getting an answer,"" Krieger said. 

The two models can also work together. Anthropic said Claude Sonnet 4.5 can create multi-step plans to solve complex problems, and Claude Haiku 4.5 can complete subtasks within those plans, for example. 

Running the models in parallel could be particularly useful for businesses that want to use AI to tackle longer-term projects, Krieger said.

""You could have Haiku monitoring financial streams of data – and because it's a smaller, cheaper, faster model, it can do that at a higher volume – and then pass off its early insights to Sonnet to do some deeper analysis,"" he said. 

Anthropic, which was No. 4 on CNBC's 2025 Disruptor 50 list and is valued at $183 billion, serves more than 300,000 business customers. Its annual revenue run rate is approaching $7 billion this month, according to an Anthropic spokesperson.

The company has been racing to keep up with competitors like Google and OpenAI, whose valuation has swelled to $500 billion. Following the launch of GPT-5 in August, OpenAI has inked several multibillion-dollar infrastructure deals and released a short-form video app called Sora.

The breakneck pace of the industry doesn't afford Anthropic much time to get comfortable after a launch. While the company was carrying out the training for Claude Sonnet 4.5, it had already kicked off work on Claude Haiku 4.5.

""We're really firing on all cylinders,"" Krieger said.

To join the CNBC Technology Executive Council, go to cnbccouncils.com/tec

Walmart is deploying millions of ambient Internet of Things battery-free sensors throughout its massive supply chain in the U.S.

The retail giant is using technology from Wiliot in what the IoT vendor is calling the first large-scale deployment of ambient IoT in the retail sector and one of the largest such implementations to date.

Ambient IoT is a class of IoT devices mainly powered by harvesting ambient energy from radio waves, light, motion, heat, or other viable ambient energy sources. It's an evolution of legacy IoT and radio frequency identification technologies that promise lower costs and high scalability.

Walmart will be using the IoT sensors to track pallets nationwide by the end of 2026. ""Expansion to other global markets is under consideration, but the immediate focus is the U.S. rollout,"" Cathey said.

The company will now have real-time insights into inventory management, knowing exactly where merchandise is located and whether it's owned by the retailer, at any moment, and covering an estimated 90 million pallets of inventory when at full scale.

The ambient IoT sensors Walmart uses capture signals about temperature, location, humidity, and dwell time. These signals are linked with the company's advanced artificial intelligence systems, enabling the company to dramatically improve supply chain efficiency, inventory accuracy, and cold chain compliance.

""We expect to be active in about 500 Walmart locations by the end of the year, with plans for national expansion in 2026,"" said Greg Cathey, senior vice president of transformation and innovation at Walmart. The rollout will cover 4,600 Walmart Supercenters, Neighborhood Markets, and more than 40 distribution centers, generating high-resolution supply chain data that feeds into Walmart's AI systems, he said.

""This data provides proof of delivery, improves replenishment decisions, and lets us know where our items are in real time,"" Cathey said. ""By combining continuous sensing with AI, we're moving from probabilistic predictions to precision decision-making.""

What makes the addition of ambient IoT sensors significant is it provides a new stream of data into AI systems, enabling them to be even more effective in giving Walmart greater visibility into supply chain operations.

The technology initiative is already making a significant impact by eliminating some manual tasks and providing automated alerts, Cathey said. ""Associates no longer need to perform time-consuming checks to locate items,"" he said. ""Automated alerts now flag this information in real time, allowing associates to act faster and dedicate more time to serving customers.""

The enhanced visibility into the supply chain is also helping to resolve inventory discrepancies, allowing improved customer experiences.

While Cathey did not disclose specific figures such as cost savings, Walmart is anticipating gains from higher supply chain efficiency, improved inventory accuracy, reduced manual tasks for associates, and the ability to get items on shelves more quickly. ""Customers [will] benefit from better product availability and consistency,"" he said.

""AI system performance is predicated on its training data. The better the data, the better the AI performance,"" said Julien Bellanger, president of Wiliot. ""Supply chain AI has long been fueled by inherently out-of-date data — or forecasted data that represents projections rather than reality.""

Ambient IoT is changing this model, Bellanger said, by fueling AI with data that reflects what's actually happening throughout the supply chain.

""We have been here before; Walmart was an early adopter of RFID back in 2004 when it was supposed to provide much the same functionality,"" said Bill Ray, distinguished vice president, analyst and chief of research at research firm Gartner. ""However, this time the cost of the tags is much lower, and that will be a tipping point.""

Ray says it's important to note that the value of such IoT systems is already known. ""The business models have been well studied and evaluated, when RFID was first touted as the solution to supply chain problems,"" he said. ""RFID has had an enormous impact, but the cost of the tags prevented the transformation it had promised. The industry has been able to integrate the new, lower-cost tags into the same value models, and come up with positive answers.""

Gartner has been tracking Wiliot for a long time. ""The question was never if the technology could deliver on its promise. The question was if Wiliot could reliably scale production without compromising tag performance or price, and if it could integrate with existing supply chain systems. This announcement tells us that Walmart is convinced it can, now Wiliot will have to prove it,"" Ray said.

""Ambient IoT just works,"" Cathey said. ""It doesn't require wanding or scanning. It lets our associates do what they do, and they can focus on doing their jobs safely and efficiently while providing continuous, real-time visibility into our supply chain.""

Ambient IoT got a boost earlier this year when a new business alliance was created to develop and promote an open, multi-standard ecosystem for ambient IoT manufacturers, suppliers, integrators, operators, users, and customers, based on next-generation, battery-free ambient IoT standards.

By focusing on advanced communication technologies, the alliance is seeking to overcome the limitations of traditional battery-powered IoT devices, promoting more sustainable and efficient products.

In this article

Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock and Elon Musk's xAI are part of a consortium of investors that has agreed to purchase Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion, the companies announced Wednesday.

Aligned designs and operates data centers and data campuses across North and South America, and is owned by Macquarie Asset Management.

MGX of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners and members of Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership, or AIP, will acquire 100% of the company's equity, in what will be the largest global data center deal to date, according to a release.

AIP was created by BlackRock, MGX, Microsoft and Nvidia in September 2024 to accelerate investment in AI infrastructure. The Kuwait Investment Authority, xAI and Temasek have joined as additional participants.

The Aligned deal marks AIP's first investment and is a step toward the group's goal of deploying $30 billion of equity capital.

""With this investment in Aligned Data Centers, we further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI, while offering our clients attractive opportunities to participate in its growth,"" Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock and Chairman of AIP, said in a statement.

AI companies have been racing to build out the infrastructure they believe they will need to meet growing demand for the technology.

Companies including OpenAI, Nvidia, CoreWeave and Oracle are striking ambitious data center and computing deals that will require unprecedented amounts of funding and power.

Data centers are the large facilities that house the hardware and equipment needed to run big AI workloads and train models. Aligned currently operates 50 campuses and has more than 5 gigawatts of operational and planned capacity.

The Aligned transaction is expected to close late next year, and it is still subject to regulatory approvals and other standard closing conditions.

The Trump administration will set price floors across a range of industries to combat market manipulation by China, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC in an exclusive interview Wednesday.

China has driven foreign competitors in the rare earth industry out of business over the past two decades by using its global dominance in refining and processing to slash prices, Bessent said.

""When you are facing a nonmarket economy like China, then you have to exercise industrial policy,"" Bessent told Sara Eisen at CNBC's Invest in America Forum in Washington, D.C.

""So we're going to set price floors and the forward buying to make sure that this doesn't happen again and we're going to do it across a range of industries,"" the Treasury secretary said, without naming specific industries the administration was looking at beyond rare earths.

The U.S. also needs to set up a strategic mineral reserve, Bessent said. JPMorgan Chase is interested in working with the Trump administration to create such a reserve, he said.

Rare earths are used to produce magnets that are crucial inputs in U.S. weapons systems like the F-35 warplane and Tomahawk cruise missiles. Rare earth magnets are also essential for civilian commercial applications like electric vehicles.

The Trump administration has been working to stand up a domestic rare earth supply chain. The Department of Defense struck an unprecedented deal in July with MP Materials, the largest U.S. rare earth miner, that included an equity stake, a price floor and offtake agreement.

China last week announced sweeping new restrictions on rare earth exports ahead of an expected meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump in South Korea later this month. Trump has threatened to slap China with additional 100% tariffs in response.

The U.S. could take equity stakes in other companies in the wake of Beijing's rare earth restrictions, Bessent told CNBC.

""I wouldn't be surprised,"" the Treasury secretary said when asked about additional equity stakes. ""When we get an announcement like this week with China on the rare earths, you realize we have to be self-sufficient, or we have to be sufficient with our allies.""

The Trump administration will not take stakes in nonstrategic industries, Bessent said. ""We do have to be very careful not to overreach,"" he said.

Shares of rare earth and critical mineral miners have rallied over the past several sessions as investors speculate on which companies might be future targets for Trump administration industrial policy.

Bunge Global jumped more than 11% on Wednesday on the back of the Trump administration's threat to cut off U.S. purchases of Chinese cooking oil.

Bunge is one of the largest soybean processors and cooking oil producers in the world. The stock's year to date gains are roughly 18%.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the U.S. is considering ""terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil"" as a retaliatory action against Beijing's refusal to buy U.S. soybeans. China was the top buyer of American soybeans for years but has not bought a single soybean from the U.S. since May amid its trade war with the Trump administration. The country has instead been buying the crop from Argentina and Brazil due to Trump's high tariff rates on China.

Trump's threat to China comes after China's used cooking oil exports surged to record highs last year, with the U.S. accounting for 43% of the total export number.

Trade tensions between China and the U.S. have escalated in recent days. Late last week, President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports. That came after China placed new export controls on rare earth minerals. China this week then moved to tighten its grip in the global shipping space by sanctioning five U.S. subsidiaries from South Korea's Hanwha Group. 

Bunge earlier Wednesday also gave a full-year forecast that reflects its merger with grain and oilseeds processor Viterra. The company said it expects to earn $7.30 to $7.60 per share, excluding items, while analysts polled by FactSet expected $7.39 per share. Still, that appeared to be better than many investors feared. 

Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland, another large American oilseed processor, also rose 1.5% after Trump's threat.

In this article

Apple announced new MacBook Pro, iPad Pro and Vision Pro models on Wednesday with an updated M5 chip that allows them to run faster than their predecessors.

The new MacBook Pro models start at $1,599. The 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $999. The latest Apple Vision Pro, which includes a Dual Knit Band, starts at $3,499.

The new devices are available to preorder now in most markets and go on sale Oct. 22. They are Apple's latest additions to its fall catalog of products.

The company released the iPhone 17 and Apple Watch Series 11 models in September.

Apple's December quarter is its largest by sales, driven by holiday and Christmas shopping. That is why the company usually updates its bestselling products in the fall. This year, it's the first full quarter of iPhone 17 sales as well.

The new device lineup is powered by Apple's M5 chip, which the company said has four times the peak compute performance compared with the previous M4.

Johny Srouji, Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Technologies, said in a release that the ""M5 delivers a huge boost to AI workloads.""

Wednesday's announcement comes as Wall Street analysts are closely watching Apple's new releases to see if the company is raising prices or eating costs related to President Donald Trump's announced and threatened tariffs, especially on semiconductors and China.

Starting prices for the latest M5 models are the same as the previous versions.

While iPads and MacBooks aren't as critical for Apple as iPhone sales, they are still massive businesses.

Apple reported $6.58 billion in iPad sales in the June quarter, an 8% decrease on an annual basis that the company attributed to difficult comparisons to the year-ago quarter when new iPad Pros were released.

Mac sales in the June quarter came in at $8.05 billion, a 15% increase on a year-over-year basis. Apple released a new version of what it calls its bestselling laptop, the MacBook Air, earlier this year.

Apple has never broken out figures for the Vision Pro headset but they are included alongside Apple Watch and AirPods sales in the company's wearables, or other products, line item. Analysts believe the company's Vision Pro revenue is negligible.

MacBook, iPads and Vision Pro put together are significantly less than Apple's iPhone revenue, which accounted for more than 47% of revenue in the company's June quarter at just under $45 billion.

Wall Street analysts tend to focus on iPhone sales and growth over the company's secondary product lines.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent insisted Wednesday that the U.S. won't change its trade negotiating stance on China due to stock market volatility.

""We won't negotiate because the stock market is going down"" or shy away from taking strong measures against Beijing for that reason, Bessent said in an exclusive interview at CNBC's Invest in America Forum.

""We will negotiate because we are doing what is best economically for the U.S.,"" he said.

Bessent pushed back on a report in The Wall Street Journal overnight that China ""expects that the prospect of another market meltdown ultimately will force [President Donald Trump] to negotiate.""

Chinese President Xi Jinping is ""betting that the U.S. economy can't absorb a prolonged trade conflict"" with China, the Journal reported, citing people close to Beijing's decision-making. 

The Cabinet secretary called that report ""terrible,"" accusing the newspaper of taking ""CCP dictation.""

A spokesperson for the Journal, asked for comment on Bessent's remarks, said the newspaper stands by its reporting.

""We hold ourselves to the highest journalistic standards and any insinuation otherwise is baseless and false,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

Bessent's comments came as markets have whipsawed in recent days, as the status of ongoing trade talks between the world's largest economies appeared to teeter.

Stocks tanked on Friday after Trump threatened to hike tariffs on Chinese imports in retaliation for new export controls that China imposed on rare earth minerals.

Trump appeared to soften his tone over the weekend, spurring a market rebound on Monday. Major stock indexes bounced around in volatile trading Tuesday; the S&P 500 took a dive before the session close after Trump issued yet another trade threat against China, this one accusing Beijing of economic hostility for not buying U.S. soybeans.

Bessent added Wednesday that while Trump ""likes a high stock market,"" he ""believes that the high stock market is a result of good policies.""

""It's the policies that we're talking about here today, in terms of this capex boom,"" Bessent said, highlighting increased investment in artificial intelligence.

In this article

Nuclear stocks traded mixed Wednesday after the U.S. Army launched a program to deploy small reactors.

Shares of NuScale, a small reactor developer, surged more than 16%. Oklo and Nano Nuclear fell more than 1% and about 3%, respectively. The uranium company Centrus jumped 10%.

Those stocks all rallied sharply earlier in the session.

The U.S. Army on Tuesday unveiled a program to build micro nuclear reactors in partnership with the Defense Innovation Unit. The microreactors will be commercially owned and operated with the goal of helping developers scale up their businesses, according to the Army.

The Army launched the ""Janus Program"" in response to President Donald Trump's May executive orders that aim to speed the deployment of advanced reactors. Trump ordered the Defense Department to have a reactor operating at a domestic military installation no later than Sept. 30, 2028.

Investors have speculated heavily on the fortunes of NuScale, Oklo and Nano Nuclear despite the fact that none of the companies have deployed a reactor yet. Oklo and Nano Nuclear have not generated any revenue. NuScale posted $8 million in revenue in the second quarter.

Artificial intelligence power demand and Trump's executive orders have fueled a wave of market enthusiasm about nuclear power. Goldman Sachs recently told investors to exercise caution on Oklo.

In this article

Elon Musk's lawyers will urge the Delaware Supreme Court on Wednesday to restore his $56 billion pay package from Tesla, as one of the biggest corporate legal battles enters its final stage nearly two years after a lower court judge rescinded the Tesla CEO's record compensation.

The outcome could have substantial consequences for the state of Delaware, its widely used corporate law, and its Court of Chancery, a once-favored venue for business disputes that has recently been accused of hostility towards powerful entrepreneurs.

The January 2024 Court of Chancery ruling striking down Musk's pay has become a rallying cry for Delaware critics. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled that the Tesla board lacked independence from Musk when it approved the pay package in 2018 and that shareholders lacked key information when they voted overwhelmingly in favor of it. As a result, she applied a demanding legal standard and found the pay unfair to investors.

The defendants, current and former Tesla directors, denied wrongdoing and said McCormick misinterpreted the facts and the law. Musk is not expected to attend.

After the Musk pay ruling, large companies, including Tesla, Dropbox, and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, switched their legal homes to Texas or Nevada, where courts are friendlier toward directors. Delaware lawmakers responded to the corporate departures, a trend known as ""Dexit,"" by overhauling its corporate law.

If Musk loses the appeal, he will still reap tens of billions of dollars in stock from the electric vehicle company, which agreed in August to a replacement deal if his 2018 plan is not restored.

The company said the replacement award was meant to retain and focus Musk, who said earlier this year he was forming a new U.S. political party, on transitioning Tesla to robotics and automated driving. Tesla is now incorporated in Texas, where it is far more difficult for a shareholder to challenge board decisions.

Tesla's board last month proposed a $1 trillion compensation plan, highlighting confidence in Musk's ability to steer the company in a new direction, even as Tesla loses ground to Chinese rivals in key markets amid softening EV demand.

The five justices on Delaware's high court will consider the appeal of the pay ruling as well as the $345 million legal fee that McCormick ordered Tesla to pay to the attorneys for Richard Tornetta, who held just nine Tesla shares when he sued to block the pay deal. The court typically takes months to rule.

Tesla estimated in 2018 the stock options plan would be worth $56 billion if the company met operational and financial goals, which it did. Because the stock continued to appreciate, the options are currently worth closer to $120 billion, by far the largest executive compensation ever. Musk is the world's richest person with a fortune of around $480 billion, according to Forbes.

The defendants have argued that McCormick erred in finding social and business ties to Musk compromised their independence and said Tesla shareholders were informed of the economic terms of the pay deal before they approved the plan. The directors said she should have reviewed the pay package under the ""business judgment"" standard, which protects directors from second-guessing by courts.

The directors have long argued the pay package performed as hoped - it focused the attention of Musk, a serial entrepreneur, and he transformed Tesla from a startup into one of the world's most valuable companies.

Several months after McCormick's ruling, Tesla received shareholder approval a second time for the plan, which McCormick rejected as legally invalid. Tesla is also appealing that decision.

AI cloud company Nscale is eyeing an initial public offering, the company confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday as it announced a $14 billion deal with U.S. tech giant Microsoft.

The London-based company, which provides technology infrastructure to help artificial intelligence scale, has ""public market ambitions"" which could be realized in the ""back end of next year,"" Chief Executive Josh Payne told the Financial Times on Wednesday.

A company spokesperson declined to comment on where Nscale is considering listing.

On Wednesday Nscale announced an ""expanded partnership"" with Microsoft, netting the younger company $14 billion, a figure first reported by the FT and verified by CNBC.

Microsoft will purchase around 200,000 Nvidia GB300 graphics processing units from Nscale, inclusive of 75,000 GPUs for projects in Norway and the U.K. that were previously announced, putting the total deal worth at around $23 billion, according to CNBC calculations based on previous announcements.

A company spokesperson declined to comment on the value of the deals.

It comes less than a month after Nscale announced a $433 million funding around, which itself came hot on the heels of a $1.1 billion financing that is considered to be the largest Series B in Europe. Its investors include other technology heavyweights such as Dell, Nvidia and Nokia, as well as asset manager Blue Owl Managed Funds.

Founded in 2018, Nscale's pace of development speaks to the wider fervor around AI and the race to build out infrastructure that can support it. In both the public and private markets, fears of a bubble have emerged as investors pile in on AI-related stocks and startups.

Nscale, however, shows no signs of slowing down. ""We're always in touch with investors about future opportunities,"" a company spokesperson said.

Many predict that the artificial intelligence boom will dramatically change how people live and work, and the scale and pace of recent AI deals seems to reflect this. At the center are a handful of companies that are increasingly turning to each other to finance and build out the necessary infrastructure.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI alone has racked up around $1 trillion in deals this year, according to a report from the Financial Times. In September, OpenAI confirmed that it would pay Oracle $300 billion for computer infrastructure over the course of five years. This deal is part of a $500 billion data center buildout project called Stargate, to which Japan's SoftBank Group is also contributing. OpenAI has also inked a $22 billion deal with CoreWeave for use of its data centers, which are packed with Nvidia graphics processing units. Most recently, OpenAI announced a partnership with Broadcom to develop and deploy racks of chips designed by the AI startup. That deal amount is undisclosed. OpenAI has been able to go on this shopping spree because of a $100 billion investment from Nvidia, though a large portion of that money likely be used for leasing Nvidia's GPUs. Microsoft has also invested about $14 billion in OpenAI since 2019.

Nvidia has also spun a similar web of intertwining AI deals. Nvidia in September agreed to pay up to $6.3 billion for any of CoreWeave's unsold cloud-computing capacity through 2032. CoreWeave gets most of its GPUs that it then rents out to customers from Nvidia, which is also an investor in the AI cloud infrastructure company. Meanwhile, Oracle has purchased about $40 billion worth of Nvidia chips to build a data center for OpenAI, which is part of the Stargate project. Softbank has a $3 billion stake in Nvidia.

Some experts are worried that these inflated AI company valuations ""are at a bubble."" A recent report by Bain & Company found that AI companies will need $2 trillion of annual revenue to fund the infrastructure needed to meet projected demand for AI by 2030. That's an $800 billion shortfall.

But AI leaders are pushing back against concerns, saying that this is simply what it takes to make AI a reality.

""The largest tech companies in the world are purchasing this infrastructure because they have demand,"" CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator said on Mad Money on Oct. 8. ""There's nothing circular about that. It's a fundamental infrastructure buildout that's taking place, and when you have such a massive-scale investment in infrastructure, it is not unusual to see partnerships as people try to serve infrastructure to the consumer. It happens in other markets, it's happening in this one.""Watch the video for a visual representation of this entangled web of AI deals.

BEIJING — Chinese smartphone company Honor on Wednesday announced it is developing a smartphone with a camera that folds out of the device using a robotic arm.

The company said it plans to share more details at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona early next year.

The new device would be the latest Chinese consumer electronics product to shake up a decades-old hardware design in an attempt to integrate AI. Earlier this year, Beijing-based Roborock started selling a robot vacuum cleaner with an arm that folds out from the top, and combines AI with sensors to detect obstructions for the arm to remove.

Honor is calling the product a ""robot phone"" and said it will incorporate artificial intelligence, but did not provide specific details.

The company said it is rolling out AI tools that help its smartphone users scan Chinese e-commerce sites for personalized shopping deals, quickly hail a taxi or get tips on how to better position the camera for a photo. The move is part of Honor's plan to spend $10 billion over the next five years for a transformation into an AI device company.

Oops, something went wrong

Publicly traded digital asset treasury and advertising firm Thumzup Media is considering integrating Dogecoin (DOGE) reward payments for users of its Thumzup app. 

The app provides users with cash rewards when they share content about advertiser's products. Thumzup believes integrating DOGE as another payment option could lower fees and improve settlement of cross-border micro-payments. 

“Exploring Dogecoin integration is an important next step in our journey to create a scalable, low-friction rewards engine,"" Thumzup CEO Robert Steele said in a statement. ""If successful, this change could improve our unit economics and increase appeal to a broader, crypto-friendly creator base.""

As part of early assessments, the firm said it believes adding DOGE could improve user satisfaction and experience while improving reward pools as other costs are cut.

Thumzup was first connected to Dogecoin in July when it began considering expansions of its Bitcoin treasury into alternative assets like DOGE, Solana (SOL), and XRP. 

Later, the Trump family-backed firm raised $50 million to add to its digital asset treasury, and agreed to acquire Dogecoin mining firm Dogehash in an all-stock deal that aimed to create a leading Dogecoin mining platform. 

Ahead of the completed acquisition, Thumzup provided Dogehash with a $2.5 million loan in September to accelerate the bettering of its Dogecoin mining suite.

Shares of Thumzup (TZUP) finished the day down more than 5%, changing hands at $5.00. The stock has gained around 46% year-to-date and recently climbed after the firm announced up to a $10 million stock buyback program open through 2026.

Oops, something went wrong

Prosecutors in the U.K. are planning to repay the victims of a nearly $7 billion Bitcoin fraud in China, despite the U.K. government previously signaling its intention to keep most of the funds.

In September, Chinese national Zhimin Qian pleaded guilty to acquiring and possessing criminal property in the form of Bitcoin valued at $6.8 billion. Qian gained the funds through a fraudulent investment scheme that duped upwards of 128,000 individuals in China between 2014 and 2017. Over the years, Qian converted the illegally obtained funds into Bitcoin and attempted to launder the assets. The Metropolitan Police seized the stolen Bitcoin from 2018 to 2021 after Qian fled China and entered the U.K. with false documentation.

Over the last few weeks, questions have abounded over what the U.K. government plans to do with the nearly $7 billion Bitcoin stash. Germany, for instance, sold billions of dollars' worth of Bitcoin last year that had all been seized from various investigations. By contrast, the U.S. government still holds $37 billion worth of seized assets, per Arkham Intelligence, and lawmakers in the country aim to use them to create a digital asset stockpile.

Are Perps and Leverage Creating Systemic Risk in Crypto Markets? Experts Weigh In

After initially signaling an intention to keep most of the Bitcoin, prosecutors in the case today said during a court hearing that they are planning a victim compensation plan, according to Bloomberg. Several investors have reportedly applied to the court to reclaim their money.

Some investors “have suffered huge personal loss in the form of lives, marriages, fracturing families and businesses,” William Glover, a lawyer for a group of victims, told Bloomberg.

Prosecutors have yet to provide specific details on how the compensation scheme will work. “Given the unprecedented scale of the seizure and public debate about any potential surplus, our position is clear: victims' restitution must come first,” Jackson Ng, a lawyer representing a set of investors, told Bloomberg.

Nick Harris, CEO of U.K.-based crypto asset recovery firm CryptoCare, warns, however, that victims could be disappointed by the final result.

“The U.K. could still retain the seized Bitcoin under the Proceeds of Crime Act rather than redistributing it directly,” Harris told Decrypt. 

“Typically, confiscated assets are channeled into the Treasury or law enforcement budgets through the Asset Recovery Incentivization Scheme, a system mirrored in the U.S. and Australia, where victim restitution isn't always prioritized,” he said.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

A former U.S. citizen who earned the moniker “Bitcoin Jesus” for his evangelism of cryptocurrency has agreed to pay the IRS nearly $50 million in back taxes in exchange for dropping its criminal case against him.

Roger Ver once owned two computer companies in Santa Clara. But he said goodbye to the United States in 2014 and moved to the eastern Caribbean Sea, specifically the island country St. Kitts and Nevis. 

When he renounced his U.S. citizenship, Ver owned roughly 131,000 Bitcoins either personally or through companies that he owned, according to federal prosecutors. At the time, Bitcoins traded for around $871 each and Ver was required to pay an “exit tax” on his capital gains. 

He hired a law firm to help him with his expatriation process and prepare his tax returns, along with an appraiser to value his companies. But prosecutors say he provided false or misleading information to the law firm and appraiser by hiding the actual number of Bitcoins he owned.

The following year, an appraiser Ver hired to value his companies asked him in an email to provide the number of Bitcoins he owned when he expatriated. That appraiser copied Ver's attorney in the email, but Ver did not provide a clear answer, according to court documents.

 California 

Federal public defenders in Los Angeles have accused the Trump administration of circumventing rules with the way acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli was appointed.

Ver asked, “[c]ompletely hypothetically speaking, what would the ramifications be if I were to have had 200,000 [bitcoins] at the time of my renunciation?”

The lawyer advised Ver to get an appraisal of his personally held Bitcoins from a “third party who [had] no personal interest in the tax implications of the appraisal,” according to court documents.

Ver continued to provide unclear responses to the appraiser. In some emails, the appraiser asked point blank for a number, but instead Ver wrote back about the state of the cryptocurrency market. 

“I actually have all the information you need to make it super easy for you. I would just need to explain it all, and then you would affix your name to it,” Ver wrote in an October 2015 email.

He then filed false returns in May 2016, which omitted the true number of Bitcoins he owned. 

By November 2017, Ver had sold tens of thousands of Bitcoins on cryptocurrency exchanges for approximately $240 million in cash, according to federal prosecutors. Even though he was no longer a U.S. citizen, Ver was required to report his earnings to the IRS and pay taxes, because his companies were U.S. corporations. 

A federal grand jury indicted Ver in April 2024 for mail fraud, two counts of tax evasion and three counts of subscription to a false tax return. At the time, he was living in Tokyo but was arrested in Spain. 

Ver agreed to pay his back taxes under an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office and the charges against him are set to be dismissed. 

“Mr. Ver is accepting responsibility for his actions and has agreed to pay a substantial penalty,” acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli said in a statement. “Every person, whether you're a millionaire or not, is required by law to pay taxes and we will not hesitate to hold anyone accountable.”

Through his attorney, Ver said in a statement, “I am very grateful this case has been dismissed and appreciate the Trump Administration's leadership and professionalism in working towards this final resolution. I am also grateful to everyone who supported me and sought justice in my case.”

The trial of two MIT-educated brothers accused of stealing $25 million worth of Ethereum kicked off in Manhattan federal court this week, with a prosecutor claiming that the alleged scheme questions “the very integrity of the blockchain” itself.

Anton Peraire-Bueno, 25, and his brother James Peraire-Bueno, 29, “manipulated and tampered with the process and protocols by which transactions are validated and added to the Ethereum blockchain” in order to gain access to victims' digital assets.

The Peraire-Bueno brothers, however, argue that the exploit wasn't fraud at all and was not illegal in the first place—raising a fundamental question about where the legality of the blockchain ends and criminal manipulation begins.

In a May 2024 statement, former U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York said the case brings “the very integrity of the blockchain into question.”

“The brothers, who studied computer science and math at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, allegedly used their specialized skills and education to tamper with and manipulate the protocols relied upon by millions of Ethereum users across the globe,” Williams said. “And once they put their plan into action, their heist only took 12 seconds to complete.”

The Peraire-Bueno brothers were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering last year.

Both brothers face a maximum sentence of 20 years for each count. Their trial began on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court and could last through the first week of November.

Earlier this year, the brothers' legal team filed a motion to prevent the prosecution from using their Google search history as part of the case, calling it “unfairly prejudicial.”

However, prosecutors claim the alleged crypto scheme was “meticulously planned” and took “numerous steps to conceal their identities and lay the groundwork to conceal the stolen proceeds.”

As the trial intensifies, it is unclear if the brothers will testify in their own defense.

Oops, something went wrong

Shares in publicly traded Ethereum treasury firm ETHZilla (ETHZ) fell nearly 5% Wednesday following an announcement that the firm is enacting a 1-for-10 reverse stock split.

The Palm Beach, Florida-based firm expects the split to become effective in trading at market open on October 20, at which point every 10 shares of outstanding ETHZ will be converted into one share.

“As part of ETHZilla's effort to expand engagement with institutional investors, the reverse split is designed to provide these investors with access to collateral and margin availability associated with stock prices greater than $10.00,” the firm posted on X.

“This decision reflects a strategic alignment with institutional standards, enabling broader participation from sophisticated capital into ETHZilla and positioning it for long-term growth.”

The firm's outstanding share count will drop from around 160 million to approximately 16 million as part of the split. It cited mutual fund minimum share price limitations as part of its rationale.

ETHZilla, formerly known as 180 Life Sciences, adopted an Ethereum treasury strategy and rebranded in late July, aiming to make a splash as one of the largest Ethereum holders in the world.

It initially secured $425 million via a PIPE offering to kickstart its Ethereum treasury.

Shortly after its strategy announcement, shares in the firm skyrocketed as it was unveiled that Peter Thiel and related entities acquired around a 7.5% equity stake in ETHZilla. But just a couple of weeks later, shares had fallen sharply, leading to a $250 million share buyback.

Despite trading above $10.00 per share at one point, ETHZ finished the trading day at $1.83, down almost 5% on the day. Shares are up more than 105% in the last six months, though.

The firm owns 102,246 ETH at present time, valuing its treasury at around $407 million at current ETH prices. The haul is good enough to make ETHZilla the sixth-largest publicly traded Ethereum treasury.

""The stock split has no impact on our ETH accumulation plans. It is important to note that ETH accumulation is only one part of ETHZilla's business model—we are not a traditional DAT,"" ETHZilla SVP, Corporate Communications and IR John Kristoff told Decrypt.

""ETHZilla is currently working to offer tokenization solutions, DeFi protocol integration, blockchain analytics, traditional-to-digital asset conversion gateways and other DeFi services,"" he added. ""We will be updating the market on our progress on these and other initiatives in the coming weeks and months.""","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

The Ethereum Foundation is expanding its DeFi-focused treasury management strategy with a fresh deployment of 2,400 ETH, worth some $9.6 million, and about $6 million worth of stablecoins, in a yield-bearing Morpho vault, according to an announcement on Wednesday.

""Morpho is a pioneer in permissionless DeFi protocols and consistently demonstrates a commitment to Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) principles,"" the foundation wrote on X, explaining that both Morpho Vault v2 and Morpho Blue v1 were released under an open GPL2.0 license.

Facing criticism earlier this year over its routine sales of ETH to fund its operations, the non-profit Ethereum Foundation announced a plan to move a portion of its treasury into DeFi protocols, beginning with 50,000 ETH.

The foundation has since moved millions worth of funds onto platforms like Compound, an OG lending protocol, and Spark, part of the Sky (formerly MakerDAO) ecosystem. That said, it also continues to sell crypto assets for fiat on centralized exchanges to fund blockchain research and development.

According to Arkham Intelligence, the Ethereum Foundation holds over $820 million worth of crypto assets, including $735 million worth of ETH, at current prices, according to The Block's ETH price page.

Founded in 2022, Morpho is a decentralized lending protocol on Ethereum that has become a popular institutional option. For instance, Coinbase recently surpassed $1 billion worth of bitcoin-backed onchain loan originations using Morpho, just eight months after the service launched.

Some $4.6 billion has been locked on Morpho Blue v1, a small fraction of the total Ethereum lending market, but in line with rivals like Compound, Spark, and older versions of Aave, according to The Block's data.

If Ethereum ever reaches $100,000, the ecosystem could grow into a $12 trillion digital economy.

It sounds almost impossible, yet some investors are starting to wonder what would happen if Ethereum (ETH-USD) really did reach $100,000. At this level, Ethereum  would no longer be just another cryptocurrency. It would become one of the largest financial ecosystems in history.





At a $100,000 price, Ethereum's current circulating supply of around 121 million ETH would be worth nearly $12.1 trillion. This is more than three times Apple's (AAPL) market capitalization and close to half the total value of gold. These are world-shifting numbers that could redefine what digital assets mean for global finance.

If Ethereum reached six figures, about 36 million ETH or roughly 30% of supply would likely remain staked, which would represent around $3.6 trillion locked up in network security. At this scale, Ethereum would function as a global digital economy with its own financial infrastructure.

Every part of the network would expand in value. Transaction fees, validator rewards, and the amount of ETH permanently removed from circulation through burning would all rise in U.S. dollar terms. The entire system would start to resemble a digital nation with its own monetary policy and incentives.

Getting to $100,000 would require more than retail enthusiasm. It would take a steady flow of institutional money. Spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have already shown that traditional investors are willing to buy and hold ETH.

If pensions, wealth managers, and retirement funds begin to treat ETH as a long-term asset class, their constant inflows could keep buying pressure high. This type of structural demand would provide stability instead of relying on hype or short-term speculation.

Another major force could come from tokenized dollars. Stablecoins and digital U.S. Treasury funds now move billions across Ethereum each day. As these assets grow, Ethereum becomes the main payment and settlement layer of the digital economy, which continually drives demand for ETH.

ETH's design already supports long-term scarcity. The network burns a portion of transaction fees in every block, reducing supply over time. Meanwhile, staking continues to remove large amounts of ETH from circulation.

Overall, roughly a third of all ETH locked up, therefore the available supply in markets becomes increasingly limited. When this shrinking supply meets consistent institutional demand, the conditions for higher prices become stronger.

At $100,000 per ETH, the scale of Ethereum's “security budget” would be staggering. The network pays validators in new ETH and fees to keep it secure. Even small changes in issuance would mean huge shifts in dollar terms.

If 100,000 ETH were issued in a year, validators would earn $10 billion. At 300,000 ETH, this number jumps to $30 billion. If the issuance reached 1 million ETH, the total security payout would reach $100 billion a year. These figures show how Ethereum's economic size directly fuels its protection.

At such a high price, ordinary users would not tolerate expensive transactions. This is why Ethereum's Layer 2 networks are so important. These secondary systems handle most transactions for just a few cents while still using ETH to settle on the main chain.

The Dencun upgrade helped by introducing “blob” data storage, which reduced costs for these networks. This setup allows Ethereum to scale for millions of users while keeping fees manageable and still ensuring ETH remains central to the entire system.

If ETH did climb to $100,000, it would likely be driven by several forces working together. ETFs would create consistent buying pressure from long-term investors. DeFi (decentralized finance) would expand as higher prices increase the value of collateral and boost lending activity.

Stablecoins would keep the system running smoothly by providing liquidity for payments and trading. Together, these elements could sustain a healthy balance between buying, staking, and burning ETH, keeping the ecosystem active and valuable.

Rapid growth brings new dangers. A multitrillion-dollar Ethereum would attract much closer scrutiny from global regulators. Oversight of staking providers, liquid staking tokens, and ETFs would increase sharply.

Technical risks would also rise. Larger stakes mean higher rewards for attackers, making network decentralization and validator diversity even more important. Any sign of centralization or technical weakness could trigger sharp market reactions.

Reaching $100,000 per ETH would take years of consistent growth, stable regulation, and strong technical execution. It would not happen overnight or from a single upgrade. It would depend on a deep integration of Ethereum into global finance, where everything from digital dollars to investment funds depends on its infrastructure.

If that vision becomes real, Ethereum would evolve from a blockchain network into a core part of the world's economic system. It would represent a new era in how technology, money, and trust connect — and show just how far one decentralized idea can go.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is sitting at $4,018.90.

All too often, when advisors and investors look to add crypto exposure to their portfolio, they'll add bitcoin exposure and stop there. To be fair, it's understandable why many traditional advisors and investors go about gaining crypto access this way. For them, bitcoin likely comes off as the most legitimized cryptocurrency of its kind. They don't even think to look deeper within the crypto space. However, there are plenty of rewards waiting for those who are willing to do so. Take altcoins, for example.

Altcoins are cryptocurrencies created by crypto developers to help craft new decentralized finance (DeFi) systems or enhance ongoing projects. Many have networks coming online, like Solana, Sui, and Sei, all of which are powered by altcoin innovation. 

This, in part, is how altcoins can offer something different than what you would get from a spot bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin is employed as a store of value, but altcoins can be used to tap into returns from crypto innovation. 

Best of all, it's easier than ever for advisors and investors to gain access to the world of altcoins. Recently, CoinShares launched the CoinShares Altcoins ETF (DIME). This is an actively managed fund that looks to provide exposure to a number of different altcoins. 

Crucially, DIME's index, the CoinShares-Compass Altcoins Index, tracks 10 different altcoins, as of October 15, 2025. This can be largely beneficial for folks looking to use DIME to gain access to the broader altcoin market. The fund could be in a strong position to benefit from long-term crypto innovation and altcoin momentum. But it isn't beholden to any specific altcoin to see beneficial results. 

DIME is just one of many compelling crypto strategies within the CoinShares fund library. One of the largest CoinShares ETFs, the CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF (WGMI A-), has well over $380 million in assets under management.

Quick Facts:

1️⃣ The TOTAL3 chart is mirroring the same bullish setup seen before the 2020-2021 altcoin boom.

2️⃣ The formation of an inverted head and shoulders pattern followed by a key liquidation candle signals that a major altcoin breakout could be imminent.

3️⃣ With the market primed for a strong run-up, some of the best altcoins to buy now include $SNORT, $MAXI, and $TROLL – all poised to benefit from the coming altcoin wave.

In the world of cryptocurrency, historical performance is a vital signal of what may lie ahead. Considering this, now is an excellent opportunity to invest in promising altcoins that could yield significant returns in the near future.

That's because the market is setting up perfectly for a generational bull run.

@el_crypto_prof, a crypto analyst with over 160K X followers, recently shared his analysis of the TOTAL3 chart, which tracks the combined market capitalization of all altcoins except Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins.

All we have to do is look back at what happened in 2020-2021, right before that massive 1,000% rally.

At that time, the TOTAL3 chart developed a perfect inverted head-and-shoulders pattern. It broke out of this pattern with significant momentum (indicated in yellow), then moved sideways for a couple of months (shown in orange). After that period, it printed a pivotal liquidation candle, which was followed by several large green candles over the next few months.

Everything is happening almost identically right now: we've got the break of the inverted head and shoulders pattern, we've got the post-breakout consolidation, and now, we've also got the liquidation candle.

A liquidation candle, simply put, is a candle with a long wick below – meaning it has eaten up all the short orders in the market. These could be stop losses of long positions or direct sell orders.

As for the TOTAL3 chart, we can arrive at the next potential target by measuring the distance from the head of the inverted head and shoulders pattern to its neckline.

This measurement provides a target of around $3.2T in total altcoin market cap, representing a massive 200% rally from current levels.

With a strong run-up on the cards, here are three top low-cap coins that could absolutely rip through the skies in the coming weeks.

Snorter Token ($SNORT) isn't just well-positioned to ride the upcoming altcoin boom – it could actually help fuel it.

That's because it powers a new Telegram-based trading bot designed to simplify sniping for meme coins by everyday traders.

Currently, retail participants find it incredibly challenging to capitalize on those initial meme coin pumps due to the unfair dominance of institutional players, who enjoy access to advanced trading tools and algorithms.

Snorter Bot, however, makes those same cutting-edge trading features accessible to everyone. It lets you place buy, sell, limit, or stop orders directly through simple Telegram chat commands.

Next, it automatically executes those orders the moment liquidity kicks in – all the while protecting you from common on-chain threats like front-running, rug pulls, honeypots, and sandwich attacks.



According to our $SNORT price prediction, the token could go absolutely bonkers after listing, potentially reaching $0.94 – a massive 750% upside – by the end of this year.

⚠️ Time's running out! The presale ends in less than 5 days. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to buy Snorter Token for just $0.1079.

What's more, holding $SNORT unlocks a range of exclusive benefits, including:

Join the $SNORT revolution today – and snipe meme coin pumps before the whales even blink.

Pure hype-driven meme coins like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) often turn out to be the biggest gainers during an altcoin boom.

With an outrageous mission and over $3.6M already raised in its presale, Maxi Doge has all the ingredients to become the next 1,000x crypto.

Don't mistake it for a wannabe Doge superstar – it's Dogecoin's actual cousin who's now out for revenge.

What's Maxi Doge's gripe with Dogecoin, you ask? Well, Maxi believes Dogecoin's popularity and fun-loving vibe hogged all the limelight growing up, leaving Maxi all by himself.

But instead of sulking over this unfairness, $MAXI decided to take matters into his own paws.

He hit the gym, bulked up on protein shakes and caffeine shots, and stared at the charts until he devised the perfect plan to overthrow Dogecoin.



Maxi's master plan? To become a top-trending crypto.

To achieve this, he has allocated a massive 40% of the total token supply for marketing, including influencer collaborations, PR campaigns, and aggressive social media promotion.

Right now, you can buy $MAXI for just $0.000263 each, and this might be the lowest price you'll ever find it at – our $MAXI price prediction suggests the token could soar 800% by the end of 2025.

Hop in on the next Dogecoin before it explodes – grab your $MAXI tokens today.

TROLL (SOL) ($TROLL) is one of the few Solana meme coins that not only didn't dump significantly on Friday but has also recouped whatever little it did lose that day.

The token is currently up nearly 40% over the past four days, trading around $0.1185.

Most notably, it's now challenging the upper resistance line of a major falling wedge pattern – a breakout from which could trigger a massive rally.



For the next potential price target, we can look at $TROLL's historical performance. Its breakout from a descending triangle pattern in July 2025 resulted in a massive 1,100% rally.

If something similar plays out this time – which it very well could for a strong, community-backed token like $TROLL – we could see it rise to new all-time highs around $1.75.

Sure, $TROLL has no underlying utility, mission, or intrinsic value – but its hilarious embodiment of the internet's wild ‘trolling' culture is precisely why it has gained so much traction since its launch.

Don't miss the madness – buy $TROLL on MEXC before the next big breakout!

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) is battling to hold the $4,000 level while Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA) clings to $0.65, with both charts nearing breakout zones that could decide the next altcoin rally.

ADA Key Technical Levels (Source: TradingView)

Cardano's price structure that began in November 2024 is reaching its apex. 

The token trades around $0.67 as of Oct. 15, after sliding toward the lower boundary of a long-term symmetrical triangle.

The daily chart shows consolidation between descending resistance from the $1.50 peak and ascending support near $0.42. 

ADA recently retested this base after rejection at $0.95 earlier in October. 

Major EMAs now act as layered resistance between $0.77 and $0.84. 

The Parabolic SAR aligns near $0.84, reinforcing this ceiling.

A drop below $0.65 could expose stronger demand near $0.55 to $0.58. 

A rebound above $0.77 may open targets at $0.80 and $1.00 if momentum improves.

ADA Netflows (Source: Coinglass)

On-chain data shows consistent outflows in October, indicating that investors are moving ADA to private wallets. 

Netflows on Oct. 15 totaled negative $8.08 million. While this reduces selling pressure, it also narrows trading liquidity.

ADA Derivqtive Analysis (Source: Coinglass)

Derivatives activity has declined sharply. ADA futures volume is down 34.9% on the day, and open interest has slipped 3.7% to $682 million. 

Options volume is nearly inactive, down 92.9%. Long-short ratios still favor bulls, with Binance accounts showing 2.6 longs for every short.

In the last 24 hours, $2.04 million in ADA positions were liquidated, mostly from longs. The data shows leveraged traders remain exposed even as overall positioning turns cautious.

ETH Price Analysis (Source: TradingView)

Ethereum slipped to $3,996 on Oct. 15, down about 3% in the session, testing key support within its year-long ascending triangle. 

The move follows heavy exchange outflows and increased liquidations across derivatives markets.

The daily chart shows ETH compressed between an ascending trendline from April and descending resistance from the $4,800 peak. 

Price now trades near $3,950 to $4,000, where the 50-day EMA ($3,979) offers immediate support. 

A hold above this range could spark a rebound toward $4,230 and $4,639. A close below may expose the 200-day EMA at $3,546 and deeper support near $3,400.

The Parabolic SAR remains overhead at $4,639, signaling that buyers have yet to regain control.

ETH Netflows (Source: Coinglass)

Exchange data shows $65.28 million in ETH outflows on Oct. 15, consistent with the broader trend of coins moving off exchanges. 

This often signals accumulation but also reduces liquidity, which can amplify volatility during sharp moves.

ETH futures volume fell 25.8% to $107.6 billion, and open interest dropped 2% to $46.7 billion. 

Options trading also slowed. Despite lower volume, positioning remains bullish. Binance accounts show a 2.4-to-1 long-short ratio, with top traders holding similar exposure.

Liquidation data reveals ongoing stress. Over the past 24 hours, $125 million in ETH positions were liquidated, including $77 million in longs. 

The figures show that optimism persists, but leveraged positions remain vulnerable to another dip.

Indian telecom giant Reliance Jio is partnering with Aptos Foundation and Aptos Labs to bring blockchain-based rewards to its more than 500 million customers.

Jio, the country's largest mobile network operator, plans to integrate Aptos' layer-1 blockchain to distribute digital rewards through its telecom services. The move was announced at the “Aptos Experience” event.

Aptos is known for its high-speed, low-cost infrastructure, which is designed to handle heavy transaction loads, a necessary feature for operating at Jio's massive scale. The blockchain-based rewards are now in a beta testing phase, and “about” 9.4 million users are experimenting with them.

The companies said the system will focus on real-world utility, not speculation. The goal, according to the announcement, is to integrate blockchain into the practical aspects of daily digital life.

Aptos Labs will provide the technical support needed to build and manage the platform.

Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ:BITF) is now causing ripples both in the blockchain and AI sectors. 

Following a 500% surge in five weeks, the firm refinanced a debt facility with Macquarie Group into $300 million project financing for its Panther Creek data center in Pennsylvania, marking a strategic shift from crypto mining to high-performance computing (HPC) and AI infrastructure. 

The initiative is an attention grabber among ETF investors as thematic funds following blockchain and AI experience a rare overlap in one firm.

For ETF investors, Bitfarms — previously best known as a Bitcoin miner cashing in on the cryptocurrency bubble — is now a compelling case study. Historically, the company fits into blockchain-themed ETFs which aim at crypto miners and digital ledger innovators. However, BITF's recent actions place these funds at crossroads, as the company is no longer simply mining Bitcoin.

On the contrary, AI-related ETFs such as the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ) and Roundhill Generative AI ETF (NYSE:CHAT) can now indirectly invest in Bitfarms' changing business. Investors in these ETFs can ride the upside of a company utilizing existing data center infrastructure to get into the red-hot AI business.

CEO Ben Gagnon said this $300 million worth of project finance provides the company with quicker access to capital as it transitioned to HPC and AI workloads.

Joshua Stevens, Macquarie's managing director, emphasized the state of Pennsylvania's strong energy and fiber base, describing it as an emerging AI hub, while a change of leadership in the finance department indicates the company's intent on this new direction.

Bitfarms' makeover spotlights an ETF manager's peculiar dilemma. Blockchain ETFs may need to reconsider their definition of inclusion, striking a balance between exposure to legacy crypto mining and hybrid approaches that combine mining and AI infrastructure. By contrast, AI ETFs could benefit from this indirect exposure, establishing a foothold in a company that combines compute-intensive workloads with blockchain expertise.

For investors, this would mean exposure to the growth of AI unintentionally through holding a blockchain ETF, while holders of AI ETFs would receive the reward of digital infrastructure initially developed for mining, a cross-over that is very unusual among thematic funds.

Bitfarms' turn is a trial run for thematic ETF agility. As companies balance multiple edges of innovation, ETFs with the capacity to modify screening and sector definitions could ride the next wave of cross-industry expansion.

ByJeff Kauflin,

Forbes Staff.

Ascrypto receives a warm embrace in Washington and token prices rise to new levels, some once-hot digital asset sectors like NFTs continue to languish. Few firms have suffered the brunt of NFTs' collapse more than NFT specialist OpenSea.

Starting in mid-2022, the market for digital art represented by these unique, nonfungible tokens–from CryptoPunks to Bored Apes—experienced a spectacular fall, declining by more than 80%. By October 2023, OpenSea, the once-dominant venue for buying and selling NFTs, was bringing in just $3 million in monthly revenue, down from a peak of $125 million in January 2022, the same month the startup was valued at $13.3 billion, briefly giving its cofounders ownership stakes worth more than $1 billion.

It wasn't just that people had lost interest in NFTs. OpenSea had also been abruptly overtaken by an upstart competitor, Blur, which charged zero trading fees and didn't require buyers to pay royalties to NFT creators. When OpenSea responded by loosening its own royalty policy, it drew the ire of its customers on Twitter, who said everything from “you people are foul” to characterizing it as “evil” and “a joke of a company.”

As OpenSea was hemorrhaging cash and struggling for market share, cofounder and CEO Devin Finzer held a company meeting for 175 staffers on payroll. He told employees that the company needed a reset and that he would be firing more than half of them. His goal: to emerge again as a smaller, nimbler startup where every remaining employee was enthusiastic about reinventing the company. Finzer offered severance packages to anyone who hadn't been laid off but also wanted out.

“What was really tough was that a lot more people than I expected–some really good people–took that package,” he says today, looking downward. CEO Finzer now operates often from a WeWork-like co-working space in downtown Manhattan. About six other New York area employees are office regulars, but nearly all of OpenSea's 60 employees and 10 contractors today work remotely.

After trudging through a three-year bear market for digital art NFTs that may never bounce back, OpenSea is pivoting hard. Taking advantage of its customer base, which had swelled to millions of monthly website visitors, the battle-worn startup has expanded from NFTs to become a one-stop shop for trading all cryptocurrencies across 22 different blockchains. This shift means OpenSea can cash in on the memecoin craze, too.

Finzer, 34, credits his wife Yu-Chi Lyra Kuo with having the idea to turn OpenSea into a trade-any-crypto application. Kuo is an early cryptocurrency investor who pursued a PhD in philosophy and politics at Princeton, earned a Harvard Law degree and in 2016 began running a crypto trading fund. In 2021, Kuo left the trading fund and met Finzer later that year. “I really consider her a silent cofounder of OpenSea 2.0,” says Finzer. He adds that she spent hundreds of hours working with him on everything from OpenSea's high-level strategy to technically mapping out how it would pull in trades from different blockchains.

OpenSea's new focus is already showing real traction. In the first two weeks of October 2025, it facilitated $1.6 billion in cryptocurrency trades and $230 million in NFT transactions, up from $142 million in total volume in all of May. The surge will make October 2025 its biggest month in over three years. Under OpenSea's new gameplan, it aggregates buy and sell orders from decentralized crypto exchanges like Uniswap and Meteora. In terms of fees, OpenSea takes about 0.9% for every transaction, accounting for $16 million in revenue over the last two weeks.

Have a story tip? Contact Jeff Kauflin at jkauflin@forbes.com or on Signal at jeff.273.

Finzer's new focus for OpenSea employs an age-old trader axiom, “Don't fight the tape.” As the soaring price of bitcoin makes headlines, crypto goes mainstream and prediction markets gain in popularity, “risk on” is the new mantra for investors. One only needs to look at Robinhood's 400% one-year stock return and exploding volume at prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket as evidence. Even though slumping market values for NFTs like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, whose average floor price has fallen from around $400,000 at its peak to $32,000 today, have burned many investors, a new crop of speculators remains undeterred. For the past two years, memecoins have been the industry's biggest obsession. “You can't fight the macro trend,” Finzer says, so you might as well embrace it.

Finzer thinks letting people trade any and all cryptocurrencies is the “right one for crypto right now” due to high demand. In this respect, he has taken a lesson from his biggest rival Blur, a company that burst onto the NFT scene three years ago with a trader-centric approach that helped it gobble up most of the NFT trading market.

His run-in with Blur also taught him something about leadership. After Blur made trading fee-free and royalty-free, Finzer responded with a series of flip-flopping fee changes that wavered between minimizing and maximizing royalties for digital creators. He was trying to please too many people, and his reactive, consensus-driven approach wasn't working. Finzer learned to stop giving in to pressure from others and trust his own instincts. “For some of these things, the only way you get better is by having the thing happen and failing your way through it,” Finzer says.

Looking back on the past two years, Finzer and former OpenSea chief technology officer Nadav Hollander say the deep layoffs were essential. They flattened the startup's structure and removed all technical managers so that every engineer wrote code. Finzer has also come to reject the conventional Silicon Valley wisdom of hiring rapidly to keep pace with soaring customer demand. He now tries to keep the company as small as possible, an approach that has become in vogue in the AI era.

Meanwhile, Blur seems to be missing in action. Its trading volume has dwindled to $92 million over the past month, down from more than $1 billion in early 2023, according to DappRadar. Its corporate X account and that of cofounder and CEO Tieshun Roquerre have been mysteriously quiet since last spring. Roquerre didn't respond to Forbes' emails or Telegram messages requesting an interview. “In crypto, some people are there to get in and get out,” says Finzer.

Crypto trading applications are everywhere–thousands already exist. Yet even though today's most popular blockchains have been around for over a decade, no company has cracked the code on making it easy to trade the millions of tokens that reside on different blockchains and store the assets yourself (or in crypto parlance, self-custody).

While Coinbase makes 300 tokens available to trade through its centralized exchange primary service, that selection represents a tiny fraction of all the tokens in existence. And like a traditional bank, Coinbase stores customers' assets for them. Everyday Americans typically don't think twice about that since they're accustomed to using banks, but it's deeply troubling to cryptocurrency die-hards who believe in completely owning and controlling their crypto at all times. Just ask anyone who had money on crypto exchange FTX when it collapsed. (More recently, Coinbase has started making many more tokens available to trade through its Base service, which lets people self-custody their assets and trade on decentralized exchanges.)

Finzer says OpenSea's bridging feature of letting people trade across 22 blockchains is its most attractive, since there are still few places where that's easy to do. The challenges of achieving this are manifold–to do it well, a company needs to: index an ever-expanding list of tokens across an ever-expanding set of blockchain operating systems; get customers the best possible price for any given trade; make the application easy to use; create a user interface where people can discover new assets; prevent customers from getting scammed.

OpenSea built a booming business years ago by making NFTs simple for anyone to purchase, and it's trying to do the same with all token trading. Finzer's goal is to make the user's experience as intuitive as it is on an app like Coinbase or Robinhood, while under the hood, aggregating people's buy and sell orders from the places where more sophisticated, tech-savvy crypto traders congregate like Uniswap.

One way he tries to do this is by opting not to do know-your-customer (KYC) checks to verify a user's identity. These checks are an important step required for banks and financial institutions to prevent money laundering and transfers from people in sanctioned countries. Finzer says OpenSea, which has moved its corporate headquarters to Miami, isn't legally required to do KYC checks, since it's not considered a U.S. money transmitter and never takes custody of customers' assets. He adds that OpenSea uses blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs to check digital wallets against lists of sanctioned addresses and flag any suspicious transactions for money laundering.

But this compliance-light approach could easily present future risks, not only of money launderers and sanctioned-country senders slipping through the cracks, but also of future U.S. administrations bringing regulatory enforcement actions against OpenSea. Under President Biden, the Securities and Exchange Commission opened investigations into whether OpenSea and decentralized exchange Uniswap were running unlicensed securities exchanges. Both companies denied that they were violating the law, and the Trump Administration dropped those investigations this past February.

Finzer denies that OpenSea takes a compliance-light approach and says his company does more on compliance than “the vast majority of apps that are built on top of blockchains.” Regarding KYC checks, he says, “KYC isn't an ‘option' we're choosing to avoid; it's fundamentally incompatible with non-custodial architecture.”

OpenSea's new trade-everything strategy also means Finzer is trying to straddle the distant worlds of art and pure financial speculation, a balance that seems impossible. He says he doesn't want to build a “soulless financial app,” but when you visit the “Tokens” section of the site, it feels like a gambling-centric financial app.

The CEO thinks the art-focused NFT market, memecoins and all other crypto tokens can “harmoniously live together” in one place on OpenSea. He says the company is only “a fraction of the way” to its vision of a venue for trading all tokens and notes that it hasn't even launched a new mobile app yet. An independent foundation set up by OpenSea is expected to release an OpenSea token soon, though Finzer declined to give details.

Outside of potential regulatory issues, OpenSea may face significant competitive challenges since the barriers to entry in crypto trading are low. In fact, globally there are hundreds of crypto exchanges. “We've found there's a lot of moat in just consistently delivering on a quality product experience–building out a brand that's trusted and works as users want it to work,” says Finzer. The history of crypto, and the eight-year history of his own startup, tells a different story.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Crypto sleuth ZachXBT has managed to deanonymise withdrawals from crypto mixer Railgun while identifying a suspect linked to NFT wash trading and the $28 million Bittensor hack. 

Decentralized protocol Bittsensor suffered a supply chain attack in 2024 that resulted in the theft of $28 million from 32 holders of its TAO token. 

In an investigation revealed today, ZachXBT showed how he was able to trace these funds to instant exchanges where they were swapped for privacy-focused cryptocurrency monero.

Almost $5 million worth of these funds was transferred to Railgun in batches of ether, USDC, and wrapped ether. 

ZachXBT claims to have then deanonymized the withdrawals from Railgun by applying timing and amount “heuristics.”

According to the sleuth, “The unique denominations and short deposit time makes the demix high confidence.”

Railgun is a rival to Tornado Cash, and has seen the likes of Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin use its service. 

In some instances, Railgun has utilised protocol policy to return stolen funds, for example from the $9.5 million exploit of the Starknet network. On the flip side, it's also popular with North Korean hacking collective Lazarus Group. 

This is a solid demonstration of Railgun's privacy pools mechanism ( https://t.co/DekkatsMR5 ) working in practice, allowing Railgun to avoid serving proceeds of crime without using any snooping / backdoors.How it works:* Anyone can deposit into Railgun.* After you deposit,… https://t.co/SqclMS3SzO

Crypto mixers are designed to make funds untraceable once they've been withdrawn. ZachXBT's research, however, appears to undermine this completely.  

Once the crypto was obfuscated, the suspects sent the funds to three more addresses and made various bridged transactions.

The funds were then used to purchase some anime-themed NFTs and, through various overpriced sales and fund transfers, they were laundered.

The crypto sleuth noted that, “It's extremely rare to see exploits/hacks involve NFT wash trading.” 

One address that received the funds was funded by an address belonging to a Bittensor user who went by the alias “Rusty,” and created “Skrtt racing,” a crypto project that took bets on live-streamed Hot Wheels races.  

ZachXBT linked this individual to a lawsuit launched against suspects of the Bittensor hack, and noted that Rusty, giving a statement in the lawsuit as Ayden B, denies involvement in the scam, but admitted to owning the wallets ZachXBT managed to identify in his investigation.

“Hopefully law enforcement eventually moves forward with a criminal case in the future,” he said. 

Protos has reached out to ZachXBT to find out more and will update this piece should we hear back.

MegaETH, an Ethereum Layer 2 project focused on enabling real-time transaction speeds, is reportedly set to hold a public ICO on Sonar, an ICO platform created by prominent crypto figure Jordan Fish, also known as Cobie.

MegaETH advances blockchain infrastructure by integrating specialized databases for efficient state handling and parallel execution. The project enables faster and more responsive on-chain applications through advanced state management technologies.

The Layer 2 project has received endorsement from prominent Ethereum figures, highlighting its potential to enhance ecosystem scalability and attract developer interest. MegaETH's emphasis on high-performance features aligns with growing interest in Layer 2 solutions that mimic centralized exchange speeds while maintaining decentralization.

Sonar facilitates public token launches for emerging crypto projects, serving as Cobie's platform for community-driven investment tools in the digital assets space.

MegaETH, an Ethereum-compatible ‘real-time' blockchain, appears to be planning an initial coin offering (ICO). 

This potential public token sale would take place on Sonar, a self-hosted token launch platform created by crypto investor Jordan “Cobie” Fish, who is also a co-founder of Lido. “The First Real-Time Blockchain. Built for you. Owned by you. Register now,” MegaETH's team shared on X earlier today. 

ICOs – which are a way for crypto projects to raise funds – are making a comeback in 2025, with MegaETH's move showing a shift toward community-focused, transparent sales to drive user engagement and ecosystem growth.

According to the project's website, the registration window is open from today to Oct. 27. While MegaETH says details of a “potential crypto-asset offering” will be announced soon, it emphasized that registration does not guarantee allocation or constitute a sale. No terms of the potential deal have been disclosed.

Registration is open to anyone who completes identity verification on the Sonar platform, excluding MegaETH employees and users from prohibited areas. Individuals from the U.S. must also meet accredited investor requirements and will be subject to a 12-month lockup, MegaETH's website notes. 

Earlier this year, MegaETH announced plans to distribute its tokens through a new ICO model built around a soulbound NFT mint for its pioneer collection, The Fluffle. MegaETH said the NFT model was chosen to reward genuine community participation rather than speculative farming, The Defiant previously reported. 

“A simple points program tied to an airdrop often creates perverse incentives—especially when deployed by a blockchain—driving inauthentic behavior and ‘farming,' which raises questions about real value creation and leaves everyone dissatisfied,” the announcement noted.

This latest announcement also follows MegaETH Labs' recent launch of MegaUSD (USDm), a native stablecoin developed in collaboration with Ethena Labs using its Stablecoin-as-a-Service stack.

“$USDM aligns incentives across stakeholders, letting users and apps enjoy the lowest fees possible while routing scalable value back to MegaETH,” MegaETH said in a post on X on Sept. 8.

MegaETH initially raised $10 million through Echo in December 2024.

Capita has been fined £14m for its failure to secure personal data, which led to millions of people's information being stolen after a Black Basta ransomware cyber attack in March 2023.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which imposed the fine, said six million people had been affected by the data breach, with the information stolen including pension and staff records and details of Capita's customers.

The cost of the breach to Capita could rise because thousands of affected individuals are involved in legal action against the outsourcing services provider.

The cyber attack was subsequently claimed by the Black Basta ransomware crew, which listed Capita on its dark web leak site and published documents that appeared to have been stolen from its systems, including client information.

The incident caused major IT outages and had a significant impact on customer-facing services at many public sector bodies and some operators of critical national infrastructure across the UK, with staff left unable to take calls from members of the public and others falling back on traditional pen and paper. A total of 325 organisations, which are customers of Capita, were impacted by the data breach, said the ICO.

The ICO fined Capita plc £8m and Capita Pension Solutions £6m for failing to ensure the security of processing of personal data, which left it at significant risk. It added that the company did not have the “appropriate technical and organisational measures” to respond effectively.

UK information commissioner John Edwards said: “Capita failed in its duty to protect the data entrusted to it by millions of people. The scale of this breach and its impact could have been prevented had sufficient security measures been in place.

“When a company of Capita's size falls short, the consequences can be significant. Not only for those whose data is compromised – many of whom have told us of the anxiety and stress they have suffered – but for wider trust amongst the public and for our future prosperity. As our fine shows, no organisation is too big to ignore its responsibilities.”

The ICO initially planned to fine Capita £45m, but the fine was reduced after the business submitted representations and mitigating factors, including improvements it made following the attack, support offered to affected individuals and engagement with other regulators.

The attack began when a malicious file was unintentionally downloaded onto an employee's device. Capita's failure to quarantine the device for 58 hours meant the attacker was able to exploit its systems.

Adolfo Hernandez, CEO at Capita said: “When I joined as CEO the year after the attack I accelerated our cyber security transformation, with new digital and technology leadership and significant investment. As a result, we have hugely strengthened our cybersecurity posture, built in advanced protections and embedded a culture of continuous vigilance.""

“Following an extended period of dialogue with the ICO over the last two years, we are pleased to have concluded this matter and reach today's settlement.”

Adnan Malik, head of data protection at Barings Law, which is undertaking legal action on behalf of thousands of affected individuals against Capita, said the ICO fine represents less than 1% of Capita's annual revenue, which last year exceeded £2bn.

“It does little to set right the harms caused by the firm's inadequate cyber security procedures, which led to the loss of highly sensitive data, including benefits and pension records,” added Malik.

The ICO fine is separate to Barings Law's legal action against Capita, and changes nothing about its ongoing claim,” added Malik. “If anything, we would expect that this will mean our case progresses more quickly.”

He said there are increasing data breaches against major firms, which are incredibly damaging to people's finances, privacy and trust. “This fine, and mounting legal proceedings, should be a wake-up call to any firm still playing fast and loose with its customers' data.”

 perspective

It's always all about the money, and never more so than when talking about cryptocurrencies. They're touted as being about liberation, but really they're about taking our revenues and redistributing them to billionaires.

Governments have sought to control money distribution ever since there have been governments. There are entire Anglo-Saxon kings (shout out to King Æthelweard) whose names we know only because of coins dug up centuries later by metal detectorists.

The Sunday Read



It would be nice to think this was because rulers were concerned about spreading prosperity by ensuring a reliable currency, and I'm sure that's partly true. But the underlying reason has always been that coining/printing money is incredibly profitable. In very crude (and slightly misleading) terms: printing a $100 bill costs around 10 cents; it sells for $100; so that's $99.90 in profit for the government right there.

Anyway, this was always one of the (if not the only?) interesting things about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin: by taking the power to issue money away from countries, governments would lose the ability to profit from our need for a means of distribution and exchange, and citizens would gain it for themselves. So it's not surprising that governments want to stop that happening.

Last week, Uganda became the latest country to launch a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), which will use the same kind of blockchain technology that underpins Bitcoin to create a mobile-first version of the country's shilling, and thus attempt to negate the appeal of crypto. Perhaps more importantly India, which leads the world in crypto adoption according to some measures, plans to do the same. 

“This will only make it easier to transact. It will also reduce paper consumption and will be faster to transact than the banking system. But it will also have traceability,” said the Indian Commerce and Industry Minister.

For most people in Western countries, the replacement of cash money by CBDCs would make very little difference because the vast majority of transactions are done electronically already; but for criminals, it would be disastrous. Accustomed to being able to use cash in huge quantities to hide their transactions, cartels, traffickers and others would have to invent new ways to find anonymity. (Inevitably, they'll find it, but it will be more expensive, thus making their crimes less profitable.)

The European Central Bank is moving forward with its own plans to introduce a digital euro, and Piero Cipollone, a member of the ECB's executive board, gave this fascinating interview last week about what that would look like (I think what he's describing looks really good, for what it's worth). A key insight is that, as electronic payment methods have spread, Europeans have become ever-more reliant on foreigners for processing transactions. “It … makes us vulnerable: we depend on others for our money and this can be weaponised against us. Ten years ago we weren't facing this problem, because cash was king,” he said.

He called the payment processors that dominate transactions “international”, but in reality they're American. Which brings us to a really interesting exception to the general global movement towards CBDCs: in the U.S., President Donald Trump has ruled the idea out completely, because it would “threaten the stability of the financial system, individual privacy, and the sovereignty of the United States”.

I think concerns about CBDCs' impact on privacy are very overstated, considering most of us are already giving away ample data about our financial lives to banks, Apple, Paypal, and whomever, for them to do with what they wish, and it is particularly odd that the White House is stopping the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar on privacy grounds while encouraging private companies to do so in the form of stablecoins like Tether's USDT.

“The difference between a CBDC and a stablecoin like USDT is simple,” said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino last week. “One belongs to the people. The other belongs to the state.”

That is obviously nonsense. Leaving aside the facile distinction between “people” and “state”, the idea that a digital dollar run by a democratically-overseen Central Bank like the Federal Reserve would somehow be less of the people than one run by a private company based in a foreign country whose president boasts of being a dictator (as El Salvador's Nayib Bukele has done) is so idiotic it makes my brain hurt.

As so often with Donald Trump's White House, this is all about the money and who gets it. The profits from issuing currency are called seigniorage, an old French term meaning that which belongs to the seignior or lord. By getting the Fed out of the CBDC business, and instead encouraging private companies to issue stablecoins, the White House is just redirecting seigniorage from the budget towards political allies, such as Trump's own children. To be honest, I'm sure good old King Æthelweard did the same thing back in ninth century England, but you would have hoped that, 1,200 years later, we might have moved on a bit.

How much money are we talking about? Well, at the end of the month we'll learn how much Tether made in profit in the third quarter. My money is on it exceeding its already record-breaking $4.9 billion haul from Q2. Its smaller rival Circle meanwhile is predicted to make revenues of more than $6 billion a year by 2028. Any Americans reading this: if the Federal Reserve had issued a CBDC instead of letting private companies do it, that money would be yours for spending on public services. Instead it's being routed into right-wing media, political donations and the pockets of well-connected billionaires.

Nigel Farage, the leader of political party Reform UK – currently riding high in opinion polls – has told an event audience that he wants to “bring crypto in from the cold” and put an immediate halt to work on a potential UK central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Farage – a former Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1999 until the UK's withdrawal from the European Union (EU) in 2020, a move he campaigned for – is one of the best-known figures in British politics. Reform UK has just five members of Parliament but has recently consistently polled above the ruling Labour Party and opposition Conservatives, leading to growing talk of Farage as a potential prime minister.

Farage took part in a fireside chat on the opening day of the ‘Digital Asset Summit 2025', an event organised in London on 13-15 October by US-based financial media, research and events firm Blockworks. During a 30-minute conversation he highlighted some the promises made in a ‘Cryptoassets and Digital Finance Bill' (or, in its own words, ‘statement of intent') published by Reform in May that set out a ‘post-Brexit roadmap to make the United Kingdom the world's premier hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation.'

“I was in the European Parliament for over 20 years but I don't regard myself as a politician,” he told the audience, ahead of positively answering the opening question as to whether he believed he was the UK's next prime minister. Farage began his career as a commodities trader in the City. “I still regard myself much more as a businessman who's in politics because things need fixing,” he said.

Duirng the discussion he went on to slam “over-regulation” in the City and tell digital asset industry representatives in the audience that “I am your champion.”

Reform's seven-page ‘bill' included a plan for HM Treasury to create and manage a ‘Bitcoin Reserve Fund' as part of the UK's official reserves. This is following the example of the US, where president Donald Trump signed an executive order in March to create a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve' and ‘Digital Asset Stockpile'.

The document also specified ‘Rapid Policy-Making Timelines', stating that ‘any government taskforce or commission on crypto is limited to 90 days (extendable by 30 days only with parliamentary approval) to prevent bureaucratic drift and keep the UK well ahead of slow EU processes.'

“We're [the UK] losing reinsurance businesses off to Bermuda, etc, and this whole area of digital assets and crypto just isn't being talked about at all,” Farage said at the Blockworks event.  

“I was the first prominent person in British politics to adopt crypto, to talk about crypto, to try and legitimise crypto, which was in 2020,” he said. “One of the reasons I'm here today [at the conference] is my deep frustration that despite one speech by [former Conservative PM] Rishi Sunak in this space, the Conservatives [and] the Labour Party have done nothing in this area.”

Referring to Reform's stated plans, he said: “If we win the next general election, will put [it] into law very, very quickly, and we will effectively bring crypto in from the cold.”

The Labour government was elected in July 2024 in a landslide win that ended 14 years of Conservative rule. In March this year PM Sir Keir Starmer in spoke of planned ‘fundamental reform of the British state', saying that politicians had for years “hid[den] behind a vast array of quangos, arms-length bodies and regulators… a sort of cottage industry of checkers and blockers.”

Farage wants “appropriate” regulation.

“When I started [working in the City], you could put a brass plaque outside your front door and say ‘commodity broker' and there were a few cowboys around,” he said. “I think a degree of regulation that gives consumers confidence is what you need. By the time I left the City in 2004, I saw compliance departments getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger, and, effectively, their job was to stop you doing business, to stop you innovating. So over-regulation is a curse.”

“I saw it [regulation] go massively over the top,” he continued. “A lot of that was because we were in the globalist European Union, which is the most heavily regulated marketplace on Earth – which is why it's going down the tubes, frankly. “

“So, yes, I'm all for appropriate regulation,” he said. “But the next British government needs to deregulate: deregulate financial services, deregulate small business, deregulate entrepreneurship. And we have to get the tax burden right because, at the moment, the flight of capital, the flight of brains from this country is frankly disastrous.”

Farage was talking on stage to Blockworks co-founder Michael Ippolito in a session titled ‘The Future of Digital Assets in the UK'.

He criticised his fellow parliamentarians for a perceived lack of knowledge and interest in digital finance-related topics.

“If you had this conversation with 95 per cent of current regulators in the House of Commons or the House of Lords, you may as well be speaking Swahili to them. They don't know anything about the space – they don't want to know anything about the space,” he said.

He also aimed his fire at the Bank of England (BoE), criticising the central bank for a cautious stance over cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins.

“I remember when I came out publicly saying that, actually, people should hold crypto as part of their portfolio – and that was in 2020, when I said ‘look, this [crypto] is here to stay, it's a fascinating space',” he said. “I liked it because whilst I'd campaigned for national sovereignty [from the EU] for all those years, here is personal sovereignty… you've got your own money, you're in charge.”

The BoE is currently researching the possibilities for a potential British CBDC through a digital pound ‘design phase.'

Like Trump, who slammed a potential digital US dollar as a “dangerous threat to freedom”, Farage describing CBDCs as “the ultimate authoritarian nightmare.”

“If and when we win the next election, we will automatically shut down the CBDC project, make all those working on it say ‘very sorry, chaps – you're of work'. We will stop it overnight,” he said.

Last month the UK government announced plans to launch a digital ID scheme and make having digital ID mandatory for anyone for working in the UK.

Farage was similarly critical of this public sector initiative. “I'd rather go to prison that have digital ID and total state control over my life and over my money…. I'm going to fight this and we are going to win,” he said.

Cryptocurrencies are widely seen as having made it easier for criminals to launder money due to their high degree of anonymity.

The government is attempting to ramp up anti-money laundering (AML) through updated legislation such as the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023.

“We have excessive anti-money laundering rules,” Farage said. “The AML regs are a ‘sledgehammer to miss the nut'. For every 100 quid we're spending on regulation to seek money laundering, we're only getting a pound back the other way.”

Reform's cryptoassets and digital finance bill included an intention to allow taxes to be paid in cryptocurrencies. HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) ‘must build systems to accept Bitcoin (and other approved crypto) for tax liabilities, using HMRC-published GBP exchange rates at the time of payment,' the document stated, adding that ‘crypto collected can be converted into sterling or added to the Bitcoin Reserve Fund.'

The document also stated that the party had become the first UK political party ‘to be able to accept donations in Bitcoin, Ethereum, as well as other cryptocurrencies.'

Palmer Luckey's ambitious crypto-friendly digital banking startup Erebor has received conditional approval from regulators to start operations, federal officials announced Wednesday.

As The Post was first to report, Luckey, the 32-year-old tech mogul known for leading the fast-growing defense firm Anduril, is among the chief backers for Erebor – which aims to aims to provide a stable option for Silicon Valley firms and tech entrepreneurs to park their money and cryptocurrency outside traditional banks.

Tech investor Joe Lonsdale of venture firm 8VC is another key backer for Erebor, as is Peter Thiel's Founders Fund.

Conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an independent branch of the US Treasury, marked a crucial step forward for the startup, which is based in Columbus, Ohio. It still needs to clear a few more regulatory hurdles before it can open for business – a process likely to take several months.

“Today's decision is also proof that the OCC under my leadership does not impose blanket barriers to banks that want to engage in digital asset activities,” Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gould said in a statement.

“Permissible digital asset activities, like any other legally permissible banking activity, have a place in the federal banking system if conducted in a safe and sound manner,” he added.

An Erebor representative declined to comment.

Luckey is listed as Erebor's principal shareholder and a member of its board of directors. Owen Rapaport, the cofounder of crypto-monitoring company Aer Compliance, is listed as Erebor's CEO.

The startup's unusual name is a reference to the mountain where the dragon Smaug stores his hoard of gold in J.R.R. Tolkien's “The Lord of The Rings” prequel “The Hobbit.”

Sources previously told The Post that Erebor will handle cash plus deposits in stablecoin, a class of digital currency with value directly pegged to a “stable” asset like the US dollar or gold.

Talks about Erebor began soon after the sudden collapse in 2023 of Silicon Valley Bank and accelerated as some tech investors grumbled about crypto and crypto-adjacent startups getting “debanked” by traditional institutions during the Biden administration.

Luckey is not expected to play a role in Erebor's day-to-day operations.

President Trump — who got backing from Luckey and Lonsdale as well as many other tech and crypto executives during his 2024 campaign — has taken a much friendlier regulatory approach to the industry.

Luckey and his allies also are seeking an alternative to traditional fractional reserve banking – where banks deploy most of their client deposits while keeping a relatively small amount in reserve at any given time.

Insiders say Erebor will focus on helping tech entrepreneurs build their businesses as opposed to maximizing returns on deposits.","{'href': 'https://nypost.com', 'title': 'New York Post'}","cryptocurrency"

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Chinese company gives an Eric Trump crypto firm preferential access to tech","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/eric-trump-crypto-china-bitmain","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 19:16:00 GMT","

SEC filings show Bitmain gave firm partially owned by Eric Trump unusually generous terms on equipment

A private Chinese company is giving preferential access to its technology and providing unusually beneficial payment terms on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of specialized equipment to a firm partially owned by Eric Trump, according to industry sources and Securities and Exchange Commission records.

The company, Bitmain, has faced concerns over the potential national security risks of its technology, with one Republican congressman asking the treasury department to review some of its business dealings in the United States.

American Bitcoin Corporation was founded in March, just two months after Donald Trump's inauguration. Eric Trump currently has a 7.5% stake in the company, SEC filings show. Created through a daisy chain of mergers, and majority owned by a company called Hut 8, American Bitcoin went public with overwhelming publicity on 3 September on the Nasdaq exchange. Though the phenomenal stock profits of the Trump venture have been previously reported, the fact that Bitmain appears to be providing preferential access and payment terms to the operation has not been previously reported.

Filings by American Bitcoin with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that the company is purchasing more than 16,000 advanced mining machines – servers that process complex math problems to earn Bitcoin – from Bitmain.

The SEC filings indicate that American Bitcoin is paying Bitmain in “pledged” bitcoin – rather than cash – which could be redeemed up to two years from now, at a current price. An industry expert said he was briefed on the American Bitcoin deals and that Bitmain was offering the company unique and favorable terms, with little money down, and such a long period of time for redeeming their collateral.

In May, at a Las Vegas bitcoin conference sponsored by Bitmain, the president of American Bitcoin, Matt Prusak, underscored the political nature of the bitcoin industry. “If you think you're in the energy business or compute business or bitcoin business you're half right,” he told the audience. “Underneath it all you're in the business of politics, in the politics business.”

Favorable treatment by Bitmain is a main ingredient of the American Bitcoin venture. “Preferential access” to the technology it buys from Bitmain is “central to American Bitcoin's ability to maintain a structural cost advantage”, according to an American Bitcoin press release last month.

In a statement to the Guardian, Bitmain said “technical cooperation” with American Bitcoin's majority owner Hut 8 was specific to one type of mining machine, and was with Hut 8 rather than American Bitcoin. Hut 8 and American both list the same address in Miami on filings with the US government, and Hut 8 handles all of American Bitcoin's operations and infrastructure.

Bitmain, in its statement to the Guardian, said it offers “pledged bitcoin” to other customers. But in a May announcement the company said it would offer a six-month redemption period for these pledges, not a 24-month term, as it offers American Bitcoin.

Experts say American Bitcoin's special access to Bitmain's technology and financing terms raise concerns that the Chinese entity views business with the Trump sons as an opportunity to try to influence the Trump administration on a variety of issues: crypto regulation, energy, or China policy.

“The disclosed terms are pretty unusual,” said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. “It's one thing to extend credit. But the weird part is: ‘you have the option to buy back when you're mining at a discount,'” he said. “If the president's family was involved it brings up the obvious question of whether Bitmain is trying to get special treatment.”

Even the appearance of impropriety can be problematic, said Eric Chaffee, a professor of law at Case Western, who cautioned that at the same time all the facts are not known. “This does look a bit like a sweetheart deal where the reason they are doing this is to curry some influence with the Trump administration,” he said. “This looks bad but at the same time there could be underlying facts that make it a fair deal.”

A spokesperson for Hut 8, Gautier Lemyze-Young, did not dispute the financing terms involved bitcoin with a 24-month window but said the terms were agreed to “in September 2024 long before the launch of American Bitcoin”.

The transaction at issue, though, was done by American Bitcoin, and was revealed in August 2025.

On the day American Bitcoin went public a company executive posted a photo of the team, including Eric and Don Jr, on X, with the phrase “And we are off to the races.”

Lemyze-Young said in the statement that the close work with the Chinese company stemmed from a longstanding relationship and was due to “results, not politics or external affiliations”.

Eric Trump did not respond to detailed requests for comment emailed to American Bitcoin and the Trump Organization, where he is executive vice-president.

A former company executive who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Guardian that the Trump family involvement, announced publicly in March, was known months earlier to insiders as the mergers were organized to form American Bitcoin. “We knew well in advance that they were involved. That's why we wanted to do it,” he said, referring to a merger. “They have some access at the White House. Better than not having it. That's certainly a bonus.”

It is not the first crypto venture of the Trump family to raise questions about foreign influence. An entirely separate Trump cryptocurrency business, World Liberty Financial, which has no ties to American Bitcoin except the Eric Trump ownership, announced in May that the United Arab Emirates would use its stablecoin in a transaction in which it made a $2bn investment involving a separate cryptocurrency exchange.

But American Bitcoin stands out in part because so many threads intersect with US policy: Trump has announced a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve”, which may help drive up bitcoin's price; has loosened regulations on energy, which is key to cheap bitcoin mining; and has launched policies on China that often seem to pivot back and forth between aggressive economic confrontation and conciliation.

Eric Trump has been promoting American Bitcoin and the stock, appearing with company executives at investor forums and business news broadcasts, repeating that the Trump family had turned to cryptocurrency because it was “debanked” following the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol.

“We developed a company named American Bitcoin. We are one of the biggest bitcoin mining companies on Earth,” he told a conference last month, claiming the price of bitcoin would shoot to a million dollars, an eightfold increase from the present.

Bitmain is not regulated by US agencies but there have been concerns about the company's technology. Last month the Republican congressman Zachary Nunn, of Iowa, pressed the treasury department to review Bitmain and another Chinese bitcoin company. In a statement to the Guardian, Nunn wrote: “American families deserve to know that our power grid, digital infrastructure, and national security aren't being compromised by foreign entities with opaque ownership and ties to hostile regimes.”

In Bitmain's statement to the Guardian, the company said it responded to his office, and said it “strictly complies with US and applicable laws and regulations and has never engaged in activities that pose risks to US national security”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","cryptocurrency"

October 15, 2025 – The cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem stands at the precipice of a profound transformation, driven by a wave of innovative technologies poised to redefine scalability, privacy, user experience, and real-world integration. From modular blockchain architectures to the cryptographic marvels of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and the tangible impact of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs), these advancements, gaining significant traction from late 2023 through 2025, are addressing the core limitations that have historically hindered mainstream Web3 adoption.

This burgeoning landscape is fostering a palpable sense of optimism within the crypto community, with many hailing these innovations as the catalysts for the next major bull run. The immediate perceived impact is a concerted effort to make blockchain technology more intuitive, secure, and integrated with daily life, moving beyond speculative trading to deliver substantial utility. This matters immensely for the crypto ecosystem as it signals a maturation of the industry, shifting focus towards foundational infrastructure and user-centric design that can onboard billions of new users and unlock trillions in real-world value.

The market leading up to October 15, 2025, has been a dynamic canvas reflecting both the promise of these emerging technologies and the broader macroeconomic currents. While some innovations are still in nascent stages of direct tokenization, others have already demonstrated measurable impacts on associated tokens.

Modular Blockchains, exemplified by projects like Celestia (TIA), are viewed as a foundational shift towards greater scalability and flexibility. The TIA token, focusing on data availability, experienced significant volatility. After a surge to $1 on October 14, it had previously plummeted to a new all-time low of $0.27 on October 10, following a broader crypto market deleveraging event. Token unlocks, including 9.62 million TIA tokens worth approximately $9.6 million on October 5, and the exit of Polychain Capital, which sold its remaining 43 million TIA back to the Celestia Foundation, contributed to supply pressure and market uncertainty. Despite the ""disillusionment"" period, the underlying technology's long-term potential continues to attract developer interest, indicating a discerning market seeking real utility.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are garnering distinctly bullish sentiment, anticipated to drive the next major crypto bull run. The market sees ZKPs as the ""missing link"" for widespread blockchain adoption, crucial for scaling networks, ensuring transactional privacy, and enabling regulatory compliance. ZKP-based systems are projected to grow 35% annually, reaching $5.6 billion by 2027. This heightened interest is projected to drive increased trading volume and enhanced liquidity for ZKP-related tokens such as Polygon (MATIC), Mina Protocol (MINA), and Loopring (LRC), as upcoming ZKP whitelists and presales generate intense anticipation.

Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) have seen their ecosystem surge past $16 billion in market capitalization as of late 2025, projected to reach $669 million by 2032. Solana has rapidly emerged as a hub for DePIN projects, hosting over 50 projects with a collective market capitalization of $3.5 billion. While the sector experienced substantial growth in 2024, it struggled against other crypto metas in 2025, with tokens like Helium (HNT) battling support levels around $3.10-$3.20 in September 2025, having experienced a ""long, painful grind down."" However, Render (RENDER) found support at $6.80 and was poised for a potential 60% surge. Experts believe 2025 will be a ""breakthrough year"" for DePIN, transitioning from speculative excitement to infrastructure reality.

Account Abstraction and Intent-Centric Architecture are protocol-level innovations that, while not having directly associated investment tokens in the same way as L1s or specific dApps, indirectly impact the market by enhancing user experience and increasing utility. Increased adoption of these features could indirectly lead to higher trading volumes and liquidity on networks that support them, such as Ethereum (ETH), by simplifying transactions and onboarding more users. Ethereum itself experienced significant volatility, surging above $4,700 in early October 2025 due to institutional inflows, before dipping below $3,800 due to macro tensions and then rebounding.

Restaking, popularized by protocols like EigenLayer, has introduced a new ""yield meta,"" reshaping capital efficiency. EigenLayer's EIGEN token saw a dramatic 33% price increase in mid-September 2025, climbing from $1.50 to $2.09, driven by partnerships and broader risk sentiment improvements. However, EIGEN also experienced downward pressure, projected to prolong a negative trend in October 2025, with token unlocks (e.g., 36.82 million EIGEN tokens unlocked on October 1, 2025) contributing to supply. Trading in EIGEN surged over 260% in a 24-hour period during its rally but showed weak volume in mid-October, suggesting limited buying interest.

The broader market context, including a ""historic deleveraging event"" between October 10-14, 2025, saw an estimated $19-20 billion in leveraged positions liquidated. This was triggered by macro policy shifts, excessive market leverage, and a sharp drop in liquidity, with Bitcoin (BTC) plunging from over $126,000 to below $105,000. This event, while painful, is viewed by analysts as a crucial market reset, purging speculative excess and laying a healthier foundation for utility-driven growth.

The crypto community and ecosystem are demonstrating strong engagement and a largely positive sentiment towards these emerging technologies, viewing them as critical for addressing existing blockchain limitations, enhancing user experience, and driving mainstream Web3 adoption.

Modular Blockchains are met with strong positive sentiment, seen as a significant evolution from monolithic architectures. Discussions highlight their ability to enhance scalability, reduce transaction costs, and improve overall performance by separating core blockchain functions. Influencers recognize modular blockchains as setting a new standard for how crypto platforms scale and interact, emphasizing the full-stack flexibility they offer. Projects like Arbitrum, Manta Network, Celestia, Optimism, and Berachain are frequently highlighted. PancakeSwap is integrating Layer 2 modular solutions for faster DeFi trading, Solana is collaborating with modular ecosystems to offload data availability tasks, and Binance's (BNB) NFT platform is adopting modular models to handle traffic surges.

Sentiment around Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) is overwhelmingly enthusiastic. The crypto community views ZKPs as a revolutionary cryptographic technique poised to drive the next major bull run, with discussions frequently labeling upcoming ZKP whitelists and presales as ""rare entry points"" and ""Ethereum moments."" There's a palpable ""buzz"" on platforms like Crypto Twitter and Reddit, recognizing ZKPs as the ""math behind the next bull run"" and a ""missing link"" for widespread blockchain adoption. Influencers are actively championing ZKP projects, predicting they will redefine how digital societies adjudicate truth. ZKPs are crucial for scaling decentralized networks, ensuring transactional privacy, and enabling regulatory compliance, with projects like zkSync, StarkWare, and Polygon zkEVM experiencing renewed attention.

DePINs represent one of the hottest sectors of 2024, characterized by considerable excitement and optimism. The community sees DePINs as a foundational element for a resilient, user-empowered internet, promising enhanced security and improved uptime. There's a strong belief that DePINs will be instrumental in onboarding the next billion users into Web3. Major crypto influencers are ""betting heavily"" on DePINs as the ""next significant hype."" Leading projects include Helium (decentralized wireless), Akash Network (decentralized compute), and Filecoin (decentralized storage). IoTeX aims to onboard 100 million devices and unlock trillions of dollars in real-world value on-chain by 2025.

The community around Account Abstraction (AA) has expanded significantly, particularly with the widespread adoption of ERC-4337. Discussions center on AA's potential to revolutionize the user experience of on-chain interactions and accelerate mass adoption by making blockchain more intuitive and accessible. Ethereum developers, including Vitalik Buterin, are actively debating achieving ""long-term goal alignment"" for an account system revamp that incorporates quantum resistance and transaction batching. The anticipated inclusion of EIP-7702 in the Pectra upgrade in 2025 is considered a major development. AA is expected to lead to programmable wallets, enabling innovative use cases like subscription payments and social recovery.

The concept of Intent-Centric Architecture has gained significant traction, with major institutions like Paradigm identifying it as a top area of interest. The sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, focusing on its potential to drastically improve the Web3 user experience by simplifying complex blockchain interactions. Thought leaders consider intent-centric design one of the most critical UX and architectural shifts in Web3, highlighting its capacity to simplify onboarding, reduce errors, lower costs, and broaden adoption. This architecture is anticipated to streamline DeFi operations, enhance security, and improve user experience, with projects like Enso Finance's Intent Engine and Cow Swap already utilizing this approach.

Discussions surrounding Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) are marked by a sense of urgency and preparedness. The community acknowledges the impending threat of quantum computers potentially compromising current cryptographic systems. There is a strong focus on how to future-proof decentralized platforms. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has advocated for an account system revamp that includes quantum computer resistance. PQC is crucial for protecting wallet security, DeFi protocols, NFTs, digital identity, and interoperability bridges.

While Restaking has gained significant traction in DeFi for capital efficiency, and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a crucial privacy technology, specific widespread social media sentiment and community discussions for these particular aspects were not prominently detailed in the research leading up to October 15, 2025. However, their underlying technical importance is widely acknowledged.

The period from October 2025 onwards promises to be a pivotal era for the crypto market, characterized by the convergence and maturation of these emerging technologies, driving unprecedented growth and mainstream adoption.

In the short-term (October 2025 – 2027), the market will experience increased efficiency, improved user experiences, and a surge in institutional interest. Modular Blockchains will see increased deployment of appchains and wider adoption of ZK-Rollup platforms, significantly reducing gas fees and transaction times. Zero-Knowledge Proofs will drive the next bull run, with ZKP-based solutions projected to process over 60% of Ethereum's Layer-2 transactions by year-end 2025, unlocking new utility for Web3. DePINs will transition from speculative excitement to large-scale application, with their global market expected to surpass $32 billion by the end of 2025, becoming a cornerstone of digital infrastructure, especially driven by AI industry demand. Account Abstraction will accelerate crypto adoption by making Web3 as intuitive as mobile banking, removing barriers for millions of new users. Restaking will have a dramatic impact on the DeFi industry, boosting liquidity and yield, and attracting more individual and institutional investors. Intent-Centric Architecture will bring millions of new users into the Web3 ecosystem by making blockchain services feel as intuitive as regular apps, enabling new classes of AI-native protocols.

In the long-term (2028 Onwards), these technologies will fundamentally reshape the internet, financial systems, and digital interactions, moving towards a more private, secure, and user-centric Web3. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), though still maturing, will become crucial for enabling privacy-preserving computation on blockchains, facilitating the handling of sensitive institutional and personal data without decryption. This capability is vital for integrating blockchain into sectors requiring strict data confidentiality and regulatory compliance. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) will become an existential imperative. As quantum computers pose a tangible threat, all critical blockchain infrastructure and digital assets will undergo a mandatory transition to PQC, ensuring the long-term integrity and security of the digital economy.

Cross-cutting catalysts include continued institutional adoption and regulatory clarity, with approvals of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs driving significant inflows. The fusion of AI and blockchain is a major trend, with AI enhancing scalability, risk management, and powering AI agents interacting with DePINs and intent-centric systems. The tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWAs) is expected to accelerate, bridging traditional and digital finance. Enhanced UX/UI through Account Abstraction and Intent-Centric Architecture will be critical for mass adoption.

Strategic considerations for projects include embracing modularity, prioritizing user experience, leveraging ZKPs for privacy and scalability, exploring DePINs, and preparing for PQC migration. For investors, diversification into foundational infrastructure, identifying user-centric innovations, evaluating security and privacy roadmaps, monitoring the regulatory landscape, and looking for real-world utility are paramount. A long-term investment horizon is crucial, recognizing that the full impact of these emerging technologies will unfold over several years.

The crypto market in October 2025 is at a pivotal juncture, transitioning from speculative interest to a more mature, secure, scalable, and user-friendly ecosystem. The advancements in modularity, privacy (ZKPs, FHE), user experience (Account Abstraction, Intent-Centric Architecture), and long-term security (PQC) are directly addressing the historical barriers to mainstream adoption.

Key takeaways for crypto investors and enthusiasts:

The long-term significance of these technologies for crypto adoption cannot be overstated. They are the building blocks for a future where blockchain technology seamlessly integrates into global financial and digital infrastructure. This will lead to mainstream acceptance, driven by institutional integration, improved user experience, and the tokenization of real-world assets.

Final thoughts on what this means for crypto adoption: We are moving towards an era where interacting with crypto technologies will be as intuitive as using everyday apps, largely due to innovations in user experience and underlying infrastructure. The industry is professionalizing, attracting significant institutional capital, and building robust, compliant, and secure systems that will support billions of users.

Eric Trump, son of U.S. President Donald Trump and a co-founder of decentralized finance protocol WLFI$0.1381, said he is actively working on a real estate tokenization project tied to a building currently under development.

Teasing the plan in an interview with CoinDesk TV coming next week, he said the effort may offer fractional ownership to the public, potentially using the crypto rails built by World Liberty Financial.

""We are working on it as it pertains to one specific building that I'm doing right now,"" Trump said in the interview. ""I think it's going to be absolutely incredible.""

His comments followed Zach Witkoff, another WLFI co-founder, who floated plans to bring the Trump real estate portfolio onchain during a panel discussion at the Token2049 event in Singapore in early October.

Tokenization refers to the process of turning traditional assets such as bonds, credit, equity – or, as in this case – real estate into digital tokens that can be bought, sold and transferred on blockchain rails. It's a model increasingly explored by global banks and asset managers as a way to unlock liquidity and broaden investor access to traditionally exclusive asset classes.

Trump suggested in the interview on Wednesday that applying the tokenization model could open investment opportunities to his family's global base of supporters. He said he envisions offering micro-shares in ""high-profile properties"" directly to retail investors, instead of getting financing through traditional lenders.

""If I decided to build a hotel in Washington, D.C. or in Dubai or in New York, why do I have to go out using Deutsche Bank?"" he said. ""Why can't I go out to the masses?""

He described a model where investors might contribute as little as $1,000 to gain partial ownership of a building, with added benefits like hotel perks or exclusive access.

While details remain scarce, he indicated the initiative would be integrated with World Liberty Financial and its U.S. dollar stablecoin USD1. World Liberty Financial launched last year with a focus on merging crypto infrastructure with traditional financial services.

The protocol announced plans last month to roll out a debit card and retail application soon, a move that would make the USD1 stablecoin available for everyday payments, CoinDesk reported.

The full interview will air on October 21 on CoinDesk's YouTube channel.

Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple Labs, called out the Wall Street banking lobbyists who have sought to resist the movement of his company and other crypto firms into the banking sector and into the Federal Reserve's so-called master accounts.



The crypto sector ""should be held to the same standard"" on money-laundering protections and other illicit-finance safeguards as traditional financial businesses, Garlinghouse said at DC Fintech Week on Wednesday, agreeing with traditional bankers on that point. But the industry — as a result — ""should have the same access to infrastructure, like a Fed master account."" 

""You can't say one and then combat the other,"" Garlinghouse said of the demands that crypto be held to similar regulatory standards. ""It's hypocritical, and I think we all should call them out for being anti-competitive in that regard.""



Fed master accounts would allow crypto firms more seamless integration into the U.S. financial system and direct access to the central bank's systems — a benefit at the core of traditional banking. But they've run into challenges in getting the Fed to grant such access, or even to explain how it could be obtained.



Ripple recently applied for a master account through its Standard Custody & Trust Co. affiliate — a New York trust — at the same time that the prominent crypto firm also sought a federal banking charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in July.



Garlinghouse's company, which has also recently delved into the field of stablecoin issuers, said banks are finally taking them more seriously after years of difficulty in which the resistance from U.S. regulators made the financial firms reluctant to engage.



""I had meetings yesterday in New York City, where banks that would not have talked to us three years ago are now leaning in and saying, how could we partner around this?"" he said, confirming that those conversations involved Ripple's stablecoin effort, known as RLUSD.



He said granting crypto firms such as Ripple and Circle master accounts will contribute to more stability, regulatory oversight and risk mitigation.



""It's been a little disappointing to see some of the traditional banks start to lobby against things like that,"" Garlinghouse said.

While the recent wave of tokenized stocks has mostly targeted offshore users, a new platform called SoloTex aims to bring equity tokens to U.S. retail traders in a compliant way.

Texture Capital, a U.S.-based broker-dealer registered with the SEC and FINRA, said it has received regulatory approval to launch SoloTex, a retail trading venue that lets investors buy tokenized versions of U.S. equities with stablecoins like USDC$0.9999. The platform, built in partnership with tokenization firm Sologenic, is expected to go live by the end of 2025.

In an interview with CoinDesk, Texture Capital CEO Richard Johnson and Sologenic CEO Mike McCluskey said that SoloTex aims to distinguish itself from competitors by offering real share ownership with the tokens. The platform issues the tokens only when the underlying stock is purchased and holds real shares in regulated custody under U.S. legal frameworks, in contrast to offshore, synthetic structures or exposure through special purpose vehicles (SPV).

""We believe this is a first for the U.S. market and it sets the stage for a new era of asset ownership through tokenization,"" McCluskey said.

Tokenization of traditional assets has drawn growing interest from major financial firms and startups alike. Institutions like JPMorgan and Franklin Templeton have experimented with tokenizing assets like treasuries and money market funds. The process promises faster settlement, lower fees and broader market access and it could mushroom to a multitrillion-dollar market over the next decade, according to projections.

Tokenized stocks gained steam earlier this year as a roster of trading platforms and crypto exchanges rolled out tokenized equities including Gemini, Kraken, Bybit and Robinhood. But existing offerings have remained largely inaccessible to U.S. retail investors due to regulatory complexity. Meanwhile, synthetic stock tokens or exposure through special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that often don't provide actual share ownership. These products can lack regulatory oversight, introduce additional counterparty risks and trade at prices that drift from the real market due to limited liquidity.

These products can lack regulatory oversight, introduce additional counterparty risks and trade at prices that drift from the real market due to limited liquidity, according to McCluskey and Johnson.

On SoloTex, each trade mints a stock token on demand, representing a one-to-one claim on the actual share held in custody by the platform's clearing broker, they said. These tokens will provide full shareholder rights, including dividends and voting, and can be viewed alongside other crypto holdings in a self-custodied wallet.

""Offering actual tokenized U.S. equities to the U.S. market has always been the holy grail,"" said Ashley Ebersole, legal advisor for SoloTex, in a statement. ""SoloTex represents the leading edge of innovation within established regulatory architecture, and we will continue to innovate towards fully tokenized capital markets as regulations permit.""

Coinbase surprised crypto markets on Wednesday by unveiling a new issuer-facing listings program and, minutes later, adding BNB to its listing roadmap — an unexpected nod to the flagship token of its biggest rival.

At 4:12 p.m. UTC, the Coinbase Markets account on X introduced “The Blue Carpet,” a revamped asset-listing experience aimed at making the process more transparent for onchain builders. 

According to Coinbase's blog post, the bundle offers a direct line to the listings team for tailored guidance, the ability to request updates to an asset's page across Coinbase's centralized exchange and its retail DEX, referral discounts for services such as MiCA whitepaper support and market-maker matching, and limited Coinbase One subscriptions for select core team members. Coinbase reiterated that applications and listings are free and that issuers are not required to purchase ancillary services.

At 4:45 p.m. UTC, Coinbase Markets posted that BNB had been added to the roadmap. As with other roadmap items, the signal reflects intent rather than immediate availability. Roadmap inclusion does not ensure a listing; Coinbase can delay or decline assets if liquidity, technical, compliance, or other requirements are not satisfied. Coinbase said trading will be announced separately once sufficient market-making support and infrastructure are in place.

The timing is notable. 

Just nine days earlier, Arca CIO Jeff Dorman published a critique arguing Coinbase lists “some of the absolute worst assets” while ignoring “the best ones,” and he highlighted tokens issued by rival platforms — including BNB — as examples of high performers the exchange had historically not offered. He said an exchange should either list widely and be neutral, or curate the “best assets” like a broker, and faulted Coinbase for falling between those models. 

Dorman further contrasted BNB, LEO, TRX and HYPE — citing revenue-backed buybacks and strong tokenomics — with what he called inflationary tokens and opaque listing practices, framing Coinbase's approach as selectively exclusionary. Against that backdrop, adding BNB to the roadmap looks like a meaningful shift in posture, even if a listing is not guaranteed. 

Beyond its 2017 origins as a trading-fee token, BNB now serves as the primary gas asset for BNB Chain transactions and is used across that network for payments, staking, token launches and governance proposals — functioning as the chain's transaction fuel and utility token.

Pairing the Blue Carpet rollout with a high-profile roadmap addition signals Coinbase aims to court major nonnative assets when liquidity, compliance and technical standards are met — rival affiliations notwithstanding. 

At the time of writing, bnb was $1,164.33, down 4.7% in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin's October Slowdown Masks Strength, Analysts Predict Catch-Up With Gold

 Crypto analysts say the weekend's market volatility is temporary and are predicting an upward trend to emerge in the coming weeks. 

Bitcoin could reclaim its all-time high of $125,100 in the coming week, but not without one more major correction, according to veteran trader Peter Brandt.

“Either a huge shakeout, which would be confirmed by an ATH quickly within the next week or so,” he said, though he acknowledged there could also be a much more bearish outcome. 

The crypto market crashed on Friday after US President Donald Trump's announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, resulting in over $19 billion in liquidations across the market.

After dropping from around $121,000 to as low as $102,000 on Friday, Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded to approximately $112,400 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap.

“If anything, this weekend was a reminder you have to be so careful with leverage, and even multiples above 1.5x are dangerous,” Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards told Cointelegraph.

“They do, and you need to always consider multi-year, long-term risk,” he said. He said the weekend's volatility is temporary, and described his outlook for the coming weeks as simply “up.” 

Other analysts remain optimistic, citing broader macroeconomic signals as indications that fresh capital could flow into the cryptocurrency market in the coming weeks.

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said in an X post on Tuesday that a buying opportunity may be presenting itself in the crypto market after US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that quantitative tightening “is over.” 

“Back up the … truck and buy everything,” Hayes said. 

Quantitative easing is bullish for crypto as it encourages banks to lend more and makes borrowing cheaper for consumers and businesses through lower interest rates.

Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph on Tuesday that “the fundamental economic data is the big story for Bitcoin right now.”

“Inflation is facing a double whammy at the moment from lower oil prices and demand, and at the same time, the US labor market is showing signs of distress,” Hundal said, as US inflation reached 2.90% in August, the highest level since January.

“The Fed has a mandate to target full employment, and it all just feels inevitable that we'll see further rate cuts this month. This is a goldilocks zone for Bitcoin,” he said.

Meanwhile, macroeconomist Lyn Alden recently said on a podcast that she is leaning “toward this next quarter being probably pretty favorable” for Bitcoin.

 US spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs reversed course with fresh inflows after a wave of outflows following the recent market meltdown. 

US spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw inflows on Tuesday as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted further rate cuts may come before year-end. 

Spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs saw $102.58 million in net inflows, rebounding from a $326 million outflow a day earlier, according to data from SoSoValue. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) led gains with $132.67 million in inflows, while BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) posted a modest outflow of $30.79 million. 

Total net assets across all spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $153.55 billion, representing 6.82% of Bitcoin's market cap, while cumulative inflows stood at $62.55 billion.

Ether (ETH) ETFs mirrored the turnaround, recording $236.22 million in net inflows following Monday's steep $428 million outflow. Fidelity's Ethereum Fund (FETH) topped the list with $154.62 million, followed by Grayscale's Ethereum Fund (ETH) and Bitwise's Ethereum ETF (ETHW) with $34.78 million and $13.27 million, respectively.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled Tuesday that the US central bank is nearing the end of its balance sheet reduction program and is preparing for potential rate cuts as the labor market weakens.

Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics conference, Powell said the Fed may soon stop its “quantitative tightening” process, noting that reserves are “somewhat above the level” consistent with ample liquidity. 

“An October rate cut will have markets taking flight, with crypto and ETFs seeing liquidity flow and sharper moves,” Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of the Taiwan-based company Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph.

“Expect digital assets to feel the lift as capital seeks efficiency in a softer rate environment,” he added.

As Cointelegraph reported, crypto investment products showed strong resilience during last week's market turbulence, recording $3.17 billion in inflows despite a major flash crash triggered by renewed US-China tariff tensions, according to CoinShares.

CoinShares said Monday that last Friday's panic led to only $159 million in outflows, even as $20 billion in positions were liquidated across exchanges. The resilience helped push total inflows for 2025 to $48.7 billion, already surpassing last year's total.

“Easing US-China tariff tensions and a renewed debasement trade echoed in gold's strength are fueling fresh demand for digital assets,” Liu noted.

A Surgeon Explains the Alarming Rise of Lung Cancer in Nonsmoking Women

Thoracic surgeon Jonathan Villena explains why early screening for lung cancer is critical—even for those without symptoms.

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

Lung cancer is the deadliest cancer among women in the United States, surpassing the mortality numbers of breast and ovarian cancer combined. And surprisingly, younger women who have never smoked are increasingly being diagnosed with the disease.

Here to explain what could be driving this trend—and why early screening can make all the difference—is Jonathan Villena, a thoracic surgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among U.S. women, surpassing breast and ovarian cancer combined. Thoracic surgeon Jonathan Villena explains why younger nonsmoking women are increasingly affected—and how early screening could save lives.

Thank you so much for joining us.

Jonathan Villena: Thank you for having me.

Feltman: So our viewers and listeners might be surprised to hear that lung cancer [deaths] in women now tops breast cancer, ovarian cancer combined. Can you tell us more about what's going on there?

Villena: Yeah, definitely. So in general lung cancer is the number-one cancer [killing] people in the U.S., both men and women. If you look at the American Cancer Society, around 226 new—226,000 new cases of lung cancer are projected to be diagnosed in 2025. Of those about 50 percent are cancer-related deaths, meaning [roughly] 120,000 people die every year from lung cancer. Now, what's—the good news is that the incidence has actually been decreasing in the last few years.

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: If you look at the American Cancer Society's statistics, in the last 10 years [ of data, which goes through 2021], the, the incidence of lung cancer has decreased in men around 3 percent per year. And it's about half of that in women, meaning it's decreasing [roughly] 1.5 percent per year. So one of the reasons that they think that this might be happening is that there was an uptick in smoking in women around the '60s and '70s, and that's why we're seeing a slight, you know, decrease in the incidence in men but not so much in the women.

What's more interesting and very surprising is the fact that when you look at younger people, meaning less than 65 years old—especially younger never-smoking people—there's actually an increase of women in that subgroup. They're overrepresented, and that's something very surprising.

Feltman: Does the research offer us any clues about what's going on in this demographic of younger women?

Villena: Yeah, so there's been a lot of research. So, you know, in general—and something that people don't know is that about 20 percent of lung cancers actually occur in people that have never smoked in their entire lives.

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: This is something that we don't really understand why this happens to this one in five people, but there are some risk factors associated with it. Number one is exposure to radon, which is a natural gas that sometimes people are exposed to for a prolonged time. Number two is secondhand smoking ...

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: So they don't smoke directly, but they live in a household where they smoke. And number three are kind of other environmental factors, things such as working in a specific, you know, manufacturing plant that deals with specific chemicals. And then lastly, the one that has had, actually, had a lot of research into it are genetic factors. There's definitely a preponderance of certain mutations in somebody's genes that can cause lung cancer, and that is overrepresented in women.

Feltman: Do women face any unique challenges in getting diagnosed or treated when it comes to lung cancer?

Villena: So, yes. First of all, you know, how do we treat or catch lung cancer? So the newest and, and latest way of catching this disease is actually through lung cancer screening.That's something that's relatively new; it's only happened in the last 10 years. And that's in certain demographics, meaning that if someone is over 50 years old and they have smoked more than one pack per day for 20 years, they meet the criteria for lung cancer screening, which is basically a radiograph or a CAT scan of their lungs. That's the way that we pick up lung cancer.

That's the—almost the exact same thing that people have for breast cancer, such as mammography, or colonoscopy. So that's before any symptoms come in. That's really just to try to capture it when it's in very nascent stages, right?

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Villena: Where it's very small or not symptomatic. And that's the way we diagnose a, a lot of lung cancer.

Now, that being said, there's a couple of things. So first of all, [roughly] 60 to 70 percent of people, like, in general get mammographies.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Villena: [About] 60 to 70 percent of people get colonoscopies. Only 6 percent of people actually get lung cancer screening. So it's dismally low.

Feltman: Yeah.

Villena: The reason being that sometimes people don't know about it; it's relatively new. Sometimes even doctors don't know about it. There's also a little bit of guilt involved, where people, you know, they think they did it to themselves by smoking ...

Feltman: Hmm.

Villena: So they don't wanna go do it. The second thing is that, as you could imagine, this is only for high-risk individuals or people that have a history of smoking, all right? So it misses these never-smoking one in five patients. So that's one of the things that we're actively working on.

Feltman: Yeah, how else does the, you know, the stigma associated with lung cancer because of its association with smoking, how does that impact people's ability to get diagnosed and treated?

Villena: I think there's a lot of hesitancy between patients. There's, you know, a recent study that showed that people are more—have more tendency to downplay their smoking history, meaning that if they quit, let's say 10 years ago, you tell your doctor that you never smoked.

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: And that's something very common. Or if you smoked, you know, one pack a day, maybe you say you smoked half a pack a day because you feel that guilt. So then you don't give your doctor or your caretaker the full picture. And sometimes that prevents you from getting these tests, right? So there's definitely that attitude.

There's also a bit of a fatalistic attitude, sort of like, “I did it to myself. I'd rather not know. You know, this is something that—you know, I made that choice, and if I get cancer, that's my choice.” Right? So that's, that's also another attitude that we're constantly trying to change in patients. You know, the treatment, once you capture it, is all the same, but really it's about getting screening and it's about finding the lung cancer.

Feltman: So with smoking no longer necessarily being the driving factor, at least in this younger demographic, what kinds of risk factors should we be talking about more?

Villena: So I think, you know—so smoking is always number one.

Feltman: Sure.

Villena: In the never-smoking people it's either radon, secondhand smoking or environmental factors, and then a little bit of genetics plays, plays a part.

Radon is something that people can test for in their homes. It's something that people should read up on. So that's number one: if you have exposure to that, to get rid of that.

If you are in, in an environment, let's say you work with chemicals that you think, you know, are astringent or have caused—causes you to have coughs or, you know, affects you in any sort of way, to kind of try to talk to your employer to work in a more ventilated setting.

Really important with genetic factors is understanding your family history.

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: If you have a mother, a grandmother, a grandfather who died of cancer or you have a lot of cancer in your family, sometimes understanding that and knowing that from your, you know, from your family perspective will actually clue a doctor in to doing further tests, to looking into that further, 'cause that sometimes is passed down and you can have the same genes.

Feltman: Are there any big research questions that scientists need to answer about lung cancer, specifically in young women?

Villena: So, you know, there's so much to look at, all right? So if we think about just the genetic aspect of it, there's one specific gene called the EGFR gene—or it's a mutation that's found in lung cancer that in, if you look at all people with lung cancer, it's found in about 15 percent ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Villena: Of the population with lung cancer. Now, if you look at never-smoking Asian women that get lung cancer, it's about 60 percent of them ...

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: Have that mutation. So the important thing about that EGFR mutation is there's a specific drug for that mutation, all right?

So there's definitely a lot of genetic kind of information that we're still actively researching. But the important thing about this genetic information is that there's drugs targeted specifically for those mutations. So the more we know, the more we understand, the better.

Feltman: So for folks who are hearing this and are surprised and, and maybe concerned what is your advice for how they should proceed, how they should look into their risk factors?

Villena: You know, I think one of the, the, the major aspects of health in general is understanding your own health.

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: I think that younger people tend to delay care, tend to not see their doctors, and because, one, they're busy, right, at their very busy moment in their lives. But second is that, you know, you don't wanna deal with it, and you think that you will not get cancer, that you will not get this disease because you're young and you've never smoked and you've never done anything bad.

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: But, you know, you have to be very aware of your body, so what are the kind of top four symptoms? So number one, let's say you have a cough, and that cough lasts for longer than two weeks, right?

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Villena: A normal cold, things like that will go away after a couple of weeks. But if it's there for a couple of months, and I've definitely seen patients that tell me in retrospect, you know, “I've had this cough for three months,” right, and it should have been checked up sooner. So understanding yourself, understanding your body, not, you know, waiting for things, not procrastinating, which is very hard to do, but you should definitely see your doctor ...

Feltman: Yeah.

Villena: Regularly.

Second is, like I said before, understanding your family, right, and what your genetic makeup is, right? Knowing your family history, understanding if your parents, grandparents had cancer, etcetera, or other chronic diseases.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Villena: And that's, that's basically the, the major aspects of it. It's really being in tune with yourself.

Feltman: So once a patient is actually diagnosed, what does treatment look like?

Villena: So treatment for lung cancer, actually, is heavily dependent on the stage. There's everything from stage 1, in which it's localized to one portion of a lung, to stage 4, where it actually has gone to other parts of the body.

Now, stage 1 disease, you basically need a simple surgery, where that lung nodule, or that lung cancer, is surgically removed, and typically you don't need any other treatments. So stage 1 is what we look for. Stage 1 is the reason that lung cancer screening works because stage 1 doesn't really have any symptoms ...

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: So when you find it that early patients do very well.

Stage 4, once it's left the lung, you are no longer a surgical candidate, unless in, you know, sometimes very specific cases, but for the most part you're no longer a surgical candidate. And there you need systemic treatments.

Feltman: And how long does the treatment tend to take for a stage 1 patient, if it's just a surgical procedure?

Villena: So if it's just a surgical procedure, look, I do these surgeries all the time: the patient comes in; we do the surgery; the patients usually go home the next day.

Feltman: Wow.

Villena: And then we follow the patient and get CAT scans every six months for a long time to make sure nothing comes back or nothing new comes. So it's pretty straightforward, and we do this all the time. We do these surgeries robotically now. Patients recover incredibly well, and they're out, you know, doing—living their lives in a couple of weeks. So it's really something very, very, very efficient.

Feltman: Yeah, so huge incentive to get checked early.

Villena: Mm-hmm.

Feltman: Are there any advances in treatment, you know, any new treatments that doctors are excited about?

Villena: Yeah, so there's two major steps forward that have changed lung cancer treatment. Number one is something called targeted therapy.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Villena: So that means that there's a drug that targets a specific mutation. So just how I was speaking about earlier about the EGFR mutation in young, never-smoking Asian women, there is a drug that targets that mutation that has really shown amazing results at all stages now.

And the second one is actually immunotherapy, which won the Nobel Prize, which is this idea that you can use your own body's immune system to kill the cancer cell. So cancer is very smart—what it does is it evades your immune system; it pretends that it's part of your own body. And what this drug does is that it basically reawakens your immune system to recognize that cancer again and kill it. And we've seen amazing results, even in the stage 4 patients, where they are potentially cured of cancer, which, which we've never seen before.

Feltman: What motivated you to get into this specialty?

Villena: You know, I do have a family history of this in an uncle that passed away from lung cancer ...

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: And he was a heavy smoker. And, you know, I saw how, basically, decimated his, he was—[his] life [was], basically. He was a very vibrant guy, he was very active, and in six months he was gone, right?

And I think, you know, once I started getting into, you know, medical school and understanding things, one of the major things that I really got into was research. And I see that if my uncle had been treated 20 years ago, he potentially could have been saved ...

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: Because of these advances in research. And right now we are right at the cusp where we are learning all these new things, and we actually have the tools to change how patients are treated, you know? And this—every year there's a new treatment, which prior to that, there was no new treatment; i t was basically just chemo, and that's it, all right? So I think that that really motivated me—something that I can actually take part in and actually change the course for a lot of people.

Men's Brains Shrink Faster than Women's. What That Means for Alzheimer's

Women's brains age more slowly than men's, but they still have higher rates of Alzheimer's disease

During ageing, men experience a greater reduction in volume across more regions of the brain than women do, according to a longitudinal study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The authors suggest this means that age-related brain changes do not explain why women are more frequently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease than men are.

“It's really important that we understand what happens in the healthy brain so that we can better understand what happens when people get these neurodegenerative conditions,” says Fiona Kumfor, a clinical neuropsychologist at the University of Sydney, Australia. This study adds to scientists' understanding of typical brain ageing, she adds.

Nearly twice as many women are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease as men, and ageing is the biggest risk factor for the disease. This has prompted research into age-related sex differences in the brain. “If women's brains declined more, that could have helped explain their higher Alzheimer's prevalence,” says co-author Anne Ravndal, a PhD student at the University of Oslo.

Previous research investigating sex differences in brain ageing has shown mixed results, Ravndal adds. Several studies have found that men experience greater loss of total grey matter and hippocampus size compared with women, whereas other work has reported a sharper decline of grey matter in women.

The latest study included more than 12,500 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans from 4,726 people — at least two scans per person, taken an average of three years apart — who did not have Alzheimer's disease or any cognitive impairments and were control participants in 14 larger data sets. The researchers compared how the individuals' brain structures changed over time, looking at factors including the thickness of grey matter and the size of areas that are associated with Alzheimer's disease, such as the hippocampus, which is essential to memory.

Overall, men experienced a greater reduction in volume across more regions of the brain than women did. For example, the postcentral cortex, which is responsible for processing sensations of touch, pain and temperature, as well as the body's own position and movements, declined by 2.0% per year in men and by 1.2% annually in women.

Kumfor says the results suggest that men age faster than women do. Men also have a shorter life expectancy.

If these changes did have a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, the study would have shown that women experience a greater decline in areas associated with the disease, such as the hippocampus and precuneus, which are involved in memory, says Amy Brodtmann, a clinician researcher in cognitive health at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.

Ravndal says the results point to other possible explanations for the sex differences in prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, such as differences in survival or susceptibility to the disease.

That sex differences in brain volume don't seem to play a part in the condition is not entirely surprising, says Kumfor, because neurodegenerative conditions are complex. Understanding the disorders will require longitudinal studies involving people with Alzheimer's disease, to compare how their brains change over time. “Just looking at age-related changes in brain atrophy is unlikely to explain the complexities behind it,” she adds.

Although the study is robust, further investigations with more diverse data sets are needed, says Brodtmann. For example, people included in the study had high levels of education — a protective factor against Alzheimer's disease — meaning that they were not fully representative of the general population. The data sets also lacked information about other factors that influence a person's risk of Alzheimer's disease, such as ethnicity and the age at which women experience menopause.

The authors say that when they adjusted their analysis for education level, some parts of men's brains no longer showed a steeper decline than occurred in women. When they compared men and women who were predicted to live for the same number of years, rather than those of the same age, the two groups' brains declined at similar rates.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Woah—Scientists Just Made Warm Ice","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a69022700/warm-ice/","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

Scientists created this new phase of ice—known as Ice XXI—by supercompressing water to 20,000 times normal pressure in just 10 milliseconds.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Ice isn't all that complicated. Gather together some H20 molecules, drop the thermostat to zero degrees Celsius (at atmospheric pressures) and voila—ice. So, it may come as a surprise that there isn't just one molecular arrangement, or “phase,” of ice. In fact, there are 20 phases of ice, all denoted with Roman numerals from I to XX. 

Now, in a new study published in the journal Nature Materials, scientists from the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) have now found yet another phase, appropriately named Ice XXI. At the heart of the experiment, scientists used diamond anvil cells (DACs)—a common device used in materials science for squeezing samples under immense pressure—to subject water to 2 gigapascals (20,000 times higher than normal atmosphere) of pressure in just 10 milliseconds. Then, they utilized state-of-the art X-ray facilities like the European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser Facility (XFEL) and PETRA III to visualize the structure.

The scientists call this kind of water “supercompressed,” and it's metastable, meaning it persists for a time even when another form of ice would be more stable. And because of the immense pressure, ice forms at room temperature but the molecules are much more densely packed. 

“Rapid compression of water allows it to remain liquid up to higher pressures, where it should have already crystallized to ice VI,” Geun Woo Lee, a co-author of the study from RISS, said in a press statement. “The structure in which liquid H2O crystallizes depends on the degree of supercompression of the liquid.”

Compressing the water is only part of this high-tech experiment, though, as scientists also need to meticulously document the water's molecular journey during those handful of milliseconds. The European XFEL produces X-ray flashes that capture an image every microsecond, which is one millionth of a second. This basically creates an ultra-advanced high-speed camera that shows the ice phase formation in motion.

Then, the team used the P02.2 beamline at PETRA III to conduct diffraction experiments to understand the overall structure of Ice XXI, which has a tetragonal structure composed of large repetitive units called “unit cells” that contain 152 water molecules. Using DACs to examine materials under immense pressures is a common way for scientists—especially geologists—to glimpse the inner workings of Earth. These high-pressure ice experiments similarly aim to help experts understand hard-to-reach physics.

“Our findings suggest that a greater number of high-temperature metastable ice phases and their associated transition pathways may exist, potentially offering new insights into the composition of icy moons,” Rachel Husband, a co-author of the study from Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron's (DESY), said in a press statement. 

The idea isn't as far-fetched as one from a study in 2021, which focused on how the superionic Ice XVIII and Ice XX phases might lie at the heart of the formation of the unusual magnetic fields found on Neptune and Uranus. In other words, unlocking the mysteries of ice on Earth could help us unlock an unknown number of mysteries throughout the cosmos.

A natural sweetener derived from the Stevia plant could have a previously unknown superpower.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Few people like going bald—there's a reason why hair growth is a multi-billion industry. One of the leading causes of hair loss is androgenetic alopecia, otherwise known as pattern hair loss, which impacts up to 50 percent of both men and women. One of the most widespread medications for baldness, which is the active ingredient in products like Rogaine, is minoxidil (originally developed to treat high blood pressure).

While this treatment has helped many people grow hair, it does come with a few downsides. Standard treatments typically have poor water solubility and skin permeability, so some hair growth experts resort to applying minoxidil with microneedling, a technique that punctures small holes in the top layer of the skin to stimulate growth factors and increase the medication's absorption. 

As described in a new study, scientists from China and Australia have developed a dissolving patch that can perform this microneedling work while also delivering a dose of minoxidil to the scalp, and it's derived from a somewhat unlikely ingredient: Stevioside (STV), the natural sweetener derived from the Stevia plant. The results of the study were published in the journal Advanced Healthcare Materials.

“Using STV as a novel solubilizing agent, we incorporated minoxidil into a dissolving microneedle patch, which was used to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of minoxidil and overcome the limitations of traditional carrier single-function approaches,” the authors wrote in the study. “This method not only enhances drug penetration into skin but also eliminates other issues associated with traditional topical formulations, such as slow onset of action and/or inaccurate dosing.”

As the authors note, while testosterone doesn't directly cause baldness, the enzyme 5α-reductase converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone, which triggers the apoptosis (or death) of keratin-producing cells in the epidermis. Minoxidil, however, suppresses certain enzymes and inhibits androgen receptors, which has the net effect of decreasing the formation and binding of dihydrotestosterone. It also boosts aromatase, which converts testosterone into estradiol—a kind of estrogen that further stimulates hair growth.

To test their new idea, researchers used mouse models with androgenetic alopecia and tested their new patch against standard treatments. In 35 days, scientists saw hair regrowth in 67 percent of the target area, compared to only 25 percent from the control group—a promising start for this Stevia-based hair loss treatment. Of course, mice are one thing, and humans are another.

“While the mouse model results are promising, human hair growth cycles differ, and androgenetic alopecia is influenced by multiple factors,” Lifeng Kang, a co-author of the study from the University of Sydney, told Gizmodo. “Therefore, clinical trials are essential to confirm efficacy and safety in humans.”

Unwanted hair loss isn't a thing of the past (at least, not yet), but science has it in its crosshairs—no pun intended.

The relationship between the sites means an earthquake in one zone can trigger an earthquake in the other in a phenomenon called “stress triggering.”

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Researchers hoping to unravel the dance of earthquake movement in North America's West Coast discovered a disturbing fact: Two of the world's largest fault lines sometimes work in conjunction. History, as it turns out, shows that an earthquake in either the Cascadia Subduction Zone or the San Andreas Fault can trigger an earthquake in the other. 

In a new study published in the journal Geosphere, researchers from Oregon State University—led by Chris Goldfinger, a marine geologist and geophysicist—show evidence of what's called “partial synchronization” of the northern San Andreas Fault and Cascadia Subduction Zone. Partial synchronization basically means that an earthquake event in one zone has a history of triggering events in the other, and the historical evidence of “significant interaction” between the two (and the potential for more in the future) should be taken as a warning. 

The core piece of evidence of this relationship comes from the seabed. The team mined 130 sediment cores (dating back 3,100 years) from the Mendocino Triple Junction—where the Cascadia Subduction Zone's Juan de Fuca plate and Gorda plate (under the North American Plate) rendezvous with the San Andreas Fault off the coast of northern California. There, the sediment layers showed unusual turbidite (the layers formed by marine landslides moving the ocean floor) action, which is often a telltale sign of an earthquake. 

A typical turbidite features coarse sediment at the bottom with the finer silt settling at the top. At the Mendocino Triple Junction, however, that structure was flipped and “seem[ed] to be upside down with all the sand at the top,” Goldfinger told Scientific American. “And as far as we know, gravity hasn't changed.”

That likely implies those unique turbidite formations were stacked by two earthquakes, one from each zone, in quick succession—a matter of years or even minutes apart. The study shows that eight of the turbidite bends have “substantial temporal overlap” between the Cascadia Subduction Zone and the San Andreas Fault, and that the last major synchronization earthquake event occurred around 1700.

Goldfinger compared the situation to tuning a radio to convert incoming signals. “When you tune an old radio, you're essentially causing one oscillator to vibrate at the same frequency as the other one,” he said. “When these faults synchronize, one fault could tune up the other and cause earthquakes in pairs.” 

Just because it's been over 300 years since the last paired quake, however, it doesn't eliminate future possibilities. “We could expect that an earthquake on one of the faults alone would draw down the resources of the whole country to respond to it,” Goldfinger told The Guardian. “If they both went off together, then you've got potentially San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver [B.C.] all in an emergency situation in a compressed timeframe.”

While there were only eight major events, the evidence showed the two areas were so closely linked that near-simultaneous quakes weren't so much a rarity as a rule. 

“In the paper we stuck to the geology instead of dwelling on the potential doom and gloom,” Goldfinger said. “But it's pretty clear that if something like this happened—and we think the evidence for it is strong—we need to be prepared.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This type of meat supercharges muscle growth after workouts","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251015032318.htm","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 15:03:26 GMT","

A new study examined how muscles respond to weight training when people eat different types of pork afterward. Researchers compared high-fat and lean ground pork burgers that contained the same amount of protein to see how each affected short-term muscle growth. The results surprised the team and added to growing evidence that the body's muscle-building process after exercise depends not just on how much protein is consumed, but on the type of protein as well.

The research was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

""What we're finding is that not all high-quality animal protein foods are created equal,"" said Nicholas Burd, a professor of health and kinesiology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, who led the research with graduate student Žan Zupančič.

Burd's previous work revealed similar patterns. One earlier experiment showed that eating whole eggs after weight training led to greater muscle-protein synthesis than eating the same amount of protein from egg whites alone. Another study found that eating salmon produced a stronger muscle-building response than consuming a processed blend with the same nutrients in identical proportions.

Together, these findings suggest that whole foods stimulate muscle growth more effectively after exercise than processed versions do. Burd noted that in some cases, the natural fat content of whole foods might actually enhance muscle-building activity.

In this latest study, the research team used advanced techniques to measure and track muscle-protein synthesis in 16 young, physically active adults. To prepare the test meals, they collaborated with the University of Illinois Meat Science Laboratory to create pork patties with precisely defined fat levels.

""That took us a year because it was so hard to get those fat ratios correct,"" Burd said. All of the meat came from a single pig, and the patties were sent to an external lab for detailed nutrient analysis. Once the fat-to-lean ratios and other nutritional values were verified, the burgers were frozen until used during the experiment's feeding phase.

Before participants began the workout and meal trials, they received an infusion of isotope-labeled amino acids. This technique allowed the scientists to monitor how quickly those amino acids were integrated into muscle tissue. Blood samples were also collected throughout the process to measure circulating amino acid levels.

Muscle biopsies were taken both before and after the two-hour infusion to establish a baseline for muscle-protein synthesis.

""And then we took them to the gym,"" Burd said. ""And they were wheeling that infusion pump and everything else with them.""

At the gym, participants performed leg presses and leg extensions, then returned to the lab to eat one of three test meals: a high-fat pork burger, a lean pork burger, or a carbohydrate drink. Five hours later, the researchers took another muscle biopsy to measure how the meal and exercise together affected protein synthesis.

After several days of recovery, 14 of the 16 volunteers repeated the process but switched meal types to ensure that individual differences did not skew the results.

As expected, amino acid levels in the blood rose sharply after eating pork compared with the carbohydrate drink. However, those who consumed the lean pork burger showed the largest increases in amino acids -- both total and essential.

""When you see an increased concentration of amino acids in the blood after you eat, you get a pretty good idea that that is coming from the food that you just ate,"" Burd said.

Those who consumed the lean pork burger after a bout of weight training also had a greater rate of muscle-protein synthesis than those who ate the high-fat pork burger. This was a surprise to Burd, as ""the previous studies using fattier foods, such as whole eggs or salmon, generally showed enhanced post-exercise muscle-protein synthesis compared with lower fat food such as egg whites or nutritional supplements,"" he said.

Although weight training boosted muscle-protein synthesis in the groups eating pork, the protein in the high-fat burger seemed to have no added benefit in the hours after participants consumed it, while the protein in the lean pork gave muscle-protein synthesis a boost.

""For some reason, the high-fat pork truly blunted the response,"" Burd said. ""In fact, the people who ate the high-fat pork only had slightly better muscle-building potential than those who drank a carbohydrate sports beverage after exercise.""

Interpreting the results of this study for people who want to optimize muscle gains from weight-training is tricky, Burd said. It could be that processing the ground pork patties, which involved grinding the meat and adding the fattier meat to the lean, affected the kinetics of digestion.

""There was a little larger rise in the amino acids available from eating lean pork, so it could have been a bigger trigger for muscle-protein synthesis,"" Burd said. ""But that seems to be specific to the ground pork. If you're eating other foods, like eggs or salmon, the whole foods appear to be better despite not eliciting a large rise in blood amino acids.""

Burd stresses that exercise is the strongest stimulus for muscle-protein synthesis.

""Most of the muscle response is to weight-training, and we use nutrition to try to squeeze out the remaining potential,"" he said. ""When it comes to eating after weight-training, what we're finding is that some foods, particularly whole, unprocessed foods seem to be a better stimulus.""

Burd also is a professor of nutritional sciences and is affiliated with the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at the U. of I.

The National Pork Board's Pork Checkoff program supported this research. The funder had no involvement in study design, data collection or analysis.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","MIT scientists find metals hold secret atomic patterns","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251014014427.htm","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 03:54:31 GMT","

For years, scientists have known that tiny chemical patterns can form inside metal alloys, but most assumed these patterns were insignificant or disappeared during manufacturing. Recent experiments have shown that in controlled lab conditions, such patterns can actually influence how metals behave -- affecting their strength, durability, heat resistance, and even how well they withstand radiation.

Researchers at MIT have now discovered that these subtle chemical arrangements also persist in metals made through standard industrial processes. The unexpected finding points to a new physical principle that explains why these patterns remain.

In a study published in Nature Communications, the MIT team detailed how they identified and analyzed the patterns, uncovering the physics that drives them. They also developed a model that predicts how these patterns form, allowing engineers to potentially adjust them to fine-tune a metal's properties for use in aerospace, semiconductor, or nuclear applications.

""The conclusion is: You can never completely randomize the atoms in a metal. It doesn't matter how you process it,"" explains Rodrigo Freitas, the TDK Assistant Professor in the MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering. ""This is the first paper showing these non-equilibrium states that are retained in the metal. Right now, this chemical order is not something we're controlling for or paying attention to when we manufacture metals.""

For Freitas, an early-career researcher, the discovery validates his decision to pursue a problem many others thought was already settled. He credits support from the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research's Young Investigator Program and the collaborative effort of his team, which includes three MIT PhD students -- Mahmudul Islam, Yifan Cao, and Killian Sheriff -- as co-first authors.

""There was the question of whether I should even be tackling this specific problem because people have been working on it for a long time,"" Freitas says. ""But the more I learned about it, the more I saw researchers were thinking about this in idealized laboratory scenarios. We wanted to perform simulations that were as realistic as possible to reproduce these manufacturing processes with high fidelity. My favorite part of this project is how non-intuitive the findings are. The fact that you cannot completely mix something together, people didn't see that coming.""

From surprises to theories

Freitas and his team began with a simple question: how quickly do elements mix during the processing of metals? Conventional thinking suggested that there comes a point where metals become completely uniform at the atomic level during manufacturing. Finding that point, they believed, could help design alloys with varying levels of short-range atomic order.

Using advanced machine-learning tools, the researchers simulated how millions of atoms moved and rearranged during metal processing.

""The first thing we did was to deform a piece of metal,"" Freitas explains. ""That's a common step during manufacturing: You roll the metal and deform it and heat it up again and deform it a little more, so it develops the structure you want. We did that and we tracked chemical order. The thought was as you deform the material, its chemical bonds are broken and that randomizes the system. These violent manufacturing processes essentially shuffle the atoms.""

Yet the metals didn't behave as expected. Despite extreme processing, the alloys never reached a completely random state. The result puzzled the team since no existing theory could account for it.

""It pointed to a new piece of physics in metals,"" the researchers write in the paper. ""It was one of those cases where applied research led to a fundamental discovery.""

To explore further, they built high-precision computational models to capture how atoms interact and statistical methods to measure how order evolves over time. Through large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, they watched how atoms reorganized during deformation and heating.

The team observed that certain atomic arrangements appeared at unexpectedly high temperatures, and even more remarkably, entirely new patterns emerged that had never been seen outside of real-world manufacturing. They described these patterns as ""far-from-equilibrium states.""

They then developed a simplified model to reproduce the main features of the simulations. The model revealed that these patterns originate from defects in metals known as dislocations -- irregular, three-dimensional distortions in the atomic lattice. When the metal is deformed, dislocations twist and shift, nudging nearby atoms into preferred positions. Previously, researchers thought this process destroyed all atomic order, but the MIT team found the opposite: dislocations actually favor certain atomic exchanges, creating subtle but stable patterns.

""These defects have chemical preferences that guide how they move,"" Freitas says. ""They look for low energy pathways, so given a choice between breaking chemical bonds, they tend to break the weakest bonds, and it's not completely random. This is very exciting because it's a non-equilibrium state: It's not something you'd see naturally occurring in materials. It's the same way our bodies live in non-equilibrium. The temperature outside is always hotter or colder than our bodies, and we're maintaining that steady state equilibrium to stay alive. That's why these states exist in metal: the balance between an internal push toward disorder plus this ordering tendency of breaking certain bonds that are always weaker than others.""

Applying a new theory

The researchers are now exploring how these chemical patterns develop across a wide range of manufacturing conditions. The result is a map that links various metal processing steps to different chemical patterns in metal.

To date, this chemical order and the properties they tune have been largely considered an academic subject. With this map, the researchers hope engineers can begin thinking of these patterns as levers in design that can be pulled during production to get new properties.

""Researchers have been looking at the ways these atomic arrangements change metallic properties -- a big one is catalysis,"" Freitas says of the process that drives chemical reactions. ""Electrochemistry happens at the surface of the metal, and it's very sensitive to local atomic arrangements. And there have been other properties that you wouldn't think would be influenced by these factors. Radiation damage is another big one. That affects these materials' performance in nuclear reactors.""

Researchers have already told Freitas the paper could help explain other surprise findings about metallic properties, and he's excited for the field to move from fundamental research into chemical order to more applied work.

""You can think of areas where you need very optimized alloys like aerospace,"" Freitas says. ""They care about very specific compositions. Advanced manufacturing now makes it possible to combine metals that normally wouldn't mix through deformation. Understanding how atoms actually shuffle and mix in those processes is crucial, because it's the key to gaining strength while still keeping the low density. So, this could be a huge deal for them.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This European treatment for joint pain just passed a major scientific test","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251015032316.htm","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 14:47:55 GMT","

A new randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial suggests that a single round of low-dose radiation therapy could offer a safe and effective alternative for people suffering from painful knee osteoarthritis.

Participants with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis experienced notable pain reduction and improved mobility within four months of receiving the treatment. The radiation exposure was only a tiny fraction of what is used in cancer therapy. Because the study included a control group that underwent a simulated treatment, researchers were able to clearly separate genuine treatment effects from placebo responses, which are common in osteoarthritis trials. Early results from this Korean study were presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Annual Meeting.

""People with painful knee osteoarthritis often face a difficult choice between the risks of side effects from pain medications and the risks of joint replacement surgery,"" said Byoung Hyuck Kim, MD, PhD, principal investigator on the trial and an assistant professor of radiation oncology at Seoul National University College of Medicine, Boramae Medical Center. ""There's a clinical need for moderate interventions between weak pain medications and aggressive surgery, and we think radiation may be a suitable option for those patients especially when drugs and injections are poorly tolerated.""

Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting an estimated 32.5 million adults in the United States. It develops as the cartilage that cushions bone ends wears away over time. The condition often targets the knees and hips, limiting mobility and diminishing quality of life. Typical treatment begins with lifestyle adjustments and pain-relief medications, with surgery considered when symptoms become severe.

Low-dose radiation therapy has long been used in European countries such as Germany and Spain to treat joint pain, where it is widely accepted. However, Dr. Kim noted that before this study, rigorous placebo-controlled evidence was scarce, and awareness of the treatment remained low among clinicians in other parts of the world.

""There is a misconception that medicinal, or therapeutic, radiation is always delivered in high doses,"" he said. ""But for osteoarthritis, the doses are only a small fraction of what we use for cancer, and the treatment targets joints that are positioned away from vital organs, which lowers the likelihood of side effects."" In this study, he explained, the radiation dose was less than 5% of what is typically used in cancer therapy, and no radiation-related side effects were observed.

The multicenter study included 114 participants with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis, recruited from three academic hospitals in Korea. They were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a very low dose (0.3 Gy), a low dose (3 Gy), or a control group that received simulated (sham) radiation. In the placebo group, patients went through the same setup as those receiving treatment, but no radiation was actually delivered. Each participant underwent six treatment sessions without knowing which group they were assigned to.

To ensure the results reflected the true effects of radiation, the researchers restricted the use of additional pain relievers, allowing only acetaminophen as needed during the four-month follow-up period. The effectiveness of treatment was evaluated using internationally recognized standards, identifying a participant as a ""responder"" if they achieved meaningful improvement in at least two of three measures: pain, physical function, and overall assessment of their condition. Participants also completed separate questionnaires addressing pain, stiffness, and mobility. No treatment-related side effects were reported.

After four months, 70% of patients in the 3 Gy group met responder criteria, compared to 42% in the placebo group (p=0.014). Outcomes in the 0.3 Gy group were not significantly different from the control group (58.3% improved, p=0.157), indicating the 3 Gy regimen drove relief beyond placebo effects.

Meaningful improvements in the composite score of pain, stiffness and physical function were reported more often in the 3 Gy group (56.8%) than in the placebo group (30.6%, p=0.024). For other secondary outcomes, including the amount of pain medication needed, there were no significant differences.

Dr. Kim said this trial differed from previous research in two critical ways. ""The sham-controlled design helped rule out placebo effects, and we limited stronger analgesics, which made differences between groups more clearly attributable to the radiation itself,"" he said.

""In previous studies, drugs such as NSAIDs or opioids were also used during the intervention or follow-up period. But using these pain relievers could mask the effects of radiation therapy,"" he said. Because analgesic use was limited to acetaminophen only during the four months of follow-up in this trial, ""that means the differences between treatment groups are more clearly attributable to the low-dose radiation therapy itself.""

Responses in the placebo arms were substantial -- about 40% met the criteria for treatment response without true radiation -- but are consistent with rates reported in prior osteoarthritis trials of injections or medications and in at least one similar European study, Dr. Kim said. ""It was surprising, and it underscores how important placebo-controlled designs are in osteoarthritis research. We need to examine this more closely in future studies.""

Radiation therapy may be best suited for patients with underlying inflammation and preserved joint structure, he explained. ""For severe osteoarthritis, where the joint is physically destroyed and cartilage is already gone, radiation will not regenerate tissue,"" Dr. Kim said. ""But for people with mild to moderate disease, this approach could delay the need for joint replacement.""

He emphasized that low-dose radiation should be considered as part of shared decision-making alongside standard measures such as weight loss, physiotherapy, and medications. ""In clinical practice, responses could be even stronger when radiation is properly combined with other treatments, and patient satisfaction may be higher than with current options alone.""

The research team is completing 12-month follow-up to assess durability of benefits and to correlate symptom relief with imaging-based measures of joint structure. Planned studies also include larger, pragmatic trials to evaluate outcomes in specific subgroups and health-economic analyses comparing low-dose radiation with injections and medication regimens.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","It actually rains on the Sun. Here's the stunning reason","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251015032312.htm","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 13:18:32 GMT","

It rains on the Sun, and scientists at the University of Hawaiʻi Institute for Astronomy (IfA) have finally uncovered the reason why.

Unlike the water that falls from clouds on Earth, solar rain takes place in the Sun's corona, the outermost layer made of intensely hot plasma. This phenomenon involves cooler, heavier blobs of plasma that condense high above the Sun's surface and then plunge back down. For years, researchers couldn't understand how this ""rain"" formed so rapidly during solar flares.

New explanation

That puzzle has now been solved by Luke Benavitz, a first-year graduate student at IfA, working with IfA astronomer Jeffrey Reep. Their findings, published in the Astrophysical Journal, fill a critical gap in long-standing solar models.

""At present, models assume that the distribution of various elements in the corona is constant throughout space and time, which clearly isn't the case,"" said Benavitz. ""It's exciting to see that when we allow elements like iron to change with time, the models finally match what we actually observe on the Sun. It makes the physics come alive in a way that feels real.""

Why it matters

The discovery gives solar scientists new tools to better simulate how the Sun behaves during energetic flares -- knowledge that could eventually improve forecasts of space weather events that influence technology and communications on Earth.

Earlier models suggested the heating that causes coronal rain should take hours or even days, yet solar flares occur within minutes. The IfA team's new approach shows that changes in the relative amounts of elements, or elemental abundances, can account for the rapid formation of solar rain.

""This discovery matters because it helps us understand how the Sun really works,"" said Reep. ""We can't directly see the heating process, so we use cooling as a proxy. But if our models haven't treated abundances properly, the cooling time has likely been overestimated. We might need to go back to the drawing board on coronal heating, so there's a lot of new and exciting work to be done.""

Fresh insights

Their findings also open up a broader range of questions. Scientists now realize that the composition of the Sun's atmosphere changes over time, overturning decades of assumptions that it stayed constant. This insight extends far beyond coronal rain, prompting a reexamination of how the Sun's outer layers evolve and how energy circulates through its atmosphere.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Astronomers detect a cosmic “heartbeat” in pulsar signals","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251015032302.htm","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 12:55:21 GMT","

Pulsars may be revealing that extremely low-frequency gravitational waves are moving through the universe. Observations reported in 2023 by international pulsar timing array collaborations could be caused by either a background of overlapping gravitational waves from countless distant sources or a single pair of nearby supermassive black holes orbiting each other. To determine which explanation fits, Hideki Asada, a theoretical physicist and Professor at Hirosaki University, and Shun Yamamoto, a researcher at the Graduate School of Science and Technology, Hirosaki University, have proposed a new approach. Their method takes advantage of ""beat"" effects that occur when two gravitational waves have nearly the same frequency, searching for their subtle influence on the arrival times of pulsars' radio signals.

Their findings were recently published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (JCAP).

The night sky contains remarkably precise ""cosmic clocks"": pulsars, which are dense neutron stars that emit radio pulses at steady intervals, ticking like perfectly timed metronomes. On Earth, radio telescopes track these pulses not only to learn about the pulsars themselves, but also to use them as tools for studying the structure and behavior of the wider universe.

If something unseen -- almost a ""cosmic ghost"" -- distorts spacetime between a pulsar and Earth, the timing of its pulses shifts slightly. These changes are not random; several pulsars in certain parts of the sky can show matching variations, as if a slow, invisible wave were passing through space.

""In 2023 several pulsar timing array collaborations -- NANOGrav in the US, and European teams -- announced strong evidence for nanohertz gravitational waves,"" Asada notes. Nanohertz means wave periods of months to years, with wavelengths of several light-years. To probe such scales, we rely on distant, stable pulsars hundreds to thousands of light-years away. ""The signal was statistically reliable but below the 5-sigma threshold that particle physicists usually require,"" he continues. ""It's 'strong evidence' but not yet a confirmed detection, but the cosmology and astrophysics community believes we are approaching the first detection of nanohertz gravitational waves.""

Although the evidence is promising, it still falls short of absolute confirmation. Asada notes that if future data strengthen the result, the next step will be to pinpoint the origin. ""There are two main candidate sources for nanohertz gravitational waves,"" he explains. ""One is cosmic inflation, which would have created spacetime fluctuations in the very early universe, later stretched to cosmic scales. The other is supermassive black hole binaries, which form when galaxies merge. Both scenarios could generate nanohertz gravitational waves.""

Distinguishing between these possibilities has been difficult because the correlation patterns seen in pulsar data -- the way timing differences between pulsars relate to each other -- were once thought to appear similar in both cases. ""In our paper, we explored the situation where a nearby pair of supermassive black holes produces a particularly strong signal,"" Asada says. ""If two such systems have very similar frequencies, their waves can interfere and create a beat pattern, like in acoustics. That feature could, in principle, allow us to distinguish them from the stochastic background of inflation.""

Asada and Yamamoto therefore leverage a familiar acoustic effect: beats. When two waves have almost -- but not exactly -- the same frequency, their superposition produces periodic strengthening and weakening. Applied to gravitational waves, two supermassive-black-hole binaries with similar frequencies would imprint a characteristic modulation in the pulsar-timing signal. The method is to look for this modulation -- the ""beat"" -- in the pulsar correlation patterns. If it's present, that strongly suggests the signal is not a diffuse background but arises from specific, relatively nearby binaries.

We now await stronger confirmation of the pulsar signal's nature. ""I think once a confirmed detection at 5-sigma is achieved, maybe within a few years, the next step will be to ask: what is the origin of the waves? At that point, our method could be useful to distinguish whether they come from inflation or from nearby supermassive black hole binaries,"" Asada concludes.

When Mary Leakey discovered the OH 5 cranium of Paranthropus boisei alongside Oldowan stone artefacts, it was declared “the oldest yet discovered maker of stone tools”1. Whether Paranthropus made and used tools has been debated ever since2,3,4, largely because there are no known hand bones that can be definitively attributed to this genus. Here we report fossil hand and foot bones unambiguously associated with craniodental material of P. boisei. KNM-ER 101000 demonstrates that P. boisei shared key manipulative and bipedal adaptations with the genus Homo. Moreover, the hand morphology of KNM-ER 101000 converges on that of gorillas in ways that are consistent with manual food processing and would have facilitated powerful grasping, such as that used in climbing. These fossils suggest that P. boisei was capable of tool making and use in some capacity while also supporting the proposed dichotomy of distinct dietary adaptations between Paranthropus and Homo. In addition to offering insights into the poorly known postcranial functional anatomy of Paranthropus, this discovery illuminates broader patterns of hominin hand evolution and tool use.

In recent decades, some researchers have opined that it should be assumed until proven otherwise that all Plio-Pleistocene hominin species engaged in tool behaviours to some degree3,5,6,7. Meanwhile, others have argued that Paranthropus was a toolmaker on the basis of analyses of hand bones with uncertain attribution to the southern African species Paranthropus robustus8,9,10,11,12. However, fossil hand bones confidently associated with taxonomically diagnostic craniodental remains have been conspicuously missing from these debates. Almost none of the approximately 2.5–1.0 million-year-old hominin hand fossils from eastern Africa are known with certainty to belong to a particular species13. This uncertainty extends to the OH 7 hand bones, which form part of the holotype of Homo habilis2, but whose species assignment has been questioned (for example, see ref. 14).

Here we describe a hominin partial skeleton that includes hand and foot bones unambiguously associated with craniodental elements of P. boisei. KNM-ER 101000 was recovered in 2019–2021 during survey and excavations at Koobi Fora on the eastern side of Lake Turkana, Kenya (Supplementary Fig. 1). The fossils derive from laminated sandy silt that directly overlies a known hominin trackway surface (FE22)15. This sequence represents a lake margin facies approximately 10 m above the prominent stromatolitic marker bed A6 and 7.6 m below the base of the Koobi Fora Tuff complex16 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Information). On the basis of this information, KNM-ER 101000 is estimated to be slightly older than 1.52 million years.

Fine sands with abundant nondecalcified molluscs, silts with saline crusts (halite) and clays with multiple pedogenic carbonate (Bk) horizons characterize this interval of strata. Note that the source strata for KNM-ER 101000 are 10–25 cm above a siltstone layer that has a known hominin trackway surface (FE22)15. c, Specimen distribution map of the KNM-ER 101000 excavation.

Between approximately 2 and 1 million years ago (Ma) in eastern Africa, there is evidence of up to four contemporaneous hominin species: P. boisei, H. habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus (for examples, see refs. 17,18,19). The teeth of KNM-ER 101000 resemble those of P. boisei in size more than those of any Homo species. Moreover, they exceed the sizes of Homo in all dimensions of the mandibular premolars and molars except for the buccolingual breadth of the second lower molar (M2), which falls within the upper limits of the early Homo range (Extended Data Fig. 2a–f and Supplementary Table 2). In terms of relative proportions, the ratio of the maxillary crown sizes of the canine and third upper molar (M3) (55%) of KNM-ER 101000 is within the range for P. boisei (49–56%) and below that of early Homo (66–76%), which signifies that KNM-ER 101000 possessed the relatively small canines that are characteristic of P. boisei (Fig. 2b). Hyperthick enamel is another well-established synapomorphy of Paranthropus20,21,22. The average enamel thickness (AET)23,24 of the maxillary and mandibular M3 specimens of KNM-ER 101000 is within the P. boisei range (M3 AET = 2.86 and M3 AET = 2.68; Fig. 2c). Overall, the dentition of KNM-ER 101000 strongly supports its taxonomic attribution to P. boisei.

In b and c, data are presented as boxplots, with the median indicated by a vertical line, the box spanning the interquartile range and the whiskers extending to 1.5× the interquartile range from each quartile. The skull silhouette in a was created by Mark Belan.

Associated cranial fragments also preserve morphology diagnostic of P. boisei (Fig. 2a). These include a parietal fragment that preserves a prominent sagittal crest, which suggests that it can be attributed to a male P. boisei individual. The anterior margin of the zygomatic process of the maxilla originates in alignment with the third upper premolar (P3)19,25,26. Likewise, the nasoalveolar contour of the maxilla is flat, suggesting that the incisors would not have protruded beyond the bicanine line27. Computed tomography imaging of this maxillary fragment revealed a three-rooted fourth premolar (P4) (Supplementary Fig. 2), which is universally expressed in Paranthropus28. However, it is also present in some specimens attributed to early Homo. The right temporal bone preserves a well-defined and robust articular eminence, with a maximum preserved mediolateral length of 39 mm, which distinguishes it from the narrower mandibular fossae of Homo25,29. These features of the maxillary and temporal fragments are congruent with the identification of KNM-ER 101000 as P. boisei.

Spatially associated with these P. boisei craniodental elements are multiple bones from the right and left hands (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 1). As with the craniodental remains, there is no indication that more than one individual is represented (for example, there is no duplication of elements and no notable difference in element size). Bones of the left thumb include a mostly complete manual distal phalanx (mDP1), the proximal end of a proximal phalanx (mPP1) and the proximal half of a first metacarpal (Mc1). The palm is represented by a complete right fifth metacarpal (Mc5) and three other metacarpal shaft fragments. The finger bones include nine phalanges (six proximal and three intermediate), with the second proximal phalanx (mPP2) and the probable third intermediate (mIP3) phalanx preserved largely intact. Substantial portions of what are provisionally assigned to mIP2 and mPP4 are also preserved along with smaller phalangeal fragments, which are probably mPP3, mPP5 and mIP4. The wrist is represented by the left trapezoid and scaphoid and by the right lunate and hamate.

Palmar (left) and dorsal (right) views. The following right elements were mirrored: hamate, lunate, Mc5 and proximal phalanx (second ray). See Supplementary Table 1 for a full list of element attributions and sides (where known). The outline is for illustrative purposes only and not an interpretation of the relative phalangeal lengths (see Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3 for analyses of digit proportions). Scale bar, 10 mm. The hand outline was created by Francis Tre Lawrence.

KNM-ER 101000 indicates that P. boisei had essentially modern human-like intrinsic hand proportions. That is, the thumb was long relative to the palm and other fingers (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c and Supplementary Table 3), a characteristic also exhibited by known species of Australopithecus but not Ardipithecus ramidus, which had more ape-like hand proportions. Although only the base of the mPP1 is preserved, human-like thumb-to-finger proportions are indicated on the basis of the length of the Mc5 against both a reconstruction of the total pollical phalangeal length (using the mDP1 length plus the predicted mPP1 length based on the hallucal proximal phalanx length) and the mDP1 length alone (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Furthermore, the length of mPP2 compared with that of mDP1 indicates a thumb that was long relative to the index finger, as in recent humans and all fossil hominins except Ar. ramidus (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Such proportions in KNM-ER 101000 would have enabled P. boisei to form human-like precision grips that require opposition of the distal pads of the fingers to that of the thumb30.

The mDP1 is broadly similar in morphology to those of most other early hominin specimens but larger in absolute maximum length and width (Extended Data Fig. 3b). It is very robust, with an expanded apical tuft and a deep proximopalmar fossa and pronounced insertion gable for the tendon of flexor pollicis longus. Weathering prevents full assessment of the ungual fossa, but it seems to have been expansive, which is indicative of a well-developed digital pulp. The exceptionally broad apical tuft of KNM-ER 101000 is most similar to that of OH 7 (but OH 7 lacks any clear indication of a well-developed flexor pollicis longus muscle30), as well as to specimens of Homo naledi and to Neanderthals. Earlier hominins such as Orrorin tugenensis and Australopithecus afarensis exhibit moderately broad tufts similar to recent humans, whereas Ar. ramidus resembles Pan and Gorilla in the narrowness of its tuft. Broadening of the pollical distal phalanx may represent an adaptation to increased manual dexterity (for example, human-like forceful precision grips). However, what drove the extreme broadening of the distal phalanx in some of these hominin species is unclear.

In contrast to species of Australopithecus, KNM-ER 101000 exhibits a robust thumb, with evidence of well-developed thenar musculature. The pollical metacarpal, although lacking the distal half, is exceptionally robust with marked entheses. It is considerably larger in relative and absolute size than any of those known for australopiths, including KNM-ER 47000 (a specimen that has been tentatively attributed to P. boisei31; Extended Data Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 3). The articular facet for the trapezium is strongly curved dorsopalmarly and radioulnarly as seen in extant great apes and in Australopithecus (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c). Such marked articular curvature is unlike the derived, relatively flatter condition (especially radioulnarly) shared among modern humans, Neanderthals and H. naledi.

The trapezoid is well preserved and, similar to those of extant great apes, is wedge-shaped with a relatively large triangular-shaped facet for the scaphoid and a mostly dorsally placed facet for the capitate. The palmar aspect of the bone is expanded proximodistally such that the radial and ulnar portions of the second metacarpal facet are oriented more parallel to the scaphoid facet than is typically seen in extant great apes. However, the palmar portion is not radioulnarly expanded as it is in modern humans, Neanderthals and H. naledi (Extended Data Fig. 5a,d).

The scaphoid preserves facets for the radius, capitate, lunate and trapezoid that are all mostly intact, but with some erosion near their respective boundaries; however, the tubercle (and most of the trapezium facet) is missing. As with all hominins and the African apes, the centrale portion is completely incorporated into the body. The shape and orientation of the capitate and lunate facets, as well as the large facet for the trapezoid that distally closes the scaphoid–capitate joint, are most similar to those of extant African apes. By contrast, modern humans, Neanderthals and H. naledi display a configuration which is more open distally and is confluent with an enlarged and palmarly placed capitate-trapezoid joint (Extended Data Fig. 5b,e).

The lunate is well preserved. The facet for the capitate head is deeply concave and the radiocarpal surface is convex and mediolaterally broad (Extended Data Fig. 5f). Overall, the lunate exhibits the morphology shared by African apes and hominins. However, in combination, the morphologies of the lunate and scaphoid suggest that KNM-ER 101000 mostly retained a primitive, African ape-like radiocarpal and midcarpal joint configuration (Extended Data Fig. 5c).

As with the thumb, the hypothenar elements of KNM-ER 101000 are robustly developed, which is suggestive of considerable ulnar-side hand strength (Extended Data Fig. 6). The hamulus of the hamate is long relative to the length of the hamate body (Extended Data Fig. 6a,c), which resembles the condition in Gorilla (particularly Gorilla beringei). However, unlike in Gorilla, Pan and Pongo, KNM-ER 101000 shows a more hominin-like relationship between the hamulus breadth and width and only a moderate distal inclination of the hamulus, which is similar to most other early hominins (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b, measurements are defined in the caption). The large hamulus of KNM-ER 101000 probably provided expanded entheses and increased leverage (longer moment arm) for the opponens digiti minimi and flexor digiti minimi muscles and probably the flexor carpi ulnaris with its connection to the hamulus through the pisohamate ligament. The morphology of the hamulus is accompanied by an Mc5 shaft that is very robust (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c) and exhibits marked radioulnar bowing with an exceptionally large and rugose crest along its ulnar aspect, which marks the distal attachment of the opponens digiti minimi (Extended Data Fig. 6c). In these aspects, the hypothenar complex of KNM-ER 101000 converges on the condition seen in G. beringei (Extended Data Fig. 6c). However, Gorilla and other great apes tend to have Mc5 and Mc4 bases that are ‘locked in' by the strong distal inclination of the hamulus. By contrast, KNM-ER 101000 exhibits a more convex surface on the Mc5, and the correspondingly concave surface on the hamate indicates increased mobility of the fifth ray, similar to that of recent humans and other hominins. Pronounced protuberances at the base of the Mc5 mark attachment of the extensor carpi ulnaris (on the dorsal side) and the flexor carpi ulnaris (on the palmar side by way of the pisometacarpal ligament) along with the capsular ligaments of the fifth carpometacarpal joint.

The morphology of the non-pollical phalanges is consistent with that of the thumb and hypothenar region in exhibiting marked robusticity (Extended Data Figs. 7 and 8). The complete mPP2 is the most robust specimen in the fossil comparative sample. Moreover, its exceptional radioulnar breadth at the midshaft relative to the proximodistal length is matched only by a few male specimens of Gorilla (Extended Data Fig. 7a). KNM-ER 47000 (ref. 31) (ostensibly also representing P. boisei) is considerably more gracile, although this difference could reflect sexual dimorphism (see the G. beringei male–female comparison in Extended Data Fig. 7b). In overall gestalt, the proximal phalanges of KNM-ER 101000 resemble those of gorillas (especially G. beringei), although the complete mPP2 lacks strong longitudinal shaft curvature (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d) as do the less complete phalanges from the other digits (based on qualitative assessments). This result suggests that climbing and suspension may not have been a regular component of the adult male P. boisei locomotor repertoire. All of the mPP specimens of KNM-ER 101000 are similar to those of gorillas in having pronounced flexor sheath ridges, which indicate strong recruitment of the long digital flexors (sometimes interpreted as another correlate of climbing or suspension). However, these ridges are generally less well developed in the more arboreal great apes (genera Pongo and Pan), which renders the biological role of this trait (beyond strong digital grasping) difficult to interpret32,33,34,35.

The intermediate phalanges of KNM-ER 101000 evince a robusticity similar to the proximal phalanges, which is again matched only by a few Gorilla specimens and by OH 7, possible P. robustus or Homo specimens from Swartkrans and some Neanderthal specimens. The longitudinal shaft curvature of the intermediate phalanges does not clearly separate recent Homo sapiens from the African apes, but the measurable intermediate phalanx of KNM-ER 101000 is among the least curved in the fossil sample, with only two specimens from Swartkrans exhibiting lower included angle values (Supplementary Table 5). Relative to the midshaft radioulnar width, the mPP2 of KNM-ER 101000 has an exceptionally narrow distal trochlea (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Although relative trochlear breadth has been suggested to align OH 7 with Paranthropus14 (rather than its typical attribution to H. habilis36), there is extensive overlap with the extant ape sample and several of the other hominin samples in this measurement (Extended Data Fig. 8b).

A small fragment of the left proximal radius of KNM-ER 101000 is preserved. Much like the other known radius of P. boisei (OH 80)37, the size of the radial tuberosity (long axis of enthesis = 27.8 mm, perpendicular to the long axis = 17.6 mm) suggests that KNM-ER 101000 possessed a large biceps brachii muscle that was probably capable of generating strong forearm flexion and supination. Its absolute cross-sectional cortical area is within the range of Gorilla and in the upper quartile of Pan troglodytes, well above that of recent humans (Supplementary Fig. 5). Some studies have suggested that P. boisei would have engaged in arboreal behaviours on the basis of the thick cortical bone observed in the tentatively attributed humerus of KNM-ER 47000 (ref. 38). Although a strong upper limb could have facilitated climbing behaviours, other explanations such as systemically thick cortical bone in this species should also be considered in the context of the overall morphological pattern across the postcranium39.

The right foot of KNM-ER 101000 is represented by a complete hallucal proximal phalanx (pPP1), a non-hallucal proximal phalanx (probably pPP5) and a right third metatarsal (Mt3) that is missing its distal end (Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10). The pPP1 is intrinsically robust, with a dorsally canted proximal articular surface similar to that of recent humans and other hominin fossils (for example, SKX 45690 and StW 470). Dorsal canting facilitates increased dorsiflexion during bipedal push-off40,41. The logged ratio of pPP1-to-pPP5 length in KNM-ER 101000 reflects a hallux that is long relative to that of great apes but short in comparison to recent humans. The pPP5 of KNM-ER 101000 is relatively short, displaying reduced curvature compared to Ar. ramidus (ARA-VP-6/500-044 and GWM67/P2u) and A. afarensis (A.L. 333-115i, A.L. 333-154 and A.L. 333-160) along with a greater dorsal inclination of its metatarsophalangeal joint facet that matches pedal phalanges from Neanderthals, Pleistocene H. sapiens and SKX 16699 (ref. 42), which probably reflect similar functionality of the lateral forefoot (Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10). A high positive Mt3 torsion angle (about 41°) in KNM-ER 101000 indicates the presence of a well-developed transverse arch, which significantly contributes to stiffness in the hominin foot43. By comparison, the Mt3 of OH 8 has a lower Mt3 torsion angle (15°) than KNM-ER 10100, falling near KNM-ER 803 and Sterkfontein specimens attributed to Australopithecus africanus, but its value falls within the range of the modern human sample. Finally, the Mt3 of KNM-ER 101000 displays a dorsoplantarly tall and relatively flat proximal articular surface, which is associated with tarsometatarsal joint stability in bipeds44. The Mt3 base of OH 8 is slightly shorter than that of KNM-ER 101000, with a ratio value falling near those of H. naledi (U.W. 101-1035 and U.W. 101-1457), Dmanisi H. erectus (D2021) and SKX 247. However, the difference between OH 8 and KNM-ER 101000 could be sampled in our modern human and chimpanzee samples. Overall, the pedal elements of KNM-ER 101000 indicate that increased stiffness and bipedal push-off characterized the foot of P. boisei. However, the relatively short hallux of KNM-ER 101000 also suggests that the push-off mechanics in P. boisei would have differed slightly from those of recent humans (sensu45). The reduced intrinsic length and diaphyseal curvature of its non-hallucal proximal phalanx are more human-like than those of A. afarensis and Ar. ramidus, which suggests that there was little reliance on pedal grasping in P. boisei by approximately 1.5 Ma. Although a fully bipedal foot does not preclude occasional (or even frequent) climbing, as observed in some human populations46, it suggests that this behaviour was not the primary selective force in the locomotor repertoire of this species.

It has long been assumed that the earliest members of the genus Homo manufactured and used stone tools2. However, the discovery of 3.3 million-year-old stone tools at Lomekwi47 together with 3.0-million-year-old Oldowan artefacts alongside a purported Paranthropus molar at Nyayanga4 has reignited debate about possible tool use in other taxa. On the basis of analyses of KNM-ER 101000, it is clear that the hand of P. boisei had derived thumb–finger length proportions and was probably capable of grips similar to those of modern humans. However, judging from the retention of a suite of plesiomorphic features in the wrist and base of the thumb, radioulnar transmission of loads from the powerful thumb probably differed from that of recent humans and Neanderthals, which indicate differences in habitual thumb use during manual manipulation. We propose that precision-pinch-type grips were likely to be less effective in P. boisei than in later members of the genus Homo with a more derived trapeziometacarpal and radial wrist morphology. However, this does not rule out tool behaviours (including the making and use of early lithic technology).

Overall, the functional morphology of the hand and wrist of KNM-ER 101000 suggests that it had a powerful grip strength, particularly in the ulnar aspect of the hand. An important caveat is that tool use may not have been the only factor driving selection on hominin hands. For example, in some fossil hominin taxa such as A. afarensis and H. naledi, there is compelling evidence to suggest that climbing was an important part of the locomotor repertoire. There are indications of strong grasping in KNM-ER 101000 that would have facilitated climbing performance, and P. boisei may have engaged in arboreal behaviour at some frequency. However, one of the clearest signals of frequent climbing and suspensory behaviour in primates (that is, longitudinal shaft curvature of the manual and pedal phalanges48) is notably less expressed in KNM-ER 101000 than in A. afarensis, H. naledi and extant African apes, whereas pedal morphology in KNM-ER 101000 evinces a greater commitment to terrestriality than in earlier hominins.

Although one possibility for explaining the convergence of gorilla-like hand morphology in P. boisei is that it may have adopted a climbing style that was specifically gorilla-like, the distinctive features of the climbing gait in gorillas seem to be a compensation for their large body mass49. Thus, it is unclear why P. boisei would have adopted such a mode of climbing given that estimates of its body mass50 are similar to those of other early hominins such as A. afarensis51, and notably smaller than modern gorillas. Consequently, although any primate will use its hands in a variety of behaviours, climbing competency may not have been the sole (nor likely to be the primary) selective factor in the convergent evolution of the gorilla-like manual features in P. boisei.

In primates more broadly, feeding behaviours often require complex manual manipulation and forceful processing52. Mountain gorillas use forceful, palm dominated power grasping that incorporates the fifth digit during arboreal behaviours, but they also regularly use their hands in this capacity to access edible portions of tough vegetation53. The morphological convergence of P. boisei hand morphology with that of G. beringei (especially in the hypothenar region and manual phalanges) is notable in light of dietary reconstructions indicating that P. boisei subsisted on a tough diet dominated by herbaceous, grass-like plants (reviewed in ref. 54). On the basis of the overall morphology of the postcranial elements of KNM-ER 101000 (and possibly other specimens attributed to P. boisei, such as OH 80), the similarities to gorillas may reflect intensive manual processing of such plants for food.

In addition to insights into the paleobiology of Paranthropus, KNM-ER 101000 provides an opportunity to revisit longstanding debates over the taxonomic attribution of the foot bones from OH 7 and the hand bones from OH 8 (refs. 10,14,55). The morphology and relative proportions of the intermediate phalanges of KNM-ER 101000 are highly similar to those of OH 7. Although this similarity could be viewed as evidence in favour of the hypothesis that the hand of OH 7 belongs to Paranthropus rather than H. habilis14, the degree of variation in relative trochlear breadth makes the taxonomic significance of this metric unclear. It seems unlikely that a pollical metacarpal base as curved as the Mc1 in KNM-ER 101000 (or KNM-ER 47000) would articulate with a trapezium like in OH 7. This finding weakens the hypothesis that the hand of OH 7 belongs to Paranthropus14 (further detailed analyses are required to establish whether this range of variation occurs in a single species). Poor scaphoid preservation in both OH 7 and KNM-ER 101000 limits the utility of comparison between these elements. The Mt3 of KNM-ER 101000 is similar to that of OH 8, which has intrinsically large Mt2 and Mt4 articular facets and a dorsoplantarly tall diaphysis relative to its mediolateral breadth. By contrast, the Mt3 diaphysis of KNM-ER 101000 has a substantially greater transverse curvature and a dorsoplantarly flatter proximal articular surface than OH 8. However, the extent to which these metatarsal traits distinguish P. boisei from H. habilis is currently unknown.

More generally, because Homo and Paranthropus are sister taxa21,22,27, the KNM-ER 101000 fossils enable the reconstruction of the probable ancestral condition of the hand that would have characterized the earliest members of both the Homo and Paranthropus lineages. Modern humans and Neanderthals share several derived features in the thumb and radial wrist bones that probably evolved as an adaptation to making and using stone tools3,7,56,57,58. Exactly when this complex of derived features first evolved remains unclear, but available fossil evidence suggests that it had occurred by at least 1.4 Ma (for example, KNM-WT 51260)59.

Our analyses reveal that the last common ancestor (LCA) of Homo and Paranthropus (and therefore the earliest members of the genus Homo) would have possessed a relatively robust Mc5 and Mc1 and a radially expanded first carpometacarpal joint (Fig. 4). This proportional increase in the marginal elements of the hand represents an adaptive shift from earlier australopiths, such as those probably responsible for the Lomekwian stone tools47, and indicates an increased reliance on stabilized power grips56. By comparison, derived aspects of the modern human wrist that facilitate effective precision-pinch grips do not seem to have been present in the Homo–Paranthropus LCA. Rather, these evolved later in the Homo lineage.

Summary of ancestral state reconstructions highlighting key inferred transitions in hominin hand evolution. Ancestral state reconstructions were conducted across a phylogeny consisting of 6 extant apes and 14 hominin fossils for 20 morphological characteristics using maximum parsimony. No polarity or character ordering was assumed a priori. KNM-ER 101000 was taken as the sole representative of P. boisei, although it never differed in character state from KNM-ER 47000. FPL, flexor pollicis longus. Illustrations were created by Mark Belan.

If the derived features of the P. boisei hand are indeed convergent with gorillas to facilitate strong and repeated grips involved in intensive food processing, then it may support a model in which Paranthropus and Homo evolved divergent dietary strategies in a sympatric setting that allowed them to subsist as ecological specialists and generalists, respectively, with Homo including further commitment to intensified tool use60.

Immediately after specimen excavation and preparation, surface scans of each fossil element were generated by T. Gichunge using a HDI Advance 3D scanner (Polyga). Subsequently, micro-computed tomography (microCT) scans of KNM-ER 101000 were generated at the Stellenbosch University CT Scanner Facility61 with a General Electric Phoenix VTOMEX L240 microCT system (the scan resolution ranged from 15 to 50 μm depending on the size and density of the element).

Linear measurements of the dentition of KNM-ER 101000 were recorded from the original fossils using Mauser 0.05 mm accuracy dial calipers. Comparative dental metrics were obtained from published sources (Supplementary Tables 6–10). For comparisons between the anterior and posterior dentition, crown modules of hominin maxillary M3 specimens and canines were calculated per a previous study62.

To measure enamel thickness, buccolingual sections through the apices of the dentine horns of the mesial cusps of the unworn maxillary RM3 (protocone and paracone) and the unworn mandibular RM3 (metaconid and protoconid) were virtually extracted from the microCT scans of these teeth in Avizo (v.2021). In each slice, the enamel–dentine junction (EDJ) was clearly visible, and the area (mm2) of the enamel cap was measured using ImageJ. With reference to the RM3, a wedge of dentine was lost below the preserved EDJ of the metaconid, and the missing cervical extension of its enamel cap could be estimated with reasonable accuracy by following its curvature inferiorly as previously advocated63. The area of the narrow crack through the cusp tip of the metaconid was subtracted from the overall estimated measurement of the enamel cap to obtain a value of 63.21 mm2, and its inferior length was subtracted from the overall estimated length of the EDJ to obtain a value of 22.11 mm. With reference to the RM3, the area of the wide crack through the intercuspal embrasure (1.80 mm2) was subtracted from the overall measurement of the enamel cap to obtain a value of 67.70 mm2, and its inferior length (0.73 mm) was subtracted from the overall measured length of the EDJ to obtain a value of 25.25 mm. The AET was then calculated by dividing the area of the enamel cap by the length of the EDJ. Summary metrics of comparative data from refs. 23,24 are provided in Supplementary Table 4.

Relevant linear dimensions of KNM-ER 101000 were measured and compared with data from extant comparative groups and available fossil hominins (see Supplementary Tables 11–37 for details of the compositions of extant and fossil samples and data sources for each analysis).

Only the proximal base of the mPP1 is preserved for KNM-ER 101000. To estimate the total pollical phalangeal length (proximal plus distal), the mPP1 length was estimated on the basis of the length of the hallucal proximal phalanx, which in the comparative sample of extant H. sapiens (n = 53), Pan spp. (n = 52) and Gorilla spp. (n = 48) specimens correlates strongly with pollical proximal phalanx length (least squares regression: mPP1 length = 0.997 × pPP1 length − 0.38; r2 = 0.66; P < 0.001). The total mPP1 and mDP1 length using the mean estimate of the mPP1 length and the upper and lower 95% prediction intervals are plotted against the Mc5 length in Extended Data Fig. 3a to show the uncertainty, but is human-like in all cases. Note the relative length of only the distal pollical phalanx relative to the Mc5 length. Supplementary Fig. 3 also demonstrates the human-like proportions.

The longitudinal shaft curvature of the mPP2 and the complete mIP3 of KNM-ER 101000 were quantified using the included angle method. Landmarks were extracted from the 3D polygon model of the specimen to measure dimensions used to calculate the included angle per a previously described method64. The extant comparative sample was measured in the same way along with all compared fossils, except for one whose included angle values were taken from the literature (OH 86)65. The sample composition for the curvature analysis is provided in Supplementary Tables 34 and 35.

The principal curvatures of the articular surface were quantified for the Mc1 of KNM-ER 101000 and the extant and fossil comparative samples in the dorsopalmar and radioulnar directions using a quadric surface fit with a least-squares method57 (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Zero values indicate a flat surface with no curvature, whereas values greater or less than zero indicate a curved surface with more curved surfaces having larger absolute values than less curved surfaces. Because this articular surface in hominids is typically saddle-shaped, the sign indicates the direction of curvature (for example, dorsopalmar is positive, radioulnar is negative). Comparative sample details are provided in Supplementary Tables 21 and 22.

A canonical variate analysis of trapezoid shape was conducted using angles between articular surfaces and relative surface areas (Extended Data Fig. 5a). The former were quantified by fitting least-squares planes to each and measuring the angles between the resulting planes66, whereas the latter were quantified by dividing the articular surface area by the surface area of the entire bone67. Comparative sample details are provided in Supplementary Tables 23 and 24.

A 3D geometric morphometric analysis of the preserved portions of the scaphoid of KNM-ER 101000 was conducted (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Using Stratovan Checkpoint software, surface patches were fit to the radius and capitate articular facets and to the preserved portion of the trapezium–trapezoid facet. Landmark patches (density of 9 × 9) were manually placed using the ‘patches' option in Stratovan Checkpoint (v.2022.12.16.0419, Stratovan). No patch was placed on the trapezium surface because this region was broken in KNM-ER 101000. Landmarks that were homologous and easily locatable (for example, points where three structures met, maxima of curvature) were treated as conventional landmarks and used as anchors to place the patches. The remainder of the landmarks were treated as sliding semi-landmarks. In total, there were 8 landmarks and 235 sliding semi-landmarks. The sliding semi-landmarks were slid along the surfaces in 3D to minimize the bending energy of a thin-plate spline deformation using the function slider3d() in the R package Morpho (v.2.10)68. Sliding is an iterative process; specimens were relaxed against the Procrustes mean configuration by sliding along tangent planes until a designated threshold distance (the Procrustes distance between the old and new mean) was reached68. After each iteration of the sliding process, the points were projected back onto the surface to avoid the semi-landmarks ‘falling off' the bone68,69,70. The set of slidden landmarks underwent a generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) and subsequent principal component analysis (PCA) using the function procSym() in the R package Morpho (v.2.10)68. The procSym() function returns an array of GPA superimposed coordinates of the translated, scaled and rotated landmark configurations for each specimen. A PCA was then performed on the array of GPA superimposed coordinates, which returned a matrix of principal component (PC) scores. The PC scores were plotted using the function ggplot() in the R package ggplot2 (v.3.4.1)71. Point clouds were used to visualize the shape variation along PC axes. Point clouds representing the most negative and positive shapes along the PC axes were generated using plotReftoTarget() in the R package geomorph (v.4.0.4)72,73. Comparative sample details are provided in Supplementary Tables 25 and 26.

A canonical variate analysis of scaphoid and lunate shape (using matched pairs of these carpals) was conducted using angles between articular surfaces and relative surface areas (following the same methods as described above for the trapezoid shape analysis). Comparative sample details are provided in Supplementary Table 27.

Variables quantifying functional aspects of hamate form were quantified using landmarks placed on 3D surface scans of KNM-ER 101000 and the comparative sample following previously described methods74 and summarized in Supplementary Fig. 4c. Details of the comparative sample are provided in Supplementary Tables 28 and 29.

The cross-sectional cortical area of the radius of KNM-ER 101000 was measured immediately distal to the radial tuberosity at a level that we estimated to represent 25% of the total physiological length (as defined in a previous study75). The comparative dataset for this analysis consisted of radii from a mixed sex sample of recent cadaveric modern humans (n = 10) housed in the Department of Anatomical Sciences, Stony Brook University, as well as P. troglodytes (n = 18) and Gorilla spp. (n = 24) specimens housed at the American Museum of Natural History (New York City) and the Museum of Comparative Zoology (Harvard University). These comparative specimens were subjected to longitudinal CT scanning using a LightSpeed VCT scanner (GE Healthcare) in the Department of Radiology, Stony Brook University Hospital. The slice thickness was 2.5 mm. Specimens were scanned dry, and a bone-reconstruction algorithm was used. The cross-sectional area of the cortical bone was calculated from DICOM files using the BoneJ plugin76 for ImageJ software (NIH). Each element was first segmented by the BoneJ automated thresholding protocol ‘Optimize Threshold' to extract the bone phase. Structural properties were then analysed on a DICOM slice that was determined to represent 25% of the physiological length using the ‘Slice Geometry' function.

The size and composition of the extant sample varied across the analyses of different pedal elements. These are described in Supplementary Tables 38–43. The fossil hominin data were collected from original specimens housed at the following institutions: the Ditsong National Museum of Natural History; the Evolutionary Studies Institute, University of the Witwatersrand; the National Museum of Ethiopia; and the Turkana Basin Institute, Ileret. We supplemented the fossil data using research-quality casts of specimens housed at the following institutions: the National Museum of Kenya (for example, Koobi Fora specimens) and the National Museum of Tanzania (OH 8). We also used published data on base measurements of fossil hominin metatarsal samples77,78. For most analyses, we visualized distributions of raw values across species combined with box and whisker plots that display summary statistics such as the median, the interquartile range and the range for each sample.

CT data from the New Mexico Decedent Image Database (NMDID) and Primate Research Institute Computed Tomography (PRICT, Kyoto University) were segmented to produce 3D meshes using ORS Dragonfly software. CT data from the Center for Academic Research and Anthropogeny (CARTA, University of California, San Diego) were used to generate 3D meshes using OsiriX software. The remaining individuals were scanned using a NextEngine HD or an Artec Space Spider scanner. We cleaned each 3D model using Geomagic Wrap software (for example, filling small holes and smoothing meshes generated by CT scanning). We calculated the pPP1 dorsal canting angle as the angle between a least-squares plane fit to the proximal articular surface and a plane fit to the plantar surface defined by three landmarks: the most plantar point on the medial tubercle of the base; the most plantar point on the lateral tubercle of the base; and the most plantar point on the trochlea. We calculated the angle as the inverse cosine of the dot product of the normal vectors of each plane.

We calculated a phalangeal length ratio (pPP1/pPP5) and a pPP5 length ratio (pPP5 length/pPP5 base mediolateral breadth) from linear measurements collected using Mitutoyu sliding calipers.

The articular angle method was used to quantify the orientation of the metatarsophalangeal joint surface to enable comparisons with previously published data42. To quantify the shaft curvature, we used ImageJ software to calculate the included angle from three measurements collected on photographs of pPP5 specimens79. The three measurements included the maximum length, the midshaft depth and the projected phalangeal height at the midshaft.

We evaluated the morphometric affinities of the pPP5 of KNM-ER 101000 using PCA. The analysis included nine variables: the included angle of curvature; the dorsal canting ratio; the length; the base mediolateral breadth (BML); the base dorsoplantar depth (BDP); the midshaft mediolateral breadth (MSML); the midshaft dorsoplantar depth (MSDP); the trochlea mediolateral breadth (TML); and the trochlea dorsoplantar depth (TDP). The seven linear distances (length, BML, BDP, MSML, MSDP, TML and TDP) were divided by their geometric mean. The dorsal canting ratio was calculated using two linear measurements: the dorsal interarticular length and the plantar interarticular length. The combination of curvature, ratio and geometric mean-standardized lengths required the use of the correlation matrix in the PCA. We used the ‘princomp' function in R (v.4.4.0).

We calculated Mt3 torsion using a previously described 3D landmark method80. As previously noted, the CT data from NMDID, PRICT and CARTA were segmented to produce 3D meshes using ORS Dragonfly or OsiriX software. All 3D models were imported into Geomagic Wrap for smoothing and/or cleaning before analysis. We digitized six landmarks on each 3D model: the most plantar point of the proximal articular surface at midline (LM1); the most dorsal point of the proximal articular surface at midline (LM2); the centroid of the proximal articular surface (LM3); the most proximal point of the medial tubercle on the plantar Mt head (LM4); the most proximal point of the lateral tubercle on the plantar Mt head (LM5); and the most dorsal point of the Mt head at midline (LM6). A seventh landmark (LM7) was calculated as the midpoint between LM6 and the midpoint of landmarks LM4 and LM5, which positioned it inside the 3D model near the Mt head. The landmarks were used to define a local coordinate reference frame. LM1 and LM2 were used to define a tarsometatarsal joint vector (TMT). LM3 and LM7 were used to define a proximodistal axis vector (PD). LM4 and LM5 were used to define a mediolateral axis vector (ML). The cross-product of PD and ML vectors was used to define a dorsoplantar axis vector (DP). TMT was projected onto the same plane as DP, and the metatarsal torsion angle was calculated as the rotation of TMT relative to PD using the atan2 function. The resulting angular rotation value was converted from radians to degrees (where 1 radian = 180°/π). For right metatarsals viewed from their proximal ends, a positive torsion value indicates a counterclockwise rotation, whereas a negative torsion angle indicates a clockwise rotation of DP relative to TMT for comparability with previous studies80,81,82,83. Metatarsal torsion angles were calculated using a custom Matlab script.

We computed the ratio of Mt3 base dorsoplantar to mediolateral dimensions using linear distances (Mt3 BDP/BML).

To reconstruct patterns of hand evolution across the hominin phylogeny, we constructed a character matrix consisting of 20 discrete morphological characteristics across the manus (Supplementary Table 44). The previously proposed characteristics3 served as the starting point for this matrix (Supplementary Table 45). We then coded character states for 6 extant species and 14 fossil taxa when preserved elements permitted the assessment of a given character. In most cases, we based these character codings on fossils that were unequivocally attributed to a taxon (for example, category A in ref. 13). The following samples were exceptions to this criterion: OH 7, which we coded as H. habilis; SK 84 was taken to represent P. robustus; and all Sterkfontein Member 4 fossils were considered to represent A. africanus. KNM-ER 101000 was treated as the sole representative of P. boisei, although it never substantially differed from the character states observed in KNM-ER 47000. The tree topology used for ancestral state reconstructions was based on the most parsimonious tree recovered per a previous study22. Ancestral state reconstructions were conducted individually for each character along the tree using maximum parsimony in Mesquite (v.3.61)84. No character ordering or polarity was assumed a priori.

Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

3D surface scans of the KNM-ER 101000 fossils are available to view, manipulate and measure at MorphoSource (https://www.morphosource.org). A full list of digital object identifiers is provided in Supplementary Table 46. All 2D measurements recorded by the authors are also provided in the Supplementary Information.

Manual elements shown in palmar view. Proximal radius positioned to show radial tuberosity. Box contains pedal elements shown in dorsal view.

Boxplots depicting linear dental metrics in early Homo (purple), Homo erectus (light blue), and Paranthropus boisei (red). KNM-ER 101000 is shown as a yellow star in each panel. Data are shown as boxplots, with the median indicated by a horizontal line, the box spanning the interquartile range (IQR), and the whiskers extending to 1.5 × IQR from each quartile. Individual fossil specimens included in each plot are listed in Supplementary Tables 6–10. g) Photographs show the KNM-ER 101000 maxillary and mandibular dentition. The postcanine dentition is shown in occlusal or near occlusal (RM3) view, while the canines are in labial view. CT sections taken perpendicular to the mesiodistal axis through the apices of the dentine horns of the mesial cusps of the maxillary RM3 (h) and the mandibular RM3 (i).

a) natural log plot of the combined estimated length of the proximal pollical phalanx (mPP1) and distal pollical phalanx (mDP1) versus fifth metacarpal (Mc5 maximum length) with a least-squares regression line through the recent H. sapiens sample [ln(mPP1_length_+_mDP1_length) = 0.93 * ln(Mc5_maximum_length) − 0.32; p < 0.001, r2 = 0.69]; b) plot of mDP1 tuft RU breadth versus mDP1 maximum length a least-squares regression line through the recent H. sapiens sample [mDP1_tuft_RU_width = 0.19 * mDP1_maximum_length + 5.0; p < 0.01, r2 = 0.23]c) 3D surface model renderings of the KNM-ER 101000 digital specimens shown with relevant comparative specimens, which are all visually scaled to the same Mc5 maximum length as KNM-ER 101000. The central star in (a) includes the mean estimate for the mPP1 length and the upper and lower stars represent the 95% confidence interval of that estimate. Australopithecus sample: 1 = A. afarensis [plot in (a) includes AL 333-69 mPP1 + AL 333-159 mDP1 and mean of AL 333-14, AL 333-89, and AL 333-141 Mc5s and plot in (b) includes AL 333-159]. 2 = “A. prometheus” StW 573. 3 = A. sediba MH2. 4 = A. africanus StW 294.

A robust first metacarpal (Mc1) shaft in KNM-ER 101000 is combined with a presumably primitive (African-ape-like) morphology of the first carpometacarpal joint. a) natural log plot of the Mc1 radioulnar (RU) midshaft width versus maximum length of the fifth metacarpal (Mc5) with least-squares regression line through the recent H. sapiens sample [lnMC1_midshaft_RU = 0.63 * ln(Mc5_max_length) − 0.05; (p < 0.001, r2 = 0.28)]; b) bivariate plot of the curvatures of the Mc1's proximal articular surface (for the trapezium); c) renderings of Mc1s from a female gorilla, a male gorilla, KNM-ER 101000, and KNM-ER 47000. Australopithecus sample: 1 = A. afarensis (AL 333w-39 and −58 Mc1s each plotted against the mean of the Mc5 specimens—they overlap in the plot because the two Mc1s differ by only 0.6 mm in midshaft RU breadth); 2 = A. sediba MH2; 3 = A. africanus StW 418.

a) canonical variates plot including joint angles and surface areas of the trapezoid; b) principal components plot showing results of a 3D geometric morphometrics analysis of scaphoid shape; c) canonical variates plot including joint angles and surface areas for the scaphoid and lunate combined; d) rendering of the KNM-ER 101000 trapezoid; e) renderings of the of the KNM-ER 101000 scaphoid (dotted outline indicates the articular area for the trapezoid and the asterisk indicates the portion that is typically reduced in H. sapiens in response to the shape changes of the trapezoid and capitate, resulting in a scaphocapitate joint that is open distally); f) renderings of the KNM-ER 101000 lunate. Australopithecus sample: 1 = Australopithecus sp. StW 618; 2 = A. sediba MH2.

Well-developed hypothenar morphology (hamate hamulus and Mc5) of the KNM-ER 101000 specimen (yellow star throughout). a) Hamulus length versus hamate body length; b) natural log-log plot of the square root (sqrt) of the area (radioulnar width x dorsopalmar depth) of the Mc5 at midshaft versus the Mc5 maximum length c) 3D surface model renderings of the KNM-ER 101000 hamate and Mc5 and comparative specimens. Mc5s are scaled to the same proximodistal length and hamates are scaled to the same proximodistal body length. The least squares regression lines are fit to the Homo sapiens samples (excluding one individual with pituitary dwarfism and one with gigantism in the hamate analysis): hamulus_length = 0.62 + 0.47 * hamate_body_length (p < 0.001, r2 = 0.44); ln(Mc5_sqrt_midshaft_area) = −1.41 + 0.85 * ln(Mc5_maximum_length) (p < 0.001, r2 = 0.33). Australopithecus sample: 1 = A. afarensis AL 333-50 hamate, 2 = A. cf. afarensis KNM-WT 22994-H hamate, 3 = A. sediba MH2 left hamate, 4 = A. sediba MH2 right hamate). Fossil hominins in the Mc5 plot (E): taxa symbols follow the hamate plots with addition of Ar. ramidus (green diamond) and for the Australopithecus spp. specimens 5 = A. afarensis AL 333-14, 6 = A. afarensis AL 333-89, 7 = A. afarensis AL 333-141, 8 = A. sediba MH2, 9 = A. africanus StW 63.

Manual proximal phalanges robusticity (a,b) and longitudinal shaft curvature (c,d). RU = radioulnar width. Data presented in a) consist of the following samples: KNM-ER 101000 n = 1, KNM-ER 47000 n = 1, G. beringei n = 109, G. gorilla n = 96, P. troglodytes n = 152, P. paniscus n = 66, Ar. ramidus n = 1, A. afarensis n = 8, StW 573 n = 2, A. africanus n = 3, Swartkrans n = 5, A. sediba n = 4, OH 86 n = 1, H. floresiensis n = 1, H. naledi n = 11, H. antecessor n = 1, H. neanderthalensis n = 13, recent H. sapiens n = 216. Data presented in c) consist of the following samples: KNM-ER 101000 n = 1, KNM-ER 47000 n = 1, G. beringei n = 68, G. gorilla n = 96, P. troglodytes n = 68, P. paniscus n = 84, A. afarensis n = 7, StW 573 n = 2, A. africanus n = 3, Swartkrans n = 2, A. sediba n = 4, OH 86 n = 1, H. floresiensis n = 1, H. naledi n = 8, H. antecessor n = 1, H. neanderthalensis n = 2, recent H. sapiens n = 96. In both boxplots (a,c) the median is indicated by a horizontal line, the box spans the interquartile range (IQR), and the whiskers represent the minimum and maximum values in the sample.

RU = radioulnar width. OH 7 and KNM-WT 15000 are juveniles and are missing the proximal epiphyses. Raw lengths (without epiphyses) are used in the calculation of the index plotted in (a). Data on primate epiphyseal thicknesses are scant. Conservative upper estimates of the added length added by epiphyses (an additional 2.0 mm) would put the median index slightly lower for the OH 7 specimens at 0.38 (maximum 0.39, minimum 0.37) and thus closer to the Swartkrans sample. Similarly, when the KNM-WT 15000 phalanx is estimated at an additional 2.0 mm length with epiphysis, it results in an index of 0.29. However, the growth allometry of length and width for early hominin intermediate phalanges is unknown, so caution is warranted in interpreting these metrics for such juvenile individuals. Data presented in a) consist of the following samples: KNM-ER 101000 n = 1, OH 7 n = 4, G. beringei n = 77, G. gorilla n = 48, P. troglodytes n = 68, P. paniscus n = 59, A. afarensis n = 11, A. africanus n = 4, Swartkrans n = 5, A. sediba n = 3, H. erectus n = 1, H. floresiensis n = 2, H. naledi n = 4, H. neanderthalensis n = 42, recent H. sapiens n = 155. Data presented in b) consist of the following samples: KNM-ER 101000 n = 1, OH 7 n = 4, G. beringei n = 77, G. gorilla n = 48, P. troglodytes n = 68, P. paniscus n = 59, A. afarensis n = 11, A. africanus n = 4, Swartkrans n = 5, A. sediba n = 1, H. erectus n = 1, H. floresiensis n = 3, H. naledi n = 4, H. neanderthalensis n = 42, recent H. sapiens n = 155. In both boxplots (a,b) the median is indicated by a horizontal line, the box spans the interquartile range (IQR), and the whiskers represent the minimum and maximum values in the sample. c) illustrates the observed morphology in a sample of hominin and extant ape intermediate phalanges.

Relative length and proximal articular surface morphology of the KNM-ER 101000 pedal proximal phalanges. (a) Dorsal canting angle of the hallucal proximal phalanx. (b) Proximal articular angle of the non-hallucal pedal proximal phalanx. (c) PP1 to PP5 length ratio. (d) PP5 length to base mediolateral breadth ratio. Note that KNM-ER 101000 has a non-hallucal proximal phalanx articular angle within the range of the fossil Homo sample combined with intrinsic length reduction compared to Ar. ramidus and A. afarensis. In each boxplot (a-d) the median is indicated by a horizontal line, the box spans the interquartile range (IQR), and the whiskers represent the minimum and maximum values in the sample.

Analyses of pedal proximal phalanx shape, included angle of proximal phalanx curvature, and third metatarsal variables. (a) PCA on 9 variables reflecting the intrinsic dimensions, curvature, and base dorsal canting ratio of the pPP5. Individuals on the positive end of PC1 have increased curvature, decreased dorsal canting, increased intrinsic length, and a mediolaterally narrower base and trochlea. Individuals on the positive end of PC2 have mediolaterally wider and dorsoplantarly shallower midshafts. Open triangles = H. sapiens, black crosses = P. troglodytes, grey crosses = P. paniscus, open black circle = G. gorilla, solid black circle = G. beringei, open black diamonds = Pongo spp., green diamond = Ar. ramidus (ARA-VP-6/500-044), red squares = A. afarensis (1 = A.L. 333-115i, 2 = A.L. 333-154, 3 = A.L. 333-60), gold star = KNM-ER 101000. (b) Pedal PP5 included angle of curvature. (c) MT3 torsion angle. (d) Third metatarsal base dorsoplantar height to mediolateral breadth ratio. KNM-ER 101000 has a more derived, Homo-like pPP5 combined with high metatarsal torsion and a dorsoplantarly deep tarsometatarsal joint. In each boxplot (b-d) the median is indicated by a horizontal line, the box spans the interquartile range (IQR), and the whiskers represent the minimum and maximum values in the sample.

Tropical forests act as important global carbon sinks1, and Earth System Models predict increasing near-term carbon sink capacity for these forests, with elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration thought to stimulate tree growth2,3. However, current forest inventory data analyses suggest that the carbon sink capacity of intact tropical forests may be in decline, portending a possible future switch from carbon sinks to carbon sources3,4,5,6,7. Here we use long-term forest inventory data (1971–2019) from Australian moist tropical forests and a causal inference framework8,9,10 to assess the carbon balance of woody aboveground standing biomass over time, the demographic processes accounting for it, and its climatic drivers, including cyclones. We find that a transition from sink (0.62 ± 0.04 Mg C ha−1 yr−1: 1971–2000) to source (−0.93 ± 0.11 Mg C ha−1 yr−1: 2010–2019) has occurred for the aboveground woody biomass of these forests, with sink capacity declining at a rate of 0.041 ± 0.032 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. The transition was driven by increasingly extreme temperature and other climate anomalies, which have increased tree mortality and associated biomass losses4, with no evidence of the carbon fertilization (stimulation) of woody tree growth. Forest dynamics underlying carbon sink capacity were also punctuated by cyclones, with impacts of a similar magnitude to long-term climate-induced changes. Our findings suggest the potential for a similar response to climate change by woody aboveground biomass in moist tropical forests globally, which could culminate in a long-term switch from carbon sinks to carbon sources.

CRT is calculated by dividing a, total standing aboveground biomass (AGB) by b, biomass loss rate. c, CRTs were calculated per decade for each plot (grey lines), then averaged to give regional means. Panels (a-b) show regional means for standing biomass and biomass loss, plotted using a loess smooth on all plot-by-census data. Grey shading is the 95th percentile confidence interval for error on the loess-smoothed annual means.

a, Wood density, b, stem density, c, basal area, and d, mean AGB of dead stems (biomass loss divided by number of dead stems) for n = 279 timepoints (n = 20 plots).

This arises because the statistical infrequency of cyclones results in smaller sample size for this group. Net AGB rate is the annualized change in per hectare AGB gains minus AGB losses. Boxplots show the interquartile range of the distribution, with census records for individual plots (open circles) and statistical outliers based on the inter-quartile range of the Net AGB distribution (closed circles).

Bars represent each census interval and are shaded by interval length (lighter bars for longer intervals) to aid visual interpretation. Red triangles represent the cyclone dates for each plot affected.

Over the past decade, consumer wearable sensors have become increasingly ubiquitous in health monitoring, enabling the widespread tracking of key biophysical parameters. The transition towards next-generation body-interfaced biomolecular sensing technologies, fuelled by the integration of reagentless sensing strategies with advanced nanomaterials, marks the next substantial leap forward. These innovations enable unobtrusive, multimodal monitoring of both physiological parameters and biochemical disease markers in real time. This Review examines the current generation of body-interfaced biomolecular sensing technologies, with a particular emphasis on materials innovation and nanotechnological advancements, and discusses their pivotal role in chronic disease monitoring. The discussion extends to the challenges and prospects in this rapidly evolving field, highlighting the potential for materials-focused approaches to transform the landscape of chronic disease monitoring and management with body-interfaced bioelectronics. By harnessing the power of materials and nanotechnological innovations, these biomolecular sensing technologies promise to enhance diagnostic capabilities and foster a more proactive, personalized approach to combating these diseases.

Stencilling, in which patterns are created by painting over masks, has ubiquitous applications in art, architecture and manufacturing. Modern, top-down microfabrication methods have succeeded in reducing mask sizes to under 10 nm (refs. 1,2), enabling ever smaller microdevices as today's fastest computer chips. Meanwhile, bottom-up masking using chemical bonds or physical interactions has remained largely unexplored, despite its advantages of low cost, solution-processability, scalability and high compatibility with complex, curved and three-dimensional (3D) surfaces3,4. Here we report atomic stencilling to make patchy nanoparticles (NPs), using surface-adsorbed iodide submonolayers to create the mask and ligand-mediated grafted polymers onto unmasked regions as ‘paint'. We use this approach to synthesize more than 20 different types of NP coated with polymer patches in high yield. Polymer scaling theory and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation show that stencilling, along with the interplay of enthalpic and entropic effects of polymers, generates patchy particle morphologies not reported previously. These polymer-patched NPs self-assemble into extended crystals owing to highly uniform patches, including different non-closely packed superlattices. We propose that atomic stencilling opens new avenues in patterning NPs and other substrates at the nanometre length scale, leading to precise control of their chemistry, reactivity and interactions for a wide range of applications, such as targeted delivery, catalysis, microelectronics, integrated metamaterials and tissue engineering5,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Surface patterning by techniques such as stencilling, embroidery, weaving and marbling has long been used in decorative art, cultural expression and architecture. Among these techniques, stencilling can reproducibly and precisely generate patterns on a surface by applying paint over masks with cut-outs, which is widely used in modern manufacturing. In microfabrication, electronic circuits12, flow channels13 and chemical patterns2 are ‘painted' over photoresist masks by lithography at a resolution of tens to hundreds of nanometres, enabling production of miniature devices for electronics12, memory storage14 and energy conversion15. These masks are fashioned top-down, limiting further feature miniaturization and are often implemented to flat surfaces.

By contrast, stencilling surfaces from bottom-up through self-assembly of atoms, ions or molecules is largely unexplored. Bottom-up processes, which are governed by chemical reactions or physical interactions, are promising in obtaining atomic precision patterning, solution-processability, scalability and compatibility with complex, 3D surfaces. In particular, extensive studies have applied surface patterning to make patchy particles; that is, particles with spatial domains of different ligand chemistries16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25. Janus particles, in which a section of a micrometre-sized spherical16 or ellipsoidal17 particle is coated with metal and ligand patches, are important examples. However, it remains challenging to synthesize patchy NPs with high precision and high yield for particle sizes less than 100 nm or complex (such as faceted) 3D shapes. This challenge limits the use of patchy NPs as building blocks, for which their surface ligand patterns and resultant directional interaction are expected to have a crucial role in targeted delivery5, self-assembly into metamaterials6,7, molecular separation8 and motored nanomachines9. For example, despite various strategies18,19,20,26 to render patchy NPs, only their self-assemblies into clusters were demonstrated owing to limited yield. Self-assembly of NPs into extended ordered superlattices, which has been achieved for NPs with polyhedral shapes27,28,29,30, has yet to be realized for patchy NPs.

Here we extend stencilling to a bottom-up platform by combining atomic stencils and polymer paints, providing nanometre precision and uniformity in the surface patterning of differently shaped gold NPs (Fig. 1, Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 and Supplementary Note 1). At this size scale, we achieve masking and painting by integrating colloidal NP synthesis and surface science principles with polymer physics. First, we show that iodides are efficient masks on gold NPs. The co-adsorption of iodide and 2-naphthalenethiol (2-NAT) on gold exhibits a remarkably tunable dependence on the type of gold facet, which we explain using electronic density functional theory (DFT). This facet dependence leads to selective surface masking. Next, we ‘paint' the iodide-masked NPs by ligand-mediated polymer grafting, in which polymers selectively adhere only to the unmasked gold surface, rendering patches. With these two steps demonstrated, we explore the parameter space of NP shape, iodide concentration, ligand concentration and grafting temperature, achieving the synthesis of more than 20 different types of patchy NP, 17 of which are at a yield higher than 80% (Fig. 1, Supplementary Figs. 3–15 and Supplementary Table 1). This approach generates patch patterns not observed previously, such as face patches, hybrid face–vertex patches, web-like patches and symmetry-broken patches. These patterns are predicted by our multiscale scaling theory31 and MD simulation performed in parallel with our experiments. Our particles are highly uniform, allowing self-assembly into millimetre-scale, non-closely packed lattices directed by patches, which until now have been merely a computational blueprint32. The openness of these lattices can lead to emergent properties, such as negative Poisson ratios7 and complete photonic bandgaps11. Our implementation of atomic stencilling is straightforward, based on the fundamental understanding of interatomic and intermolecular interactions, and can generalize to other NP systems and substrates for functional patterning.

Scale bar, 30 nm. c, Library of different patchy NPs created by atomic stencilling of five different NP shapes. The particle shape schematics also highlight the existence of truncations (not drawn to scale). Within each NP shape of ‘w/ iodide', top to bottom corresponds to increasing [I−]/[2-NAT]. Shown for each shape are representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (left) and predictions based on polymer scaling theory (right). For cuboctahedra and cubes, two patch patterns are shown with two different viewing angles. See more examples in Supplementary Figs. 3–15 and synthesis conditions in Supplementary Tables 1, 2 and 4–8. In experimental images, the polymer patches are false-coloured in cyan. The labels ‘w/ iodide' (purple-shaded region) and ‘w/o iodide' (unshaded region) refer to polymer-grafted NPs with and without iodide incubation, respectively. Scale bars, 20 nm.

Figure 1a shows an example of traditional stencilling at the macroscale, in which a Mona Lisa silhouette-shaped mask is applied onto an arbitrarily curved pottery surface and painted over. The waxy masked area repels aqueous ink, delivering intricate patterns on painting. Likewise, stencilling on NP surfaces is achieved by two steps (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Note 2). During masking, the pristine NPs, which are synthesized following previous literature33,34, are incubated with sodium iodide. Halide ions are known to adsorb on metal surfaces and are widely used as shape modifiers in NP synthesis35,36 but have not been used for molecular patterning. Of the three halides (that is, chloride, bromide and iodide), iodide binds most strongly to gold surfaces35,37 and resists removal from the gold surfaces35,37, even on extensive washing, which provides stable masking. The incubation with iodide is carefully controlled in degassed water with sodium hydroxides and NPs are subsequently washed, as excess iodide can cause unwanted etching of gold NPs35 (Methods and Supplementary Note 2). Next, the iodide-masked NPs are mixed with short hydrophobic thiol ligands of 2-NAT and polystyrene-b-polyacrylic acid (PS-b-PAA) in dimethylformamide (DMF) and water, heated at a fixed temperature for 2 h to complete the polymer grafting. 2-NAT covers the unmasked regions and makes them hydrophobic, allowing the physisorption of the PS blocks24 of the polymers to paint the exposed gold surface. Although other halide ions are present during iodide masking, they show negligible effects on polymer patching (Supplementary Fig. 16a,b). Control experiments using bromide and chloride as masking agents generate non-patchy NPs (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 16c–e).

As summarized in Fig. 1c, the stencil strategy robustly produces a library of patchy NPs for five different core NP shapes (octahedron, bipyramid, cuboctahedron, cube and rhombic dodecahedron), each of which has small vertex truncations. These truncations produce secondary facets (hereafter referred to as vertices), whose atomic arrangement differs from that of the primary facets (hereafter referred to as faces). Varying the reaction conditions allows control over the size, shape and pattern of the patches (Supplementary Figs. 3–15, Supplementary Tables 2–10 and Supplementary Notes 2 and 3). In the absence of iodide masks, NPs are fully coated with polymers regardless of NP shape (Fig. 1c, the ‘w/o iodide' region). With iodide masks, moving left to right and top to bottom in Fig. 1c, we see that, for the octahedron and bipyramid shapes, not only is the vertex patch size tunable but the pattern transitions from all-vertex patches to a single vertex patch as the iodide concentration [I−] increases while keeping the 2-NAT concentration [2-NAT] constant, breaking the inherent NP symmetry. Cuboctahedra exhibit a transition from all-face to all-vertex patches with increasing [I−]/[2-NAT], whereas cubes and rhombic dodecahedra are both dominated by face patches but exhibit further complexity. Their extended face patches can merge into web-like patterns. For rhombic dodecahedra, hybrid patches that include both face and vertex patches can coexist on a NP. Each of the experimentally realized patchy NPs matches that predicted by scaling theory (Fig. 1c). We emphasize that our stencil approach and explicit use of adatom masks differentiates our method from other reports to create polymer patches on NPs18,19,20,21,22,23,24. The stencilling method is scalable (Supplementary Fig. 17 and Supplementary Note 2.9) and applies to other thiols and block copolymers (Supplementary Fig. 18).

Atomic-scale DFT calculations (Methods, Supplementary Tables 11–13 and Supplementary Note 4) show that iodide adsorption onto gold NP surfaces leads to facet-selective binding of 2-NAT ligands, controlled by iodide and ligand concentrations. Experimentally, iodide is expected to oxidize to iodine on metal surfaces35; we include this consideration in our DFT model and refer to this process as iodide adsorption. We consider the low-energy (111), (100) and (110) facets of gold observed in the particles33,34. Depending on the NP shape, these facets can be large (faces) or small (vertices), an observation that will become important below. Our DFT calculations predict that the Au(111) facet is preferentially masked by iodide at all of the conditions considered (Fig. 2a–c,e, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figs. 19–23). Figure 2a illustrates the effect of iodide on 2-NAT adsorption at a 2-NAT coverage of 1/3 monolayer (ML) and iodide coverages of 0 and 1/2 ML (top and bottom panels, respectively). In the absence of iodide, 2-NAT resides close to all of the gold surfaces (Fig. 2b) and forms strong chemical bonds (Fig. 2c). As the iodide coverage increases, the Au–S distance dAu–S increases for all surfaces, but the increase in dAu–S is the largest for the (111) surface, followed by the (100) and then the (110) surfaces (Fig. 2b). Concomitantly, the fraction of the binding energy that can be attributed to chemisorption decreases the most for Au(111) and the least for Au(110) as the iodide coverage increases (Fig. 2c). Strong iodide adsorption onto gold NPs is experimentally confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping of iodide-incubated gold NPs (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3 and Supplementary Figs. 24–26). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy confirm that increasing [I−] leads to higher iodide adsorption and less 2-NAT coating onto the NP surface (Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Tables 9 and 10).

Scale bars, 20 nm. e, Phase diagram delineating equilibrium adsorption configurations on gold as a function of iodide and 2-NAT chemical potentials. The surface coverages of iodide (purple) and 2-NAT (orange) on three different facets are represented by relative line lengths (coverage values in Supplementary Table 13), corresponding to the numbered phase regions in the phase diagram. Regions in which stencil effect is predicted by DFT are shaded in cyan.

Figure 2e shows a phase diagram delineated into regions based on the equilibrium surface configurations of iodide and 2-NAT adsorption on all three gold surfaces for varying chemical potentials, \({\mu }_{{{\rm{I}}}^{-}}\) and μ2-NAT. For 2-NAT, we only include chemisorption configurations. We do observe configurations in which 2-NAT is partially or completely physisorbed (Fig. 2a) but we presume that the weakly bound, physisorbed 2-NAT would not remain on the NP surface to provide stable grafting sites for polymers (Fig. 2c). We use \(\Delta {\mu }_{2\text{-NAT}}={\mu }_{2\text{-NAT}}\,-\,{E}_{2\text{-NAT}}^{{\rm{DFT}}}\) for plotting Fig. 2e (Supplementary Table 13 and Supplementary Note 4), in which \({E}_{2\text{-NAT}}^{{\rm{DFT}}}\) is the energy of 2-NAT in the gas phase and Δμ2-NAT is the rescaled chemical potential of 2-NAT. We see that, with low \({\mu }_{{{\rm{I}}}^{-}}\) and high Δμ2-NAT, all surfaces are covered by 2-NAT and there is no adsorbed iodide. Conversely, with high \({\mu }_{{{\rm{I}}}^{-}}\) and low Δμ2-NAT, all surfaces are covered by iodide with no adsorbed 2-NAT. The cyan-coloured intermediate regions in Fig. 2e indicate where stencilling is expected. Each cyan region has 1/3 ML of iodide and no 2-NAT on Au(111) and 1/2 ML 2-NAT but no iodide on Au(110). Our calculations predict competition between iodide and 2-NAT adsorption on Au(100): at low \({\mu }_{{{\rm{I}}}^{-}}\), the (100) surface contains 2-NAT only. The surface coverage switches to iodide only as \({\mu }_{{{\rm{I}}}^{-}}\) increases with moderate Δμ2-NAT and both iodide and 2-NAT adsorb when the chemical potentials of both species are high.

The DFT calculations predict facet-dependent 2-NAT adsorption on gold in the presence of iodide, which rationalizes the experimental library of patchy NPs. The surfaces of the five gold NP shapes comprise combinations of {111}, {100} and {110} facets (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Figs. 5–7). Consistent with DFT calculation, {111} facets are masked first. When all NP faces are {111} and masked by iodide, vertex polymer patches dominate. As shown in Fig. 3c–e, gold octahedra of eight triangular {111} faces have a high yield (92.8%) of six vertex patches (Fig. 3d), with highly uniform patch thickness, position and coverage (Supplementary Figs. 3, 4 and 27 and Supplementary Video 1). Similarly, bipyramids with ten {111} faces exhibit vertex patches on the longitudinal vertices and a doughnut-like patch around the equator, at a yield of 80.4% (Fig. 3f–h, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, Supplementary Video 1). When [I−] is fixed, variations in [2-NAT] change the patch size (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). In the control experiment without iodide masking, decreasing [2-NAT] can cause insufficient 2-NAT coverage, leading to partial polymer-coated domains that are irregular and lack facet selectivity (Supplementary Fig. 4c,d).

Note that, in the SEM images (o–r), the dark regions on the NPs are the polymer patches, as also highlighted in cyan in the insets. More than 100 NPs (208 NPs (d), 102 NPs (g), 141 NPs (j) and 130 NPs (m)) are analysed to determine the synthesis yield of each patchy NP type. Scale bars, 200 nm (20 nm for inset images).

When NP faces are not all {111}, non-conventional patterns emerge, such as face, web-like and hybrid patches, which are the unique result of facet-selective iodide masking and cannot be created using previously reported strategies18,19,20,21,22,23,24. For example, cuboctahedra—which have eight faces of {111} and six faces of {100}—can have six face patches on the {100} facets at low [I−]/[2-NAT], with {111} facets masked first (Fig. 3i–k, Extended Data Fig. 6f,h, Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8 and Supplementary Video 2). The patch pattern transitions to 12 vertex patches when both {100} and {111} faces are masked at high [I−]/[2-NAT] (Fig. 3l–n, Extended Data Fig. 6g,i, Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Video 2). In optimized conditions, the face-patched and vertex-patched cuboctahedra are highly uniform, at yields of 79.4% and 75.4%, respectively (Fig. 3j,m and Supplementary Table 5). Cubes, which contain six {100} faces and eight {111} vertices, exhibit expanded face patches that merge at the cube edges to form web-like patches (Fig. 3o and Supplementary Table 6) at low [I−]/[2-NAT]. The patches shrink their size to disconnected face patches at a high yield of 98.0% at high [I−]/[2-NAT] (Fig. 3p, Supplementary Figs. 10–12, Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Video 1). These observations align with our DFT calculations and Raman results that higher [I−]/[2-NAT] leads to decreased 2-NAT adsorption (Extended Data Fig. 4). Rhombic dodecahedron NPs have all 12 faces as {110} facets and two sets of vertex types—six {100} vertices and eight {111} vertices (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 7a–g). At low [I−]/[2-NAT], only the {111} surfaces are masked, leading to a hybrid patch pattern: extended patches on the {110} faces merging into web-like patches with tunable widths, together with small patches, each of diameter 9.0 ± 1.0 nm, precisely located on the six {100} vertices (Fig. 3q, Supplementary Figs. 13a,b,e and 28 and Supplementary Table 8). At high [I−]/[2-NAT], the six {100} vertices are also masked, consistent with DFT calculations, leading to only face patches, as all vertices become masked (Fig. 3r and Supplementary Fig. 13c–e). The emergence of these new patch patterns underscores the precise and robust realization of facet-specific masking with nanometre resolution (Supplementary Fig. 29). The stencil approach works for small NPs as well. Smaller rhombic dodecahedra, with 28.6 nm edge length, for example, exhibit the same patch patterns as the larger ones (Extended Data Figs. 7h–k and 8, Supplementary Fig. 14 and Supplementary Video 3).

Although iodide masking dictates the available gold NP facets for polymer grafting and, thus, patch patterning, the PS-b-PAA block copolymers as patches experience microphase separation and have sizes similar in magnitude to the size of the core NPs. As such, we expect that enthalpic and entropic effects associated with the polymers further fine-tune, within the set of available grafting sites, the patch patterns on NPs and the size of patches24,31. To explain these effects, we develop a multiscale modelling workflow to bridge the atomistic-level DFT model with mesoscale polymer behaviour. We first construct a statistical mechanical adsorption model for iodide masking that inputs the binding energies computed by DFT, which determines the stoichiometric ratios of surface binding sites available for polymer grafting on each facet type (Methods, Supplementary Fig. 30 and Supplementary Note 5). In this way, we directly map DFT calculations of individual facets to the 3D NP shapes, thereby quantifying how surface masking affects the thermodynamics that govern chain conformations (Fig. 4a). Microscopically, neighbouring grafted polymers induce crowding, causing chain extension and a large entropic penalty24. Meanwhile, chain extension facilitates enthalpically favourable PS–PS contacts (Supplementary Note 6). This competition between conformational entropy and interchain attraction Echain determines the free energy of a grafted polymer chain at the unmasked NP surface locations.

a, Schematic of the theoretical model of polymer grafting on NP surface and its dependence on [I−] and Echain. Polymers of end-to-end distance R are grafted with one end with their conformation as a function of Ω, a shape parameter that defines the spatially dependent NP surface curvature (Supplementary Note 6). b,f, Polymer grafting probability pgraft mapped onto the surfaces of an octahedron (b) and a cuboctahedron (f). c,g, MD simulations (purple, surface regions masked by iodide; cyan, grafted polymer chains) of patchy octahedron (c) and patchy cuboctahedron (g). d,h, TEM images of patchy octahedron (d) and patchy cuboctahedron (h), with patches colour-coded to their local thickness tloc (Supplementary Note 3). When two patches overlap in projection, we show the thickness map for one of them for clarity. Reaction conditions from left to right: (d) [I−] of 0, 0.17, 0.42 and 117.60 µM at a fixed [2-NAT] of 11.3 µM; (h) [I−]/[2-NAT] of 0, 0.037, 0.980 and 30.7 (Supplementary Tables 2 and 5). Scale bars, 10 nm. e, Maximum patch thickness tm (defined and labelled in d) and patch coverage fraction fcov (defined as the fraction of NP surface covered by patches) from theory (lines) and experiment (mean values as symbols, standard deviation as error bars). From low to high [I−], a total of 111, 45, 74, 98, 73 and 43 NPs are analysed for each sample, respectively. i, Phase diagram of patch patterns predicted by theory. Patchy NP configurations overlaid on the phase diagram are individual theoretical calculations. Coloured regions are approximated by examining the predicted patch patterns.

Using this multiscale modelling approach, we predict the patching behaviours as a function of experimentally relevant parameters, including NP shape, NP local surface curvature Ω, [I−], grafting concentration and temperature T (Supplementary Notes 6 and 7 and Supplementary Figs. 31–36). In the absence of iodide and excess [2-NAT], our model predicts that NPs are fully coated by polymers (Fig. 4b,f and Supplementary Fig. 31), consistent with our experiments. Following introduction of iodide stencils, grafted chains can no longer freely explore the NP surface but are confined to regions bounded by the masks. In the example of octahedra, vertex patches are found to form in our model (Fig. 4b), MD simulation (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Note 8) and experiments (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). Figure 4e shows the theoretical prediction of the patch dimensions, including maximum patch thickness tm and patch coverage fraction fcov (Supplementary Figs. 32–34 and Supplementary Note 3). The initial increase of tm is associated with increasing [I−], reducing the area of available sites as reflected in smaller fcov, and thus crowding the chains to induce polymer extension. Similarly, rhombic dodecahedra, although face-patched, exhibit the same dependence of patch dimensions on [I−] as vertex-patched octahedra (Extended Data Figs. 8 and 9, Supplementary Fig. 35, Supplementary Note 8 and Supplementary Video 4). By comparison, cuboctahedra NPs undergo a patch pattern transition (Fig. 3i–n), which is also captured by the model and MD simulation (Fig. 4f–h and Supplementary Video 4).

The patching process is driven largely by thermodynamic equilibrium, although with kinetic formation of intermediates. For example, the patches in octahedra are initially small and only form at a subset of the available vertices (Supplementary Fig. 37), because free polymer chains in solution may not have sampled all vertices. Yet, as more chains adsorb, chain crowding at the vertices drives the patches to the equilibrium state, with more uniform patch size and distribution.

Our predictive multiscale framework is extended across all experimentally relevant handles to construct a phase diagram (Fig. 4i), including four distinct regions of patch patterns: vertex-patched, face-patched, fully coated and symmetry-broken. We use the reduced coordinates of [2-NAT]1/2/[I−] to reflect the idea that iodide coverage competes with [2-NAT] to control chain coverage on the NP surface. The thermodynamic effects of the polymer chain conformation grafted out of the available sites determined by unmasked regions are captured in reduced coordinate TΩ1/4. A high TΩ1/4 reflects the limit at which steric repulsion between neighbouring chains dominates patch patterning, whereas a low TΩ1/4 indicates that chain–chain attraction dictates the resultant polymer distribution. Notably, the symmetry-breaking limit corresponds to substantial microphase separation between the PS and PAA blocks, in which interchain attraction dominates to break the intrinsic symmetry of iodide-masked NPs (Supplementary Fig. 15).

Atomic stencilling provides highly uniform patchy NPs, which allows us to demonstrate their self-assembly into highly ordered superlattices. The polymer patches on neighbouring NPs are repulsive as a result of electrostatic and steric forces arising from the choice of polymer. Consequently, we expect patchy facets to avoid alignment with one another at close range. At the same time, we do not expect the monolayer of iodide on the masked facets to impede the gold–gold van der Waals interactions, so the masked facets are still expected to favour alignment.

Controlled evaporation of the patchy NP solution leads to the formation of superlattices with large interparticle spacing (Fig. 5a–g, Supplementary Figs. 38–47 and Supplementary Table 14). For the four patchy NPs as building blocks (face-patched rhombic dodecahedra, face-patched cuboctahedra, vertex-patched octahedra and face-patched cubes), their superlattices feature single-crystalline domains that extend over hundreds of micrometres or even millimetres were it not for the cracks that develop during drying. These superlattices exhibit body-centred cubic (BCC) or body-centred tetragonal (BCT) symmetries, which differ from the closely packed lattices formed by pristine NPs of the same shapes27 (Supplementary Fig. 48 and Supplementary Table 15). Our Monte Carlo (MC) simulations predict these superlattices and reveal that the directional interactions among precisely patterned patches are key to obtaining these open structures (Fig. 5h–r, Supplementary Fig. 49, Supplementary Note 9 and Supplementary Video 5).

Consider face-patched rhombic dodecahedra as an example. They have 12 patched faces and 14 masked vertices, so we propose that each particle will favour having 14 particles in its first and second neighbour shells with the attractive vertices aligned (Fig. 5k). A top-down view of the superlattice shows an interparticle spacing of 77.5 ± 6.9 nm (1.56 times the NP size) in one two-dimensional (2D) square-symmetry lattice layer (Fig. 5e). 3D reconstruction from X-ray tomography at single-particle resolution confirms a BCC superlattice, exceeding tens of layers in the z-dimension (Fig. 5g and Supplementary Figs. 50–52). Successful formation of the same superlattice on different substrates demonstrates that interparticle interactions, rather than substrate effects, dominate the assembly process (Supplementary Figs. 39–42). The BCC superlattice has a volume fraction as low as 0.31, in sharp contrast to the space-filling face-centred cubic superlattices assembled from pristine rhombic dodecahedra (Supplementary Fig. 48). We compute potentials of mean force for pairs of face-patched rhombic dodecahedra at different relative orientations (Fig. 5h). MC simulations using these interaction potentials reveal that initially randomly oriented patchy NPs reorient to produce BCC lattices with long-range ordering (Fig. 5i,j and Supplementary Fig. 53). As suggested, the BCC lattice is stabilized by the formation of a unit cell featuring a central patchy NP surrounded by eight nearest neighbours and six next nearest neighbours, in both simulation and experimental assemblies (Fig. 5f,k,l and Supplementary Fig. 54).

All four patchy NPs form into large-scale superlattices, with agreement between experiment and MC simulation. The face-patched cuboctahedra (Fig. 5m,n and Supplementary Figs. 43–46 and 55) and vertex-patched octahedra (Fig. 5o,p and Supplementary Figs. 47 and 56) assemble into BCC structures at low volume fractions. The face-patched cubes assemble at a low volume fraction (0.33 in MC simulation; Supplementary Figs. 57 and 58) into a BCC superlattice, which transitions to a BCT superlattice (lattice vector ratio of 1.8:1:1) at increased volume fraction (0.53 in MC simulation in Supplementary Fig. 57, experiment in Fig. 5q,r), in which a BCC arrangement is geometrically impossible. Notably, the patch pattern, size and thickness are all crucial for the formation of long-range, open structures. The assembly of symmetry-broken patchy NPs shows disrupted local order. Furthermore, if the patches are too small, the strong attraction from gold–gold van der Waals forces between exposed faces can lead to kinetically trapped aggregates (Supplementary Fig. 59).

Our work presents bottom-up stencilling of NPs using adatom adsorption to create masks. Strong interatomic bonding leads to nanometre precision in molecular patterning, resulting in a large library of patchy NPs. We develop a robust multiscale theoretical framework for atomic stencilling, by bridging DFT calculations, polymer scaling theory, MD simulation of chain distributions and configurations with MC simulation of large-scale assembly, which predicts and confirms our experimental observations. This experiment–theory–simulation integration can extend to other NP systems, in which the tunability of core NP composition, shape, size, as well as patch polymer chemistry is limitless. For example, gold nanorods are promising candidates worth further study owing to their rich faceting behaviours determined by particle size and synthesis conditions38. Stencilling can also be applied to other metal NPs such as palladium nanocubes (Supplementary Fig. 60), in which the presence of iodide leads to the formation of face-patched palladium nanocubes, similar to the face-patched gold nanocubes. Iodide adsorption on Pd(111) and Pd(110) has been studied39,40, although the specific 2-NAT co-adsorption mechanism needs further investigation. The general principle of facet-selective adsorption and masking is likely to generalize to other metals, such as Cu (refs. 36,41,42) and Ag (ref. 43). Surface chemistry is critical to the self-assembly27,28, electron–photon coupling44, charge/electron transfer45 and chemical reactivities10 of NPs and other surfaces. Using atomic stencilling to control surface chemistry is poised to accelerate NP applications, from metamaterials to quantum information systems, fuel cells, batteries and catalysis5,6,8,9,10, as well as to achieve nanometre-scale patterning on substrates46 for integrated circuits and other multifunctional materials.

Our work demonstrates nanoscale colloidal valency control using explicit surface ligand patches for 3D superlattice engineering. ‘Valency' control has been shown with extensive successes in simulation32, at the molecular scale (for example, metal–organic frameworks) and for micrometre-sized colloids16, leading to innovations in reticular chemistry, tandem catalysis and understanding of out-of-equilibrium dynamics owing to symmetry-breaking. At the nanoscale, valency control has been demonstrated using NPs uniformly grafted with DNA47; here we show that directional interactions can be rationally achieved from surface patchiness, which may or may not reflect the underlying particle symmetry. Experimental observation of the self-assembly dynamics of patchy NPs, using liquid-phase TEM48,49,50 or small-angle X-ray scattering, can potentially reveal how the directional interactions govern the assembly pathways.

Nanopure deionized (DI) water (18.2 MΩ cm at 25 °C) purified by a Milli-Q Advantage A10 system was used. Note that the purity of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) is important for gold NP synthesis. We have used three types of CTAB: (1) Sigma-Aldrich, for molecular biology, ≥99%, product number: H6269; (2) Sigma-Aldrich, BioXtra, ≥99%, product number: H9151; and (3) Sigma-Aldrich, BioUltra, ≥99.0%, product number: 52365. For the data presented in this work, CTAB (1) and CTAB (2) were used for the experiments performed before February 2024. CTAB (3) has been used to reproduce the experiments afterwards.

Gold octahedron, cuboctahedron, rhombic dodecahedron, cube and bipyramid NPs were synthesized following previously reported methods with slight modifications33,34 (Supplementary Note 1). Palladium cubes were synthesized following previous literature51 with modifications (Supplementary Note 2.8).

Patchy NPs were synthesized in two steps, which are iodide masking and ligand-mediated polymer grafting. Using the patchy octahedra in Fig. 3c as an example, for the iodide-masking step, we first degas DI water by purging with N2 for 1 h to minimize oxygen content. This degassed water is used throughout the masking step to minimize the oxidative etching of NPs. A gold octahedra solution was centrifuged at 2,400 × g for 15 min and the resulting pellet was diluted in 20 mM CTAC with degassed water to achieve a final NP concentration of 0.5 optical density (OD) at a maximum extinction wavelength λmax (Stock Solution I). Next, 5.75 µl of freshly prepared iodide solution (1 ml of 10 mM NaI, 500 µl of 200 mM NaOH and 8.5 ml degassed DI water) was added dropwise to 6.9 ml of Stock Solution I under mild vortex and incubated undisturbed for 30 min. After the incubation, 2.1 ml of 40 mM CTAB was added, followed by three rounds of centrifugation (3,400 × g, 5,300 × g and 2,200 × g for 15 min each). The supernatant was removed after each centrifugation and a 10-µl pellet was redispersed in 10 ml of 20 mM CTAB after the first round and 1 ml of DI water after the second round, respectively. The final pellet from the third centrifugation, after supernatant removal, was diluted with DI water to reach 5.0 OD at λmax with 0.07 mM CTAB (Stock Solution II). The final CTAB concentration can be varied depending on differently shaped NPs, as provided in Supplementary Note 2.

For ligand-mediated polymer grafting, still using the patchy octahedra in Fig. 3c as an example, we sequentially added 817 µl DMF, 5 µl of 2-NAT solution (2 mg ml−1 in DMF), 200 µl of Stock Solution II and 80 µl of PS-b-PAA (8 mg ml−1 in DMF) into an 8-ml vial under mild vortex. The vial was tightly capped with a Teflon-lined cap, sonicated for 5 s, Parafilm-sealed and heated at 110 °C in an oil bath for 2 h without disturbance. After cooling to room temperature in the oil bath, the reaction mixture was transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged three times at 3,400 × g, 1,300 × g and 1,000 × g (15 min each) to remove molecular residues. After each centrifugation, 1.49 ml of the supernatant was removed and a 10-µl pellet was redispersed in 1.49 ml of water. Following the final centrifugation, the 10-µl pellet was diluted with 90 µl of water for subsequent characterizations and self-assembly experiments. Detailed descriptions of the experimental procedure of the synthesis of other patchy NPs are provided in Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Tables 2–8.

Similar procedures with modifications can be extended to palladium nanocubes (Supplementary Note 2.8), other thiols and block copolymers (Supplementary Notes 2.1 and 2.5) and scale-up synthesis (Supplementary Note 2.9).

For self-assembly experiments, a patchy NP solution in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube was left undisturbed overnight, allowing the particles to sediment and concentrate (≥30.0 OD at λmax).

A silicon wafer (3 × 3 mm2, Ted Pella) was cleaned with water, acetone and isopropanol through sonication for 5 min each, followed by 60 s of O2 plasma treatment using a Harrick Plasma PDC-32 (maximum RF power of 18 W) to make the surface hydrophilic. Meanwhile, a 4 × 4-inch2 piece of Parafilm was placed on a TechniCloth (TX609, Texwipe) with a water-filled Petri dish cover (60 × 15 mm2, Falcon) on top. 3.5 µl of a concentrated patchy NP solution was drop-casted onto the wafer on the Parafilm. Immediately after drop-casting, both the silicon wafer and Petri dish were covered by a large Petri dish (100 × 15 mm2, VWR) and gently pressed down to seal against the Parafilm, maintaining a humid environment (humidity: 75–80%). A typical drying process takes 16–24 h at room temperature (Supplementary Fig. 38a).

A 10-µl glass capillary tube (inner diameter: 0.5573 mm, Drummond Scientific Company) was filled with 2 M NaOH, incubated for 20 min, rinsed with water and dried to make the inner wall hydrophilic before use. 5 µl of concentrated patchy NP solution was then drawn into the capillary tube, keeping the NP solution several centimetres away from both tube ends. The capillary tube was suspended inside a loosely capped 15-ml centrifuge tube, which was then placed in a desiccator until the solution had fully dried, forming a visible gold ring around the interior. See the experimental set-up in Supplementary Fig. 38b.

TEM images were acquired with a JEOL 2100 LaB6 transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV. SEM images were captured using an FEI Helios NanoLab 600i operated at 2 kV with a beam current of 0.17 nA and a working distance of 4.0 mm. HAADF-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging was conducted on a probe aberration-corrected Thermo Fisher Scientific Themis Z scanning transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV. STEM-EDX mapping was acquired with a Thermo Fisher Scientific ‘Kraken' Spectra 300 operated at 60 kV equipped with Dual-X EDX detectors with a collection angle of 1.76 sr.

For NP facet imaging and analysis, solutions of pristine NPs were drop-casted on TEM grids, with CTAB concentration reduced through three rounds of centrifugation. Approximately 50–200 µl of the pristine NP solutions in 40 mM CTAB was used per sample. Each sample was first diluted with 1 ml of water in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, followed by removing 990 µl of supernatant after each of the first two centrifugations. After each centrifugation, a 10-µl pellet was redispersed in 990 µl of water. Following the third centrifugation, a 1.5-µl pellet was drop-casted onto a carbon-coated copper TEM grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences, CF400-Cu) and dried completely. Before imaging, samples were plasma-cleaned for 2 min at 15 W under a 12-sccm flow of Ar + O2 to remove residual CTAB molecules covering NPs using a PIE Scientific Tergeo-EM plasma cleaner.

HAADF images were acquired with a beam current of approximately 20 pA and semi-convergence angle of 18 mrad. The camera length was 115 mm and the collection angles of the HAADF detector were 62–200 mrad for image acquisition. To minimize image distortion from sample drift, several sequential frames (10–50 frames) with short dwell time (100–500 ns) were acquired, which were used to render drift-corrected frames to enhance the contrast.

TEM images for tomography reconstruction were collected by titling the samples from 0° to −60° and then from 0° to +60° in 2° intervals, capturing 61 images per sample. To minimize beam damage, a low electron dose rate of 6–8 e− Å−2 s−1 was used. To improve the polymer patch contrast, a defocus of −2,048 nm was used. Image alignment and contrast-transfer function correction were performed using IMOD64 4.9.3 software52. Tomograms were generated using OpenMBIR with diffuseness of 0.3 and smoothness of 0.2 as reconstruction parameters, which uses a model-based iterative algorithm of tomogram reconstruction53. 3D models of the tomograms were visualized using Amira 6.4 from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The tomograms were denoised using three filters: median (3 × 3 × 3 voxel neighbourhood, iterations 26), Gaussian filter (kernel size 9, 3 × 3 × 3 standard deviation) and edge-preserving smoothing (time 25, step 5, contrast 3.5 and sigma 3). Polymer patches and gold NPs were segmented by greyscale intensity thresholding and refined manually in Amira 6.4 software.

Samples for the STEM-EDX analysis were prepared by drop-casting Stock Solution II on carbon-coated copper TEM grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, CF400-Cu). The octahedra and cuboctahedra were iodide-masked. To minimize carbon contamination, the TEM grids were baked overnight at 130 °C in high vacuum to remove excess CTAB. STEM-EDX maps were acquired with a 120-pA probe current, a 30-mrad semi-convergence angle and continuous raster-scanning with drift correction, using a 2-µs dwell time over approximately 4 h. For iodide-masked cuboctahedra, the NPs were predominantly oriented on the carbon support along the [001] direction. Therefore, the stage was tilted 45° to the [110] zone axis, aligning both the {111} and {100} facets ‘edge-on'. Elemental mapping was achieved by fitting and quantifying the peak intensities above the background using the Cliff–Lorimer method54. Two high-quality EDX maps of seven cuboctahedra were selected and a total of 1,692 line profiles were obtained (Supplementary Fig. 25). Similarly, iodide-masked octahedra were oriented on the carbon support along the [110] direction and their ‘edge-on' {111} facets were used for iodide concentration analysis (Extended Data Fig. 2).

The tloc of patches was determined as the diameter of the largest circle that can fit within the patch and includes the target pixel. Patch contours were manually outlined in ImageJ to define the patch regions. The tloc map was then obtained using the built-in ‘Local Thickness' function in ImageJ, as also detailed in our previous work24.

The values of tm and fcov were measured using a neural-network-based method on TEM images55. The neural network-based TEM image segmentation is detailed in Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Figs. 32 and 33. After training the neural network with manually labelled TEM images of diverse patchy NP shapes, a shape fingerprint t was extracted from the patch contours. First, the centroid of the gold NP was identified and rays extending from θ = −180° to θ = 179° at 1° intervals were drawn from the centroid. The distance that each ray travels within the patch region was recorded as a function of θ. tm is determined by the maximum value of t and fcov is identified as the range of θ in which t is non-zero. See detailed description in Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Figs. 34–36.

Ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectra were measured using a Scinco S-4100 PDA spectrophotometer with a quartz cuvette (path length = 1 cm, VWR).

XPS analysis was performed using a Kratos Axis Ultra equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation X-ray source and an energy resolution of 0.4 eV. Before characterization, 10 µl of each Stock Solution II, prepared with various iodide concentrations, was drop-casted on a silicon wafer cleaned with water, acetone and isopropanol and then fully dried. The silicon wafers were fixed to the sample bar and transported to the instrument in an airtight container under an Ar atmosphere for XPS signal acquisition. Data processing and peak fitting were conducted using the CasaXPS software. Atomic concentrations within samples were calculated by integrating the fitted XPS spectra for all analysed regions and adjusting for atomic relative sensitivity factors. See detailed sample conditions in Supplementary Table 9.

Raman characterization was performed using a Horiba XploRA-nano TERS/TEPL with a 100× objective lens. The Raman samples were prepared following two steps, without polymer grafting (Supplementary Table 10). First, gold octahedra were iodide-masked in varying [I−] and then concentrated to reach 20.0 OD at λmax in 0.07 mM CTAB, following the iodide-masking procedure described above. Next, 40 µl of 2-NAT (0.2 mg ml−1 in DMF) and 200 µl of the iodide-masked octahedra were sequentially added into 860 µl of DMF in a vial with mild vortex. The remaining reaction condition and washing steps follow the standard iodide masking procedure, except for centrifugation, which was performed three times at 2,900 × g for 15 min and 2,400 × g for 7 min twice. After the first two centrifugations, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of DMF. After the final centrifugation, the sediment was redispersed in 20 µl of DMF and the NP concentration was adjusted to 13.0 OD at λmax by adding water. A 5-µl aliquot of this NP solution was drop-casted onto a clean glass slide. The glass slide was used after washing with isopropyl alcohol and water and then fully dried. Raman measurements were performed with a 638-nm excitation wavelength, 1-mW laser power and three scans for average (90 s exposure time each).

The X-ray tomography sample was prepared through a focused-ion beam milling using the FEI Helios NanoLab 600i. Before milling, platinum was deposited on the self-assembled patchy rhombic dodecahedra on a silicon wafer, with a deposition diameter of 3 µm and a thickness of 300 nm. Subsequently, the assembly was milled into a cylinder with a diameter of 2.5 µm. The shaped cylinder was lifted with an OmniProbe and mounted onto a tungsten needle tip (Supplementary Fig. 50).

X-ray tomography data were acquired at the hard X-ray nanoprobe beamline of National Synchrotron Light Source II at Brookhaven National Laboratory. A monochromatic beam at 12 keV was selected and then focused by a set of crossed multilayer Laue lenses to produce a nanobeam56 with a size of approximately 13 nm. 2D fly-scans were performed in a grid pattern with at least 150 × 150 pixels, 50-ms dwell time and 10-nm step size at every 2° to collect 91 projections covering 180°. Far-field diffraction patterns were analysed with a ptychographic reconstruction algorithm to retrieve both the complex-valued probe and the object functions. The acquired fluorescence spectra were fitted using the software package PyXRF. Individual 2D frames were coarsely aligned using ImageJ 1.5, MultiStackReg plugin, whereas fine alignments were adjusted with a cross-correlation function in Tomviz 1.9, followed by 3D reconstruction. The data were further processed by Fourier filtering using the sharp lattice peaks in the reciprocal space image of the superlattice to remove noise and sharpen the particle positions for subsequent segmentation, using Dragonfly 2020.2 software57.

All DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package58,59,60 with projector augmented waves61. The generalized gradient approximation by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof was used for the exchange-correlation functional62. We chose an energy cut-off of 450 eV as an optimal value for our plane-wave basis set. For the sampling of the first Brillouin zone, Monkhorst–Pack grids were used63. We also included the DFT-D3 method of Grimme et al. with the Becke–Johnson damping to describe long-range van der Waals interactions64. See details in Supplementary Note 4.

A library of individual patchy NPs was simulated using MD using the HOOMD-blue simulation engine65. First, a single anisotropic particle was placed at the centre of the simulation box. Polymer chains with one grafting end were then randomly distributed on the surface of the central anisotropic particle and allowed to freely move on the surface to find their equilibrium positions. The location of iodide-masked regions predicted from our iodide adsorption theory (see details in Supplementary Note 5) were modelled as spherical beads that are strongly repulsive to the polymer chains. All chain–chain interactions exhibit Lennard–Jones attraction with each other to capture the PS–PS aggregation in experimental conditions. All other interactions were purely repulsive and modelled using the Weeks–Chandler–Andersen repulsive potential. For detailed description, see Supplementary Note 8.

Polymer patch patterns and sizes were theoretically predicted using MC grafting simulation involving two steps: (1) determining the surface distribution of iodide-masked region and (2) placing polymer chains onto the unmasked (‘free') surface sites, while accounting for chain–chain interactions. We began by constructing a grid of points on the core NP surface, defining potential sites for iodide or polymer attachment. Using the Metropolis algorithm with surface energies computed from DFT, iodide-masked points were placed on the various surface sites (Supplementary Note 5). Placing iodide-masked points on the particle surface uses the Metropolis algorithm, guided by surface energies computed from DFT. Iodide-masked points cannot accommodate polymer grafting, leaving the remaining open locations as the only ‘free' sites for polymer grafting. After an occupancy matrix logs iodide-masked positions, the first polymer chain grafts on the surface based on its Boltzmann-weighted free energy as a function of surface locations. The matrix updates with this chain attachment and ‘free' surface sites within a correlation length ξ of any polymer-occupied sites gain a favourable chain–chain interaction, governed by the Flory–Huggins parameter χ (Supplementary Note 6). This entire process repeats for each polymer chain until the target grafting density is achieved. See Supplementary Note 7 for details.

MC simulations were performed to obtain the self-assemblies of patchy NPs, using the HOOMD-blue simulation engine65. We first defined a patchy particle whose patch locations and sizes are commensurate with those measured from the above MD simulation and validated with theory and experiments. Patches were modelled to exhibit hard sphere interactions with each other to capture the strong PAA–PAA electrostatic repulsions between the outer surface of the patches (Supplementary Fig. 49). The core NP interactions were modelled using a Kern–Frenkel attraction between the various surface sites that were not covered by polymeric patches. See Supplementary Note 9 for details.

Images from DFT calculations of co-adsorbed 2-NAT and iodide on Au(111), Au(100) and Au(110) at various surface coverages (units: ML). Coloured spheres represent atoms: gold (grey), iodine (purple), physisorbed sulfur (yellow), chemisorbed sulfur (orange), carbon (black) and hydrogen (white). The configuration for 1/3 ML–1/2 ML 2-NAT–iodide coverage is shown in Fig. 2a.

The particle shown in Fig. 2d is used here to illustrate the workflow. b–e, Low-magnification bright-field image (b), HAADF-STEM image (c), Au EDX map (d) and I EDX map (e) with corresponding stacked line profiles, from which atomic ratios of Au and I are obtained. The reduced shape uniformity of gold NPs in this sample is presumably because of the extensive surfactant removal (Methods) required for high-sensitivity STEM-EDX detection of submonolayer iodide, which may destabilize unprotected gold surfaces. For EDX line profile analysis, we focus on intact octahedra oriented in the [110] projection (examples highlighted with dotted circles in d and e). Stacked line profiles are obtained along the contour of the projected octahedra as illustrated in the line profile step in a. A total of 400 line profiles are stacked in d and e. Scale bars, 50 nm (a); 200 nm (b–e).

a, XPS of gold octahedra incubated with [I−] of 13.3 µM. b,c, XPS (b) and Raman spectra (c) of gold octahedra incubated with varied [I−]. As [I−] increases from 0 to 13.3 µM, more iodides are adsorbed on the gold NP surfaces, resulting in higher I peak intensities in XPS characterizations presented in b. As iodide adsorption on the gold NP surface increases with [I−] increase from 0.42 to 16.4 µM, less 2-NAT is bound to the NP surface at a fixed [2-NAT] of 46.0 µM, resulting in decreased 2-NAT peak intensities in Raman spectra presented in c.

Predicting complex disease risks on the basis of individual genomic profiles is an advancing field in human genetics1,2. However, most genetic studies have focused on populations of European ancestry, creating a global imbalance in precision medicine and underscoring the need for genomic research in non-European groups3,4. The Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative recruited more than half a million Taiwanese residents, providing a large dataset of genetic profiles and electronic medical record data for people with Han Chinese ancestry. Using extensive phenotypic data, we conducted comprehensive genomic analyses across the medical phenome with individuals genetically similar to Han Chinese reference populations. These analyses identified population-specific genetic risk variants and new findings for various complex traits. We developed polygenic risk scores, demonstrating strong predictive performance for conditions such as cardiometabolic diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancers and infectious diseases. We observed consistent findings in an independent dataset, Taiwan Biobank, and among people of East Asian ancestry in the UK Biobank and the All of Us Project. The identified genetic risks accounted for up to 10.3% of the overall health variation in the Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative cohort. Our approach of characterizing the phenome-wide genomic landscape, developing population-specific risk-prediction models, assessing their performance and identifying the genetic effect on health serves as a model for similar studies in other diverse study populations.

A principal promise of modern genetics is the ability to predict complex disease risk on the basis of a person's genetic profile. If successful, health management strategies can be developed to mitigate risk (disease prevention) and to optimize care (early diagnosis and effective treatment). Large-scale studies by the UK Biobank (UKB) and the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network show that risk prediction on the basis of genetics holds promise, and several countries are exploring ways to implement risk-based management in clinical practice1,2. Using polygenic risk scores (PRS) to predict disease risk and identify individuals at high risk is an emerging ‘precision medicine' approach to leverage genetic findings in clinical practice. However, a substantial limitation is that current PRS models are predominantly based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with participants of European ancestry (EUR)4,5, often leading to reduced predictive performance in groups of other ancestry6,7. To fully realize the potential of precision medicine for diverse global populations, population-specific phenome-wide genomic discovery must be performed at scale and clinically applicable polygenic risk models must be optimized in and across populations. To fill this research gap in a population of East Asian ancestry (EAS), we characterized the complex genetic architecture of the population of Han Chinese ancestry phenome wide, developed population-specific PRS and assessed the external validity of the models across populations with varying degrees of genetic similarity.

Populations of EAS represent nearly a quarter of the global population, but they account for only 3.95% of the participants in previous GWAS3. Although several biobanks have been built to recruit subjects from East Asia, they have moderate sample size (72,000–212,000), and many focus on specific conditions8,9,10,11,12. By contrast, biobanks with predominantly EUR participants13,14,15,16 have significantly larger sample sizes (224,000–635,000) and access to more comprehensive clinical data. The moderate sample size and limited phenotypes in existing EAS biobanks hamper discovery of unique genetic effects and preclude the development of robust and clinically useful PRS models for EAS.

We assembled a large non-EUR cohort, the Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative (TPMI), and genotyped more than half a million participants across 16 medical centres in Taiwan from 2019 to 2023. All the participants, who are overwhelmingly of Han Chinese ancestry, contributed DNA samples for genetic profiling with a custom-designed genotyping array and consented to provide their longitudinal electronic medical records (EMRs) from 5 years before enrolment and into the future. The EMR dataset includes rich and accurate health-related phenotypes, including medical diagnoses and biochemical examinations17. Here we present the results of comprehensive genomic analyses with extensive genetic and medical data derived from the TPMI cohort, including phenome-wide GWAS and PRS model development. We identified numerous population-specific risk variants/genes, observed evidence of genetic pleiotropy and pinpointed clusters of traits that shared similar genetic aetiology. Then, we developed and validated PRS prediction models for numerous conditions against external datasets including those from the Taiwan Biobank (TWB), the UKB and the All of Us Project. Our results show the benefits of leveraging a large cohort from an understudied population to identify unique genetic underpinnings of the human phenome, interpret causal effects by means of fine mapping and colocalization and improve the performance of population-specific PRS models, which together better illuminate the clinical implications of genetic risk.

We performed comprehensive genomic analyses, including GWAS, heritability estimation and PRS model building and evaluation, across a wide range of diseases and quantitative traits using 463,447 individuals genetically similar to Han Chinese reference populations from TPMI. We examined 695 dichotomized phenotypes (phecodes; case n > 2,000) and 24 quantitative traits (sample size > 100,000), spanning numerous disease categories (defined by phecode groupings18,19), such as neoplasms, metabolic disorders, circulatory conditions, autoimmune diseases and more (Fig. 1). The phecodes, derived from International Classification of Diseases codes18,19, alongside quantitative traits such as blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), liver enzymes and lipid levels, provide a robust dataset for exploring genetic contributions to human health (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The log-transformed case proportion identified from EMRs showed a moderate but significant correlation with the log-transformed 5-year disease prevalence from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan20 (r = 0.656, P = 2.69 × 10−84) (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1), indicating that the TPMI's hospital-based design may not fully capture mild and common illnesses, which are primarily observed in local and primary care clinics. Figure 1b displays the sample sizes for 24 quantitative traits in the TPMI and highlights sample size variation across traits, a key measure affecting the power and precision of association analyses in the cohort.

Each bar represents a trait, with the x axis indicating the different category of quantitative traits and the y axis representing the corresponding sample sizes. Definitions for abbreviations in panel b can be found in Supplementary Table 2.

Our GWAS identified at least one significant locus (P < 5 × 10−8) for 265 phecodes of the 695 tested and all 24 quantitative traits. Highlighting the robustness of the TPMI data, we observed a high replication rate of reported disease loci from EAS GWAS on the GWAS catalogue (actual/expected ratio (AER) = 78.17%, considering the statistical power with the published tool, PGRM21), particularly for endocrine and metabolic/hematopoietic diseases (AER = 88.68% and 84.62%, respectively; Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 3). Lower replication rates for respiratory disease (AER = 23.53%) may reflect limited case numbers; untyped genetic variants, such as rare variants, copy number variation and structural variants; or recruitment bias such as age distribution.

We applied the sum-of-single-effects model for fine mapping to identify the independent variant–trait associations and reported the genetic variant with highest posterior inclusion probability of identified credible sets as well as the single lead variant for the failed fine-mapping regions and major histocompatibility complex region (MHC region; chromosome 6: 25,391,792–33,424,245). Our analyses showed a total of 2,656 fine-mapping-identified independent association signals, including 1,309 from phecodes GWAS and 1,347 from quantitative traits. Notably, 95 new associations, defined as having no previously reported results within 1 Mb in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalogue21 of relevant GWAS, were identified across 50 phecodes and seven quantitative traits. In addition, we identified 217 new hits from previously reported regions, defined as having low linkage disequilibrium (r2 < 0.1) with any variant observed in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalogue within 1 Mb for the same phenotype (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). After applying the multiple testing correction, 1,502 fine-mapped associations passed a Bonferroni-adjusted threshold (5 × 10−8/(695 + 24) = 6.95 × 10−11), as well as 21 previously unreported variants and 115 new hits.

Of the 95 new genetic associations, 30 variants are rare (minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.05) in populations with other ancestry (African or African American (AFR), Admixed American (AMR), South Asian (SAS) and non-Finnish European) in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)) and 33 variants less than 0.01 in EUR, the most extensively studied population, which explains why they were not reported in previous GWAS. For example, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs17089782, a missense variant in PIBF1 (p.R405Q) on chromosome 13 is significantly associated with thyroid cancer (P = 2.8 × 10−9) in the TPMI cohort. This SNP has a MAF of 5.65% in TPMI but 0.01% in EUR, which may explain why this association was only detectable in TPMI. However, PIBF1 is essential for immune regulation, especially during pregnancy, and is relevant to autoimmune diseases and cancer22. Another variant identified in our analysis of BMI (rs761018157; P = 4.8 × 10−9, MAF in TPMI = 4.34%, MAF in EUR < 0.01%) maps to PHOX2B. This gene, highly expressed in the nervous system, had previously been linked to obesity hypoventilation syndrome in a small study (n = 30)23 and associated with bone mineral density24. In addition, when we compare the effect size in TPMI and UKB for the rest of the new findings, 25 exhibit a significant different effect size (P < 0.05). For instance, a TPMI-identified platelet-count-associated variant, rs12955741, located in the intergenic region between TGIF1 and DLGAP1, exhibits a different effect size (β) compared to that in UKB (βTPMI = 0.044, βUKB = −0.005, P = 1.7 × 10−9). Moreover, the high hepatitis B virus carrier rate in Taiwan25 contrasts sharply with its rarity in European cohorts, enabling TPMI to identify new loci associated with viral hepatitis B (case number in TPMI = 23,618 versus UKB = 132). Among the 26 independent loci identified in our analysis of hepatitis B, 19 fine-mapped loci are new (Extended Data Fig. 3). Notably, 18 of these 19 loci were found to be associated with liver function or diseases (Supplementary Table 5). These new associations highlight the uniqueness of certain disease loci in the TPMI cohort, presenting opportunities for developing population-specific therapeutic interventions and advancing precision medicine.

All identified independent associations are summarized in Fig. 2. The identification of the MHC region as a significant hotspot on chromosome 6 emphasizes its extensive involvement in immune-related diseases across several categories. Similarly, the short arm of chromosome 11 (INS-KCNQ1 region) also affect various traits, including metabolic, endocrine and genitourinary diseases. These hotspots of trait-relevant variants implied the shared genetic mechanism among diseases and potential of pleiotropic effects.

Vertical bars show the accumulated number of independent variant–trait associations for dichotomized phecodes (top) and quantitative traits (bottom). Each category of diseases and traits is represented by a corresponding colour. The x axis is chromosome number and the y axis represents the accumulated number of associations, highlighting the uneven distribution of trait-associated variants across phenotypes.

Linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis (LDSC)26 showed strong liability-scaled SNP heritability (h2) for conditions such as alcoholism (h2 = 0.213), retention of urine (h2 = 0.163) and open-angle glaucoma (h2 = 0.160). Among quantitative traits, body height (h2 = 0.323), BMI (h2 = 0.218) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (h2 = 0.191) exhibited the highest heritability estimates (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Information), highlighting the significant role of genetics in these traits. These results have far-reaching implications for precision medicine, as higher heritability signals indicate the potential for more accurate genetic risk-prediction models that could improve personalized disease risk assessments.

We then partitioned heritability at the gene level and identified 329 unique genes contributing significantly to phenotypic variation (h2 > 0.1% and Z-score > 1.64). Of these, 45 affected more than one phecode and/or quantitative category, including key genes such as APOE, APOC1, TOMM40, ABCG2 and KCNQ1 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 7). We also conducted a colocalization analysis to elucidate the potential molecular function of identified GWAS signals with three expression quantitative traits locus (eQTL) datasets, including the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx)27, Multi-ancestry Analysis of Gene Expression (MAGE)28 and the Japan COVID-19 Task Force (JCTF)29 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 8). Our results identified 391 unique genes that potentially mediate the outcome through their expression level (posterior probability > 0.9), including GBAP1, which colocalized with five different traits (uric acid, serum creatinine, hematocrit, hypertension and gout). Among the colocalized genes, 75 of them can be identified only in the multi-ancestry lymphoblastoid cell lines eQTL (MAGE; 20 genes) and/or Japanese whole blood eQTL (JCTF; 59 genes). Our findings demonstrate the effect of these genes (such as APOE, ABCG2 and KCNQ1) on several traits and disorders. By elucidating shared genetic effects, these results offer opportunities to develop precision medicine approaches that address comorbidities, such as treating hyperlipidaemia and reducing dementia risk through a single intervention targeting APOE, which influences both lipid metabolism and Alzheimer's disease risk. This gene-level understanding emphasizes the potential to optimize therapeutic strategies by leveraging genetic pleiotropy in disease management.

Inner circle indicates the number of associated traits for each identified gene. Outer circle indicates chromosome number. The bar chart shows the number of identified genes by category and grouped by type of pleiotropy. We estimated h2 with h2gene57 and performed the colocalization analysis with coloc58.

Pairwise genetic correlation and clustering analyses showed three main phenotype clusters: cardiometabolic traits, autoimmune and infectious diseases, and kidney-related traits (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 4). The cardiometabolic cluster, which includes type 2 diabetes, hypertension and BMI, reinforces the interconnected phenotypic and genetic architectures of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The cluster of autoimmune and infectious diseases, which includes viral hepatitis B, psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus, illuminates shared immune system pathways and potential gene–pathogen interaction. The kidney-related cluster involved gout, chronic kidney disease, calculus of kidney and ureter, ankylosing spondylitis and measures of urea nitrogen, creatinine and uric acid. The shared genetic architecture provides opportunities to leverage the genetic risk of correlated traits while developing the PRS model.

Cross-population comparisons30 with EUR GWAS from UKB showed varying degrees of transethnic genetic-effect correlation (ρge), with strong, statistically significant correlations for traits like cholelithiasis (ρge > 0.999), type 2 diabetes (ρge = 0.829) and ischaemic heart disease (ρge = 0.756), but moderate correlations for gout (ρge = 0.616) and psoriasis (ρge = 0.418) (Supplementary Table 6). The moderate correlations indicate the differentiated genetic mechanism and disease distribution across populations (gout case n = 24,411 in TPMI and 3,179 in UKB; psoriasis case n = 4,166 in TPMI and 2,197 in UKB). Therefore, these findings demonstrate the importance of population-specific genetic studies, as differences in genetic architectures between populations can significantly affect the accuracy of PRS models.

Building on these insights, we developed and validated PRS models that demonstrated strong predictive performance for a wide range of diseases. Although we used five PRS tools, including LDpred231, Lassosum232, PRS-CS33, SBayesR34 and MegaPRS35 (Supplementary Tables 9–13), we found that LDpred2 outperformed the others for most traits (Extended Data Fig. 5). Therefore, we took the results of LDpred2 for further comparisons. Of the 265 PRS models for phecodes, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values exceeded 0.55 for 105 dichotomized phecodes with a significant P value (P < 0.05). Additionally, the explained variance of models for 24 quantitative traits ranged from 0.028 (aspartate aminotransferase) to 0.227 (height). (Supplementary Table 9 and Extended Data Fig. 6). The most predictive PRS models included highly heritable traits such as ankylosing spondylitis (AUC = 0.812 ± 0.016), psoriasis (0.709 ± 0.016), atrial fibrillation (0.702 ± 0.014), prostate cancer (0.696 ± 0.018), systemic lupus erythematosus (0.696 ± 0.015), rheumatoid arthritis (0.646 ± 0.011), type 2 diabetes (0.640 ± 0.005), female breast cancer (0.611 ± 0.010) and hypertension (0.610 ± 0.004). Interestingly, the PRS for hepatitis B also demonstrated high genetic predictability (0.654 ± 0.008). Because h² represents the upper bound of variance that can be explained by PRS, we examined the proportion of heritability captured by our models (r2/h2). A total of 36 traits, including prostate cancer (r2/h2 = 0.054/0.070), type 2 diabetes (0.066/0.126) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.136/0.191), reached more than 50% of their SNP heritability, indicating that PRS can achieve near-optimal predictive accuracy for highly heritable traits. However, for complex diseases influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, PRS performance is inherently constrained by the fraction of heritability attributable to common variants. These findings reinforce the importance of SNP heritability as a reference point for evaluating PRS utility and highlight the need for larger, ancestrally diverse datasets to further enhance genetic prediction models (Extended Data Fig. 6).

Leveraging the identified clusters, we performed a multitrait PRS training, PRSmix+36, for the traits in each cluster (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 14). Notably, multitrait PRS models improved prediction accuracy for the cardiometabolic disease cluster with a 0.040 increase in AUC (from 0.608 to 0.648) and a 1.770-fold improvement in phenotypic variance explained (r2). The performances of autoimmune and kidney-related disease clusters were also enhanced, with average AUC improvements of 0.018 and 0.009, respectively (from 0.641 to 0.659 and 0.601 to 0.610, respectively) and 1.351-fold and 1.349-fold improvements in r². The significant enhancement of multitrait PRS prediction (comparing r2 of LDpred2 and PRSmix+ with a paired t-test, P = 1.07 × 10−13) highlights the potential of leveraging shared genetic architecture to enhance disease risk prediction. Figure 5 demonstrates the performance of single-trait and multitrait PRS across three disease clusters, as well as the differing effectiveness of PRS in predicting genetic risk across various disease categories.

Grey bars indicate SNP heritability (estimated from TPMI GWAS unrelated set (n = 248,754) with LDSC) and the coloured bars represent the r2 values, indicating the proportion of variance explained by the PRS among TPMI validation set (n = 20,000) from single-trait PRS (LDpred2, red bar) or multitrait PRS (PRSmix+, blue bar). The dot-and-whisker plots showcase predictive accuracy using AUC with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomized traits. Asterisks indicate h2 estimates that consider the MHC region.

To evaluate the robustness and generalizability of our PRS models, we performed an external validation of the models (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, viral hepatitis B, gout, calculus of kidney from PRSmix+ and others from LDpred2) in TWB, unrelated individuals genetically similar to Han Chinese reference populations, n = 88,628), UKB (self-reported EAS, n = 9,893) and All of Us (genetically inferred EAS, n = 6,895). We found that the prediction accuracy, AUC, of our models ranged from 0.548 (glaucoma) to 0.712 (prostate cancer) in TWB, 0.557 (female breast cancer) to 0.634 (hypertension) in UKB and 0.520 (migraine) to 0.709 (gout) in All of Us (Extended Data Fig. 7). Although the TWB questionnaire did not contain specific details on hepatitis B status, we used antihepatitis B core total antibodies (Anti-HBc) as an indicator of infection or past infection and hepatitis B surface-antigen (HBsAg) as a marker of acute/chronic infection. Intriguingly, the AUCs for the TPMI-derived model of hepatitis B were 0.674 ± 0.003 for HBsAg and 0.530 ± 0.002 for Anti-HBc in TWB. These results demonstrate the high predictive value of the PRS for hepatitis B for predicting symptoms and severity of the disease.

TPMI-derived PRS models perform better than the UKB EUR-derived models when applied to EAS for viral hepatitis B, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, gout and migraine. (Extended Data Fig. 7) For the other traits, TPMI-derived models consistently outperform the UKB ones, although the confidence intervals overlap. However, the overlapping confidence intervals in UKB and All of Us may be due to their limited sample size of EAS. These results indicate that population-specific PRS models allow for more accurate risk stratification and enable personalized healthcare interventions for EAS. Additionally, we assessed the performance of TPMI-derived PRS and TPMI-included cross-population PRS across various ancestry groups, including populations of EUR, AFR, AMR and SAS ancestry from the UKB and All of Us cohorts (Extended Data Fig. 8). Performance varied by diseases, but consistent results were observed for female breast cancer and glaucoma across populations, and TPMI-included cross-population PRS slightly but not significantly improved in the populations other than EAS and EUR.

Although overall health is hard to define with a few metrics, herein, we used the count of clinical visits and duration of hospitalization to roughly describe individuals' overall health. We found that 131 of the top-performing PRS models (LDpred2 models with AUC > 0.55 and all PRSmix+ models for phecodes and all models for quantitative traits) are significantly associated with overall health indices, explaining 8.47% of the variation in clinical visit frequency (P = 2.69 × 10−14) and 10.29% of the variation in hospitalization duration (P = 5.62 × 10−27; Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Table 15) in the comparison between top and bottom 5% groups after adjusting for sex, age and recruiting hospital. Among the identified clusters, the cardiometabolic disease cluster contributed the most to the indices, accounting for 1.32% of clinical visits (P = 0.02) and 3.55% of hospitalizations (P = 7.10 × 10−9). This may reflect the high prevalence of cardiometabolic diseases in the hospital-based TPMI cohort. In short, quantification of the effect of PRS for various diseases and traits on human health opens up opportunities for developing precision health management strategies.

This study represents a large-scale GWAS in the population of Han Chinese ancestry, using data of around 500,000 individuals recruited from 16 medical centres across Taiwan. We investigated the genetic architecture of 695 dichotomized phecodes and 24 quantitative traits, identifying 2,656 independent variant–trait associations and showed that population-specific genetic risk-prediction PRS models for a wide range of diseases performed well in the population. Indeed, for the traits with sufficient sample size in the cohort, PRS performance rivals those developed for EUR using UKB data. These findings show that population-specific PRS models can be developed successfully for populations of non-EUR, and our project serves as a model for large-scale genetic studies in other populations.

Recent large-scale projects that emphasize ancestral diversity in human genetic studies have discovered new findings with the inclusion of subjects of non-EUR. MVP conducted multi-ancestry GWAS on 635,000 participants, identifying more than 2,000 signals unique to populations with non-EUR16. With the TPMI dataset, we performed larger GWAS in subjects genetically similar to Han Chinese reference populations for several traits than published studies. For instance, the previous largest meta-analysis for type 2 diabetes included 20,573 cases who were of Han Chinese ancestry37. By contrast, our GWAS included 59,289 cases of type 2 diabetes, almost tripling the number of cases ever tested and identified five unreported type 2 diabetes associated loci from known regions, demonstrating the power of TPMI sample size. Identification of new and population-specific risk variants may lead to further understanding of their molecular mechanism and underline the need for population-specific weightings in PRS models. Moreover, population-specific findings also better explain the performance of population-specific PRS models in the population in question. In short, our population-specific genomic profiles for comprehensive phenotypes provide a solid foundation for PRS development.

Our understanding of how the genetic factors influencing hepatitis B, an endemic infectious disease in Taiwan with an estimated hepatitis B virus carrier rate of 9.78% among the unvaccinated cohort (born before 1984)25, also benefited from the large dataset. With 23,618 cases, a significant increase from previous studies of only a few thousand cases38,39,40, we identified 26 fine-mapped signals, including 19 new loci, and showed a significant negative correlation between hepatitis B and other autoimmune diseases, such as Sicca syndrome, psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Our well-performed and validated PRS model for hepatitis B demonstrated that the host genome may determine the severity and symptoms of this infectious disease. This is similar to that previously reported in COVID-19 and pneumonia, where genetic factors have been shown to influence disease outcomes41,42,43,44. Our unexpected success of GWAS and PRS for hepatitis B not only demonstrates the power of the large sample size of TPMI but also shows the necessity of population-specific genetic study for population-enriched diseases. The benefits extend beyond differences in ancestry to include environmental factors such as pathogen exposure, food intake and lifestyle influences. Exploring how the human genome interacts with these diverse external and environmental factors can greatly enhance our understanding of how genetic variants contribute to disease susceptibility or severity.

In addition, the comprehensive phenotypic data allow us to investigate the genetic correlation among several traits that have substantial implications for clinical applications and leverage them to improve the performance of PRS models. By identifying shared genetic risks across diseases, at-risk individuals can be alerted to pursue early detection of comorbidities and targeted prevention strategies. For example, the clustering of cardiometabolic traits, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension and BMI, highlights their interconnected genetic basis and indicates that individuals with a high genetic risk for one condition may benefit from early screening and intervention for related conditions45. Additionally, the shared genetic architecture allows the development of multitrait PRS models that integrate genetic risks across correlated traits, improving prediction accuracy and enabling precision medicine approaches that address several health outcomes simultaneously46. Including the correlated traits in PRS model development improved performance, resulting in an average 1.55-fold increase in the explained percentage of phenotypic variation (P = 1.07 × 10−13). Although previous studies have proven the utility of multitraits on target diseases36,47,48, we have extended the use this approach on a phenome-wide level and demonstrated the improvement across different types of traits. As a result, we produced well-performed PRS for various categories of diseases, including cardiometabolic diseases, autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases.

We evaluated our PRS models across several large cohorts, including the TWB, UKB and All of Us. The TPMI-derived PRS models consistently outperformed those developed from EUR when applied to diseases in people with Han Chinese or EAS ancestry from the three large cohorts. When comparing with EUR-derived PRS models, we also observed better performance across several traits in EAS, particularly for cardiometabolic and autoimmune diseases. Similarly, the TPMI-included cross-population model slightly improves performance in populations of other ancestries. These results highlight the need for population-specific models and emphasize the importance of genetic data from diverse populations to advance cross-population models. By integrating these well-developed PRS models, we estimate that genetics account for 10.3% of variation of hospitalization duration in TPMI. Although the estimates of genetic contributions to health measure may be influenced by disease prevalences and ascertainment biases, our result indicate integrating genetic risk-based health management strategies with traditional risk factors, such as age, sex, smoking and BMI, may enhance prediction models and refine personalized risk stratification.

As with other large-scale epidemiological studies, ascertainment bias is also observed in our study. TPMI's case proportion shows a significant but moderate correlation with the prevalence from NHIRD, implying potential ascertainment bias of TPMI's hospital-based design. Compared to the general population in Taiwan (NHIRD), TPMI participants are overrepresented in the middle-aged group (year of birth 1940–1970, 54.3% versus 38.3%), include slightly more females (55.1% versus 50.6%) and have a higher proportion of participants from northern Taiwan (59.5% versus 47.3%). These demographic differences, along with the volunteer-based recruitment process, probably contribute to the lower case proportions observed in TPMI (Fig. 1a). Importantly, a significant portion of disease records in the NHIRD originate from local clinics and primary care settings, which are not covered in TPMI. Notably, the EMRs of the participants are incomplete, as some participants receive care from several health providers, but the TPMI only has access to EMRs from their enrolment hospitals. We acknowledge that ascertainment biases may influence disease prevalence and heritability estimates. Thus, we accounted for case-control ascertainment by applying liability-scale transformations using population prevalence data from NHIRD and used independent validation for PRS (TWB, UKB and All of Us) to mitigate the effect of ascertainment biases, while acknowledging that residual biases may persist. Methods like inverse probability weighting could mitigate such biases49, but these require detailed external reference data that are unavailable at present. Additionally, we observed a relatively low estimated heritability for body height and BMI in TPMI, compared to values reported in the literature50,51. These estimates may be affected by factors such as inconsistencies in assessment across EMRs, variations in statistical approaches and reduced bias of assortative mating in TPMI population52,53,54. These limitations also emphasize the need for future adjustments to enhance generalizability.

In addition to ascertainment bias, our study has other commonly found limitations. First, the TPMI cohort size is not sufficiently large to study some of the severe subtypes of many diseases, such as diabetes insipidus and neurofibromatosis. Second, we attempted to use eQTLs to elucidate the molecular mechanism of diseases, but the underrepresentation of EAS in current eQTL datasets, such as GTEx, poses challenges27. Gene expression regulation varies across ancestries55,56, and differences in LD structures further complicate colocalization analyses. Comparing to GTEx whole blood eQTL, the multi-ancestry lymphoblastoid eQTL and Japanese whole blood eQTL showed 309 more gene–trait pairs. Therefore, ancestral diversity is an urgent need not only in genomic data but also in transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and epigenomic datasets. Third, the current project retrieved EMRs from an average of 5 years before enrolment, so some important data such as age of disease onset for the older participants are not available. Incomplete EMRs lead to less precise case definition of some participants. Fourth, some of the younger participants have high-risk genetic profiles but are disease free for those diseases. The duration of the project is too short to determine whether they will eventually develop those diseases.

An effort is underway to gain access to the complete EMRs of the TPMI participants and to recruit more participants with severe subtypes of common diseases. The high-risk participants who are symptom-free are being followed to monitor disease development. Future studies are being planned to study the high-risk individuals who escape disease development to identify genetic and non-genetic factors that mitigate their disease risk. Furthermore, the meta-analysis integrating TPMI with other large-scale EAS biobanks, such as TWB11,12, Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study9, China Kadoorie Biobank10 and Biobank Japan8, may further enhance our understanding of the genetic aetiology in EAS and improve prediction models.

This study demonstrates that population-specific risk-prediction models, such as those developed for EAS in this work, can achieve strong predictive performance for traits with high relevance in that population. The PRS we developed for EAS performed well for several traits, including diseases with significant public health implications, such as type 2 diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus. However, for certain traits, such as female breast cancer and glaucoma, PRS derived from both UKB and TPMI performed comparably, indicating that the genetic architecture of some traits allows for generalizable models. These findings emphasize the importance of developing and validating PRS models in diverse global populations to maximize their utility and equity in genetic risk prediction. Although our results emphasize the utility of developing population-specific PRS, further research is needed to directly compare their performance with multipopulation models and assess their generalizability and to assess their effect on disease prevention and management. In particular, longitudinal studies and real-world implementations will be critical to determine the extent to which PRS-guided interventions can delay disease onset or improve health outcomes. Furthermore, it is hoped that if all can obtain their genetic profiles and determine their risk for major diseases, many diseases can be prevented or their onset can be delayed significantly, thereby fulfilling the promise of modern genetics.

In conclusion, we used a large-scale dataset of individuals genetically similar to Han Chinese reference populations produced by the TPMI to conduct phenome-wide genetic analyses and leverage these genetic findings to train risk-prediction models for several diseases and traits. The developed models are validated in EAS of different biobanks and demonstrate a consistent performance that bodes well for their use in populations of Han Chinese and EAS ancestry. Our approach can serve as a template for developing PRS models in populations that are currently without such resources, anticipating the time when all populations around the world can benefit from risk-based health management as part of the precision health movement.

We used the TPMI dataset, which links extensive EMRs with genotypic data for 486,956 individuals. Dichotomized disease status was defined by phecodes, which were based on information extracted from the EMR using International Classification of Diseases codes18,19. To ensure robustness, cases were defined by having the diagnosis of the relevant condition on two or more clinical visits. We also extracted quantitative traits from the EMR, including anthropometric, vital sign and laboratory measurements; we excluded the extreme outliers and removed or adjusted the treated and/or medicated measures on the basis of previous research; and the median value was kept if the participant had several qualified measures59 (Supplementary Information). In this study, we focused on 695 phecodes that had at least 2,000 cases and 24 quantitative traits that were measured in at least 100,000 individuals. These phecodes spanned 16 disease categories, including but not limited to infectious diseases, neoplasms, endocrine/metabolic disorders and circulatory system diseases. The 24 quantitative traits were categorized into anthropometric, circulatory, hematological, kidney-related, liver-related and metabolic measurements.

We performed genotyping using two customized high-density Axiom SNP arrays produced by Thermo Fisher, TPMv1 and TPMv2. The genotyping experiments were conducted in six genotyping centres in Taiwan17. The raw genotypic data underwent quality control measures, and the genetic variants were excluded when they had a call rate less than 0.98, MAF < 0.01, or Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test P < 1 × 10−6. We also excluded individuals with overall call rate less than 0.95, failed heterozygosity check, or inconsistent documented versus genetically determined sex. For this study, we only included the genetic variants found on both genotyping arrays and excluded variants with a significant batch effect in GWAS. The proportion of genetic ancestry was determined by ADMIXTURE60, and the projected principal component scores with 1000 Genomes as a reference panel were applied to determine individuals' ancestry61. As a result, 401,710 genetic variants and 463,447 Han Chinese participants passed all quality control measures and were used in the subsequent studies. Details are found in Supplementary Information and on GitHub (https://github.com/TPMI-Taiwan/tpmi-qc).

Phasing was conducted on quality-control-passed genotype data with SHAPEIT562. Genome imputation was carried out with IMPUTE5 using a reference panel of 1,498 whole-genome-sequenced TWB subjects12,63. We also conducted postimputation quality control with exclusion criteria INFO score ≤ 0.7 and MAF ≤ 0.01. In addition, we also performed a chip-GWAS for minimizing the bias from different chips, resulting in a dataset of 8,046,864 well-imputed common genetic variants.

We performed a principal component analysis (PCA) on the basis of genotyped variants to capture the effect of population structure. To diminish the effect of close relatives, the main PCA was conducted in a genetically unrelated subset, and other subjects were projected with the calculated PC weightings. Then these PCA scores were leveraged to accurately quantify the proportion of identity by descent and degree of relatedness. The maximum unrelated set was determined on the basis of these estimated degrees of relatedness. PC-AiR and PC-Relate were used for PCA and relatedness estimation, and PRIMUS was used for identifying the maximum unrelated set with the third degree as threshold64,65,66.

The entire dataset was divided into three subgroups: the GWAS set (n = 363,447), the training set (n = 80,000) and the testing set (n = 20,000). To maximize the statistical power, we used a mixed-effect regression model to examine the association between genotype and outcome of interest, logistic regression for dichotomized phecode and linear regression for quantitative traits. The quantile-normalization was applied to quantitative traits to ensure the normal distribution. The mixed-effect model accounted for relatedness among individuals by including a random effect for pairwise kinship. The model was also adjusted for key covariates, including age, sex, age2, interactions between age/age2 and sex, genotyping chip, enrolment hospital and ten genetic principal components to control for population stratification. SAIGE was applied for the mixed-effect model GWAS67. In the GWAS set, we selected an unrelated subset (n = 248,754) to perform GWAS using a generalized linear model with PLINK2, and we conducted 1:10 age, sex-matching for the traits with imbalanced case/control ratio (less than 1/20). These PLINK2 GWAS statistics were then used for heritability and genetic correlation estimation68.

To systematically evaluate the performance of our GWAS, we leveraged a presummarized phenotype–genotype reference map69, which collected 5,879 genetic associations for 149 unique phecodes from 523 published GWAS, including 1,215 associations from EAS. We calculate the overall and power-adjusted replication rates and actual over expected ratio for each available phecode and categories, respectively. The R package PGRM was used to measure the quality of biobank data through replication69.

We performed fine mapping to identify the independent GWAS signals in all genomic regions containing any variant with a P value less than 5 × 10−8 and plus or minus 1.5 Mb of the regional lead variant14, except the MHC region (chromosome 6: 25,391,792–33,424,245) because of its complex linkage disequilibrium structure. We used the reported 95% credible set to determine the independent signals, and up to ten signals were allowed for each region. The genome-wide significant threshold was applied for defining a credible set as an independent hit, and a further requirement of log Bayes factor > 2 was applied for the second hit. For the failed fine-mapping regions and MHC region, we used the lead SNP as the hit of each significant region. SuSiE was conducted for this summary statistics-based fine mapping with linkage disequilibrium derived from our imputation reference panel70, which reflects our study population's genetic architecture. Although using linkage disequilibrium from the GWAS sample might improve accuracy, we used the imputation panel because of the computation efficiency.

We comprehensively compared our GWAS results with reported significant signals on the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalogue21, downloaded on 11 March 2024. The mapping of phecodes and quantitative traits to GWAS catalogue phenotypes is summarized in Supplementary Table 16. We classified a variant as new if the fine-mapped independent signal was not located within 1 Mb of any reported genome-wide significant association (P < 5 × 10−8) for the corresponding phenotype. Additionally, a variant was considered a new hit if the highest linkage disequilibrium r² was less than 0.1, with any reported significant association within 1 Mb. Associations derived from uncertain and umbrella phecodes were excluded, and for duplicated genetic variants or regions, we only reported the association with the smaller P value or from the phecode with the more specific definition. Finally, we used ANNOVAR to annotate the new variants with data from the RefSeqGene database (updated 17 August 2020)71,72. For the new variants, we explored their allele frequencies in non-Finnish European, AFR, SAS and AMR from gnomAD73. We also compared the effect size between TPMI and UKB with a t-test for investigating the ancestry-specific effect.

To quantify the genomic contribution of the specific traits, we applied linkage disequilibrium score regression to estimate the SNP-based heritability with LDSC26. The GWAS summary statistics and the precalculated linkage disequilibrium score from the EAS superpopulation of 1000 Genomes were used61. For the dichotomized traits, we performed a liability-scaled transformation on the observed heritability using the 5-year population prevalence from the NHIRD of the Health and Welfare Data Science Center20,74. For traits with a higher prevalence in our dataset (TPMI) than the population (NHIRD), we applied the equation from ref. 75. For other traits, we used the adapted equation from ref. 74. Additionally, we conducted LDSC to obtain pairwise genetic correlations to assess the similarity of genetic mechanisms between traits76. On the basis of the genetic correlation matrix, we used a hierarchical cluster analysis to identify groups of traits that share genetic mechanisms. We used the weighted pair group method with arithmetic mean for clustering, and the resulting cluster tree was used for group identification. Moreover, we estimate the genetic correlation across populations, TPMI and UKB, to demonstrate varied genetic architecture in different ancestry populations. For the UKB GWAS, we applied a generalized linear model from PLINK2 with the predefined phecode (https://github.com/umich-cphds/createUKBphenome) and corresponding baseline quantitative measures among the identified unrelated set (n = 378,544). We used Popcorn for the cross-population genetic correlation, and two correlation coefficients were calculated: the transethnic genetic-effect correlation (ρge) and transethnic genetic-impact correlation (ρgi)30.

We used both gene-level heritability estimation and colocalization analysis to map our GWAS findings to functional units, specifically genes. We conducted h2gene analysis to partition SNP-based heritability to the gene level57. We estimated heritability for genes that overlapped with fine-mapped regions, where gene regions were defined as the gene body plus or minus 10 kb for gene-level heritability. Additionally, to illustrate the molecular functions of genes of interest, we used colocalization analysis to examine whether there are shared common genetic causal variants between tissue-specific gene expression and traits of interest. We used eQTL resources from 49 tissues in GTEx v.827, lymphoblastoid in MAGE28 and whole blood in JCTF29, testing any gene with genome-wide significant signals in the cis-regulation region (transcription start site plus or minus 1 Mb). The posterior probabilities were used to evaluate colocalization between gene expression and the trait of interest. The R package coloc was used with SuSiE, relaxing the single causal variant assumption58,77,78.

The preserved dataset of 100,000 unrelated TPMI subjects was split into two subsets, training (n = 80,000) and validation (n = 20,000), for PRS model building. Five popular PRS tools were used—LDpred231, Lassosum232, PRS-CS33, SBayesR34 and MegaPRS35—and the training subset was applied for parameter selection and model optimization if needed. LDpred2, PRS-CS and SBayesR assumed the effect of genetic variants following a mixture distribution with different predefined parameters and applied a Bayesian framework for distribution estimation. Lassosum2 used a penalized regression (LASSO) for weight estimating, and MegaPRS leveraged MAF and linkage disequilibrium for model building. We then used the validation subset to evaluate the performance of PRS models. Individual scores were calculated with PLINK268. The explained variance (r2) was used to evaluate the performance of PRS for quantitative traits75,79, and two indices, AUC and liability-scaled r2, were used for PRS of phecodes. We followed the approach of ref. 79 and report both raw r² and r² adjusted for covariates (sex, age and PCs). Additionally, we include partial r² estimates, calculated using the R package rsq. To account for population stratification in cross-cohort predictions, we also report r² with PCs as covariates in Supplementary Tables 9–14. For AUC comparisons, we include a baseline model incorporating standard covariates (sex, age and PCs) to better assess the added predictive power of PRS. We used the likelihood ratio test to obtain the significance for r2 with the R package lmtest, and we calculated the standard error for AUC with the R package auctestr. To further leverage the gene's pleiotropy and shared genetic mechanism among traits, we conducted multitrait PRS model building for the traits in the same genetic cluster based on pairwise genetic correlation identified in the previous step. We pooled all PRS models from the five tools for those identified traits and applied an elastic net regression to combine their weighting and find the most optimized model for the target trait. We performed PRSmix+ for multiple-traits PRS model building36. The cross-population PRS models were based on both TPMI and UKB European GWAS (https://pheweb.org/UKB-TOPMed/), and PRS-CSx was applied80.

We conducted an external validation of our developed PRS using data from the TWB, EAS from UKB and All of Us. TWB is a community-based biobank, and it has recruited over 200,000 participants in Taiwan. Herein, we used 88,628 unrelated subjects (greater than third degree; we removed 5,242 overlapped individuals), who were genotyped with the Axiom customized chip TWB2 (equivalent to TPMv1); their genotyping quality control, phasing and imputation followed the same protocol as described above. The self-reported disease condition was queried from their baseline questionnaire, except for cancer. Because the study design of TWB excluded cancer patients at recruitment, we used both baseline and follow-up self-reporting data to define cancer cases and controls. UKB has enroled approximately 500,000 participants since 2006 and linked their genetic data with enriched phenotypic data. For UKB validation, we used their inpatient record for case definition. Their ancestral population was determined by self-reported ethnic background, such as self-reported Chinese as EAS (n = 1,572); white, British, Irish and any other white background as EUR (n = 472,869); Black or Black British, Caribbean, African and any other Black background as AFR (n = 8,074); and Asian or Asian British, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and any other Asian background as SAS (n = 9,893). All of Us intends to enrol more than 1 million participants in the United States and has released whole-genome genotyping data for approximately 312,000 participants as of the first quarter of 2024. We applied ADMIXTURE with 1000 Genomes as a reference panel to assign the genetically inferred ancestral populations, including EAS (n = 6,895), EUR (n = 152,754), AFR (n = 60,964), AMR (n = 32,394) and SAS (n = 2,334). The genetically confirmed EAS as well as other superpopulations and their linked EMR were used for validating our PRS models. Moreover, we compared the TPMI-derived PRS model with UKB-derived models to investigate the performance of population-specific PRS. The UKB-derived models were based on published UKB European GWAS (https://pheweb.org/UKB-TOPMed/), and LDpred2-auto was applied for model building.

We evaluated the genetic effect on overall health measures. We used the number of clinical visits and the aggregate duration of hospitalization as overall health indices. Owing to collinearity among PRS for different traits, we used a partial least square-generalized linear model to extract components from the PRS of qualified traits with the R package plsRglm81. The number of extracted components was determined by the Akaike Information Criterion. We then estimated the covariate-adjusted proportion of genetic contribution (r2) by comparing the full model with the null model, which included only covariates such as sex, age and hospital. We used a likelihood ratio test to obtain the significances of regression models. For each index, we used three models to compare the top and bottom 5%, 10% and 20%. We selected covariate-matched controls from subjects without hospitalization records as the bottom group for hospitalization models.

The significantly positive correlations are observed across disease categories between the case proportion in TPMI (x-axis) and the 5-year prevalence in NHIRD (y-axis), except congenital anomalies.

The replication rates of TPMI GWAS-identified loci when compared to previously reported loci from the GWAS catalog are presented in this bar chart. Red bars indicate the comparison of TPMI findings to that of all ancestries and blue bars represent the comparison to East Asian ancestries. The categories of diseases are shown under the bars.

The names of nearest mapped gene were labeled for the independent GWAS significant loci.

Heatmap showing genetic correlations among heritable traits. Genetic correlations were estimated using LDSC, with colors representing the correlation coefficients between traits. The weighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (WPGMA) was used for clustering with the correlation coefficient as distance between traits.

The color represents the phecode category, and the shape indicates the PRS development tool: Lassosum2 (circle), LDpred2 (triangle), MegaPRS (square), PRS-CS (cross), and SbayesR (square cross). Each phecode is positioned at a unique x-coordinate, with the tool that has the highest AUC highlighted.

Bar and dot plot showing PRS explained variance (r²) and SNP-heritability for dichotomous traits. Gray bars indicate SNP-heritability (estimated from TPMI GWAS unrelated set [n = 248,754] with LDSC), and the colored bar chart presents the r² values, indicating the proportion of variance explained by the PRS among TPMI validation set (n = 20,000), and dots and error bars show Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) with 95% confidence interval. An asterisk (*) indicates estimates considering the MHC region.

PRS performance is presented as Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) with 95% confidence inverval in TPMI (orange, TPMI validation set, n = 20,000), Taiwan Biobank (green, n = 88,628), East Asians in UK Biobank (blue, n = 1,572), and East Asians in All of Us (purple, n = 6,895). Circles represent TPMI-derived PRS, and triangles indicate UKB (European)-derived PRS models. Only the estimates with case size > 30 were showed on the figure.

The plots show the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) with 95% confidence inverval for PRS validation in East Asian (red, n = 88,628 in TWB; 1,572 in UKB; 6,895 in All of Us), European (olive green, n = 472,869 in UKB and 152,754 in All of Us), African (green, n = 8,074 in UKB and 60,964 in All of Us), South Asian (blue, n = 9,893 in UKB and 2,334 in All of Us), and Admixed American (purple, n = 32,394 in All of Us) populations from TPMI (circle), UKB (triangle), and All of Us (square) cohorts.

Large-scale metagenomic and data-mining efforts have revealed an expansive diversity of bacteriophages (phages) within the human gut1,2,3. However, functional understanding of phage–host interactions within this complex environment is limited, largely due to a lack of cultured isolates available for experimental validation. Here we characterize 134 inducible prophages originating from 252 human gut bacterial isolates using 10 different induction conditions to expand the experimentally validated temperate phage–host pairs originating from the human gut. Importantly, only 18% of computationally predicted prophages could be induced in pure cultures. Moreover, we construct a 78-member synthetic microbiome that, when co-cultured in the presence of human colonic cells (Caco2), led to the induction of 35% phage species. Using cultured isolates, we demonstrate that human host-associated cellular products may act as induction agents, providing a possible link between gastrointestinal cell lysis and temperate phage populations4,5. We provide key insights into prophage diversity and genetics, including a genetic pathway for domestication, finding that polylysogeny was common and resulted in coordinated prophage induction, and that differential induction can be influenced by divergent prophage integration sites. More broadly, our study highlights the importance of culture-based techniques, alongside experimental validation, genomics and computational prediction, to understand the biology and function of temperate phages in the human gut microbiome. These culture-based approaches will enable applications across synthetic biology, biotechnology and microbiome fields.

The human gut microbiota consists of a plethora of microorganisms along with the viruses that infect them, including phages. These viruses are thought to shape the gut microbial community through predation, horizontal gene transfer and lysogenic conversion6,7. Recent advances in computational mining of gut metagenomes have revealed an expansive collection of viral metagenome-assembled genomes and efforts cataloguing this diversity have led to the discovery of several important viral families1,2,3,8,9,10. Moreover, lysogeny is common within the gut, with up to 90% of bacteria predicted to harbour prophages11,12. However, the extent to which these prophages re-enter lytic replication remains unclear. For example, the inactivation of resident prophages represents a common strategy whereby the bacterial population can escape lysis while maintaining beneficial phage genes13,14. Furthermore, initiation of lytic replication by resident prophages is complex, involving both host- and phage-specific cues15,16. Within the gut, little is known about temperate phages and how they interact with our commensals.

Advances in cultivation of the microbiota have enabled the isolation and archiving of previously ‘unculturable' gut bacterial species17,18, along with their phages. Here we use a collection of 252 human gut bacterial isolates (50 Actinomycetota, 1 Fusobacteriota, 51 Bacillota, 57 Pseudomonadota and 93 Bacteroidota) to computationally identify and experimentally validate inducible prophages (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). We began by exposing our bacterial isolate cultures to eight different induction agents and conditions, which included a standard medium control, well-known inducing agents such as mitomycin C (0.3 and 3 µg ml−1) and hydrogen peroxide (0.5 mM), along with lesser-known induction conditions with potential relevance to the gut, including the sugar substitute Stevia (3.7 and 37 mg ml−1) and two starvation conditions (50% carbon depletion and 100% short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) depletion)19,20,21,22,23. After induction, the samples were processed for DNA extraction and 433 viral induction samples that passed our inclusion criteria were sequenced (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 2). This resulted in the detection of 125 inducible gut prophages, representing 63 (23%) phage species (95% average nucleotide identity (ANI), over 85% alignment fraction (AF))24 from 73 (29%) bacterial isolates (5 Actinomycetota, 1 Fusobacteriota, 10 Bacillota, 17 Pseudomonadota and 40 Bacteroidota) (Fig. 1b).

a, Schematic of the methods used. (1) Induction of pure-culture bacterial isolates with standard induction agents. (2) Bacterial synthetic community co-cultured with and without Caco2 cell monolayer. (3) Induction of bacterial isolate pure cultures with cell culture medium, Caco2 cells or cell products. b, Phylogenetic tree of isolates. Actinomycetota is shown in yellow (50), Fusobacteriota in black (1), Bacillota in blue (51), Pseudomonadota in red (57) and Bacteroidota in teal (93). The outer ring shows genera of Bacteroidota; the white bars show high-quality (> 50% complete) predictions; the inner ring shows sequenced isolates (grey); and the dots represent induced prophages (black). The green lines connect isolates sharing induced prophage species and the black lines connect isolates of different genera with the same prophage species. c, The number of induced prophage species within the community (left; n = 29) and community co-cultured with Caco2 cell monolayer (right; n = 57); the grey shading indicates prophage species that were previously identified in standard conditions and pink shading shows prophage species induced only within the synthetic community. d, The number of induced prophage species as in c, coloured by phyla. e, Host abundance within the synthetic microbiome community at the phyla level, shown as the average of timepoints (n = 3) and replicates (n = 5). f, Phylogenetic tree of the bacterial synthetic community (n = 78), and heat map depicting induced prophages within the community (left; n = 22) and the community co-cultured with Caco2 cell monolayer (right; n = 42) identified using KrakenUnique. g, Isolates (n = 32) picked for pure culture induction in DMEM cell medium, Caco2 lysates and Caco2 cell monolayer. The bars represent the number of high-quality predictions (146); white shows total predictions, pink shows newly induced prophages (n = 9), grey squares show prophages also induced under standard conditions (n = 20). h, The percentage of induced isolates and the total number of isolates. i, The percentage of induced and the total number of high-quality prophage predictions. Fusobacteriota was excluded from h and i due to a single isolate.

To further expand on the prophage induction triggers tested above, we constructed a synthetic bacterial community based on a subset of our isolates (n = 78, 4 Actinomycetota, 1 Fusobacteriota, 4 Bacillota, 28 Pseudomonadota and 41 Bacteroidota; Supplementary Table 1). Using this community, we investigated the effects of bacterial co-culture, in which the competition for resources, production of microbial byproducts and quorum sensing may affect prophage induction, as well as community co-culture with a monolayer of human colonic epithelial cells (Caco2), to investigate human host-associated factors5,16 (Extended Data Fig. 1c). In total, 29 phage species out of 162 (17%) were identified as induced in community co-culture using read mapping, yet, notably, 57 phage species (35%) were induced within the Caco2 co-culture, with a total of 22 phage species being newly identified as inducible across both experiments (Fig. 1c). However, there was a shift in the bacterial community composition within the Caco2 co-culture, dominated by Pseudomonadota and Bacteroidota, potentially leading to detection of prophages induced from isolates extinct in the community only co-culture25 (Fig. 1d,e). In a complementary approach, we detected the induction of distinct prophage–host pairs by identifying unique k-mers within each prophage genome. Out of the 338 predicted prophages within the community, 150 contained unique k-mers, allowing for the detection of 43 (29%) induced prophages, 21 of which were detected only in the Caco2 co-culture (Fig. 1f).

Considering the increased prophage induction within the Caco2 co-cultured community, we wanted to investigate whether human cells or cell lysis products (independent of community effects) act as prophage induction triggers. To this end, we selected 32 bacterial isolates from the community (3 Actinomycetota, 1 Fusobacteriota, 2 Bacillota, 14 Pseudomonadota and 12 Bacteroidota; Supplementary Table 1) for pure culture induction assays using Caco2 cell monolayers, Caco2 cellular lysates and DMEM cell culture medium alone (Extended Data Fig. 1a). These conditions induced 29 prophages, with 25 observed within the Caco2 cell lysate condition and 14 in the Caco2 monolayer and DMEM cell medium (Fig. 1g). Importantly, nine of the induced prophages had not been previously detected in our bacterial isolate cultures using standard induction agents, indicating that human host-associated cellular products act as induction triggers. Taken together, 35 out of 146 (24%) prophages were found to be inducible across all conditions within these 32 bacterial isolates.

Consistent with previous reports of substantial lysogeny within the human gut11, 237 out of 252 of bacterial isolates (94%) were computationally predicted to contain high-quality prophage regions. However, across all 10 of our tested induction conditions, only 32% (80 out of 252) of isolates were induced and 18% (134 out of 736) of the high-quality prophage predictions, or 24% (68 out of 274) of high-quality prophage species, corresponded to experimentally inducible prophages in pure culture conditions (Fig. 1h,i and Supplementary Table 3). The highest concordance between inducible and predicted prophage regions was observed within Bacteroidota isolates, in which 80 predictions (27%) from 41 isolates (44%) were inducible. Comparatively, in Pseudomonadota, which had the highest number of predicted prophages (4.5 per isolate), just 12% of prophages were found to be inducible. Moreover, combining the synthetic communities, a total of 36% of prophage species was detected as induced, coinciding with recent reports from human gut metagenomes (8–36%)26,27. Although our experimental approach does not provide comprehensive identification of all gut prophages due to factors including detection limits and potential unidentified induction conditions, it is likely that a substantial portion of predicted prophages within our dataset rarely undergo induction.

We next looked to assign phage taxonomy to our induced temperate phage collection using a database comprising 9,920 phage reference genomes. Given the inherent challenges in assigning taxonomy to phages28, we applied both a gene voting-based search and a gene sharing network method using vContact2 (refs. 2,29) (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 4) with taxonomy assigned to the highest taxonomic resolution shared between methods. The resulting classification assigned 133 phages to the Caudoviricetes order and one phage within the Faserviricetes order (Supplementary Table 3). In total, 26% (35 out of 134) of phages could be assigned to ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) accepted taxa at the family level or lower. These belonged to previously reported phage taxa infecting Pseudomonadota (Bcepmuvirus, Punavirus, Uetakevirus and Peduoviridae), one Spbetavirus infecting Bacillota and 16 prophages belonging to the Winoviridae family infecting Bacteroidota. Although lacking ICTV classification, 30 genomes could be grouped into viral clusters (genus-subfamily level) together with previously described phages. Notably, 19 of these clustered with Hankyphage, a recently described virus thought to lysogenize several Bacteroides species30. Further taxonomic classification grouped ten prophages at the species level with Hankyphage, whereas the remaining nine clustered into seven potential novel species, forming a putative novel genus that we name Hankyvirus after the original phage characterized (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Comparing the Hankyvirus species to bacterial genomes in NCBI RefSeq database (95% ANI over 85% AF), we identified 52 host species originating from 9 genera and 5 families, indicating a broad host range of this genus (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Correspondingly, we find two Hankyvirus species induced within both Bacteroides and Phocaeicola isolates within our collection, providing experimental validation of these phages as actively replicating across these two host genera.

A minimum of 70% coverage over the phage was required to be counted as present within a virome. The bacterial host phyla of inducible prophage species coloured as in a, and database reference genomes (n = 875) are shown in grey.

We next sought to place our temperate phage genomes within the larger context of the human gut by comparing their prevalence to the reference genomes, including the Crassvirales order31. Approximately half of our inducible prophage species (28 out of 68) could be detected in gut viromes9 (n = 1,241; Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 5). LoVEphage, a recently discovered Bacteroidota phage9,10, was the most common, being detected in around 8% (97 out of 1,241) of the viromes and representing up to 64% of reads within one virome (Supplementary Table 3). Comparatively, the most abundant Crassvirales genome, belonging to the alpha/gamma family, was found in approximately 19% of the viromes investigated (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Three phages in our collection were species-level members of LoVEphage, induced from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Phocaeicola dorei and Phocaeicola vulgatus hosts (Extended Data Fig. 2b). An additional eight phage species were detected in 2–5% of gut viromes (Supplementary Table 3). These included the four species within the Hankyvirus genus, one Uetakevirus infecting Escherichia coli and three previously uncharacterized Bacteroidota phages (Wilby, Saffi and Shia; Extended Data Fig. 3c).

Discernible integrase or site-specific recombination genes, both of which are used as hallmark genes for a temperate lifestyle32,33, were absent in 28% (19 out of 68) of our inducible phage species, including Hankyviruses. We found transposases in ten of these viruses, while the remaining nine lacked any discernible integration genes, illustrating the difficulty in assigning phage lifestyle based on genomic data alone. Diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) are prevalent within the gut virome, and tail-targeting DGRs are known to enable rapid host switching in a Bordetella phage34,35. We found DGRs in 19% (13 out of 68) of our inducible prophage species, the majority of which were seen in Bacteroidota phages, in which 43% (12 out of 28) of species encoded DGRs targeting known and genomically predicted tail proteins (Supplementary Table 3). Concordantly, we found eight Bacteroidota prophage species actively replicating across different bacterial species, three of which replicating across different bacterial genera (Fig. 1b (connecting lines)), highlighting the involvement of DGRs in phage host range expansion through diversification of tail proteins34. More recently, bacterial DGRs were implicated in anti-phage defence mechanisms, and targeted engineering using DGRs accelerated evolution within both host receptor and the reciprocal phage binding domain36,37. Notably, we found four prophage species containing DGRs that encoded a second variable region (VR) targeting genes distal from the reverse transcriptase cassette9 (Extended Data Fig. 3c). The second VR was found in proximity to counter defence genes, such as DNA methyltransferase, indicating further involvement of DGRs in the phage–host arms race34.

The retention of cryptic prophages is known to provide the host with adaptive fitness advantages and has been shown to result in a bimodal size distribution of prophage genomes13,14. Concordantly, we find bimodal length distributions of prophages across all host phyla within our collection (Extended Data Fig. 4a), with the early peak corresponding to sequences with low completeness scores (<50% complete, n = 1,236) and later peaks corresponding to high-quality predictions (>50% complete, n = 736) and experimentally inducible prophages (n = 134; Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 6). To investigate differences in gene content between these groups, we performed gene enrichment analysis of annotated PHROG gene categories and found that small prophage genomes lacked essential phage genes (such as structural, head and packaging, and lysis genes) but were enriched in accessory genes and genes of unknown function38 (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Similarly, when limiting the comparison to high-quality predictions, we found an enrichment of structural genes (head and packaging, connector, lysis and tail) within induced prophages, whereas non-induced predictions were enriched for accessory genes and genes of unknown function, indicating that a subset of high-quality predictions might be cryptic prophage-like elements or poor predictions (Fig. 3b).

No significant difference was found based on two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. d, The dN/dS ratio of PHROG gene categories (n = 7,893) between induced–induced and induced–non-induced prophage pairs. Significant P values (shown above the brackets) were calculated using two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and adjusted using the Hochberg method. The box plots show the median (centre line), first and third quartiles (box limits), and the whiskers extend to ±1.5× the interquartile range; outliers are shown as dots. e, Absolute qPCR quantification of ΦPomma in Stevia (left, n = 3 biological replicates) and hydrogen peroxide (right, n = 3 biological replicates).

The Stevia condition is shown by the solid lines and the hydrogen peroxide condition is shown by the dotted lines. For the ΦPomma genome map, genes are coloured by PHROG categories; unknown genes are shown in grey. The deleted ‘DNA transposition protein' gene is highlighted by a black dashed box.

We next sought to investigate potential genetic mechanisms leading to trapping of prophages within the host genome by comparing experimentally induced prophages to highly similar, non-induced prophages (95% ANI, 85% AF; Supplementary Table 7). To classify these non-induced prophages as putatively cryptic, we restricted the analysis to prophages that had been sequenced (but not induced) in the same condition(s) as their inducible counterparts, with the rationale that highly similar prophages should respond to the same induction triggers. This resulted in a total of 231 prophage pairs between 65 induced and 58 non-induced prophages. No significant changes were found in gene frequency (P > 0.05, Fisher's exact test), indicating that, although gene loss may be characteristic of cryptic prophages, it is unlikely to be the initial cause of inactivation. Moreover, although we detected 201 homologous gene transfer (HGT) and 65 insertion–deletion events, there was no significant difference in the number of total events when compared to a set of high sequence similarity induced prophage pairs (222 pairs, P = 0.46, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Comparing host ANI between the induced and non-induced prophage pairs (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d), we found no association with induction (P = 0.6, Pearson's correlation), suggesting that prophage inactivation was not driven by diversification of the host or integration into divergent non-permissive hosts.

To investigate whether non-induced prophages have an elevated number of mutations, we measured the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) within the set of induced to non-induced prophage pairs, and their associated hosts. We found an overall elevated mutation rate in prophages (mean = 0.89, median = 0.18) compared with the host genome (mean = 0.16, median = 0.095, P < 2 × 10−16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), but no significant difference between induced to induced or induced to non-induced prophage pairs or their host genomes (P = 0.99 and P = 0.62 respectively, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 8). Comparing gene substitution rates, we found 143 genes with elevated dN/dS rates (>1), indicating diversifying selection (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 9). Notably, the majority (110 out of 143) of these genes lacked a known function and 40% (57 out of 143) were associated with DGRs, highlighting an active and not yet deciphered role of DGRs within gut prophages. Importantly, within the non-induced prophages we found a significant increase in the dN/dS substitution rates in genes involved in integration and excision (P = 0.002, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), suggesting that non-functional mutations in these genes provides a pathway for the inactivation of prophages.

To test whether the inactivation of integration and excision genes could trap a prophage inside its host genome, we constructed a gene deletion mutant of the inducible prophage Pomma by knocking out its DNA transposition protein (ΦPomma ∆tran) within the Bacteroides faecis host strain CC01414 (Extended Data Fig. 4e and Supplementary Table 10). From our previous inductions, we found that prophage Pomma was selectively induced by hydrogen peroxide and Stevia (37 mg ml−1). Using these two inducers, we compared the induction of wild-type ΦPomma versus the ∆tran mutant using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and sequencing of chloroform and DNase-treated supernatants. qPCR analysis showed a 3.5 and 2.6 log increase in ΦPomma concentration within the wild type versus ∆tran deletion mutant in samples treated with Stevia and hydrogen peroxide, respectively (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Table 11). Through sequencing, we observed clear induction in the wild-type strain, with 35- and 17-fold increased coverage over the bacterial background in the Stevia-treated and hydrogen-peroxide-treated samples, respectively, whereas no increase over the bacterial background was detected in the ∆tran mutant strain (Fig. 3f).

To determine whether prophage induction was linked to phylogeny, we examined the induction response across our ten conditions and standard growth control (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 3). Combined, the two concentrations of mitomycin C induced the largest number of prophages (n = 70) and the most Pseudomonadota prophages (n = 17). Hydrogen peroxide induced 43 prophages, including the largest number of Bacteroidota prophages (n = 35). However, these well-known induction agents exhibited only marginally increased induction compared to spontaneous induction during standard growth condition (n = 36). The Caco2 human cell induction conditions induced 29 prophages from 32 tested hosts, with Bacteroidota (n = 16) followed by Pseudomonadota (n = 9) showing the largest numbers of induced prophages. Considerable overlap was observed between prophage induction in standard media and induction agents (mitomycin C, n = 25; hydrogen peroxide, n = 15; Stevia, n = 19; carbon depletion, n = 9; SCFA depletion, n = 11; Caco2 induction conditions, n = 5). Comparing induction conditions across each phylum, the only significant difference observed was within the Pseudomonadota phyla in response to 3 µg ml−1 mitomycin C (P = 0.024, Fisher's exact test).

The box plots show the median (centre line), first and third quartiles (box limits), and the whiskers extend to ±1.5× the interquartile range; the means of three technical replicates are shown as dots. Normality was tested using the Shapiro–Wilk test, and significant P values (shown above brackets) of normal data were calculated using two-sided paired t-tests. e, The genome location of prophage ΦWilby (red) and ΦPomma (grey). Shaded lines connect genes with 100% amino acid identity (AAI).

We next investigated polylysogeny across our collection and its influence on induction (Fig. 4b). Polylysogeny was most prevalent within the Bacteroidota isolates, in which 28 out of 41 (68%) of lysogens had more than one inducible prophage compared with 11 out of 38 isolates (29%) across the other phyla (P = 0.002, Fisher's exact test). We then compared whether polylysogeny influenced induction, observing a positive correlation between the number of co-inhabiting inducible prophages and conditions leading to induction of each prophage (τ = 0.22, P = 0.002, Kendall's rank correlation; Fig. 4c). Prophages residing in polylysogens (n = 90) were induced on average in 2.7 conditions compared with 2.1 conditions in single lysogens (n = 35, P = 0.03, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), suggesting that polylysogeny may promote simultaneous prophage induction and reduce stability within lysogens.

Finally, we investigated differential induction within polylysogens by measuring the abundance of phage DNA in the supernatants of five highly similar (99% ANI) Bacteroidota caccae isolates harbouring the same two prophages (ΦWilby and ΦPomma; Supplementary Table 11). We identified an overall preferential induction of ΦWilby within standard medium (P = 0.006), but not in hydrogen-peroxide-treated samples (P = 0.9, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), with isolate CC01407 demonstrating the most marked difference between the two phages (P = 0.026, paired t-test; Fig. 4d). Calculating the ratio of ΦWilby over ΦPomma within each isolate, we found a significant variance of means between the isolates in both standard medium (P = 0.012) and hydrogen peroxide (P = 0.0008, analysis of variance (ANOVA)). These results implied that the host genetic background, even within highly similar isolates, may affect prophage induction. We previously identified phage ΦPomma as a transposable prophage that does not use site-specific integration, but randomly inserts into the host genome39. To investigate the prophage integration sites within our isolates, we used long-read sequencing on the five B. caccae strains. Genomic analysis identified ΦWilby integrated into the same tRNA gene location, which is characteristic of site-specific integration; however, the transposable prophage ΦPomma was found in four different genomic locations within the five isolates (Fig. 4e), implicating the integration site as a possible driver for the observed differential induction within these isolates.

The high microbial load within the human gut represents an optimal environment for temperate phages, as frequent interactions with their hosts provide ample opportunity for lysogeny12. Concordantly, the majority of bacteria within the gut are predicted to be lysogens, with up to 90% of bacteria harbouring at least one prophage11,12. However, the degree to which these prophages engage in lytic replication is poorly understood. Using our defined culture collection of 252 gut bacterial isolates, we predict that the majority harbour prophage-like elements (94%), but find that only a fraction of predicted prophages could be experimentally induced in pure culture (18%). Caveats to our approach include experimental cut-offs for detection and minimum amounts of DNA required for sequencing, which could exclude detection of low-level-inducing prophages. Moreover, there are probably biases towards induction and detection of Caudoviricetes prophages and, indeed, all but one prophage (from the Inoviridae family) belonged to this class. Moreover, considering little is known about prophage induction triggers within the gut, it is plausible that some of our isolates carry prophages that were not induced due to a lack of appropriate induction triggers. To address this, we constructed a synthetic microbiome community and co-cultured it with or without human cells to simulate the biologically relevant conditions within the human gut. Within the community co-culture, we estimate that around 29% of prophages were induced, with around half of these induced only in co-culture with human epithelial Caco2 cells. However, whether this induction was triggered by human cell factors or was the result of spontaneous induction mirroring the shift in host taxa was unclear36,40. We therefore investigated human host factors in the absence of community effects, using 32 pure culture isolates exposed to Caco2 cell monolayers, Caco2 cellular lysates and DMEM cell culture medium alone. We observed a modest increase in induction with lysed Caco2 cellular products compared with cell culture medium or intact cells, suggesting that human cellular lysis products act as prophage induction triggers. This is in accordance with previous observations of temperate virion expansion found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease that are associated with increased inflammation and cell death4.

Recent advances have highlighted the complexities governing prophage induction within natural environments, ranging from SOS-independent induction triggers, interprophage competition and interference by defence mechanisms41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48. Across our pure culture and community inductions, only a minority of predicted prophages was detected to undergo lytic replication. We therefore propose that, although the genetic pool of integrated prophages within the gut is large, only a fraction of these will readily undergo lytic replication. This is consistent with previous studies estimating low induction rates within the human gut and reduced lytic infection rates of temperate gut phages25,49. Furthermore, we detect distinct gene enrichment patterns where non-induced prophage predictions encoded fewer structural and lysis-associated genes, indicating that a portion of high-quality predictions might consist of prophage remnants or poor prophage predictions. Moreover, non-induced predictions with high sequence similarity to experimentally induced prophages exhibited increased non-synonymous substitution rates in integrase and excision-related genes. Deletion of one of these genes in an active prophage led to complete abolishment of induction, providing evidence for a genetic pathway towards prophage domestication.

A considerable portion of our isolates (52%) with inducible prophages were polylysogens, harbouring more than one replicating prophage48. We found a positive correlation between polylysogeny and successful prophage induction conditions, which is consistent with previous reports of phage anti-repressor proteins targeting non-cognate prophages leading to synchronized prophage induction50. Finally, we show that induction of polylysogenic prophages varied between near identical isolates, which correlated with divergent prophage integration sites within the host genome. Thus, prophage induction is complex and influenced by growth condition, polylysogeny and prophage integration site. In summary, we demonstrate the feasibility of culture-based approaches to provide insights into temperate phage biology and their interactions within human-associated commensals, and provide a validated collection of phage–host pairs for future use in synthetic biology, microbiome and biotechnological advances.

A culture collection of 252 bacterial isolates previously isolated and sequenced from human gut samples was used for prophage induction51. All bacterial culture work was performed in yeast-extract casitone fatty acid (YCFA) medium at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions (Whitely A95 anaerobic workstation) containing 10% carbon dioxide, 10% hydrogen and 80% nitrogen52. Each isolate was streaked onto YCFA agar plates and incubated for 24 h before a single colony was inoculated in 1 ml YCFA medium in a 96-well plate and incubated for 24 h. Frozen stocks of the 96-well master plates were maintained in glycerol suspension (25%, v/v) at −80 °C. Before each induction, 96-well plates containing 1 ml YCFA were inoculated from the frozen master plate and grown overnight.

A set of 40 single-copy marker genes were extracted from the 252 bacterial isolates using progenome-classifier53 and translated into amino acid sequences using SeqKit54 (v.2). The protein sequences were concatenated and aligned using MAFFT55 (v.7.310) before gaps were trimmed with trimAI56 (v.1.4.1). Maximum-likelihood trees were constructed using RAxML57 (v.8.2.12) PROTGAMMALGF model with 100 bootstraps replicates and visualized in iTOL58. Bacterial clusters sharing 99% ANI were identified using dRep59 (v.3.0.0) with the ‘-pa 0.9 --sa 0.99' flags. Prophage regions were predicted using Virsorter60, Vibrant61 (default settings) and VirFinder62 (minimum length 5 kb; 0.7 score; and P value 0.05). Completeness was predicted using CheckV63 and contaminating bacterial regions were removed. Trimmed predictions were located within their cognate bacterial genome and overlapping predictions were merged using R IRanges64 (v.2.28.0).

Prophages were induced by one of two methods. (1) Overnight starter cultures were diluted 1:50 in 1.5 ml standard YCFA medium and grown for 5 h before the addition of mitomycin C19 (0.3 or 3 μg ml−1, M4287, Sigma-Aldrich) or hydrogen peroxide20 (0.5 mM, H1009, Sigma-Aldrich). (2) Starter cultures were diluted 1:50 directly into standard YCFA medium, YCFA medium supplemented with Stevia23 (3.7 or 37 mg ml−1, SweetLeaf, organic Stevia leaf extract), carbon-depleted medium22 (YCFA medium with 50% reduced carbon source) or SCFA-depleted21 medium (YCFA medium without SCFAs). All cultures were then grown for 20–25 h followed by centrifugation at 4,000g for 30 min and 1 ml supernatants were collected. The supernatants were treated with 10 μg ml−1 DNase I (DN25, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.01 volume RNase A (R6148, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 37 °C. Viral particles were precipitated in 7% PEG 8000 0.3 M NaCl overnight at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 14,000g for 30 min, after which the pellets were dissolved in 50 μl TE buffer at 4 °C. Next, 20 μl of each sample was mixed with 5 μl loading dye containing 0.8% SDS and 60 mM EDTA and heated at 65 °C for 10 min. The samples were loaded onto 0.4% agarose gels and run in TAE for 1.5 h, followed by visualization of phage sized (about 50 kb) DNA bands using Image Studio Lite (LI-COR Biosciences) with a sample to control well signal ratio cut off of 0.03 (refs. 65). Samples with suspected viral DNA were treated with 0.5% SDS and 100 μg ml−1 proteinase K at 55 °C for 1 h followed by a 10 min inactivation at 65 °C. Phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction was performed followed by sodium acetate (0.3 M final) and 70% ethanol precipitation with 0.4 mg ml−1 glycogen overnight at 4 °C. The DNA quantity was validated using Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), with a minimum of 2 ng µl−1 required for sequencing. From these, a subset of samples was selected for sequencing as follows. First, all of the samples grown in standard YCFA medium or induced with mitomycin C were selected. Second, samples from at least one isolate within a bacterial cluster (99% ANI) grown in the remaining five induction conditions were selected, except for the Fusobacteria isolate, which was sequenced only in standard medium and mitomycin C. For 17 out of 84 clusters, more than one isolate was sequenced in all conditions. Nextera-XT libraries were constructed and sequenced on either the Illumina NextSeq 2000 or Illumina NextSeq 550 system.

Human colonic epithelial immortalized cells (Caco2 TC766; genotype verified by the AGRF Human Cell Line Identification Service) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, low glucose, GlutaMAX supplement, pyruvate) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), containing 10% FCS (Bovogen) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in T75 cm2 flasks (Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were routinely tested for the presence of mycoplasma contamination (MycoStrip, Invivogen) and were confirmed to be mycoplasma negative. For sonicated cell inductions, 4 × 107 cells in 5 ml DMEM (without FCS) were sonicated on ice (5 cycles, 30 s on and off at 40% frequency). Sonicated Caco2 cells were confirmed by observing efficient lysis of cells by bright-field microscopy and stored at −20 °C. Before the addition of bacterial cells, sonicated cells were thawed on ice and pre-reduced DMEM was resuspended with the cells for a final cell density of 5 × 105 cells per ml in the Whitley A95 Anaerobic Workstation (Don Whitley Scientific) at 37 °C. Sonicated cells in DMEM (2 ml) were added to 6-well tissue culture plates to achieve a total of 1 × 106 cells per well.

Two days before induction, 1 × 106 Caco2 cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates (Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a final volume of 2 ml per well with DMEM containing 10% FCS and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Caco2 confluent cell layers were serum starved under anaerobic conditions for 2 h by replacing the cell medium with 2 ml pre-reduced DMEM (no FCS) per well in the Whitley A95 anaerobic workstation at 37 °C.

Individual working stocks of bacterial isolates were prepared from overnight bacterial cultures that were centrifuged at 4,000g for 10 min, resuspended to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 5.5, combined 1:1 with 150 μl 50% glycerol and stored as frozen glycerol stocks (25% final glycerol). Glycerol stocks of individual bacterial isolates were thawed and 8.5 µl of each isolate was added to 6-well tissue culture plates containing 2 ml pre-reduced DMEM medium only, 2 ml sonicated Caco2 cells (total cell number, 1 × 106 cells per well) or confluent Caco2 cell layer. All cultures were grown for 24 h followed by centrifugation at 4,000g for 30 min after which 1.8 ml supernatants were collected, and viral DNA was extracted and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 2000 system as previously described.

Reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic67 (v.0.38) (SLIDINGWINDOW:4:25 MINLEN:100) and used to identify induced prophages using two approaches. First, high-quality prophage predictions (>50% completeness) were validated for induction as follows. Read coverage for each library were obtained on their corresponding genome using Bowtie2 (ref. 68) (v.2.3.5) (default settings). Genome coverage in 100 bp increments was obtained using Samtools69 (v.1.9) and Deeptools70 (v.3.1.3) and the average modified z score, coverage fold increase and Cohen's D of prophage regions was calculated as follows:

where z-scoreave is the average z score of the predicted region, xp is 100 bp coverage increments of the phage region, xh is 100 bp coverage increments of the host and \(\tilde{x}\) is median coverage of the host and

where Cohen's D is the effect size of prophage versus host coverage, Sh and Sp is the s.d. of the host and phage coverage, respectively71. Regions with a minimum average modified z score of 3.5 or an average twofold coverage and Cohen's D larger than 0.7 were retained. A custom Python script was then used to refine the start stop positions of the prophage regions within each genome, removing flanking 100 bp increments with coverage less than 25% of the mean prophage coverage (code is available at https://doi.org/10.26180/29946902.v1). In a second approach, regions of increased coverage were identified without previous prophage predictions using hafeZ72 (v.1.0.2) (default settings with the -N -S flags). Some of the identified regions of interest were found to be split across several host contigs. To resolve these into full-length phage contigs, de novo assembly using MetaViral SPade73 (default setting) was performed and contigs overlapping with hafeZ prediction were retained. The resulting contigs were dereplicated at 99% ANI over 85% of the AF using scripts from the CheckV repository and the longest representative of each prophage were retained for further analysis.

Proteins from the resulting contigs were predicted and annotated using PROKKA74 (v.1.14.6) (default settings, --hmms) with the PHROGS38 database. Furthermore, all proteins were scanned against the hmm databases provided by Cenote-Taker2 (ref. 75) using Hmmer76 (v.3.3.1) hmmscan (-E 1e-9). To remove potential fragmented protein hits against hallmark genes, a custom phage database was constructed of genomes from refs. 9,31 and the INphared database (December 2021 version) dereplicated at 95% ANI over 85% AF using CheckV scripts77. The same HMM searches were performed on proteins from the database and half the average length of the middle 80% percentile was calculated as a cut-off for each Caudoviricetes hallmark gene (265 amino acids for terminase large subunit, 245 amino acids for portal protein and 186 amino acids for major head protein). To identify any non-Caudoviricetes genomes, HMM searches for Microviridae, Tectiviridae and Inoviridae were performed as follows. Microviridae hallmark VP1 proteins from ref. 78 was made into HMM profiles using MAFFT v.7.310 with the standard settings followed by TABAJARA (-t 0.5 -p 50 -w 15 -b 15 -mb 15 -m c -gs 20 -md 3 -cs yes -mb 20)79. Multiple-sequence alignments of the double jelly-roll hallmark protein of Tectiviridae were obtained from a previous study80 and turned into HMM profiles using HMMER v.3.3.1 hmmbuild. These and the Inoviridae morphogenesis protein family HMMs provided by ref. 81 were searched against all proteins using hmmscan (-E 1e-9 and score ≥ 30). Contigs containing at least one viral hallmark gene were retained.

Working stocks of the synthetic microbiome community were prepared by combining 1.5 ml of overnight bacterial culture diluted to OD600 0.7, after which the community was centrifuged at 8,000g for 10 min, resuspended in 10 ml fresh YCFA and stored as frozen glycerol stocks (25% final glycerol). Human Caco2 confluent cell layers grown for 48 h in 175 cm2 tissue culture flasks (NUNC) in DMEM containing 10% FCS with 5% CO2 at 37 °C were transferred to anaerobic conditions (Whitley A95 anaerobic workstation) and the medium in each flask was replaced with 70 ml pre-warmed and pre-reduced (overnight) DMEM (without FCS). Next, 200 μl of the frozen community stock was added to each 70 ml tissue culture flasks containing Caco2 cell layers as well as to culture bottles containing 200 ml pre-reduced YCFA medium, both in five replicates. All cultures were grown anaerobically with samples (14 ml) taken at 24, 48 and 72 h. Total metagenome DNA extraction was performed using the FastDNA SPIN Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals) on 1 ml of each sample. The remainder of the sample was centrifuged at 3,000g for 30 min and the supernatant was collected and filtered through 0.45 μM syringe filters (Acrodisc, Pall) followed by incubation for 15 min with 0.1 volumes of chloroform at room temperature. The samples were then centrifuged at 4,000g for 15 min and 9 ml of the aqueous phase was collected and treated with 10 μg ml−1 DNase I (DN25, Sigma-Aldrich) and 120 μl RNase A (R6148, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature. Viral particles were precipitated using 7% PEG 8000 incubated overnight at 4 °C, centrifuged at 12,000g for 1 h and resuspended in 100 μl TE buffer. Viral DNA was extracted and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 2000 system as previously described.

Reads from the synthetic microbiome community were trimmed using Trimmomatic67 (v.0.38) (SLIDINGWINDOW:4:25 MINLEN:100), decontaminated of human reads (GCA_000001405.29) using Bowtie2 (v.2.3.5) and Samtools (v.1.19) and de-interleaved using bbmap (v.39.06). A database of community prophage genomes (high-quality predictions n = 338) and bacterial host genomes (n = 78, masked for prophage regions using bedtools (v.2.26.0)) was constructed70. Decontaminated community reads from samples were aligned against the database using Bowtie2 (default flags) and coverage was obtained using Samtools ‘coverage'. Host abundance was calculated from the Samtools outputs of total DNA extracted sequence libraries.

In viral-enriched samples, prophage species were regarded to be induced if at least one representative genome was covered with reads ≥85% of the length with a twofold increase in coverage (depth) over the mean host genome coverage (sum coverage of host contigs normalized by length) in a minimum three out of five replicates. For detection of individual prophage genomes, a custom metagenomic read classification database was built using KrakenUniq (v.1.0.4)82 containing prophage and prophage-masked host genomes. For database construction purposes, phage sequences were assigned the NCBI taxonomy IDs of their host bacteria. NCBI taxonomic data were downloaded using the ‘krakenuniq-download --db taxonomy' command on 7 July 2024. The KrakenUniq database was constructed with the krakenuniq-build command using Jellyfish (v.1.1.12) for k-mer extraction, a k-mer size of 21 and the --taxids-for-genomes option. Paired-end reads were merged using the read_merger.pl script within KrakenUniq and subsequently classified using the krakenuniq command with default parameters. On the basis of data from pure isolate inductions, a cut-off of 0.25 k-mer coverage, 10 reads and 100 unique k-mers was selected for calling detection of phage and a cut-off of 10 reads and 18,000 unique k-mers for calling detection of bacterial host genome was used. Prophage genomes were regarded as induced if they had a twofold increase in kmerDuplicity over mean host genome kmerDuplicity (sum duplicity of host contigs normalized to length) in a minimum of three out of five replicates. Prophages from undetected isolates were regarded as induced if detected in a minimum of three replicates. To estimate the number of detectable prophages within the community (prophages with at least 100 unique k-mers), pairwise distances between all prophage and prophage-masked host genomes were calculated using Mash (v.2.2.2) with a k-mer size 21 and sketch size 5000 (ref. 83). Neighbour-joining was applied to the resulting distance matrix as implemented in RapidNJ (v.2.3.2) with default parameters84. Using the resulting tree, a metagenomic classification database was constructed using Expam (v.1.2.2.5) with a k-mer size 21 and number of unique k-mers per genome was obtained using the CountUniqueKmers.py script (https://github.com/seansolari/expam/scripts/database/CountUniqueKmers.py)85.

Viral taxonomy was assigned based on a combination of the protein alignment method previously described2 against the INphared database and genus level clustering using vContact229 against phage genomes in the custom made database used for hallmark gene searches. In cases in which the taxonomic assignments from the protein voting and genus-level clustering method differed, the lowest common classification was assigned. Species level dereplication was performed at 95% ANI over 85% AF using scripts from the CheckV repository. DGRs were identified using DGRscan86 with the default settings, and remote VRs were identified querying the template repeat using BLASTn (v.2.7.1+) (-dust no -perc_identity 75 -qcov_hsp_perc 50 -ungapped -word_size 4). DGR-positive genomes were defined as genomes encoding both a reverse transcriptase gene and containing repeat regions.

The fractional abundance and prevalence of induced prophages within gut viromes were performed as described previously9 using the 1,241 human gut viromes described therein. Reads from each virome were competitively aligned to the temperate phage species genomes together with the custom database previously described. The number of reads and read coverage was obtained using Samtools ‘coverage' (v.1.9). The fractional abundance of a genomes was calculated as follows:

and the sum fractional abundance was normalized to 1 as previously described87. A genome was counted as present within a virome if at least 70% of the genome length was covered by reads.

Proteins of predicted prophages were predicted using PROKKA v.1.14.6 (default setting, --hmms) and annotated using the PHROG database. The total gene counts per PHROG category and the presence–absence of PHROG categories within each genome were obtained for induced, high-quality predictions (>50% completeness) and low-quality predictions (<50% completeness). The percentage gene frequency change of PHROG categories between induced, high-quality and low-quality predictions was calculated for total genes and presence–absence counts as follows:

where fcry and fin are the gene frequencies in the high completeness prediction and induced prophage set, respectively.

High-quality predictions were aligned to induced prophages using BLASTn (v.2.15.0+) and pairs with a minimum of 95% ANI over 85% AF (Checkv anicalc.py63 script) were further filtered to only include hosts that had been sequenced in the same condition(s) as the induced prophage. The same search was performed to identify induced–induced prophage pairs. The number of HGT and insertion–deletion events between the pairs was calculated using R IRanges (v.2.28.0) and splicejam (v. 0.0.77) packages, where an HGT event was defined as a gap of a at least 50 bp within the alignment present in both pairs and insertion–deletion events was defined as gap (minimum 50 bp) present in one of the pairs but not the other88. Gaps involving the ends of either prophage were excluded. Host ANI of prophage pairs was calculated using fastANI89 (v.1.33). dN/dS ratios between prophage pairs was calculated using dRep (compare --SkipMash --S_algorithm goANI) and the dnds_from_drep.py90 script.

Gene deletion of the DNA transposition protein gene within ΦPomma in B. faecis isolate CC01414 was achieved using the CRISPR–Cas-based system described previously91. First, we redesigned pB025, which contains the FnCas12a system, with a sgRNA targeting the DNA transposition protein gene (gene location, base pairs 5610–6524) along with a repair template containing 1,000 bp of homologous DNA up and downstream of this gene (Supplemental Table 10). This plasmid (pB025_09) was transformed into competent E. coli S17 and grown aerobically in LB medium supplemented with 100 µg ml−1 ampicillin. B. faecis was grown in brain–heart infusion (BHI) liquid medium supplemented with haemin, resazurin and vitamin K3 (menadione) under anaerobic conditions. Conjugation was performed under anaerobic conditions and B. faecis transconjugants were selected for with 200 µg ml−1 gentamicin and 25 µg ml−1 erythromycin. A deletion mutant was identified before anhydrotetracycline (aTc) induction, presumably due to leaky expression. This deletion mutant was verified by PCR and sanger sequencing confirming the clean deletion of the DNA transposition protein gene (CC01414 ∆tran).

Induction of ΦPomma in CC01414 wild type and deletion mutant (∆tran) was performed as described previously using hydrogen peroxide (0.5 mM) and stevia (37 mg ml−1) using three separate induction reactions for each condition and isolate. Lysates were treated with 2% chloroform, centrifuged for 20 min at 4,000g at 4 °C, DNase treated and phage precipitation with PEG, DNA extraction and sequencing was performed as described previously. qPCR of DNA extracted phage lysates was performed in technical triplicates using SYBR Green I Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics) with the Roche Lightcycler 480 system containing 1 μM of each primer, 2 μl of DNA template and 1× SYBR Green I Master Kit, in a final reaction volume of 20 μl. Cycle parameters were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min; followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, 62 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Primers were designed using Primer blast and no cross reactivity to bacterial background was detected (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast). The standard curve was produced with gBlock sequence from IDT containing the sequence targeted by ΦPomma primers.

Isolates were streaked onto YCFA plates and grown for 24 h. Three sperate colonies from each isolate were inoculated into 1 ml YCFA broth and grown overnight. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:50 into 1.5 ml standard YCFA medium and hydrogen peroxide was added after 5 h of growth. All cultures were grown for an additional 20 h and lysates were treated with 2% chloroform and centrifuged for 20 min at 4,000g at 4 °C and frozen at −80 °C until analysis was performed. qPCR was performed as previously described using 5 μl of DNA template and annealing temperature of 60 °C for 30 s and elongation of 30 s. qPCR primer pairs were custom designed using Primer 3 (https://primer3.org/). In silico PCR amplification (http://insilico.ehu.eus/user_seqs/PCR/) did not show cross reactivity of primers to the rest of the bacterial genome. Standard curves for primer efficiency analysis were generated by tenfold dilution in PCR-grade H2O. Samples were diluted tenfold and qPCRs was performed in triplicates. The efficiency of each primer calculated as in equation (5) and corrected ΔCt values calculated as in equation (6):

Isolates were streaked onto YCFA plates and grown for 24 h. Single colonies were grown overnight in 40 ml of YCFA medium, pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000g for 10 min and washed four times in 1 ml of PBS. DNA was extracted using the Monarch HMW DNA extraction kit (New England Biolabs) according to the Gram-positive bacteria protocol, with modifications. Cells were lysed in 300 μl of STET buffer (8% sucrose 5% Triton X-100 50 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris pH 8) containing 10 mg ml−1 lysozyme, 300 μl of HMW gDNA tissue lysis buffer and 20 μl of proteinase K and incubated at 56 °C for 10 min. The lysates were treated with 10 μl of RNase A at 56 °C for 5 min followed by 300 μl of protein separation solution. The samples were mixed by inversion for 2 min then centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 16,000g. The supernatants were collected and 550 μl of isopropanol was added to 800 μl of supernatant. The samples were inverted for 5 min, or until DNA was precipitated, and DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 12,000g. The resulting pellet was washed twice with 500 μl of gDNA wash buffer and resuspended in nuclease free water. Library preparation and Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing was performed using either the Oxford Nanopore ligation sequencing kit (SQK-LSK109) with native barcoding expansion kit (EXP-NBD114) (CC01407, CC01390, CC01401 and CC01405) or the rapid barcoding kit 96 (SQK-RBK110.96, CC01404). Resulting long reads were hybrid assembled with Illumina short reads into closed genomes using dragonfly (v.1.0.14) (CC01407, CC01390, CC01401 and CC01405) or into near complete genome using unicycler92 (v.0.4.7) (CC01404) with subsequent scaffolding using RagTag93 with CC01407 genome as reference.

Significance of PHROG gene category was calculated with Fisher's exact test (two sided) and P values were adjusted with the Hochberg method using R base stats (R v.4.1.3) and rstatix (v.0.7.0) packages. Pearson's correlation test between host ANI and phage pair inducibility as well as Kendall's rank correlation between the number prophages within lysogens and prophage inducibility was calculated and plotted using the R ggpubr (v.0.4.0) package. Significance of horizontal gene transfers and dN/dS data was calculated with Wilcoxon rank-sum test (two sided) and adjusted by Hochberg method using R ggpubr (v.0.4.0) and rstatix (v.0.7.0) packages. Normality of qPCR fold change between induced prophage in polylysogens calculated with Shapiro–Wilk test and significance tested with paired t-test (two sided) using rstatix (v.0.7.0), preferential induction calculated with Wilcoxon rank-sum test (two sided) and variance of means between isolates was calculated with ANOVA using the R base stats (R v.4.1.3) package. Genome maps were visualized using the R gggenomes (v.0.9.9.9000) package, and genome read coverage was visualized using R ggplot2 (v.3.5.1).

a, Schematic of bacterial single isolate inductions. Isolates were grown 20–25 h in standard media, Mitomycin C (0.3 and 3 μg/mL), hydrogen peroxide (0.5 mM), Stevia (3.7 and 37 μg/mL), carbon depleted or SCFA depleted media (n = 2,016). Samples were centrifugated, DNAse treated, PEG concentrated, and phage sized DNA bands were detected on agarose gels. DNA was extracted from samples with phage sized bands (n = 859) and DNA concentrations >2 ng/µL were chosen for sequencing based on condition and bacterial cluster (n = 452), 19 of which failed library preparation. Second, a subset of isolates (n = 32) were induced in DMEM media with or without sonicated or intact human colonic epithelial cells (Caco2) and DNA was extracted (n = 96), 3 of which failed library preparation. Prophages were predicted using Virsorter, Vibrant and VirFinder (n = 1972) and predictions >50% complete were trimmed for bacterial flanking regions (n = 736). Prophage reads (n = 526) were aligned to host genome and predictions with >2-fold coverage and Cohen's D > 0.7 or mean zscore >3.5 were retained. Further, reads were investigated for induction using HafeZ. De novo assembly using MetaViralSpades was used to resolve predictions spanning host contigs. Predictions were dereplicated at 99% ANI and 85% AF retaining the longest representative with at least one viral hallmark gene. b, Phylogenetic tree of bacterial isolates with heatmap depicting sequenced phage-enriched samples (shown in blue); Actinomycetota yellow (20/409), Fusobacteriota black (6/8), Bacillota blue (37/414), Pseudomonadota red (216/498) and Bacteroidota teal (247/786). c, Schematic of the synthetic community inductions. Isolates (n = 78) were co-cultured with or without Caco2 cell monolayer for 24, 48 and 72 h. Host abundance was calculated on total metagenome DNA using read mapping. Prophage induction was detected in phage enriched DNA at species level using read mapping as well as on individual prophage using KrakenUnique.

a, Annotated genome maps of the eight Hankyvirus genus phages species. Genomes are scaled by length with the ruler displayed at the bottom of the figure. Genes coloured by PHROG categories and unknown genes coloured in grey. DGR template and variable repeats denoted with black lines. b, Host range of Hankyvirus and LoVEphage species induced in this study. Light green denotes hosts found in NCBI RefSeq bacterial genome database; dark green denotes hosts in which the phage was actively induced in this study.

a, Gene sharing network between induced prophage species (solid circles, n = 68) and database representatives (9920). Representatives in translucence and coloured by host phyla when applicable otherwise in grey, except Crassvirales genomes from Yutin et al. 2021 which are highlighted with solid black boarded grey circles31. b, Mean fractional abundance and prevalence of Caudoviricetes phages within gut viromes (1241) shown as in Fig. 2b, but highlighting Crassvirales genomes in large solid grey circles. c, Annotated genome maps of four phage species encoding a second variable repeat (VR) distal from the RT cassette. Genes coloured by PHROG categories and unknown genes in grey. DGR template and variable repeats denoted with black lines.

a, Length distribution of all predicted prophages in this study separated by host phyla. Fusobacteriota excluded as only single isolate. A bimodal length distribution was observed for all phyla, with an initial peak at around 8 kb followed by a second peak at around 37 kb. b, Frequency of PHROG gene categories across induced (green, n = 134), high quality (> 50% completeness, orange, n = 736) and low quality (< 50% completeness, blue, n = 1236) predictions. Significant p values calculated using Fisher's exact test (two sided) and adjusted by Hochberg method shown above bars. c, Host ANI comparisons of induced to induced (n = 222) and induced to non-induced (n = 231) isolates with high similarity prophage pairs. Comparisons coloured by genus and shape based on NCBI taxon. Host pairs with less than 80% similarity grouped separately as too divergent for reliable ANI score. d, Density of ANI comparisons of all isolates within the dataset separated by phyla, coloured as in panel a. e, PCR amplification with phage specific primers surrounding the targeted gene (DNA transposition protein), visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis (single experiment) alongside GeneRuler 1 kb DNA ladder, showing deletion of a ~ 900 bp fragment in øPomma ∆tran mutant (gene product size, 915 bp).

A fundamental goal in modern biology and precision medicine is to acquire rich, multi-omics-style information from cells, including transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolic and electrophysiological data, in real time and at single-cell resolution. However, current techniques often rely on destructive endpoint assays that require cell lysis, losing spatial, temporal and dynamic context. Nanoscale sensors offer a transformative solution by enabling minimally invasive, continuous monitoring of intracellular activities. Here we propose a spatial classification of intracellular sensing technologies—near cell, on cell and in cell—and use this framework to evaluate the sensing modalities on the basis of their invasiveness, signal fidelity and resolution. We highlight emerging sensor platforms that are capable of detecting ions, metabolites, electrical signals and mechanical changes, as well as artificial intelligence-driven strategies for decoding complex cellular data streams. We further consider the integration of these nanosensors into three-dimensional, physiologically relevant models such as organoids to create ‘smart organoids' that report on their internal state autonomously and in real time. Finally, we discuss the major challenges in achieving intelligent intracellular sensing, including issues of sensor miniaturization, biocompatibility, multiplexing and three-dimensional integration. Together, these advances set the stage for a new era of dynamic, high-resolution cell profiling that can accelerate drug discovery, disease modelling and personalized medicine.

A new study from MIT suggests the biggest and most computationally intensive AI models may soon offer diminishing returns compared to smaller models. By mapping scaling laws against continued improvements in model efficiency, the researchers found that it could become harder to wring leaps in performance from giant models whereas efficiency gains could make models running on more modest hardware increasingly capable over the next decade.

“In the next five to 10 years, things are very likely to start narrowing,” says Neil Thompson, a computer scientist and professor at MIT involved in the study.

Leaps in efficiency, like those seen with DeepSeek's remarkably low-cost model in January, have already served as a reality check for the AI industry, which is accustomed to burning massive amounts of compute.

As things stand, a frontier model from a company like OpenAI is currently much better than a model trained with a fraction of the compute from an academic lab. While the MIT team's prediction might not hold if, for example, new training methods like reinforcement learning produce surprising new results, they suggest that big AI firms will have less of an edge in the future.

Hans Gundlach, a research scientist at MIT who led the analysis, became interested in the issue due to the unwieldy nature of running cutting edge models. Together with Thompson and Jayson Lynch, another research scientist at MIT, he mapped out the future performance of frontier models compared to those built with more modest computational means. Gundlach says the predicted trend is especially pronounced for the reasoning models that are now in vogue, which rely more on extra computation during inference.

Thompson says the results show the value of honing an algorithm as well as scaling up compute. “If you are spending a lot of money training these models, then you should absolutely be spending some of it trying to develop more efficient algorithms, because that can matter hugely,” he adds.

The study is particularly interesting given today's AI infrastructure boom (or should we say “bubble”?)—which shows little sign of slowing down.

OpenAI and other US tech firms have signed hundred-billion-dollar deals to build AI infrastructure in the United States. “The world needs much more compute,” OpenAI's president, Greg Brockman, proclaimed this week as he announced a partnership between OpenAI and Broadcom for custom AI chips.

A growing number of experts are questioning the soundness of these deals. Roughly 60 percent of the cost of building a data center goes toward GPUs, which tend to depreciate quickly. Partnerships between the major players also appear circular and opaque.

Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan, is the latest big name in finance to issue a warning, telling the BBC last week. “The level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds.”

The AI infrastructure gold rush is not entirely about building more capable models. OpenAI is effectively betting that demand for new generative AI tools will grow exponentially. The company may also be looking to decrease its dependence on Microsoft and Nvidia and turn its massive $500 billion valuation into infrastructure that it can design and customize.

Even so, it would seem prudent for the industry to use analysis like the one debuted from MIT to explore how algorithms and hardware may evolve in the next few years.

The building boom now propping up much of the US economy may also have consequences for American innovation. By investing so heavily in GPUs and other chips specialized for deep learning, AI companies might miss new opportunities that could come from exploring ideas from the fringes of academia, like alternatives to deep learning, novel chip designs, and even approaches like quantum computing. That is, after all, where today's AI breakthroughs came from.

Without much fanfare, Apple has unveiled three new flagship products today via a press release—no special event, no prerecorded show. That might be because the new iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and Vision Pro don't change the mold—they're identical to their predecessors—but internally, they're debuting Apple's highly anticipated M5 chip.

All of the devices are available for preorder today and go on sale October 22. Here's everything you need to know.

The M5 processor is the heart of the announcements today, as it powers all the new Apple hardware. It's built on the 3-nanometer process, with a 10-core GPU and a neural accelerator in each core, which Apple claims improves performance in GPU-based AI workloads and provides four times the peak GPU compute performance over the M4 chip.

Graphics performance in general is 30 percent higher than the M4, and the 10-core CPU offers 15 percent faster multithreaded performance. (Apple claims this is the “world's fastest CPU core.”) The 16-core Neural Engine has also been enhanced, which should mean Apple Intelligence and other AI tasks (like transforming a 2D photo to a spatial scene) should be faster. Apple says there's a 30 percent increase in unified memory bandwidth, allowing larger AI models to run on the device, but it also helps deliver better performance for the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine.

It has been roughly a year and a half since the debut of the M4-powered iPad Pro, but the new M5 iPad Pro tablets don't change much outside of the processor. You still have two sizes to choose from: 11 or 13 inches. Both of them feature fast charging—you can get 50 percent in 30 minutes when using a compatible charger—though annoyingly, Apple only includes a 20-watt USB-C power adapter in the box.

Both feature Apple's N1 networking chip that debuted in the iPhone 17, which includes Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread. Also in tow is the C1X 5G modem from the iPhone Air for 50 percent faster cellular performance and 30 percent less power usage than the M4 iPad Pro. Over its predecessor, you'll see a 3.5X boost in AI performance, 1.5X faster 3D rendering with ray tracing, up to 1.2X faster video transcode performance in Final Cut Pro, and 2.3X faster AI video upscaling performance in DaVinci Resolve. The 256- and 512-GB models use 12 GB of unified memory now, twice as much as before, and the faster memory bandwidth means everything gets a speed boost.

Many of the other specs are the same. They're just as thin as before, feature Apple's Tandem OLED display technology, and can hit 1,600 nits at peak brightness. You still get the nano-textured glass upgrade if you want to reduce glare on the screen. Speaking of the screen, Apple says there's a new capability for these iPads to drive external displays at up to 120 Hz; if you already have a 120-Hz screen, a new Adaptive Sync feature will ensure the lowest possible latency between iPad and monitor.

As before, the 11-inch iPad Pro costs $999, and the 13-inch iPad Pro starts at $1,299. They're compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro, Apple Pencil USB-C, Magic Keyboard, and Smart Folio.

Interestingly, Apple did not completely revamp its MacBook Pro lineup with the M5 chip. Instead, there's just one new model: a 14-inch MacBook Pro with four storage options (512 GB, 1 TB, 2 TB, or 4 TB) and three unified memory options (16, 24, or 32 GB). The base version starts at $1,599, like before, but if you max out all of the upgrades, it can cost as much as $3,369. We'll likely see M5 Pro and M5 Max chip options in 2026 alongside a 16-inch MacBook Pro.

You'll see similar speed increases like on the iPad Pro M5—3.5X faster AI performance, 1.6X faster graphics over the prior M4-powered MacBook Pro, and 2X faster SSD performance. Otherwise, this is the same 14-inch MacBook as before, with the claimed “24-hour” battery life, mini-LED display with the nano-texture glass option, a six-speaker system, and a 12-MP webcam. There are three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI, an SDXC slot, a headphone jack, and the MagSafe charging port.

Widely regarded as a miss with consumers, Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset is back but with no major changes to the hardware. Well, there's a new head strap: the Dual Knit Band. It's included in the box, and Apple says it's soft and cushioned, allowing for a comfier fit. The headset is now powered by the M5 chip, which enables faster performance, sharper details throughout visionOS 26, and better battery life. Specifically, Apple says the M5 renders 10 percent more pixels on the micro-OLED displays than before, and the refresh rate can also jump up to 120 Hz.

Battery life is now two and a half hours of general use, as opposed to just two hours on the original Vision Pro. That extends to three hours with video playback.

Unfortunately, the price remains firm at $3,499. It's arriving right before Samsung is expected to unveil its Android XR mixed-reality headset, Project Moohan, which will hopefully come with a lower price tag.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Federal Workers Are Being Used as Pawns in the Shutdown","https://www.wired.com/story/federal-workers-are-being-used-as-pawns-in-the-shutdown/","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

Federal workers have grown accustomed to a specific kind of dread over the past year. 2025 has been nonstop: First came the “fork” email from Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, followed quickly by numerous layoffs from the Trump administration.

As of July, more than 150,000 federal workers had resigned from their roles since president Donald Trump took office for the second time, according to The Washington Post. Tens of thousands were also fired.

For the past few months, it seemed like this bloodletting was over—but that all changed on Friday.

Thousands of employees at eight government agencies were subjected to RIFs, or reductions in force—the government's formal process of laying off federal workers. According to a court filing from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on Friday, this latest round of firings has affected more than 4,000 federal employees. The court filing also claimed that the administration targeted the Treasury and the Department of Health and Human Services the hardest, hacking away at a combined 2,500 jobs across the two agencies and the entire Washington, DC, office of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Department of Education culled nearly its entire team handling special education, CNN reported on Tuesday. At the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, cuts ranged from a few dozen to several hundred jobs, according to the same filing.

“People are scared. Who says their goal is to traumatize people?” says one IRS worker, referencing private speeches given by Russell Vought, the head of OMB and a key architect of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 who has been the public face of the job-cutting. ”If any normal human said ‘My goal is to traumatize families' there should be police at that person's doorstep.”

“It's pretty demoralizing,” a Food and Drug Administration employee tells WIRED. “It's clear this admin will act illegally to try to make agencies or offices they don't like suffer more.” (The Trump administration has used government resources, like websites, to place blame on Democrats for the shutdown in what critics claim is a violation of the Hatch Act, a law forbidding the use of public assets for political messaging.)

“Every day is an adventure: new EOs, new memos,” says one Department of Homeland Security worker. “It's constantly being on watch on where to pivot and what to stop, start, and sustain.” (All of these employees have been granted anonymity so they can speak candidly about their experiences.)

Instead of the haphazard cuts led by DOGE this spring, we've entered a new phase of targeted cuts orchestrated by the Trump administration to reorient the government away from what the president calls “Democrat” priorities.

These RIFs appear to be spelling out a quiet rewrite of the administrative state. The cuts targeted offices and programs focused on public health, housing grants and homelessness programs, special education programs, and environmental cleanup, CNN reported on Tuesday. At the IRS, tech workers were affected, and the cuts “will absolutely impact critical modernization projects we were planning,” one IRS source tells me.

“The majority of our members are working-class people. They don't own summer homes,” AFGE Local 2883 president Yolanda Jacobs said in a press call on Wednesday. “Many of them live paycheck to paycheck. These reckless actions are disrupting and destroying the lives of everyday working people who are constantly being used as bargaining chips.”

Any pretense that these cuts were simply about budget discipline has disappeared. In the weeks since the shutdown began, the administration has hijacked government websites, worker email signatures, and airport TV screens to blame Democrats for possible cuts in an attempt to rebrand them as accountability rather than retribution. In an exhibit attached to that court filing, the OMB emailed agencies to prepare for RIFs, focusing on areas where funding had lapsed on projects that were “not consistent with the President's priorities.”

But President Trump put it more bluntly, speaking with reporters on Friday: “It'll be Democrat-oriented because we figure, you know, they started this thing,” he said. “So they should be Democrat-oriented. It'll be a lot.”

The filing claims that other RIF plans could still be ongoing, “but those assessments remain under deliberation and are not final.”

The White House declined to comment, directing WIRED to OMB. OMB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“OMB is making every preparation to batten down the hatches and ride out the Democrats' intransigence,” the agency wrote on X Wednesday morning. “Pay the troops, pay law enforcement, continue the RIFs, and wait.” (OMB doesn't pay military members. Congress does.)

Vought's goal doesn't seem to be just to define what it is the government is allowed to do, but to strike enough fear into workers to keep them from challenging that definition. By the end of September, when a government shutdown began to seem inevitable, federal employees I had never spoken to before were reaching out to me on LinkedIn and via Signal for some kind of clarity on whether they'd still have a job in the coming weeks, hoping that I had information that hasn't been published regarding whether their agency or department would be on the chopping block.

“I just need a sanity check … are they going to RIF all federal employees if they don't have an agreement?” one federal worker messaged me, asking about a potential shutdown in late September. “If I'm furloughed I won't get back pay?” they said in a second message two weeks later.

The Trump administration continues to insist that these RIFs are about making the government more efficient by trimming bloat, but to federal workers, it feels more like an agonizing game they never agreed to play.

“So tired of being used as a pawn,” one IRS source says. “Is WIRED hiring?”

A handheld Xbox has been rumored since at least the Xbox 360 era, where gaming forums were rife with speculation that Microsoft was about to face off against Nintendo's DS and Sony's PSP. If there was ever anything to the rumor, nothing came of it—until now, 20-odd years later, with Xbox's first genuine foray into portable gaming.

The Redmond giant isn't diving in solo, though—rather than its own dedicated device, Microsoft has partnered with Asus to deliver two distinct units, the entry-grade ROG Xbox Ally at $600, and the more powerful ROG Xbox Ally X at a somewhat staggering $1,000. These aren't so much Xbox handhelds as Xbox-branded handhelds, though, adding recognizable iconography onto what might otherwise be the next generation of Asus' own portables. The team-up delivers top-tier portable play—but a frequently confusing experience.

It's best to start with what the X-ROGs—not official terminology, but good shorthand for the pair—aren't. They're not Microsoft's answer to the Nintendo Switch 2, a bespoke console letting you seamlessly enjoy home-quality gaming on the go. Nor are they a take on the Steam Deck, a portable built around the Xbox ecosystem rather than your Steam library. Despite sporting the same signature “X” icon button as on an Xbox controller, these are handheld gaming PCs in Xbox drag, with all the good and bad that entails.

Both X-ROGs run a full version of Windows 11, with the Xbox app for PC's new “full screen experience” as the default user interface. Because these are PCs at heart, though, even if you're using the same Xbox account as on your Xbox Series X or Series S, your game library on the X-ROGs will only show titles included in the Xbox Play Anywhere program. Since you can only figure out what's not available by their absence, you may find a game you fancied playing on the go isn't an option. Along with the difference in how the library is sorted and filtered, it's not the smoothest transition for console players.

The overall UI also feels more cluttered than a handheld should, with a home screen that shows your recently played games above a bunch of “Featured” offers, a row of titles recently added to Game Pass, and more. It's a far cry from the stark, minimalist elegance of the Switch 2, highlighting how much is left to be desired in optimizing the Xbox for the handheld form.

Unfortunately, Microsoft is also crow-barring AI features in, with a new Gaming Copilot assistant (also coming to the desktop PC Xbox app). It's pitched as “your personal gaming sidekick,” recognizing what's happening onscreen and responding to voice inquiries for help on parts you're stuck on. It speaks in one of four “personalities,” including a cringey “heroic”—it's detestable, but thankfully optional, so I quickly deactivated.

Running Windows under the Xbox hood also means frustrations when it comes to software updates—is it just the Xbox app that needs an update or the whole system? Should you go through the Windows App store or the Windows Update tool? Will a future system update break your games? It's all a lot more convoluted than simply turning a console on and playing a game. And, while you can swap to a full Windows desktop view at any time—and even connect a mouse if you don't fancy battling through Windows' endless menus and submenus with the X-ROGs' thumbsticks or touchscreens—finding exactly what setting may need fiddling with when you just want to play a game can be a chore.

However, because the X-ROGs are fundamentally regular PCs, they're a lot more versatile than Nintendo's or Valve's efforts. Not only can you play media, browse, or do anything else you might do on a PC (even Office tasks, if you hate joy), but you can install any other PC gaming client—Steam, Epic, GOG, and more are all available. Better still, the Xbox app aggregates all games installed on the system into one library view, regardless of where they originate. You can even turn your ROG Xbox into an ersatz Steam Deck by running Steam in Big Picture mode (although some of its controller key bindings may not work).

The big win—pardon the pun—is that you can install mods with ease. While I've gotten a few mods running on my Steam Deck over the years, its Linux underbelly makes things trickier. On the X-ROGs, I've been able to use mods as easily as on my main gaming desktop, with no second-guessing if they'll actually work. It's a great feature that's facilitated by having standard Windows as the base.

But wait, there's a third UI player in the mix: Asus' own Armoury Crate SE software. Broadly, this is more of a device manager, with a dedicated button on both consoles to bring up a Command Center quick menu. This allows you to instantly switch power profiles, create custom control inputs, or set frame rate limits. It also offers a real-time monitor displaying useful system information like temperature, CPU and GPU performance, battery level and power drain, and the current frame rate.

However, fully open Armoury Crate and you'll find an array of far deeper controls, from granular system settings to tweaking color profiles of the LED rings that sit under each thumbstick. It also has its own Update Center—yet another to check—and its own unified library, distinct from the Xbox app's. After a week with the X-ROGs, I'm finally familiar with where functions live, but the learning curve is steep, and having essentially three central interfaces—Xbox, Windows, Armoury Crate—for a single device is ridiculous.

On this at least, the X-ROGs are no different from Asus' original ROG Ally or 2024's ROG Ally X, or even other Windows-based gaming handhelds, such as the Lenovo Legion S Go. Hopping between multiple UIs doing variations of the same thing has become a kind of jank that feels baked into the entire product category. If you're accustomed to that, you'll feel right at home with the X-ROGs, with all their foibles.

However, the Xbox branding here is likely to attract players who, while perhaps more committed than “casual” gamers, still want a slick, pick-up-and-play experience from a handheld. If you stick purely to the Xbox app, the X-ROGs can be close to that, but the more you want to get out of them, the less intuitive they are.

That's a lot to get your head around before getting started, but mercifully, it's worth it. Both the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X are significant improvements on Asus' predecessors. In fact, these might be two of the best handheld gaming PCs I've ever used—although the use case for each ends up being quite different.

At a glance, the X-ROGs might seem separated only by colorways. The ROG Xbox Ally comes in white with multi-colored A/B/X/Y face buttons, while the ROG Xbox Ally X opts for all-black with gray buttons. Both use the same 290.8 x 121.5 x 50.7-millimeter form factor, each subtly decorated with near-microscopic “XBOX ROG” lettering cascading vertically down the shell like The Matrix code. They look and feel distinctly premium, as you'd expect given their prices.

Ergonomics are superb, with angular grips feeling more like holding a conventional Xbox controller than the brick-with-a-screen of many handheld PCs. All inputs are within reach, from the traditionally asymmetrical thumbsticks to the textured shoulder buttons and satisfyingly chunky triggers. At the rear sit two macro buttons with customizable inputs. Despite being nominally heavier than a Steam Deck's 669 grams—the Xbox ROG Ally weighs in at 670 grams, the Ally X at 715 grams—the masterful design means they sit better in the hand and are more comfortable to use for long play periods.

Both models also use the same screen, a 7-inch, 1920 x 1080p, 16:9 IPS touchscreen panel with a 120-Hz refresh rate and 500-nit brightness. Buyers will want to get a screen protector—it's made of Gorilla Glass Victus, but given how often you'll poke or swipe the screen to navigate the system, added protection feels necessary. When it's not covered in finger smudges, this is a great, sharp display at its default settings, and its performance can be further tweaked in Armoury Crate, either manually or with quick-sets tailored to specific gaming genres.

However, at the prices these handhelds are coming in at, it's hard not to feel a bit shortchanged that the screen isn't OLED, even on the higher-priced ROG Xbox Ally X. These are essentially the same screens as on Asus' previous ROG Ally, and despite both X-ROGs offering a higher resolution and refresh rate, the Steam Deck OLED‘s perfect black levels and ability to deliver HDR does still give it a slight edge.

The X-ROGs more clearly diverge in function. Some differences are small—the Ally's triggers incorporate Hall effect tech, while the Ally X uses Microsoft's Impulse Triggers for more nuanced haptics. Both feature two USB-C ports at the top—and you can charge through either—but the Ally's are both USB 3.2 Gen 2 (with DisplayPort 1.4 output and Power Delivery 3.0 support), while the Ally X has one USB 4 port with Thunderbolt 4 compatibility, and one USB 3.2 Gen 2 (both with DisplayPort 2.1 out), giving more versatility.

Major distinctions come down to raw power. The Ally packs in an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor, 16 GB LPDDR5-6400 RAM, and a 512-GB SSD—no slouch, but wildly outclassed by the Ally X. The flagship model's Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme chip is an absolute beast, and it's backed up by 24 GB LPDDR5X-8000 RAM and a 1-TB SSD. The resulting difference is clear to see, both in performance and who each handheld is aimed at.

Installing Forza Horizon 5 on both, the Ally impressed initially, still meeting requirements for the game's “High” quality preset. However, the game automatically set the frame rate cap to 30 fps, while a buried setting within the Xbox app for the Ally itself (absent on the Ally X) was set to “automatically limit games to 720p” resolution. Turning that off and raising the frame rate to the 120 fps the Ally is hypothetically capable of, performance dived, resulting in slightly juddery races around Mexico. Plugging the Ally in, maxing its power profile to the 20-watt “Turbo” setting in Armoury Crate, and boosting just about every other possible metric improved things, reaching a high of 48 fps—eminently playable, but nothing amazing.

On the Ally X, however, Forza ran at a smooth 60 fps straight away, off battery. Again, lifting the frame cap to 120 fps, even the Ally X never quite hit that magic number, but it did hover around 78 to 85 fps, while plugging in and setting the console to its 25-watt Turbo max saw it occasionally crest over 90 fps. Similar performance differentials were observed on other demanding AAA games installed on each handheld, including Gears of War: Reloaded, Avowed, and Halo Infinite—the Ally struggled while the Ally X handled everything I threw at it.

The basic Ally can shine with less technologically demanding games, though. Hollow Knight: Silksong hits a consistent 120 fps, while some retro classics and indies installed via Steam—Final Fantasy IX, Dredge, and Owlboy among them—all ran without a hitch. Much like the Steam Deck itself, the Ally feels best suited to these smaller titles, which also have the benefit of not eating up the entire SSD. Forza alone required a full quarter of the Ally's storage, colossal install sizes being another reminder of a lack of optimization. Both X-ROGs use standard M.2 2280 factor SSDs, though, so they should be easily upgradable, and both support microSD cards too—again better for smaller, less demanding games to be installed on.

There's one other workaround for performance throttles or storage issues, though: cloud gaming, which is surprisingly well implemented here. Testing out Bethesda's DOOM: The Dark Ages through Xbox Cloud Gaming (other platforms such as Nvidia's GeForce Now are also accessible), it connected quickly, played without a single drop-out, and ran at a consistent 60 fps on both X-ROGs. I don't know what witchcraft Xbox has been doing backstage, but this is the best cloud gaming I've ever encountered.

Whatever and however you're playing, battery life is impressive for both X-ROGs. Even though the Ally X again has an advantage—packing an 80-Wh battery versus the Ally's 60-Wh—I regularly got around six hours' play out of both units between charges, depending on the game. Playing an hour of Hollow Knight: Silksong—again, not the most demanding title—on each took the Ally from full to 85 percent, while the Ally X dropped to 88 percent. Cloud gaming saw barely any drain on either, about 7 percent per hour, but locally installed Forza or Gears slurped up around 30 to 35 percent of a full charge on both X-ROGs in around 45 minutes. Even that's far less draining than I expected, rendering both units surprisingly viable for longer play.

Both X-ROGs stand out in the increasingly crowded field of handheld gaming PCs, thanks to strong design, comfort of use, and cross-platform versatility that outpace most of the competition. Neither model is perfect, but for its first venture into the handheld space, Microsoft gets a lot right in its partnership with Asus.

If you want a reasonably powerful gaming PC that can run small to mid-size games with ease, and even some more demanding ones in a playable if not astounding state, the ROG Xbox Ally is a great choice—especially if you're happy to turn to cloud gaming for the most demanding titles.

If you want uncompromising performance and high-end capabilities, though, the ROG Xbox Ally X is a clear winner. It breezes through everything the baseline Ally does, and delivers authentic AAA gaming to boot. It's exceptional. In doing so, it's clearly, unabashedly targeting the “hardcore” gamer—and it's going to financially bleed them for the privilege.

Those prices are by far the biggest obstacle for either model, but if you're able to splash out on a high-end handheld, these can take portable gaming to the next level.

Autumn Gardiner thought updating her driving license would be straightforward. After getting married last year, she headed to the local Department of Motor Vehicles office in Connecticut to get her name changed on her license. While she was there, Gardiner recalls, officials said she needed to update her photo. That's when things started to go wrong.

Every time staff tried to take her photo, Gardiner says, the system would reject it. “Everyone's watching. They're taking more photos,” she recalls. Gardiner, who works as a grant manager for an environmental conservation charity, is one of a small number of people globally who live with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome. Sometimes known as Whistling Face syndrome, the genetic condition impacts muscles around the face and skull, which can result in an undersized mouth.

As more staff members at the DMV were called to help, Gardiner says she started to believe the rejected photos were being caused by her facial difference. The camera system didn't seem to work for her, she says. “It was humiliating and weird. Here's this machine telling me that I don't have a human face,” Gardiner says.

Gardiner isn't alone. Around half a dozen people living with a variety of facial differences—from birthmarks to craniofacial conditions—tell WIRED they are increasingly struggling to participate in modern life as identity verification software, which often is powered by machine learning, is quickly becoming commonplace.

Some of those living with facial differences tell WIRED they have undergone multiple surgeries and experienced stigma for their entire lives, which is now being echoed by the technology they are forced to interact with. They say they haven't been able to access public services due to facial verification services failing, while others have struggled to access financial services. Social media filters and face-unlocking systems on phones often won't work, they say.

“The facial difference community is constantly overlooked,” says Phyllida Swift, the CEO of Face Equality International (FEI), an umbrella group representing other facial difference and disfigurement charities and organizations. There are more than 100 million people worldwide who live with facial disfigurements, FEI estimates. People with facial differences have experienced problems with airport passport gates, photo apps, social media video filters, background blurring on video calls, and more, according to FEI's research. “In many countries, facial recognition is increasingly a part of everyday life, but this technology is failing our community,” Nikki Lilly, a patron for FEI, told a United Nations meeting in March.

From phones to hotel rooms, your face increasingly acts as a digital key. Over the past decade, rapid machine learning and AI advancements have led to the creation of a range of face recognition technologies—meaning that more than ever before, your appearance can be used as a digital identifier. Police have widely deployed face recognition systems, which have frequently been found to be inaccurate and biased against Asian and Black people, while the wider world of face checking has seen government services, anti-fraud systems, and financial institutions using AI to complete identity checks. Most recently, social media and porn websites have adopted face scanning as part of age verification measures.

These “authentication” face checks can take multiple forms. Selfies can be automatically compared to existing ID documents; while liveness tests can require you to take a short video to show you are real—not a fraudster holding a printed photo to the camera. Broadly speaking, these biometric systems often measure your facial features—such as the distance between your eyes, or the size of your jaw—to create “faceprints.” While these kinds of surveillance technologies may be effective for a lot of people, they may not be able to detect people with facial differences. The underlying machine learning technology may not be trained on datasets with a variety of faces, for example.

“The case of Face Equality International—of people who have different faces—is a really important canary in the coal mine of what can go wrong when these systems don't work,” says Greta Byrum, the founder of technology consultancy firm Present Moment Enterprises, which focuses on the social impact of technologic systems and has provided some pro bono work to FEI. “We're seeing facial recognition technologies becoming one of those hammers to which everything looks like a nail,” Byrum says.

“I would like to see people realize that not everyone looks the same, from basic skin tone to facial features to the standard facial appearance,” says Crystal Hodges, a speaker and writer who lives with Sturge-Weber syndrome and has a purple “port wine stain” across part of her face. “People's facial symmetry may not be the same. Other people have different facial features that you don't always see every day, but they exist.”

Hodges, who lives in Arizona, says that last year she and her husband were trying to get their credit scores from a large credit reporting agency when its face verification service wouldn't work for her. “​​I tried five to eight times,” she says. Towards winter, Hodges says, the birthmark will become darker. “We were trying a different ring light, we were trying calmer lighting, and it would not accept. My husband had a beard, and it accepted his.” Hodges says she recently tried the same system again, and while it worked this time, she still never got her credit score.

“If you don't include people with disabilities or people with facial differences in the development of these processes, no one's going to think of these issues,” says Kathleen Bogart, a psychology professor at Oregon State University who specializes in disability research and lives with a facial difference. “AI has amplified these issues, but it's rooted in long-standing underrepresentation and prejudice towards people with facial differences that occurred long before AI was a thing.”

When face verification systems fail, it's often hard to find help—piling more pressure on a stressful situation. For months, Maryland resident Noor Al-Khaled has struggled to create an online account with the Social Security Administration. Al-Khaled, who lives with the rare cranio-facial condition Ablepheron Macrostomia, says having an online account would allow her to easily access SSA records and quickly send documents to the agency.

“I don't drive because of my vision; I should be able to rely on the site,” Al-Khaled says. “You have to take a selfie, and the pictures have to match,” Al-Khaled says. “Because of the facial difference, I don't know if it's not recognizing the ID or the selfie, but it's always saying images don't match.”

Not having that access makes life harder. “On an emotional level, it just makes me feel shut out from society,” she explains. Al-Khaled says that all services should provide alternative ways for people to access online systems. “The lack of other fallback options means that sometimes people get trapped in these labyrinths of technological systems,” says Byrum from Present Moment Enterprises.

An SSA spokesperson says alternative options to face verification are available, and it is “committed” to making its services accessible to everyone. The agency, the spokesperson says, does not run facial recognition systems itself but uses Login.gov and ID.me for verification services. The General Services Administration, which runs Login.gov, did not respond to WIRED's request for comment. “Accessibility is a core priority for ID.me,” a spokesperson for ID.me says, adding it has previously helped people with facial differences and offered to directly help Al-Khaled after WIRED was in touch.

“There are few things more dehumanizing than being told by a machine that you're not real because of your face,” says Corey R. Taylor, a New York–based actor and motivational speaker who lives with a craniofacial anomaly. Last year, Taylor says, he was using a financial app to access a small amount of money; as he tried to complete the payment processes, he found that the face verification system could not match his selfie to the image on his ID. To get the system to work, he had to move into different positions. “I had to literally raise my eyes and contort my face,” Taylor says. When he emailed the company, he got what appeared to be a boilerplate response.

“One of the main things that we are advocating for is alternative methods,” says Hannah Saunders, the head of policy and education at FEI. “There's possibly a long-term fix in terms of changing the technology, but at the moment, we're most concerned that people can apply for jobs, they can access their money, they can get through passport control with their family, and that negotiating those kinds of systems isn't as stressful as it is.”

Swift, the CEO at FEI, says the organization has been “approached” multiple times to work with businesses to address some of the issues but has not yet been able to sort out any formal arrangements. Swift says FEI wants to put the “right systems and safeguards in place” to protect its members. Also, Swift adds, “we get the sense that this is quite low down on the list of priorities [of tech companies], and therefore progress is seemingly slow.”

However, the problems extend beyond emerging technologies. Many of the people WIRED spoke to explained that they often face appearance-based bullying online, and the internet's wider pivot to short-form video content like TikTok and Instagram Reels leaves them feeling isolated. “The internet, for so long, was a safe haven for me,” Al-Khaled says. “I found my home and solace online because it was the only place where I could meet people and actually be myself without being stared at or gawked at.” Hodges says people have previously said to her that they are shocked that she can leave her house. “I feel like that's kind of transferred now to: ‘I can't believe you leave your house, and I can't believe you go online,'” she says.

At the DMV in Connecticut last year, Gardiner says that staff were able to manually override the photography system, although she did explain her facial difference to them in the process. She received her replacement temporary license that day and full license later in the mail. “I've dealt with a lot of shit when it comes to my face, but after I left, I just cried,” Gardiner recalls. “It was kind of like a reminder that yes, I'm different and I don't fit in.”

After leaving, Gardiner messaged a state representative she knew and told her about the experience, according to messages shared with WIRED. The official got in touch with the local DMV commissioner and discussed the issue plus staff training, they say.

“While we adhere to stringent guidelines to guarantee photo compliance, our employees approach their roles with empathy, ensuring they understand and address the needs of those they serve,” a DMV CT spokesperson says. “We want our residents to have professional interactions with the DMV.” A spokesperson for Idemia, which provides the DMV with technology, says it regularly offers staff training, and its algorithms have been ranked highly in external evaluations.

Gardiner says that while there was ultimately a positive response, she has heard stories of people with facial differences running into problems at the DMV in other states. “I really want to try to pressure for better protocols: What do humans do when the AI doesn't work?” she says. But with face recognition systems being used so broadly, the problem can seem insurmountable. “After that whole DMV experience, I then had to get my passport done,” Gardiner says, “and I ran into the same problem with my passport photo.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Waymo's Robotaxis Are Coming to London","https://www.wired.com/story/waymos-robotaxis-are-coming-to-london/","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Waymo is expanding to London, the self-driving vehicle developer announced on Wednesday. The Google sister company aims to start service next year, when the UK government plans to allow autonomous vehicles to begin operating on its roads in limited pilot programs. Waymo says it's working with the government to receive the necessary permissions for its launch.

This is only Waymo's second venture outside the United States—though could be its first international robotaxi service. The company has been testing robotaxis in Tokyo since April, where it works with Japanese taxi company Nihon Kotsu, whose drivers are helping Waymo map and collect driving data from the city, and Japanese ride-hail firm GO. However, the company won't say when it plans to launch autonomous taxis in Japan.

London could prove the company's biggest challenge yet. Unlike more car-oriented cities in the US, London's streets are more winding and narrow, the city's layout a legacy of its pre-Roman and medieval history. “We will take the same rigorous approach to testing and deploying in London as we have in other cities before offering rides to the public,” Waymo spokesperson Ethan Teicher wrote in an email. He says Waymo's experience in Tokyo will help its software drive in London.

Waymo operates paid taxi service in five US cities: Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta. (It operates the latter two services through the Uber app.) It has announced plans to launch in Dallas, Miami, Nashville, and Washington, DC, next year. It has also received a permit to test autonomous vehicles in New York City, though it must do so with a safety driver behind the wheel. The company says it has provided more than 10 million paid rides since it picked up its first customers in 2020.

Waymo's move follows the UK government's announcement this spring that it would accelerate by more than a year its plans to allow autonomous vehicle tech on public roads. The government now aims to begin permitting robotaxis to operate in small numbers starting in 2026.

Government officials intend to spend about a year studying the data those vehicles produce before allowing companies to more widely launch driverless taxi services in the second half of 2027. Homegrown British autonomous vehicle developer Wayve has already announced it will work with Uber to operate robotaxis in London.

UK secretary of state for transport Heidi Alexander said in a statement that she was “delighted” about Waymo's plans. “Boosting the [autonomous vehicle] sector will increase accessible transport options alongside bringing jobs, investment, and opportunities to the UK,” she said.

Waymo says it will work with fleet-operations firm Moove to run an eventual London fleet. Moove will help manage and dispatch Waymo's electric ride-hail vehicles, and will maintain and operate the service's maintenance and charging depots. Moove is also working with Waymo in Phoenix, and eventually, Miami.

Cybersecurity and networking company F5 disclosed that a “highly sophisticated” nation-state threat actor infiltrated its internal systems this summer, stealing portions of the company's BIG-IP source code and details about software vulnerabilities.

The Seattle-based company disclosed the incident Wednesday in an SEC filing and a customer memo, saying the attacker maintained “long-term, persistent access” to some of its product development and engineering systems before the breach was contained.

F5 said it learned of the intrusion on Aug. 9, and that the U.S. Department of Justice authorized a delay in public disclosure. The company said it believes its containment efforts have been successful and that it has seen no new unauthorized activity.

F5 shares were down more than 3% in early trading Wednesday.

Some of the breached files contained configuration details for a small percentage of customers, the company said, and those customers are being notified directly.

F5 said it has no evidence that the attackers accessed CRM or financial data, or tampered with its software supply chain. Independent reviews by NCC Group and IOActive confirmed that the company's build and release systems were not modified.

The company also said the attackers did not reach its other major product lines, including NGINX, F5 Distributed Cloud Services, or Silverline.

F5 released software updates for several products, including BIG-IP, F5OS, and BIG-IP Next, urging customers to patch immediately. F5 is providing a threat-hunting guide and new tools to help users harden systems and monitor for suspicious activity.

F5 is one of Seattle's largest public tech companies, with a market capitalization around $19 billion and thousands of enterprise customers worldwide, including 80% of the Fortune Global 500. Its hardware and software sit in the middle of much of the world's internet traffic, providing load-balancing, application delivery, and security services for major corporations and government agencies.

While F5 products themselves have been targeted in the past — including a vulnerability in 2020 and the “Velvet Ant” malware campaign uncovered in 2024 — this appears to be the first publicly disclosed breach of F5's internal systems.

Separately, F5 announced Wednesday that Michael Montoya resigned from the company's board and became its chief technology operations officer. Montoya was most recently COO at New York-based cybersecurity company BlueVoyant. 

F5 reported revenue growth of 12% to $780 million in its most recently fiscal earnings, with GAAP net income of $190 million, up from $144 million in the year-ago period.

Seattle University President Eduardo Peñalver — credited with “a legacy of growth and innovation” — is leaving to become president of Georgetown University, the two Catholic Jesuit institutions announced Wednesday.

Peñalver, who has led Seattle U. since 2021, will step down March 31, 2026, and start in his new role at Georgetown in Washington, D.C., on July 1.

During his tenure, Seattle U. launched a “Technology Ethics Initiative,” designed to “convene and inspire productive discussions about the role of transformative technologies for a just society.” The initiative is led by political science professor Onur Bakiner, whose current research examines AI governance models.

Last year, the university welcomed Father Paolo Benanti, an advisor to Pope Francis on artificial intelligence and technology ethics, as a distinguished visiting professor. Peñalver moderated a conversation between Benanti and Microsoft President Brad Smith for employees on the company's campus in Redmond, Wash.

Like many institutions, Seattle U. has experienced increased enrollment demand in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines. It has also partnered with local tech corporations, including Amazon and Microsoft, which helped fund the $100 million Center for Science and Innovation.

At Seattle U., Peñalver helped launch new academic programs and integrated Cornish College of the Arts into the Seattle U. community.

“This was not an easy decision,” Peñalver said in a message to the university community, “but one I make with gratitude for all that we have accomplished together and confidence in the university's continued momentum. While I am excited about the opportunity to continue my work in Jesuit higher education at such a pivotal moment, I am also sad to be leaving Seattle University and the Pacific Northwest, which will always be my home.”

Peñalver was raised in Puyallup, Wash., and attended Henry Foss High School in Tacoma before he went on to graduate magna cum laude from Cornell University in 1994.

He studied philosophy and theology at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar and earned his bachelor's degree from Cornell University and law degree from Yale Law School. He also clerked for former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, and prior to Seattle U., was dean of Cornell Law School.

“President Peñalver is an exceptional leader steeped in the Catholic and Jesuit tradition who brings a wealth of experience in higher education, a global mindset, a commitment to social justice and academic excellence, and a bold vision for Georgetown's future,” said Thomas Reynolds, chair of Georgetown's board of directors, in a news release.

Peñalver will succeed Interim President Robert Groves, who has led Georgetown for the past year after former President John DeGioia stepped down from his role in 2024 to recover from a stroke.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

There's no better time to check the social media accounts of your favorite sports team than when that team is winning and you want to bask in the shared experience with other fans.

The vibes are especially good right now for the Seattle Mariners, who less than a week ago dispatched the Detroit Tigers in an earth-shaking 15-inning thriller, and this week jumped to a 2-0 series lead against the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League Championship Series. 

Game 3 is at T-Mobile Park Wednesday, and a team behind the scenes will be ready to react to the next big play on the field or fan moment in the stands in hopes of transferring the energy in the ballpark across the city and region and as far as the internet will take it.

“This home stretch of the season and then into the postseason has been a really fun time for us,” said Tim Walsh, senior director of digital marketing and social media for the Mariners. “It's cool because we have a lot more eyeballs on our content now, and it allows us to really showcase what we've been doing this whole season, and even more so over the last few years.”

Walsh joined the Mariners in 2020 after managing social media for more than four years with the New York Mets. A Long Island, N.Y., native, he said it's become evident during his five years that Seattle is a baseball and sports city. And he thinks the Mariners' unique collection of players and personalities, combined with an energized fan base, make his job especially enjoyable.

Walsh works with teams across the Mariners organization, managing social accounts for everything from the Mariner Moose to T-Mobile Park to the farm system. Content creators, videographers, graphic designers and others all funnel their work to the social team for use on channels including Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and more, in search of a coveted young demographic.

“Instagram in particular for us this year has been awesome,” Walsh said, adding that the Mariners passed 1 million followers this season. “I feel like the team playing well, combined with a really good strategy and a really good group of people producing the content leads to tremendous success from a social standpoint, in terms of engagement growth and the numbers that we measure ourselves by.”

The goal is to provide a mix of content to reach many different types of fans and to serve a variety of purposes for the organization. As the only team to never reach a World Series, there's a lot of emotion around what the Mariners are trying to accomplish, and the social feeds capitalize on that to engage fans. The hype video below is a good example.

Walsh also enjoys pushing a casual “group chat mentality” that can be a relatable tone to strike, leaning heavily on memes, pop culture references and trending content. Here's a strange and simple example that drew 26,000 likes and elicited this comment: “Mariners social media manager is my hero.”

The late season and playoffs have been filled with a number of viral fan moments, spotlighted by the social team and other media organizations. There was the fan who caught Cal Raleigh's historic 60th home run ball and unselfishly handed it to a little kid, or the fan in Detroit wearing a “Dump 61 Here” shirt when he caught another Raleigh smash and got himself a meeting with Raleigh and a trip to Seattle.

“One of the things we try and do is weave our fans into all of the content that we're sharing, because they are so important. They create an incredible home field advantage, unlike anything else in baseball,” Walsh said.

Taking fans behind the scenes is also important. The Mariners have experimented with GoPro cameras in the announcer's booth to catch personalities such as Rick Rizzs calling the action. But a video last Friday night (below), captured from the perspective of pitcher Luis Castillo exiting the dugout to join his team's celebration on the field, drew national applause.

Best vibes on the planet. #SeizeTheMoment pic.twitter.com/eD5dnvmjQS

Walsh credits the players for letting the social team get close to the stories that matter to fans, like when a “hidden camera” captured Julio Rodriguez getting called up to the big leagues or when rookie Cole Young got his news and made an emotional call to his family.

“Some things are going to do better than others, but I think we're not afraid to fail,” Walsh said. “I think that's really important in the social space — trying new things and not being afraid to do things that might not click or resonate in the way that you were hoping for.”

As much as the social team prides itself on reacting to key plays or viral moments of each individual game, Walsh is equally proud of the preparation his team puts in to be able to move quickly. Captions, scripts, graphics and videos that are prepared in advance enable the team to be ready for the unpredictable. 

“We don't want to get too far ahead or jinx, but we have to prep, to be ready for what's next and to tell those stories in a fun, unique way,” Walsh said. “So that when a crazy moment happens in a game, or fans start wearing shoes on their head, we're able to jump on it.”

Seattle startup Electric Era today unveiled a sleek, interactive EV charging device that uses artificial intelligence to converse with drivers as they're juicing up their vehicles. 

The company builds electric vehicle charging systems that are typically deployed at convenience stores and other businesses. The modern-looking new unit — dubbed RetailEdge — can provide information on a vehicle's charging status, suggest how much power is required to reach the next destination, give information on loyalty points earned at a partnering business, and even tell jokes.

“This is a next generation charging dispenser that does more than just charge cars. It can talk to drivers, it can answer their questions. It can provide them an intelligent and immersive interface while they stop to charge and shop,” said CEO and co-founder Quincy Lee. 

RetailEdge incorporates in-house-designed hardware and software, including bilingual AI technology that can integrate with business partners' existing systems. The chargers also include payment interfaces. While some competitors cut costs by using off-the-shelf components, Lee said his startup achieves efficiency by developing custom solutions.

“We are a uniquely capable team of designing very low cost products that have heightened product capabilities,” he said. 

Electric Era launched in 2019 and distinguished itself by pairing its DC fast-charging systems with giant batteries to help deliver and store power needed by recharging EVs. The company has served 72,000 drivers in the past year and has 130 charging stalls deployed in roughly a dozen states. Lee said he expects those numbers to at least double by the end of next year.

The company has 40 employees and has raised $20.5 million in equity funding plus $8.9 million in debt financing.

Today's announcement comes as EV charging infrastructure continues expanding despite policy headwinds. Republican leaders recently canceled tax credits for EV purchases, but charging stations are proliferating.

Bloomberg reported that the number of public charging stations in the U.S. increased by 19% in the first nine months of this year, with 780 high-speed stations added in the third quarter alone.

“The charging map is also being filled in by restaurants and retail stores, which increasingly see [charging] cords as a way to attract customers,” Bloomberg reported — which is the sector targeted by Electric Era.

The startup will keep selling its original charging units alongside RetailEdge. Lee described his products as “cost competitive” but didn't share specifics.

Electric Era has so far avoided the charging cable thefts that plague many installations, as thieves sever the cables for the copper and other metals they contain. Lee suspects the company's units are going into locations with more activity and employee oversight, but he recognizes the vulnerability.

The issue is particularly acute in the Seattle area, where Electric Era will be installing 32 ports over roughly the next eight months. The region has been hard hit by thieves targeting not only charging sites but also utility and telecommunications infrastructure.

Lee said his team is “constantly lobbying” state leaders to pass laws that protect this sort of essential infrastructure.

While employees spend much of their day communicating and coordinating amongst themselves on projects, this effort is often undermined by the availability of specific individuals. When a colleague with vital information is away — whether on vacation or in a different time zone — the rest of the team must delay progress until that person responds.

Ashutosh Garg and Varun Kacholia, the co-founders of Eightfold — an AI recruiting startup last valued at $2.1 billion — believe that advances in LLMs and data privacy technologies can help solve some aspects of this costly problem. Earlier this year, they launched Viven, a digital twin startup with a mission to grant employees access to crucial information from teammates even when those colleagues are unavailable.

On Wednesday, Viven emerged out of stealth mode with $35 million in seed funding from Khosla Ventures, Foundation Capital, FPV Ventures, and others.

Viven develops a specialized LLM for each employee, effectively creating a digital twin by accessing their internal electronic documents such as email, Slack, and Google Docs. Other employees in the organization can then query that person's digital twin to get immediate answers related to common projects and shared knowledge.

“When each and every person has a digital twin, you can just talk to their twin as if you're talking to that person and get the response,” Ashutosh Garg told TechCrunch.

One major hurdle is that people just can't share everything with anyone who asks. Employees often handle sensitive  information or have personal files they want to keep private from the rest of the team.

According to Ashutosh Garg, Viven's technology solves that complex problem through a concept known as pairwise context and privacy. This enables the startup's LLMs to precisely determine what information can be shared and with whom across the organization.

Viven's LLMs are smart enough to recognize personal context and know what information needs to stay private — like questions related to an employee's personal life. But perhaps the most important safeguard is that everyone can see the query history of their digital twin, which acts as a deterrent against people asking inappropriate questions.

“It's a very hard problem to solve, and until recently, it was unsolvable,” Ashu Garg, a general partner at Foundation Capital told TechCrunch.

Viven is already in use by several enterprise clients, including Genpact and Eightfold. (Co-founders Ashutosh Garg and Varun Kacholia continue to lead Eightfold, splitting their time between that company and running Viven.)

As for competition, Ashutosh Garg claims that no other company is tackling digital twins for the enterprise yet.

He wasn't sure that there were no competitors when he first started thinking about the idea. So he called Vinod Khosla to ask about it. The legendary investor assured Ashutosh Garg that nobody is doing this and agreed to invest.

Ashu Garg of Foundation Capital was equally excited about Viven.

“When Ashutosh came to me and described the product, the big aha for me was: there's this horizontal problem across all jobs of coordination and communication, which no one is automating,” Ashu Garg told TechCrunch.

But just because there are no direct competitors now doesn't mean that other companies won't build digital twins for companies in the future. Ashu Garg said that Anthropic, Google's Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and OpenAI's enterprise search products have a personalization component. But, if they do enter this market, Viven hopes its “pairwise” context technology will be its moat.

On Wednesday, Anthropic released Claude Haiku 4.5, the newest version of its smallest model, billed as offering similar performance to Sonnet 4 “at one-third the cost and more than twice the speed,” per a company blog post. 

Anthropic cites a range of new benchmark results to back up those performance claims. In the company's testing, Haiku scored 73% on SWE-Bench verified and 41% on the command-line-focused Terminal-Bench — below Sonnet 4.5, but on par with Sonnet 4, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 in each case. Tests show similar results on benchmarks for tool use, computer use, and visual reasoning.

The new version of Haiku will be immediately available under all free Anthropic plans and the company believes it will be particularly appealing for free versions of AI products, where it can provide significant capabilities while minimizing server loads. The lightweight nature of the model also means it's easier to deploy multiple Haiku agents in parallel or in combination with a more sophisticated model.

In a statement to press, Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger said the Haiku would make new styles of deployment possible in production for the first time. “It's opening up entirely new categories of what's possible with AI in production environments – with Sonnet handling complex planning while Haiku-powered sub-agents execute at speed,” Krieger said. “We're giving people a complete agent toolbox where each model has the right combination of intelligence, speed, and cost for different parts of the job.” 

The most immediate applications are likely to come in software development tools, where Claude Code is already commonly used and latency is often a critical factor. In statements provided by Anthropic, Zencoder CEO Andrew Filev described the new version of Haiku as “unlocking an entirely new set of use cases.” 

Haiku 4.5 comes after a string of high-profile launches for Anthropic: just two weeks after the launch of Sonnet 4.5 and two months after the launch of Opus 4.1, both of which were hailed as state-of-the-art on release. The previous version of Haiku was released in October 2024.

Cybersecurity firm F5 Networks says government-backed hackers had “long-term, persistent access” to its network, which allowed them to steal the company's source code and customer information.

In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, F5 said it now “believes its containment actions have been successful,” after first discovering the hackers in its network on August 9.

The Seattle, Washington-based company, which specializes in providing application security and cybersecurity defenses for large companies and governments, said the hackers had access to its BIG-IP product development environment and its knowledge management systems, which included source code and publicly undisclosed security vulnerabilities.

F5 said it wasn't aware of any modifications to its software while in development, nor was it aware of any exploitation of the vulnerabilities. The company published several updates on Wednesday for its BIG-IP platform to fix the undisclosed security flaws and urged customers to patch them.

The company also said the hackers downloaded configurations and implementation information about some of its customers' systems, files that could help hackers find and exploit potential design weaknesses, and potentially hack into those customers' systems.

F5 said in the notice that the U.S. Department of Justice allowed the company to delay its public disclosure. An F5 spokesperson would not say for what reason the delay was allowed, but the DOJ can allow companies to hold off on notifying the public if there is a “substantial risk to national security or public safety.”

F5 has over 1,000 corporate customers and serves more than 85% of the Fortune 500, the largest public companies by revenue, including banks, tech companies, and critical infrastructure companies.

The U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre warned on Wednesday, following F5's disclosure, that hackers could “enable a threat actor to exploit F5 devices and software.”

CISA said in an email on Wednesday that it has ordered civilian federal agencies under an emergency directive to patch their systems by October 22, citing the security risks.

The company did not attribute the attacks to a particular government or nation-state-affiliated hacking group, and F5 spokesperson Dan Sorensen declined to answer TechCrunch's questions beyond the company's published statement, including how many customers are affected and if it was known how the hackers broke in to begin with. 

F5 is the latest tech company in recent years to have been hacked by government hackers, including Microsoft — by China, and Russia, at least twice; cloud and enterprise technology firm Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and several other companies as part of the broader Russian cyberattack on the software maker SolarWinds.

AI hyperscaler startup Nscale has signed a sizable deal with Microsoft to bring Nvidia AI hardware to multiple data centers.

The AI cloud provider announced on Wednesday that it signed a deal with Microsoft to bring approximately 200,000 Nvidia GB300 GPUs to three data centers in Europe and one in the U.S.

These GPUs will be delivered through Nscale-owned operations and through a joint venture with investment company Aker, one of Nscale's investors.

About half of these GPUs, 104,000, will head to a data center in Texas leased by Ionic Digital, over the next 12 to 18 months. Nscale plans to increase its footprint at this location to 1.2 gigawatts, the company stated.

Nscale will also deploy 12,600 GPUs to the Start Campus data center in Sines, Portugal, starting in the first quarter of 2026.

The deal builds on previous plans with both Microsoft and Aker regarding data centers in Norway and the United Kingdom. Nscale will send 23,000 GPUS to its Loughton, England campus starting in 2027, and send the remaining 52,000 GPUs to Microsoft's AI campus in Narvik, Norway.

“This agreement confirms Nscale's place as a partner of choice for the world's most important technology leaders,” Josh Payne, founder and CEO of Nscale, said in a company press release. “Few companies are equipped to deliver GPU deployments at this scale, but we have the experience and have built the global pipeline to do so.”

It's a bold claim by Payne, considering that Nscale was founded in 2024. Since its launch, the company has raised more than $1.7 billion from strategic partners including Aker, Nokia and Nvidia. Nscale has also raised from investors like Sandton Capital Partners, G Squared and Point72, among others. Payne told the Financial Times that the company is looking at an IPO as early as the end of next year.

“The pace with which we have expanded our capacity demonstrates both our readiness and our commitment to efficiency, sustainability and providing our customers with the most advanced technology available. It's a clear signal that Nscale is setting a new standard for how the next wave of AI infrastructure will be delivered,” Payne said in the release.

GPU deals have picked up in recent weeks. OpenAI announced it was purchasing six gigawatts' worth of chips from AMD last week. OpenAI also recently inked a deal with Nvidia in which Nvidia will invest up to $100 billion in the company in exchange for 10 gigawatts' worth of chips in September.

Apple on Wednesday announced its new M5 chip along with the new iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and Vision Pro, all powered by the new chip.

These devices are now available for preorder, with shipping and in-store availability expected on October 22.

The M5 chip will allow the new devices to run faster than their predecessors. Apple says the chip has over four times the peak GPU compute performance compared to the M4. Johny Srouji, Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Technologies, added in a statement that it “ushers in the next big leap in AI performance for Apple silicon.” 

For the new iPad Pro, Apple touts that the chip brings “up to 3.5x the AI performance” of last year's Pro and up to 5.6x faster than the iPad Pro with M1.

Other upgrades include Apple's C1X cellular modem with up to 50% faster cellular data performance and the N1 chip for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Thread connectivity. Additionally, the new iPad Pro has faster storage read and write speeds and faster charging of up to 50% in around 30 minutes.

Adding more power to the iPad Pro seems like a logical step for Apple to take, as the tech giant is pushing it to feel more like a laptop. With iPadOS 26, the tablet is getting more intuitive window displays, the Preview app, and the ability to create folders for better organization. 

The pricing starts at $999 for the 11-inch model and $1,299 for the 13-inch, with color options in black and silver.

The new 14-inch MacBook Pro is expected to be even faster than its predecessor, featuring upgraded graphics performance (up to 1.6 times better), a higher memory bandwidth of 153Gbps (increased from M4's 120Gbps), and improved storage speeds.

It also boasts a battery life of up to 24 hours.

The price starts at $1,599, and it is available in space black and silver.

Vision Pro is also set to receive the M5 chip, replacing the current M2.

The M5 chip enhances display rendering by 10%, supports refresh rates up to 120Hz (up from 100Hz), and accelerates AI-powered features, making them 50% faster. Additionally, battery life improves by 30 minutes, providing up to 2.5 hours of general use and three hours of video playback.

The upgraded Vision Pro also comes with a Dual Knit Band to give users a more comfortable fit. It's available in small, medium, and large. The price remains at $3,499.

The announcement of the new Vision Pro follows reports that Apple is shifting its focus toward developing smart glasses instead of overhauling its VR headset.

Liberate, an AI startup automating insurance operations, has raised $50 million in a round led by Battery Ventures as it looks to scale its agentic deployments across carriers and agencies globally.

The all-equity round values the three-year-old startup at $300 million post-money, with participation from new investor Canapi Ventures and returning backers Redpoint Ventures, Eclipse, and Commerce Ventures.

The insurance industry has been navigating a difficult stretch, with rising operational costs, legacy system constraints, and increasing customer expectations. Specifically in the non-life segment, global premium growth is projected to slow through 2026, driven by heightened competition, weaker rate momentum, and new cost pressures, including tariffs, per a recent report by Deloitte. While some carriers experimented with AI, many early efforts stalled due to fragmented data and inflexible workflows. That is now changing, as insurers shift toward full-scale AI adoption — embedding it into the core of their operations rather than layering it on top. Liberate is stepping in to meet this shift head-on.

Founded in 2022, the San Francisco-based startup builds AI systems for property and casualty insurers, focusing on sales, service, and claims. At the front end, its voice AI assistant, Nicole, handles inbound and outbound calls to help sell policies or respond to service requests. Behind the scenes, a network of reasoning-based AI agents connects to insurers' existing systems, gathering context and generating responses that Nicole delivers — all without human intervention.

Liberate's AI agents are built to complete end-to-end tasks — not just respond to queries or escalate tickets. These include quoting policies, processing claims, and updating endorsements, among other routine functions.

The agents can also operate over SMS and email, allowing insurers to interact with customers across different channels while automating more of their day-to-day workflows.

“Insurance companies want to grow, but they're not able to do so,” Liberate co-founder and CEO Amrish Singh (pictured above, center) said in an interview. “It's the status quo where the opportunity is.”

Singh co-founded Liberate after nearly four years at Metromile, the car insurance firm owned by Lemonade, where he worked across both back-office operations and technology. He teamed up with Ryan Eldridge, Liberate's VP of engineering and also a former Metromile executive, and Jason St. Pierre, the company's CPO, who previously held roles at Twitter, Google, and Verily, Alphabet's life sciences arm.

Liberate's AI systems have helped increase sales by an average of 15% and cut costs by 23%, Singh told TechCrunch, adding that the startup now has over 60 customers and focuses on the top 100 carriers and agencies, which together represent 70% to 80% of the U.S. property and casualty insurance market.

The technology uses reinforcement learning tailored for long, regulated insurance conversations. Each interaction is auditable and includes human-in-the-loop safeguards to meet compliance requirements, the startup said.

Over the past year, Liberate has scaled from 10,000 monthly automations to 1.3 million automated resolutions, Singh stated. These include direct customer interactions via its voice AI, as well as back-office tasks handled by AI agents integrated into carriers' core systems.

Since AI systems can still make mistakes and are not foolproof yet, Liberate uses an internal tool called Supervisor to monitor all interactions between its agents and customers. The software flags issues or anomalies and escalates to a human when the AI's response may be off-track, Singh said.

“The advantage of servicing only one industry, and within that servicing only three specific use cases, is that you can put a lot more guardrails in place,” the executive noted.

Without disclosing the names of its clients, Liberate said that using its agents, hurricane claim response time dropped from 30 hours to 30 seconds.

The AI agents enable 24/7 sales operations, allowing customers to buy insurance even at midnight or early in the morning — times when human agents typically are not available, Singh said.

Before this round, Liberate raised a $15 million Series A last year. Its voice AI-powered omnichannel experience and ability to fully automate tasks by integrating into existing systems were key factors that drew investors to back the company at a larger scale.

“Mapping the process, modeling it, and making sure that all the systems connections are in place, well tested, and appropriately designed so that you can complete the task, not just communicate, is what Liberate is doing,” Marcus Ryu, a general partner at Battery Ventures, told TechCrunch.

Ryu, who previously worked with property and casualty insurers at Guidewire Software, focuses on enterprise software, fintech, and insurtech investments at Battery Ventures. He is joining Liberate's board.

The Series B funding will be used to expand Liberate's reasoning capabilities and support broader deployment across insurers. The startup has raised $72 million to date and currently employs around 50 people.

It's funny that in the first example where the author asked the viewers to find the function definition, I was able to do so faster with the colorful syntax highlighting he considered wrong.To recognize different elements of code is more than just colors, but actual syntaxes of the language and the general shapes of code blocks.It's a matter of taste, and in my decades of programming, I've found colleagues and many teams trying for all kinds of fancy themes only to come back with a ""boring"" one, like Material Theme, which is also my main driver nowadays.I think the author had some good ideas, particularly around literals (what he called constants), rejection of the requirement for equal brightness, and emphasizing comments. The author is more than welcome to bring his version of perfect syntax highlighting to the market of ideas. Its adoption should prove it if his idea wins.

The author later asks what color class definitions were. I think this fundamentally gets wrong how syntax highlighting helps humans. I don't have a clue what color anything is in my favored highlighting, but my brain does incredible pattern recognition to help me digest code in it without me consciously knowing what color does what.So his arguments for why there's a problem don't hold up, but that doesn't mean there is not in fact a problem.

I am however in that weird minority that prefers light themes, and I do also prefer minimal syntax highlighting. The author does have a point to an extent, but I don't think there's any one objectively better way to do it I think it's all personal preference.I don't like the rainbow highlighting, too distracting for me, and doesn't work particularly well with light themes. I did try the author's alabaster theme in VSCode though and it highlights the wrong things for me.(In C#) if I have var result = await SomeMethodName(param, param, param); It put both ""result"" and ""SomeMethodName"" in blue, the rest being black. I'd actually prefer it the other way around, highlight the programming language's keywords (var and await in this case) and leave my own names (result and SomeMethodName) unhighlighted.The theme was also inconsistent. The post says we shouldn't highlight PL keywords, but the proposed theme does highlight some keywords while ignoring others.

I do agree that it is harder to see the return misspelling with the more detailed syntax highlighting, but when I'm coding I'm mainly focused on the actual tokens I'm writing, and you better believe I pick up on if the syntax highlighting is showing my token as wrongly being a keyword rather than an identifier, or the wrong type of identifier. Even if I don't actually know what the colors are, it will look wrong.Rainbow vomit syntax highlighting logically seems like a bad idea, but like many things, even though it's hard to prove that it's better, I think a lot of people will agree that it really is better. Especially with tree-sitter and LSPs giving more detailed syntax highlighting; I can feel the benefits of 'oh, that's the wrong identifier color, isn't it?' to the point where if I run into an edge case that breaks highlighting it becomes immediately noticeable.

Many games (especially gacha games where one may be tracking multiple orthogonal ""levels"" on any given piece of inventory) compress tremendous amounts of data into a character or gear item portrait; ticks on the top, dots on the side, colored frames, etc. - all so we can pick things out in a crowd without needing to set a custom sort order.And yet our IDEs, citing silly things like ""render optimizations"" and ""consistency with ANSI escape codes,"" allow each character to have just a single foreground color, a single background color, and maybe a squiggly underline. Why stop there?Give me the freedom to add arbitrary overlays and decorations on any given token. Give me <ruby>-style elements [0] that will let me put a little colored dot or emoji at the top right of any token that meets a certain requirement... say, a utility function, or a reference from the file that's open at the top right of my screen.Let us swim in rainbows with sparkles flying past our eyes.

Same. It sort of killed the article for me. I also thought that in his resulting theme the limitation of colors would eventually trip me up. Having numbers and strings be the same color is terrible - I have noticed mistakes in the oast where numbers were erroneously attributed as strings for being enclosed in quotation marks precisely because my theme gives those different colors.

Same. I noticed this on a Whatsapp group I have with old friends. About 8 people, so each gets a specific color in their name, and that's how I identify who is talking on a glance.Once one of them switched thier phone number, and had to leave and reenter the group. This caused the colors of everyone to change.For a couple of weeks it was hell. I was used to Person A to be pink, Person B to be yellow and so forth. I would reply to A thinking I was replying to B because their color changed, which caused a lot of confusion.

I don't understand the premise of this. What is ""the base text color"" and why would it be important to be able to see it?

It seems like the author gets most of their value from associating the specific highlight color with a specific meaning. I think I get most of the my value from the different highlight groups. From that perspective, I don't really care if I open an editor and strings are green - I care strings form one group that's different than variable names or etc. The main problem I had with the ""complicated"" scheme was the reuse of purple: branching, looping, imports, functions, this, new - these are not at all related so making them purple doesn't help me (or the author), regardless of total color count.I don't think either way is wrong, but it may feel like it to different people.

For example: keywords, specifically, are actually very useful to highlight. This post complains that misspelling ""return"" didn't make easily-scannable color changes (it changed the color from purple to red, which still looks like a special color)... But then, proposes to not highlight keywords at all, so misspelling ""return"" would still be impossible to quickly scan for visually! In both cases with the proposed color scheme, ""return"" and ""retunr"" would have identical coloring: white.Generally speaking I think a lot of the visual noise of syntax highlighting comes from having too many colors. For example, you don't need the ""class"" keyword to have a different color than the ""const"" keyword — and many syntax highlighting themes are guilty of doing exactly that. But it's useful to be able to immediately, visually see if you made a typo: if you expected to write a keyword, and it's colored like normal text, you know you messed up. Similarly, it's useful when reviewing code to quickly be able to tell whether there's a typo somewhere.I have a pretty custom syntax highlighting theme for Neovim. I have a few categories that are highlighted differently:- Keywords- Function calls and method calls (highlighted identically)- Property accesses (to highlight mistakes when you're simply accessing a property 
instead of calling it — it's a different color than a method call)- Non-string built-in primitive types like numbers, booleans, etc- Strings- Comments- TypesUltimately I think syntax highlighting is a tool to let you see mistakes. If you go too wild with the colors, it's true that since everything is a unique color, it's hard to tell when something is the wrong unique color. But you can use a relatively restrained palette and get a lot of value, and I think this post goes a bit too far in terms of reducing color usage.

I've always thought the default Visual Studio color scheme was a nice balance. And I especially like the green comment color in that theme. It doesn't scream for your attention but also doesn't fade into the background (which, annoyingly, many themes do quite literally).Of course if the author prefers their extra minimal colors I'm not going to tell them they're wrong. Though framing it as objectively better I do disagree with.

I'd prefer minimal-to-no syntax highlighting except for things that should NOT be there. Nonexisting keywords should be highlighted. Unclosed strings. Unbalanced parens or brackets.I like making comments their own color so you can easily separate them from actual code but I'm otherwise in the minimal camp.

Yeah I generally want the opposite. I want keywords to be the thing being highlighted.I also really dislike overly colorful themes, and I prefer light mode (dark mode is far too hard on my eyes, oddly enough I have to strain to focus or it's fuzzy).But the author's alabaster theme still highlights the wrong things and is inconsistent.public async Task<byte[]> SomeMethodName(Type param, Type param) results in Task, SomeMethodName, and BOTh the data type and parameter name being highlighted.If highlighting isn't for keywords, why is Task and the data types highlighted?likewise var result = await SomeMethodName(param, param); has result and SomeMethodName highlighted and I generally want the opposite, I want the PL's keywords highlighted and nothing else.

I prefer dark mode (precisely for the garish colors, sorry), but been using light mode... because it's hard to make everything use dark mode!When my terminal was dark, the eg some docs in the browser were light, switching back and forth was quite painful. Yes, it's super simple for websites to detect the preferred color scheme with @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {}, yet most (such as this one) don't. I could use some hacks, but then I'm in for a world of pain. So I just use light theme everywhere and it's ok(ish).

Agreed with almost everything the author had to say, but not this. Hard disagree. In my view, keywords are the single most important thing to highlight. I'd be ok without anything else. Keywords sketch the structure of the program in most languages. The thing I want my eye drawn to, in the case of top-level definitions, for example, is the keyword. It's the predictable anchor as I'm scanning a long series of definitions. The identifiers are not: some are long, some are (very) short.And how do I understand the control flow of my program? I look at keywords. If I want to read the condition, I have to find the condition. But all the conditions look different. What's the reliable way to spot them? The predictable 'if' that precedes each one, without fail.My eye is a parser. It needs to recognize tokens. But some tokens are easy to confuse: keywords look just like identifiers.

An assertion of correctness relating to a matter of taste is, ironically, going to be trivially falsifiable. Even though I found myself personally agreeing with most of what the author had to say (for my tastes)! I definitely want to try lifting the visual importance of comments.

I'm not being facetious. The author is trying to show comparisons to the reader of various syntax highlighting schemes, but any difference between them is overwhelmed by the massive contrast between the bright yellow background and the black background of the code samples.

Notably, I don't necessarily remember which colors are used by my code editors off the top of my head, but you can be damn sure that if the smallest thing is different tomorrow, I will notice, and if anything is the wrong color, I will immediately notice something is wrong. Put as many colors as possible and it makes it easier for me to spot any mistake. Although I can understand that more than a few colors can be distracting to some people.As for ""everyone does it wrong"", and in particular wtt the Christmas tree effect, I find Kate's and IDEA's default color themes quite well designed and balanced, and where each sub expression start and end.I do find light themes far more readable, and only use dark themes under very bad lighting conditions where a white background would hurt the eyes even at minimal screen brightness.Bonus topic: in the Christmas tree screenshots, you can notice that parentheses are of different colors. This creates a visual mess but I do activate this option in Kate anyway because it is very useful to quickly check that the parentheses are balancIt's less necessary when you have syntax checking though, because the editor will put a red background or draw squiggles.

The primary difference is that my theme has an underlying assumption that colors have semantic meaning that we all implicitly understand(red = bad, yellows/oranges are action-oriented etc). So instead of color = syntax, my theme semantically maps color = intent.• Warm colors (orange/red) for actions — throw, return, await.• Cool colors (blue/green) for definitions and values — function names, constants, variables.• Muted neutrals for structure and noise — punctuation, keywords like var or constThis means comments are muted, contrary to the author's proposal - imo while they are important and helpful, they're secondary to the actual codeMy primary design goal was that if you open a large file and squint at it, the flow should be immediately obvious (the flow colors stand out, if you see a bunch of blues it's calling a bunch of other functions etc)(You can see screenshots in the link)

The solution is not to use fewer colors, but rather to take advantage of the 3D space of color perception.Good themes have a hierarchy. Perhaps red is for keywords and blue is for symbols, but different kinds of symbols have different shades of blue. A lighter blue for functions, a darker blue for classes, for example.This allows the highlighting to convey a higher amount of information when reading code closely, without causing distraction when skimming through code.

Somewhat related, I got used to turning off syntax highlighting for some coding sessions.It started when I was using vim to edit large data files and syntax highlighting there was buggy.Later, I worked with large react files, where with each JSX block the latency and highlighting reliability was getting worse. So I turned it off too and I was surprised that I didn't see a big difference in readability after that.I'd still use syntax highlighting for backend work. But I don't mind looking at large html files or react prototypes sans highlighting.

I also like minimal themes (and light mode!) but keywords are precicesly the thing I want highlighted. The ""Visual Studio(Light)"" theme in VSCode gets it pretty close to what I want but still has some inconsitencies that bug me but I haven't bothered making my own to fix them yet. It primarily just highlights keywords, comments, strings.But then you can have something like public async Task<byte[]> SomeMethod(DateTime date, int someNumber) and int is highlighted but DateTime isn't...

Like literally IDE not just highlights, it underscores a problem in red/yellow, puts a marker on the left of line, and on the right at the scrollbar as well. Also marks the whole file tab and file name on project tree. Gives a warning when user creates a commit.Still, many, too many programmers don't care to either fix or silence it.

But I agree with the author that if little to nothing ends up being given the base text colour (e.g. white or black) then the design is an unthinking one (less of a design process, more of a box-ticking exercise to assign a unique colour to everything that can possibly have one).

If is not highlighting structure then is failing to do the pre-optimization that helps your organic parser do that.The ""matter of taste"" part can come after the ""matter of structure"" was adequately elevating the right categories of elements to each level, hence inviting to receive the required attention.

2. having keywords vs variable names vs functions be different colors helps you find misspellings, not the other way around. But that's almost beside the point, because it's your linter/intellisense/error checker's job to let you know when you have an obvious syntax error. You're also taking this as if you've just discovered this code block in the ether and have to debug it, rather that the reality that if you had actually been the author, you would have immediately noticed it, even without red squiggles, because it would be immediately obvious when you type it that it doesn't highlight as a keyword. Human brains are hardwired for pattern recognition, one could even argue it's the only thing the human brain is even good at.3. I'm not sure where the notion of comments being grey is ""tradition"", but in practically every editor I've used, the default color for comments is a pretty easy to pick out green. Comments usually stick out like a sore thumb, in fact, as they typically don't share their color with any other syntax. Again, this points to you specifically picking out a non-default theme to make your points against.4. ""... gets so bad you can't see the base color"" this isn't so much a thing, rather, the base color just isn't white. Which is because most people would agree that pure white on black is not pleasant to look at for long periods of time. There's a reason you don't see many dark mode highlighters use white. Again, default for vscode is a pleasant light blue. Plenty of contrast, but not so harsh it strains your eyes.5. This is the most psychological, and subjective one, but plain, unhighlighted text just doesn't look like code. It looks like plaintext. Because plaintext is unstructured. Syntax highlighting brings out (highlights) the inherent structure of code. And that's kind of the entire point; it's there to show the structure. It may help you spot a typo, but that's not why it's there. That's an incidental perk. It's there because our brains are really good at pattern recognition, and having syntax follow a predictable color scheme taps in to that pattern recognition.

I mean, any of those would work, but the one that works best is the one you're used to.The brain is great at learning patterns, I'm extremely used to IntelliJ's classic theme (light) with Firacode with ligatures.But that's me, I've been daily driving that for years, so stuff just pops up at me.I like semantic highlights (i.e. something is static or a field, or whatever) rather than pure syntactic ones, but what matters most to me is stability.If it changes for no reason, it's jarring and takes a while to get used to it again.

Twice during the last couple of years, I've done this poll online:  When reading a code block in your chosen viewing mode (light or dark), 
  which of these should the code block always do?

  - Match my chosen mode
  - Have a dark background
  - Have a light background

... and, each time, “Match my chosen mode” won with well over 75% of the votes (about 150–200 total votes in each case). Accordingly, I've styled my site's code blocks to handle both dark- and light-mode viewing. I also provide a switch that enables one to toggle back and forth just in case the chosen system mode doesn't match how one wants to view code blocks (e.g., some people prefer to see code blocks in dark mode even if they're otherwise using light mode).

Lately she's been dabbling with soft support for well known grifters like Eric Weinstein, though last I heard she stopped short of actually endorsing his theories. I think there's just too many views to be had by courting that audience, so it becomes irresistible to engage with. The best thing a good physics communicator could do would be to completely ignore the well known physics grifters and focus on the quality content, but instead she has been leaning toward defensing Weinstein and others.

Artificial intelligence is helping health-care providers better assess their patients' discomfort.

For years at Orchard Care Homes, a 23‑facility dementia-care chain in northern England, Cheryl Baird watched nurses fill out the Abbey Pain Scale, an observational methodology used to evaluate pain in those who can't communicate verbally. Baird, a former nurse who was then the facility's director of quality, describes it as “a tick‑box exercise where people weren't truly considering pain indicators.”

As a result, agitated residents were assumed to have behavioral issues, since the scale does not always differentiate well between pain and other forms of suffering or distress. They were often prescribed psychotropic sedatives, while the pain itself went untreated.

Then, in January 2021, Orchard Care Homes began a trial of PainChek, a smartphone app that scans a resident's face for microscopic muscle movements and uses artificial intelligence to output an expected pain score. Within weeks, the pilot unit saw fewer prescriptions and had calmer corridors. “We immediately saw the benefits: ease of use, accuracy, and identifying pain that wouldn't have been spotted using the old scale,” Baird recalls.

In nursing homes, neonatal units, and ICU wards, researchers are racing to turn pain into something a camera or sensor can score as reliably as blood pressure.

This kind of technology-assisted diagnosis hints at a bigger trend. In nursing homes, neonatal units, and ICU wards, researchers are racing to turn pain—medicine's most subjective vital sign—into something a camera or sensor can score as reliably as blood pressure. The push has already produced PainChek, which has been cleared by regulators on three continents and has logged more than 10 million pain assessments. Other startups are beginning to make similar inroads in care settings.

The way we assess pain may finally be shifting, but when algorithms measure our suffering, does that change the way we understand and treat it?

Science already understands certain aspects of pain. We know that when you stub your toe, for example, microscopic alarm bells called nociceptors send electrical impulses toward your spinal cord on “express” wires, delivering the first stab of pain, while a slower convoy follows with the dull throb that lingers. At the spinal cord, the signal meets a microscopic switchboard scientists call the gate. Flood that gate with friendly touches—say, by rubbing the bruise—or let the brain return an instruction born of panic or calm, and the gate might muffle or magnify the message before you even become aware of it.

As the opioid crisis rages, companies are on a hunt for new, nonaddictive pain medicines. A new study offers a glimmer of hope amid a bevy of failures.

The gate can either let pain signals pass through or block them, depending on other nerve activity and instructions from your brain. Only the signals that succeed in getting past this gate travel up to your brain's sensory map to help locate the damage, while others branch out to emotion centers that decide how bad it feels. Within milliseconds, those same hubs in the brain shoot fresh orders back down the line, releasing built-in painkillers or stoking the alarm. In other words, pain isn't a straightforward translation of damage or sensation but a live negotiation between the body and the brain.

But much of how that negotiation plays out is still a mystery. For instance, scientists cannot predict what causes someone to slip from a routine injury into years-long hypersensitivity; the molecular shift from acute to chronic pain is still largely unknown. Phantom-limb pain remains equally puzzling: About two-thirds of amputees feel agony in a part of their body that no longer exists, yet competing theories—cortical remapping, peripheral neuromas, body-schema mismatch—do not explain why they suffer while the other third feel nothing.

The first serious attempt at a system for quantifying pain was introduced in 1921. Patients marked their degree of pain as a point on a blank 10‑centimeter line and clinicians scored the distance in millimeters, converting lived experience into a 0–100 ladder. By 1975, psychologist Ronald Melzack's McGill Pain Questionnaire offered 78 adjectives like “burning,” “stabbing,” and “throbbing,” so that pain's texture could join intensity in the chart. Over the past few decades, hospitals have ultimately settled on the 0–10 Numeric Rating Scale.

Yet pain is stubbornly subjective. Feedback from the brain in the form of your reaction can send instructions back down the spinal cord, meaning that expectation and emotion can change how much the same injury hurts. In one trial, volunteers who believed they had received a pain relief cream reported a stimulus as 22% less painful than those who knew the cream was inactive—and a functional magnetic resonance image of their brains showed that the drop corresponded with decreased activity in the parts of the brain that report pain, meaning they really did feel less hurt.

What's more, pain can also be affected by a slew of external factors. In one study, experimenters applied the same calibrated electrical stimulus to volunteers from Italy, Sweden, and Saudi Arabia, and the ratings varied dramatically. Italian women recorded the highest scores on the 0–10 scale, while Swedish and Saudi participants judged the identical burn several points lower, implying that culture can amplify or dampen the felt intensity of the same experience.

Bias inside the clinic can drive different responses even to the same pain score. A 2024 analysis of discharge notes found that women's scores were recorded 10% less often than men's. At a large pediatric emergency department, Black children presenting with limb fractures were roughly 39% less likely to receive an opioid analgesic than their white non-Hispanic peers, even after the researchers controlled for pain score and other clinical factors. Together these studies make clear that an “8 out of 10” does not always result in the same reaction or treatment. And many patients cannot self-report their pain at all—for example, a review of bedside studies concludes that about 70% of intensive-care patients have pain that goes unrecognized or undertreated, a problem the authors link to their impaired communication due to sedation or intubation.

These issues have prompted a search for a better, more objective way to understand and assess pain. Progress in artificial intelligence has brought a new dimension to that hunt.

Research groups are pursuing two broad routes. The first listens underneath the skin. Electrophysiologists strap electrode nets to volunteers and look for neural signatures that rise and fall with administered stimuli. A 2024 machine-learning study reported that one such algorithm could tell with over 80% accuracy, using a few minutes of resting-state EEG, which subjects experienced chronic pain and which were pain-free control participants. Other researchers combine EEG with galvanic skin response and heart-rate variability, hoping a multisignal “pain fingerprint” will provide more robust measurements.

Immersing patients in virtual worlds can reduce the pain of a needle stick as well as more pernicious chronic pain. 

One example of this method is the PMD-200 patient monitor from Medasense, which uses AI-based tools to output pain scores. The device uses physiological patterns like heart rate, sweating, or peripheral temperature changes as the input and focuses on surgical patients, with the goal of helping anesthesiologists adjust doses during operations. In a 2022 study of 75 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, use of the monitor resulted in lower self-reported pain scores after the operation—a median score of 3 out of 10, versus 5 out of 10 in controls—without an increase in opioid use. The device is authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration and is in use in the United States, the European Union, Canada, and elsewhere.

The second path is behavioral. A grimace, a guarded posture, or a sharp intake of breath correlates with various levels of pain. Computer-vision teams have fed high-speed video of patients' changing expressions into neural networks trained on the Face Action Coding System (FACS), which was introduced in the late 1970s with the goal of creating an objective and universal system to analyze such expressions—it's the Rosetta stone of 44 facial micro-movements. In lab tests, those models can flag frames indicating pain from the data set with over 90% accuracy, edging close to the consistency of expert human assessors. Similar approaches mine posture and even sentence fragments in clinical notes, using natural-language processing, to spot phrases like “curling knees to chest” that often correlate with high pain.

PainChek is one of these behavioral models, and it acts like a camera‑based thermometer, but for pain: A care worker opens the app and holds a phone 30 centimeters from a person's face. For three seconds, a neural network looks for nine particular microscopic movements—upper‑lip raise, brow pinch, cheek tension, and so on—that research has linked most strongly to pain. Then the screen flashes a score of 0 to 42. “There's a catalogue of ‘action‑unit codes'—facial expressions common to all humans. Nine of those are associated with pain,” explains Kreshnik Hoti, a senior research scientist with PainChek and a co-inventor of the device. This system is built directly on the foundation of FACS. After the scan, the app walks the user through a yes‑or‑no checklist of other signs, like groaning, “guarding,” and sleep disruption, and stores the result on a cloud dashboard that can show trends.

Linking the scan to a human‑filled checklist was, Hoti admits, a late design choice. “Initially, we thought AI should automate everything, but now we see [that] hybrid use—AI plus human input—is our major strength,” he says. Care aides, not nurses, complete most assessments, freeing clinicians to act on the data rather than gather it.

PainChek was cleared by Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration in 2017, and national rollout funding from Canberra helped embed it in hundreds of nursing homes in the country. The system has also won authorization in the UK—where expansion began just before covid-19 started spreading and resumed as lockdowns eased—and in Canada and New Zealand, which are running pilot programs. In the US, it's currently awaiting an FDA decision. Company‑wide data show “about a 25% drop in anti­psychotic use and, in Scotland, a 42% reduction in falls,” Hoti says.

Orchard Care Homes is one of its early adopters. Baird, then the facility's director of quality, remembers the pre‑AI routine that was largely done “to prove compliance,” she says.

PainChek added an algorithm to that workflow, and the hybrid approach has paid off. Orchard's internal study of four care homes tracked monthly pain scores, behavioral incidents, and prescriptions. Within weeks, psychotropic scripts fell and residents' behavior calmed. The ripple effects went beyond pharmacy tallies. Residents who had skipped meals because of undetected dental pain “began eating again,” Baird notes, and “those who were isolated due to pain began socializing.”

Inside Orchard facilities, a cultural shift is underway. When Baird trained new staff, she likened pain “to measuring blood pressure or oxygen,” she says. “We wouldn't guess those, so why guess pain?” The analogy lands, but getting people fully on board is still a slog. Some nurses insist their clinical judgment is enough; others balk at another login and audit trail. “The sector has been slow to adopt technology, but it's changing,” Baird says. That's helped by the fact that administering a full Abbey Pain Scale takes 20 minutes, while a PainChek scan and checklist take less than five.

Engineers at PainChek are now adapting the code for the very youngest patients. PainChek Infant targets babies under one year, whose grimaces flicker faster than adults'. The algorithm, retrained on neonatal faces, detects six validated facial action units based on the well-established Baby Facial Action Coding System. PainChek Infant is starting limited testing in Australia while the company pursues a separate regulatory pathway.

Skeptics raise familiar red flags about these devices. Facial‑analysis AI has a history of skin‑tone bias, for example. Facial analysis may also misread grimaces stemming from nausea or fear. The tool is only as good as the yes‑or‑no answers that follow the scan; sloppy data entry can skew results in either direction. Results lack the broader clinical and interpersonal context a caregiver is likely to have from interacting with individual patients regularly and understanding their medical history. It's also possible that clinicians might defer too strongly to the algorithm, over-relying on outside judgment and eroding their own.

If PainChek is approved by the FDA this fall, it will be part of a broader effort to create a system of new pain measurement technology. Other startups are pitching EEG headbands for neuropathic pain, galvanic skin sensors that flag breakthrough cancer pain, and even language models that comb nursing notes for evidence of hidden distress. Still, quantifying pain with an external device could be rife with hidden issues, like bias or inaccuracies, that we will uncover only after significant use.

For Baird, the issue is fairly straightforward nonetheless. “I've lived with chronic pain and had a hard time getting people to believe me. [PainChek] would have made a huge difference,” she says. If artificial intelligence can give silent sufferers a numerical voice—and make clinicians listen—then adding one more line to the vital‑sign chart might be worth the screen time.

Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage can scale faster than other approaches. But some experts are dubious about the climate benefits.

Over the last century, much of the US pulp and paper industry crowded into the southeastern corner of the nation, setting up mills amid sprawling timber forests to strip the fibers from juvenile loblolly, long leaf, and slash pine trees.

Today, after the factories chip the softwood and digest it into pulp, the leftover lignin, spent chemicals, and remaining organic matter form a dark, syrupy by-product known as black liquor. It's then concentrated into a biofuel and burned, which heats the towering boilers that power the facility—and releases carbon dioxide into the air.

Microsoft, JP MorganChase, and a tech company consortium that includes Alphabet, Meta, Shopify, and Stripe have all recently struck multimillion-dollar deals to pay paper mill owners to capture at least hundreds of thousands of tons of this greenhouse gas by installing carbon scrubbing equipment in their facilities.

The captured carbon dioxide will then be piped down into saline aquifers more than a mile underground, where it should be sequestered permanently.

Big Tech is suddenly betting big on this form of carbon removal, known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS. The sector also includes biomass-fueled power plants, waste incinerators, and biofuel refineries that add carbon capturing equipment to their facilities.Since trees and other plants absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and these factories will trap emissions that would have gone into the air, together they can theoretically remove more greenhouse gas from the atmosphere than was released, achieving what's known as “negative emissions.”

The companies that pay for this removal can apply that reduction in carbon dioxide to cancel out a share of their own corporate pollution. BECCS now accounts for nearly 70% of the announced contracts in carbon removal, a popularity due largely to the fact that it can be tacked onto industrial facilities already operating on large scales.

“If we're balancing cost, time to market, and ultimate scale potential, BECCS offers a really attractive value proposition across all three of those,” says Brian Marrs, senior director of energy and carbon removal at Microsoft, which has become by far the largest buyer of carbon removal credits as it races to balance out its ongoing emissions by the end of the decade.

But experts have raised a number of concerns about various approaches to BECCS, stressing they may inflate the climate benefits of the projects, conflate prevented emissions with carbon removal, and extend the life of facilities that pollute in other ways. It could also create greater financial incentives to log forests or convert them to agricultural land. 

When greenhouse-gas sources and sinks are properly tallied across all the fields, forests, and factories involved, it's highly difficult to achieve negative emissions with many approaches to BECCS, says Tim Searchinger, a senior research scholar at Princeton University. That undermines the logic of dedicating more of the world's limited land, crops, and woods to such projects, he argues.

“I call it a ‘BECCS and switch,'” he says, adding later: “It's folly at some level.”

For a biomass-fueled power plant, BECCS works like this:A tree captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as it grows, sequestering the carbon in its bark, trunk, branches, and roots while releasing the oxygen. Someone then cuts it down, converts it into wood pellets, and delivers it to a power plant that, in turn, burns the wood to produce heat or electricity.

Usually, that facility will produce carbon dioxide as the wood incinerates. But under both European Union and US rules, the burning of the wood is generally treated as carbon neutral, so long as the timber forests are managed in sustainable ways and the various operations abide by other regulations. The argument is that the tree pulled CO2 out of the air in the first place, and new plant growth will bring that emissions debt back into balance over time. 

If that same power plant now captures a significant share of the greenhouse gas produced in the process and pumps it underground, the process can potentially go from carbon neutral to carbon negative.

But the starting assumption that biomass is carbon neutral is fundamentally flawed, because it doesn't fully take into account other ways that emissions are released throughout the process, according to Searchinger.

Among other things, a proper analysis must also ask: How much carbon is left behind in roots or branches on the forest floor that will begin to decompose and release greenhouse gases after the plant is removed? How much fossil fuel was burned in the process of cutting, collecting, and distributing the biomass? How much greenhouse gas was produced while converting timber into wood pellets and shipping them elsewhere? And how long will it take to grow back the trees or plants that would have otherwise continued capturing and storing carbon?

“If you're harvesting wood, it's essentially impossible to get negative emissions,” Searchinger says.

Burning biomass, or the biofuels created from it, can also produce other forms of pollution that can harm human health, including particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide.

Preventing carbon dioxide emissions at a given factory may necessitate capturing certain other pollutants as well, notably sulfur dioxide. But it doesn't necessarily filter out all the other pollution floating out of the flue stack, notes Emily Grubert, an associate professor of sustainable energy policy at the University of Notre Dame who focuses on carbon management issues and the transition away from fossil fuels. 

The idea that we might be able to use biomass to generate energy and suck down carbon dates back decades. But as global temperatures and emissions both continued to rise, climate modelers found that more and more BECCS or other types of carbon removal would be needed to prevent the planet from tipping past increasingly dangerous warming thresholds.

In addition to dramatic cuts in emissions, the world may need to suck down 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year by 2050 and 20 billion by 2100 to limit warming to 2 °C over preindustrial levels, according to a 2022 UN climate panel report. That's a threshold we're increasingly likely to blow past.

These grave climate warnings sparked growing interest and investments in ways to draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Companies sprang up offering to sink seaweed, bury biomass, develop carbon-sucking direct air capture factories, and add alkaline substances to agricultural fields or the oceans. 

But BECCS purchases have dwarfed those other approaches.

For companies with fast-approaching climate deadlines, BECCS is one of the few options for removing hundreds of thousands of tons over the next few years, says Robert Höglund, who cofounded CDR.fyi, ​​a public-benefit corporation that analyzes the carbon removal sector.

“If you have a target you want to meet in 2030 and you want durable carbon removal, that's the thing you can buy,” he says.

That's chiefly because these projects can harness the infrastructure of existing industries. At least for now, you don't have to finance, permit, and develop new facilities.

“They're not that hard to build, because it's often a retrofitting of an existing plant,” Höglund says. 

BECCS is also substantially less expensive for buyers than, say, direct air capture, with weighted average prices of $210 a ton compared with $490 among the deals to date, according to CDR.fyi. That's in part because capturing the carbon dioxide from, say, a pulp and paper mill, where it makes up around 15% of flue gas, takes far less energy than plucking CO2 molecules out of the open air, where they account for just 0.04%.

In 2020, Microsoft announced plans to become carbon negative by the end of this decade and, by midcentury, to remove all the emissions the company generated directly and from electricity use throughout its corporate history. 

It's leaning particularly heavily on BECCS to meet those climate commitments, with the category accounting for 76% of its known carbon removal purchases to date.

In April, the company announced it would purchase 3.7 million tons of carbon dioxide that a paper and pulp mill, located at some unspecified site in the southern US, will eventually capture and store over a 12-year period. It reached the deal through CO280, a startup based in Vancouver, British Columbia, that is forming joint ventures with paper and pulp mill companies in the US and Canada, to finance, develop, and operate the projects. 

It was the biggest carbon removal purchase on record—until four days later, when Microsoft revealed it had agreed to buy 6.75 million tons of carbon removal from AtmosClear, CDR.fyi noted. That company is building a biomass power plant at the Port of Greater Baton Rouge in Louisiana, which will run largely on sugarcane bagasse (a by-product of sugar production) and forest trimmings. AtmosClear says the facility will be able to capture 680,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year.

“What we've seen is a lot of these BECCS projects have been very helpful, if not transformational, for providing investment in rural economies,” Marrs says. “We look at our BECCS deals, in Louisiana with AtmosClear and some other Gulf State providers, like CO280, as a real means of helping support these economies, while at the same time promoting sustainable forestry practices.”

In earlier quarters, Microsoft also made substantial purchases from Orsted, which operates power plants that burn wood pellets; Gaia, which runs facilities that convert municipal waste into energy; and Arbor, whose plants are fueled by “overgrown brush, crop residues, and food waste.” 

Notably, at least three of these projects rely on some form of waste, a category distinct from fresh-cut timber or crops grown for the purpose of fueling BECCS projects. Solid waste, agricultural residues, logging leftovers, and plant material removed from forests to prevent fires present some of the ripest opportunities for BECCS—as well as some difficult questions of carbon accounting.

A 2019 report from the National Academy of Sciences estimated that the US could achieve more than 500 million tons of carbon removal a year through BECCS by 2040, while the world could exceed 3.5 billion tons, by relying just on agricultural by-products, logging residues, and organic waste—without needing to grow crops dedicated to energy.

Roger Aines, chief scientist of the energy program at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, argues we should at least be putting these sources to use rather than burning them or leaving them to decompose in fields. (Aines coauthored a similar analysis focused on California's waste biomass and contributed to a 2022 lab report prepared for Microsoft to evaluate costs and options for carbon removal purchases.)

He stresses that the BECCS sector can learn a lot from using that waste material. For example, it should help to provide a sharper sense of whether the carbon math will work if more land, forests, and crops are dedicated to these sorts of purposes.

“The point is you won't grow new material to do this in most cases, and won't have to for a very long time, because there's so much waste available,” Aines says. “If we get to that point, long into the future, we can address that then.”

But the critical question that emerges with waste is: Would it otherwise have been burned or allowed to decompose, or might some of it have been used in some other way that kept the carbon out of the atmosphere? 

Sugarcane bagasse, for instance, is or could also be used to produce recyclable packaging and paper, biodegradable food packaging and cutlery, building materials, or soil amendments that add nutrients back to agricultural fields.

“A lot of the time those materials are being used for something else already, so the accounting gets wonky really quickly,” Grubert says. 

Some fear that the financial incentives to pursue BECCS could also compel companies to trim away more trees and plants than is truly necessary to, say, manage forests or prevent fires—particularly as more and more BECCS plants create greater and greater demand for the limited supplies of such materials.

“Once you start capturing waste, you create an incentive to produce waste, so you have to be very careful about the perverse incentives,” says Danny Cullenward, a researcher and senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania who studies carbon markets.

Like other big tech companies, Microsoft has lost some momentum when it comes to its climate goals, in large part because of the surging energy demands of its AI data centers. 

But the company has generally earned a reputation for striving to clean up its direct emissions where possible and for seeking out high-quality approaches to carbon removal. It has consulted extensively with critically minded researchers at advisory firms like Carbon Direct and demonstrated a willingness to pay higher prices to support more credible projects.

Marrs says the company has extended that scrutiny to its BECCS deals.

“We want as much positive environmental impact as possible from every project,” he says.

“We're doing months and months of technical due diligence with teams that visit the site, that interview stakeholders, that produce a report for us that we go through in depth with a third-party engineering provider or technical perspective provider,” he adds.

In a follow-up statement, Microsoft stressed that it strives to validate that every BECCS project it supports will achieve negative emissions, whatever the fuel source.

“Across all of these projects, we conducted substantial due diligence to ensure that BECCS feedstocks would otherwise return carbon to the atmosphere in a few years,” the company said. 

Likewise, Jonathan Rhone, the cofounder and chief executive of CO280, stresses that they've worked with consultants, carbon market registries, and pulp and paper mills “to make sure we're adopting the best standards.” He says they strive to conservatively assess the release and uptake of greenhouse gases across the supply chain of the mills they work with, taking into account the type of biomass used by a given plant, the growth rate of the forests it's harvested from, the distance trucks drive to ship the timber or sawmill residues, the total emissions of the facility, and more.

Rhone says its typical projects will capture and store away on the order of 850,000 to 900,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. How much that would make up of the plant's total emissions would vary, based in part on how much of the facility's energy comes from by-product biomatter and how much comes from fossil fuels. For its first projects, the company will aim to capture 50% to 65% of the CO2 emissions at the pulp and paper mills, but it eventually hopes to exceed 90%. 

In a follow-up email, Rhone said the carbon capture equipment at the mills it works with will also prevent “substantial levels” of particulate matter and sulfur dioxide emissions and might reduce emissions of other pollutants as well.

The company is in active discussions with 10 pulp and paper mills in the Gulf Coast and Canada. Each carbon capture and storage project could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. 

“What we're trying to do at CO280 is show and demonstrate that we can create a stable, repeatable playbook for developing projects that are low risk and provide the market with what it wants, with what it needs,” Rhone says. 

Proponents of BECCS say we could leverage biomass to deliver substantial volumes of carbon removal, so long as appropriate industry standards are put in place to prevent, or at least minimize, bad behavior.

The question is whether that will be the case—or whether, as the BECCS sector matures, it will veer closer to the pattern of carbon offset markets. 

Studies and investigations have consistently shown that loosely regulated or poorly designed carbon credit and offset programs have allowed, if not invited, companies to significantly exaggerate the climate benefits of tree planting, forest preservation, and similar projects. 

“It appears to me to be something that will be manageable but that we'll always have to keep an eye on,” Aines says. 

Even with all these carbon accounting complexities, BECCS projects can often deliver climate benefits, particularly for existing plants.

Adding carbon capture to an operating paper and pulp mill, power plant, or refinery is at least an improvement over the status quo from a climate perspective, insofar as it prevents emissions that would otherwise have continued.

But ambitions for BECCS are already growing beyond existing plants: Last year Drax, the controversial UK power giant, announced plans to launch a Houston-based division tasked with developing enough new BECCS projects to deliver 6 million tons of carbon removal per year, in the US or elsewhere.

Numerous other companies have also built or proposed biomass power plants in recent years, with or without carbon capture systems—decisions driven in part by policies that classify them as carbon neutral.But if biomass isn't carbon neutral, as Searchinger and others argue it can't be in many applications, then these new unfiltered power plants are just adding more emissions to the atmosphere—and BECCS projects aren't drawing any out of the air. And if that's the case, it raises tough questions about corporate climate claims that depend on its doing so and the societal trade-offs involved in building lots of new plants dedicated to these purposes.

That's because crops grown for energy require land, fertilizer, insecticides, and human labor that might otherwise go toward producing food for an expanding global population. And greater demand for wood invites the timber industry to chop down more and more of the world's forests, which are already sucking up and storing away vast amounts of carbon dioxide and providing homes for immense varieties of plants and animals.

If these projects are merely preventing greenhouse gas from floating into the atmosphere but not drawing any down, we're better off adding carbon capture and storage (CCS) equipment to an existing natural-gas plant instead, Searchinger argues.

Companies may think that harnessing nature to draw carbon dioxide out of the sky sounds better than cutting the emissions of a fossil-fuel turbine. But the electricity from the latter plant would cost dramatically less, the carbon capture system would reduce emissions more for the amount of same energy generated, and it would avoid the added pressures to cut down trees, he says.

“People think some magic happens—this magic combination of using biomass and CCS creates something bigger than its parts,” Searchinger says. “But it's not magic; it's simply the sum of the two.” 

The industry is getting billions, but it's way too early to count on fusion to meet growing electricity demand.

Lilac Solutions is pioneering a new type of lithium extraction that could double US production in two years and shake up the industry. 

Plus, scientists are fighting back against the administration's climate misinformation.

Apple isn't quite ready to release its top-end MacBooks yet. But as a pity prize for getting through the awful year of 2025, the engineers on Apple's campus in Cupertino, California, have a new MacBook Pro with M5 to tide you over. Better yet, Apple claims this new 14-inch MacBook Pro offers better battery life than before.

The new MacBook Pro looks very, very similar to last year's MacBook Pro with M4. It's still using the same Liquid Retina XDR mini LED display as previous iterations did. Of course, that means it still has the notch hanging over the screen, like a guillotine blade on the edge of a terrible descent, not to mention the same Magic Keyboard design that's become standard across Mac products. If you were hoping we would finally receive the windfall of OLED on Mac, you'll probably have to wait until next year at the earliest.

Apple claims the new M5 chip is built specifically for AI and graphics performance. The new version of the M-series silicon includes new GPU cores, and each is packed with a neural accelerator. This is supposed to offer 3.5 times better AI performance than the previous generation—but let's be honest, you really care about how it will perform on graphics-intensive tasks. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M5's 10-core GPU promises 1.6 times faster graphics performance in some creative apps compared to the M4 chip. It should have better multi-thread performance for longer workloads, which may benefit code compiling or video editing. As for the 10-core CPU, it's propped up by four performance cores and six efficiency cores, promising 15% better multi-thread performance over M4. That could mean slightly faster performance in some video editing apps. The new iPad Pro and Vision Pro both sport a new M5 chip.

Apple promised the new MacBooks with M5 will run graphics workflows better with an enhanced ray tracing engine for more realistic lighting effects in 3D applications and games. The GPU also features enhanced shader cores to hopefully optimize games for the laptop. Many of these upgrades may not seem like big deals to everybody but the most hardcore Mac users. Apple made a big deal about upgrading the system's SSD storage speeds. This may make importing or exporting large RAW image files and videos faster. Buyers can now opt for up a 4TB SSD, as well.

As for battery life, Apple promised a 24-hour battery life, though that number is likely based on video playback tests, which normally support higher battery benchmarks. Still, even an 18-hour battery life would be a big benefit for regular users. The device will otherwise support fast charging through the MagSafe port—promising 0 to 50% in 30 minutes.

This will be the first MacBook to ship with macOS 26 Tahoe, which means you'll have to get used to Liquid Glass and changes to the Spotlight function sooner rather than later. The new MacBook Pro starts at $1,600 with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage. You'll need to spend $1,800 for a version with 1TB of storage and a whopping $2,000 for a model with 24GB of RAM. The device is up for preorder now, and units should start shipping Oct. 22, according to Apple. The MacBook is available in the usual Space Black and Silver colors.

Apple is effectively replacing the base M4 MacBook Pro with the M5 version. The M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBooks remain for the time being. Reliable leakers have suggested that a new MacBook Pro, powered by the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, could come next year, potentially with an upgraded chip design. Intel recently debuted its Panther Lake mobile chips with a unique design that expands the size of the GPU, or graphics processing unit. Panther Lake uses a die-to-die bridge to connect its GPU and CPU, meaning the former can be larger than it could be if the two were housed on the same die. Perhaps Apple is taking a similar approach with its upcoming chips. An upgraded GPU would make sense, considering that the company is pushing gaming on Mac far more than it has in previous years.

Whatever delights may be in store for Mac fans in 2026, at least Apple is signifying that it's not going to raise the prices of its lower-end models, even as it sits in the eye of President Donald Trump's tariff storm. Next year, however, could bring even more hardship to big tech's supply chains. We'll have to see if the company's current pricing scheme can survive.

Apple's Vision Pro is getting its first big upgrade since its release, and just like all the products Apple announced today, everything centers on the M5 chip. According to Apple, the introduction of the M5 brings quite a few benefits to the Vision Pro experience, including “10% more pixels on the custom micro-OLED displays,” which should equate to a sharper, better-defined viewing experience. A new 10-core GPU architecture will also enable ray tracing and very likely make gaming feel even more immersive, particularly when it comes to rendering light and shadow.

On top of that, the M5 will bump the Vision Pro's refresh rate to 120Hz, helping to reduce ghosting and make watching pretty much any experience involving lots of motion look even smoother. If you're worried about AI performance, the M5 will also perform better on that front. Apple says native AI experiences like Personas and spatial video run 50% faster, which may not be the most important metrics in the world, but they will be a boon to those who don't like waiting around for things to load. As you might expect from Apple silicon, the M5 sounds like a step up generation-to-generation, but it's not just about performance; the chip is also bringing much-needed battery improvements.

Apple says the M5 Vision Pro is rated for 2.5 hours of general use and three hours of video playback. That last one is especially important considering that the Vision Pro is still positioned as the best headset for long-form content thanks to its premium display. Speaking of wearing the Vision Pro for hours at a time, Apple is also introducing a new Dual Knit Band that has both upper and lower straps. That might not sound like the most mind-blowing upgrade, but having used the previous Vision Pro myself, I predict that extra support will go a long way, especially since the headset weighs between 600 and 650 grams. The band will also be sold separately for $99.

One thing you won't be getting in this generation is a discount. With the M5 and upgraded head strap, the price this generation will remain the same—which is to say, $3,500. That's a heck of a lot of money for a headset, but if you're in the market for a very expensive toy and have the cash to spare, this Vision Pro is shaping up to be the best, most performant one you can buy.

You can preorder the M5 Apple Vision Pro starting today, and the headset hits shelves on Oct. 22.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has greatly reshaped the country's public health infrastructure since taking over as U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary during the renewed Trump administration—and not for the better.

Still, from RFK Jr.'s pledge to take on fictional chemtrails to his recent fearmongering about circumcisions and autism, it might be hard for the average person to keep track of Kennedy's many inane beliefs related to health and wellness. So here's a handy guide to the supplements and alternative treatments that RFK Jr. has either advocated for or may personally be taking right this moment, and why they're probably not worth the hype.

Earlier this February, a viral video showed RFK Jr. dropping doses of a blue liquid into a glass of water during a flight. Though the exact nature of this concoction remains unconfirmed, internet sleuths concluded that he was likely taking methylene blue, a synthetic dye that's become a popular remedy among the alternative medicine community.

Methylene blue is commonly used as a diagnostic dye for some medical tests. It's also the primary treatment for methemoglobinemia, a rare blood disorder caused by the overproduction of methemoglobin, a form of hemoglobin. Online, however, the dye has taken on a second life as an advertised cure-all for everything under the Sun, from cancer to Alzheimer's disease.

Methylene blue has a long history in medicine, and it's certainly possible that scientists will find new uses for the versatile substance. But the most boisterous claims made by its adherents are often based on preliminary studies that still need more follow-up. The cancer studies on methylene blue, for instance, have largely involved animal or lab experiments. Some research has also suggested that methylene blue's anti-cancer effects would likely work best in combination with light therapy, not taken alone. And some studies have failed to support the supposed brain-boosting abilities of the dye.

All of which is to say: it's probably not time yet for all of us to start dosing our morning coffee with methylene blue.

The well-built Kennedy has admitted numerous times to taking testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) as a part of an anti-aging regimen prescribed by his doctors. He's also taken pains to deny that he uses steroids—a distinction without much difference (testosterone is a steroid, and many people use synthetic versions of it to build up muscle).

Men typically experience a gradual decline of testosterone as they age. And doctors commonly do prescribe TRT to men with lower than usual levels of testosterone, a condition that can be caused by various factors but is more common in men over 60. For these patients, TRT is generally safe and can provide numerous health benefits, including restored sex drive and improved mental health and energy. But many men continue to have normal testosterone levels long into their later years, and it's not at all clear whether TRT should be used to prolong healthy aging for the average man.

In the past, the Food and Drug Administration has warned the public about taking TRT solely to address “low testosterone levels due to aging,” noting that the benefits and safety of this use are not firmly established. Though research has suggested that typical TRT doesn't raise the risk of conditions like prostate cancer or heart attacks, it may be more dangerous for people who have normal levels of testosterone to begin with.

During a 2023 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, RFK Jr. stated that he was on an extensive regimen of vitamin supplements—adding that he couldn't even remember the entire list of them because he took so many.

Vitamin and mineral supplements can absolutely benefit people who are deficient in specific nutrients. Certain supplements are also an important preventative treatment at times, such as the recommended use of prenatal folic acid among pregnant women to prevent birth defects.

Today, people typically get these needed nutrients from food. By and large, studies haven't backed the idea that supplements are a cure-all for a wide range of health problems, as many in Kennedy's corner tend to profess. A 2018 review failed to find evidence that nutritional supplements generally improve heart health, for instance, as did a 2019 review the following year. Another review in 2021 found that supplements provide little help for losing weight.

These products aren't just worthless for most—they carry their own unique health risks. Compared to FDA-approved drugs, the supplement industry is much less regulated. These products can often contain toxic contaminants like fungi and bacteria, or even actual hidden drugs. And the supplements themselves can cause serious harm if taken in large or chronic enough doses.

In an interview on Gary Brecka's Ultimate Human Podcast earlier this June, RFK Jr. made clear his intentions to open up the floodgates of alternative medicine. He announced that he would expand people's access to experimental and off-label treatments, specifically referencing two treatments in particular: stem cell therapy and chelation.

Chelation drugs bind to heavy metals in the body, which then allows them to be excreted out through urine. Doctors routinely use chelation to treat certain kinds of acute poisoning or other toxic exposures. But in the alt med/MAHA world, chelation is instead used to “cleanse” people of supposed toxins blamed for a bevy of chronic illnesses, including autism. People have gotten seriously hurt or even died after taking improper chelation, and the FDA has warned the public to stay away from chelation therapy for autism.

These dangers might be an acceptable risk for RFK Jr. During the same interview, Kennedy admitted that expanded access to these treatments would likely come with a cost. “And of course you're going to get a lot of charlatans, and you're going to get people who have bad results,” he said. “And ultimately, you can't prevent that either way. Leaving the whole thing in the hands of pharma is not working for us.”

Kennedy is perhaps most well known for his fervent opposition to vaccination, complete with a long track record of misrepresenting the safety and effectiveness of many vaccines, including the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine.

During the height of a large-scale measles outbreak in Texas earlier this year—the largest seen in the state in three decades—RFK Jr. begrudgingly endorsed the use of the MMR vaccine. But he also tried to prop up several alternative treatments, namely cod liver oil, a supplement known for having high levels of vitamin A.

People deficient in vitamin A are at greater risk for a severe measles infection, and the World Health Organization does recommend that doctors provide vitamin A to measles-infected children living in areas where deficiency is common. But that doesn't describe the U.S. at all, since only around 0.3% of the general population may have a vitamin A deficiency. What's more, Kennedy's advice likely actually endangered children. At least one hospital in the state reported treating several children who had both measles and vitamin A toxicity.

RFK Jr. is an avid fan of unpasteurized, raw milk. He's said that he drinks it regularly, and earlier this May, he celebrated the release of his “Make America Healthy Again” report by doing raw milk shooters as part of a podcast interview with wellness influencer Paul Saladino.

Advocates commonly claim that raw milk tastes better than milk that's gone through pasteurization. Some will take it a step further and argue that raw milk has numerous added health benefits, from better nutrition to even helping prevent lactose intolerance.

The taste difference might come from raw milk having slightly more fat than your typical store-brand carton, experts have said. But the process of pasteurization, which simply heats and then cools milk to kill off dangerous germs and extend shelf life, doesn't dramatically change milk at all. You get the same important nutrients from pasteurized milk as you do from raw milk, and raw milk contains the same kind of lactose, so your tummy will hurt just the same if you're already intolerant to lactose in general.

Raw milk is significantly more likely to carry dangerous, or at least misery-inducing, foodborne germs like Salmonella, Listeria, and Campylobacter. The ongoing threat of bird flu and its recent spread to dairy cows has also made raw milk a potential vector for these infections as well. Unfortunately, many right-wingers and RFK Jr. supporters appear to have only become more enamored with raw milk as of late.

Apple's top-end iPad models will be first in line to showcase Apple's more powerful silicon, just as the iPad Pro with M4 did last generation. The new M5 iPad Pro is thin—even slimmer than the latest iPad Air—and it packs the same tandem OLED display and 11- and 13-inch flavors. It may essentially be a spec bump over last year's Pro model, but if you were planning on running endless tiled windows with iPadOS 26, that still makes it your best bet.

The new M5 chip is the highlight. It promises faster AI performance than its M4 predecessor thanks to new neural engines built into each of the 10 GPU cores. That could lead to 3.5 times better performance when using apps that leverage AI. The new iPad Pro also includes what appears to be the same 10-core CPU—with four performance and six efficiency cores—as the new MacBook Pro 14 with M5. This means an enhanced ray-tracing engine is coming to Apple's tablets, and that the new iPad Pro could be slightly better than the M4 silicon at 3D rendering.

Beyond the chip bump, the new iPads now support options for Apple's own optional C1X cellular modem and N1 wireless chip that debuted in the iPhone 17. Apple also promoted similar memory write and read speeds to the M5 MacBook Pro 14. Memory bandwidth has jumped to 150GB per second, which should make multitasking slightly faster on the new version than it was on the 2024 iPad Pro. Otherwise, the 11- and 13-inch models both support WiFi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread connectivity.

Why do you need a more powerful Apple tablet? Well, beyond the creative apps that require more horsepower, Apple promoted that the latest updates to iPadOS would enable users to have multiple apps on their screens at once. You'll still find your workspace constrained—even if you opt for the larger screen—but if you were planning on using your tablet for multitasking with several intensive programs running in the background, you may be better off with the more expensive iPad.

The 11-inch model of the new M5 iPad Pro starts at $1,000; you'll need to shell out $1,300 for the 13-inch version. Each comes with 256GB of storage at base, and if you jump for the 2TB options, prepare to spend $2,000 or more. That's without opting for 5G connectivity, the $130 Apple Pencil Pro, and the $300 Magic Keyboard. All options start shipping Oct. 22

A U.S. Border Patrol video featuring antisemitic lyrics went viral on X on Tuesday after far-right users discovered it had been posted to Facebook and Instagram. The video, which included the lyrics “Jew me” and “kike me,” was deleted from the platforms on Wednesday morning, though it's not clear whether the offensive content was taken down by Border Patrol or Meta.

The 13-second video appears to have been posted to Instagram in August, but was pinned in the Reels section of the official Border Patrol page, making it more visible to a wider audience. The video only gained widespread attention late Tuesday on X, where far-right extremists celebrated a signal that was clearly intended for them. The Instagram video had 3.4 million views when Gizmodo viewed it Tuesday night.

The audio used in the clip comes from Michael Jackson's controversial 1995 song “They Don't Care About Us.” The song includes the lyrics “Jew me, sue me, everybody do me/ Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me.”

The lyrics were criticized at the time for being antisemitic, though Jackson defended his words, insisting he didn't intend for them to be offensive. The singer, who died in 2009, issued an apology and later released an edited version of the song.

The video starts with footage of someone adjusting a bodycam before viewers see Border Patrol agents walking around with guns. Another shot shows a truck hauling Border Patrol dune buggies, and then a shot in the desert where a dune buggy kicks up dust behind it.

Gizmodo saved a copy of the Border Patrol video before it was taken down from Instagram and Facebook.

The video is very short, making it clear that the choice of lyrics was the intentional focus. Viewers are obviously meant to hear the antisemitic aspects, since it's more or less the only audio in the 13 seconds being presented. DHS didn't respond to questions from Gizmodo on Wednesday morning.

Comments on Instagram included people who clearly understood the message of the video as antisemitic. One commenter replied, “based song choice,” which was liked by the Border Patrol account. Another commenter wrote, “if you know you know.”

Comments from the far-right on X were even more explicit, including “This deserves 6 million likes and shares,” a reference to the number of Jews who died in the Holocaust.

Other commenters on X marveled at how mainstream their far-right and antisemitic ideas were becoming, with one person writing, “This movie is taking a strange turn. It's strange to me because I never thought I'd see this in the mainstream—it was always underground.”

And while it's accurate to describe the shift as “strange,” it was entirely predictable after President Donald Trump was inaugurated for a second time in January. Billionaire Elon Musk really kicked off the tone of the era with two Nazi-style salutes. Musk later denied he was making Nazi gestures, but many of his supporters clearly took it as a sign that they could drop the mask. Steve Bannon, a former top advisor to Trump, made the same salute not long after.

Trump himself has also said some extremely antisemitic things, including when he used the term “shylock” at a rally in July.

“No death tax, no estate tax, no going to the banks and borrowing from, in some cases, a fine banker. And in some cases, shylocks and bad people.”

In fact, there's an entire Wikipedia page devoted to collecting examples of Trump's antisemitism.

U.S. Border Patrol is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which has been posting far-right extremist content since Trump took office for a second time. In a tweet on Tuesday, DHS posted just one word, “Remigrate,” a term more popular in Europe among the far-right that refers to ethnic cleansing through deporting non-white people.

DHS also posted a video that included the words “Save America” in a typeface that's clearly meant to evoke Nazi-era imagery.

DHS has frequently posted fascist propaganda using copyrighted material without permission, something that sometimes gets the content removed from the major social media platforms.

The people of DHS often know they're the bad guys, like when they responded to questions from John Oliver's HBO show by talking about the “heroism” of Darth Vader. The late-night host was asking about a video posted by Gregory Bovino—the new face of anti-immigrant operations in the U.S., with his frequent appearances on TV—where Vader is destroying rebel forces labeled with things like “gang member,” and “fake news.”

Is a lot of this trolling? Sure, that's one defense of it. But at some point, you own the words and images that you push into the world. And if you spend all day, every day saying racist and antisemitic things, people have to start taking you at your word.

Not to mention the fact that DHS has real power in the world to upend lives and has no business joking or “trolling” the American people. Agencies under DHS, like ICE, are currently harassing and arresting people for looking Latino. And that often includes American citizens.

Ironically, DHS said back in April that social media would be screened for “antisemitism” by any foreign nationals in the country. In reality, DHS was looking for anyone who opposed the war in Gaza, falsely equating such a position with antisemitism. The U.S. State Department announced Tuesday it had canceled the visas of six people who had written negative things about Charlie Kirk.

Antisemitism runs deep in the modern Republican Party. Politico published leaked texts from the Young Republicans on Tuesday, which included messages like “I love Hitler.” Vice President JD Vance defended the texts and dismissed criticism as “pearl-clutching.” And guys like Vance know their audience. They can be dismissed as shitposters, but they're some of the most vile racists on the planet, and they're becoming normalized in ways that would've been unthinkable even a decade ago.

Americans who are opposed to Trump plan to stage nationwide protests on Saturday, Oct. 18, for what's being dubbed another No Kings rally. Republicans have tried to characterize the upcoming protests as hate marches, falsely insisting they would be full of “Hamas supporters.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Wednesday that the reason the government hasn't opened yet is because of the upcoming demonstrations, a claim that makes no sense whatsoever.

“This crazy No Kings rally this weekend, which is gonna be the farthest left, the hardest core, the most unhinged in the Democratic Party, which is a big title. No Kings equals no paychecks,” said Bessent.

Bessent: “This crazy No Kings rally this weekend, which is gonna be the farthest left, the hardest core, the most unhinged in the Democratic Party, which is a big title. No Kings equals no paychecks.”

The No Kings rally, which is likely to include a wide variety of Americans who are opposed to Trump's fascist takeover of the country, has a website that allows people to find their nearest demonstration. It won't just be the “hardest core,” as Bessent puts it, if past protests are any guide.

Correction: This article originally stated that the Instagram video had been viewed 4.3 million times before it was deleted. It was 3.4 million. Gizmodo regrets the error.

Everything is an Xbox now, right? If that's the case, why can't we mod our smart fridge or smart toaster with screens to transform them into the rough approximation of an Xbox gaming machine? The hard truth is that there is no unified sense of “Xbox” anymore. That's epitomized by the $1,000 Asus ROG Xbox Ally X handheld. It's the first piece of real gaming hardware with an Xbox name to roll out in five years. Despite the moniker, it's far more of a PC than it is any flavor of Xbox console. And thanks to Microsoft's efforts to fix Windows for a small screen, it's one of the best handheld PCs yet.

The ROG Xbox Ally X can certainly compete with Valve's Steam Deck, and it can do so without worrying about kernel anti-cheat compatibility. The one point it can't compete on is price. At $1,000, the ROG Xbox Ally X will seem like an overindulgent splurge that won't net you the ease or comforts of a true-blue console. And though it has better graphics potential than Valve's handheld, maximizing its capabilities requires coaxing.

If this is what we can expect from “Xbox” going forward, then console gamers had better get used to their new PC playground—whether that means adjusting power and graphics settings or dealing with Windows' penchant for bugs and missing settings. But it also means a cleaner, more gamer-focused experience than any other handheld Windows device released over the past several years can match.

Asus ROG Xbox Ally X

It's the first step on a long road to reinventing the Xbox brand. In the meantime, it's one of the best handheld PCs you can get, despite one glaring bug.

Pros

Cons

The real innovation of the Xbox Ally is the new “full screen experience,” or FSE. The built-in software finally alleviates the excruciating experience of forcing Windows 11 desktop to run on a 7-inch screen. Now, a hit of that newfangled Xbox button pulls up most (but not all) of the features and apps you need. Even better, you can access games across the most popular game launchers with a few quick taps. Plus, the device promises better performance on this version of Windows. In our tests, that proved true compared to devices with similar specs.

The new UI is imperfect, and the software is far from complete. You'll still find game launchers or incongruous settings that require you to muddy your screen with your grubby fingerprints. There are options missing—some are still stuck behind Windows settings—and I've experienced concerning issues with the device depleting standby power, as if leaking juice like sand through an hourglass. Since this handheld has the entire weight of Microsoft's gaming arm behind it, I hope updates come swiftly and that the FSE makes its way to more handhelds than just the one bearing Microsoft's Xbox logo.

 View this post on Instagram



Still, this isn't the Nintendo Switch 2 of the Xbox brand. The Xbox Ally is the kind of device to make me imagine what a true merging of PC and Xbox could be. It could prove an expensive disaster—or a glorious (but still expensive) shift to the entire gaming landscape.

Xbox told me that Microsoft and Asus started working together shortly after the launch of the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X to craft the new handheld. What, can't you tell? It's the two prongs on both sides of the device that the two partners in crime claim was modeled directly on the Xbox wireless controller. When you hold the controller and Xbox Ally up together, you'll see the similarity isn't 1-to-1—not that it matters. Each prong holds a rumble motor that feels far more present than those of other unibody handhelds do.

Despite all that, I wouldn't go as far as to say it's more ergonomic than flat body designs. I can curl my digits around a Steam Deck and play comfortably just as well as I can with the ROG Xbox Ally X.

This is still a PC. With that in mind, you have access to two USB-C ports (one being USB-4 compatible, for hooking up external devices like an eGPU) on top alongside a microSD slot and a headphone jack. There's no port on the bottom to enable a Switch-like dock. In fact, all your regular Steam Deck docks you bought for other handhelds may not work as well with the two grips sticking out from the body. My Steam Deck Dock from Gulikit does not fit the Xbox Ally, even though it's perfectly usable with past handhelds.

While I didn't find the grips supremely comfortable, there's another extra benefit to the controller-like design. My wrists never fell asleep as I lost circulation while playing while lying down, like they often do when I'm using my personal Steam Deck or Switch 2. I like to play my handhelds in bed, so the extra grips proved to be a plus despite making the handheld even thicker.

It weighs in at 1.58 pounds, which is barely any more heft than the original $800 ROG Ally X and lighter than other handheld PCs like the Legion Go lineup.

The triggers and bumper buttons also have a feel akin to the Xbox controller and its “Impulse” triggers with individual vibration motors. The sides of the device are sloped more than they are on the ROG Ally X, meaning I don't need to perform any crab claw gestures to access the LB and RB buttons. But if you were expecting the device to feel exactly like an Xbox controller, you'll end up disappointed. The A,B,X,Y layout is the same, but the look and feel of both the buttons and joysticks are far more ROG Ally than Xbox.

In the end, all that matters is if it feels good to play. I can comfortably say: It does.

Beyond the twin menu buttons, the only switch you need to care about for menu navigation is the new Xbox button found next to Asus' own Armoury Crate toggle. Hitting the button once brings up the Game Bar menu, delivering quick access to your game library across all launchers. Hitting the library button will take you to the Xbox app, where you can access Game Pass (you get a three-month Xbox Game Pass Premium subscription with the device; just don't forget to cancel) and Xbox Cloud gaming. It's here you'll also find your library of both games and supported apps, which mostly include game launchers.

Xbox gamers who have never had to even consider their consoles' power draw will now need to start thinking about TDP, or thermal design power. Despite originally telling me it was working on a replacement for power management, Microsoft left Asus' Armoury Crate software in this handheld. You can access the program from the Game Bar to tweak the power draw you're sending to the processor. More TDP means better performance at the cost of battery life. As a rule of thumb, you can stick to lower performance modes for two-dimensional or less intensive games. For everything else, shift it to “Turbo,” which ends up at 25W on battery power, or the max 35W if you have the device plugged in.

How does it fare compared to Valve's SteamOS, the Linux-based operating system made popular by the Steam Deck? Like SteamOS, the Windows FSE is a controller-first layout designed to make accessing the Xbox game store and your game library easier than it is on a desktop. Firms like Asus, Lenovo, and MSI have designed front ends to enable some easy access to your titles, but the FSE has come closest to a “console-like” feel.

When you hold down the Xbox button, you can easily swap between open apps. Want to access Steam's Big Picture Mode? It's a few taps away, with no need to muddy the touchscreen with your fingerprints. It's here you'll also see an option to open up desktop mode if there are platforms you can't access through the Xbox app.

Asus originally described the FSE to me as the system dual booting Windows. However, the improved performance is available in either variation.

As if you needed another reminder, this is a PC, not an Xbox console. A 2023 update redesigned the Xbox app so it could be navigated with a controller. There's still more work to be done on this front. You can't use the right stick to scroll. There isn't enough use of the RB and LB buttons for navigating through side-by-side menus. Beyond those hangups, what's particularly egregious is just how limited Microsoft made its first-party software. On the Linux-based SteamOS, I can drop into the desktop mode, install Emulation Station, and access it from the Steam Deck's home menu. The Xbox app will recognize apps like GOG Galaxy, Epic Games Store, Battle.net, and Ubisoft Connect, but it won't enable other apps you may load on. Accessing them requires entering the Desktop Mode. SteamOS can be tweaked to allow third-party apps to appear on the home screen, but Microsoft, being Microsoft, won't let you do the same with the FSE.

What's often lost in the rat race for better performance is the fact that small improvements mean a lot on a power-sipping device like a handheld: A 5 fps difference can determine whether a game is playable or not.

AMD's Ryzen Z2 Extreme offers only a marginal bump in performance compared with the Ryzen Z1 Extreme that hit the scene two years ago. However, the updates Microsoft made to Windows 11 also supposedly limit background tasks and boost performance. From what I experienced comparing the Lenovo Legion Go 2 to the ROG Xbox Ally X, that seems to check out. Asus' device displayed small performance gains (the delta varied by title, of course) at the same resolution and TDP.

There are areas in which Lenovo's handheld wins, of course. The Legion Go 2 contains 32GB of RAM; the Ally sports just 24 alongside its 1TB of SSD storage. The Legion also sports a massive 8.8-inch OLED display. After spending more than a week with the Xbox Ally's 7-inch IPS LCD, I miss those deeper black levels and contrast.

But for that specific upgrade, you have to drop the price equivalent of a new Nintendo Switch—$350 after recent price hikes. Lenovo's Legion Go 2 held the price record among AMD Ryzen Z-series devices with the astronomical $1,350 launch price of its AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme model. The same APU—or accelerated processing unit—can be found in the much more affordable ROG Xbox Ally.

At 1080p resolution and 35W when plugged in, I could get around 52 frames per second in Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam Deck settings. In actual gameplay, you'll see frame rates at just under 50 fps in most scenarios. At 30W, last year's ROG Ally hits around 46 fps. Other games, like Shadow of the Tomb Raider, see better uplift, with the new Xbox Ally X netting around 10 fps more than its predecessor.

Synthetic benchmarks may help us get a better idea of how much the device has improved. The Xbox Ally X netted around 400 points more than its predecessor did on 3DMark Steel Nomad Light and did 600 points better on 3DMark Time Spy. In actual gameplay, the difference is more minute, especially at the highest wattage. On some tests, notably 3DMark and games like Baldur's Gate III, the device didn't perform exceptionally better than the MSI Claw 8 AI+ running an Intel Core Ultra 258V. On others, the Ryzen Z2 Extreme underperformed Intel's mobile chip.

But the Z2 Extreme's secret weapon is that it performs better at lower wattages than previous generations did. When testing multiple games at 15-25W, relying often on AMD's FSR upscaling, I could finally achieve playable frame rates on titles like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Star Wars Outlaws. (Even on the “Turbo” profile, the device defaults to 25W when running on battery.) I found that I could run multiple current AAA games, and a few unreleased Xbox titles, at playable frame rates with just a bit of finagling in the graphics settings.

And here's another secret: You don't even need the FSE to get this boost. Xbox claimed the latest Windows build (which includes the FSE) would separately enhance the Ally's performance, and that has more than panned out. I updated the Lenovo Legion Go 2 to the latest Windows Insider Update without bothering to install the updated user interface. It displayed bigger performance improvements than the Ally had (perhaps influenced by the Legion's additional memory, which is the most significant difference between the two systems). The update moved the needle by 5 fps or more in games like Cyberpunk 2077 and up to 3 fps in Shadow of the Tomb Raider.

There's a voice in the back of my brain that's hard to ignore. It tells me to shake my fist at Microsoft in a “man yells at cloud” fashion over how simple this fix seems to have been. Are you telling me we could have had this level of gaming performance on Windows this whole time?

There's a “just fine” quality to the ROG Xbox Ally's 1080p display. It's a semi-glossy IPS LCD that lacks the “inky” qualities of OLED. I eventually tired of the large bezels surrounding the display, and the size makes it difficult to read text in RPGs like Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader and other RPGs. The screen is plenty bright indoors and in ambient light, but it's still not enough to survive direct sunlight. It didn't help that I was moving between the Asus model and the Legion Go 2 in quick succession; for some, the larger screen will probably be worth the extra heft. Still, the Ally's panel is serviceable in the same way that Apple's MacBook displays get the job done, even if it's the same damn screen every damn year and there's a big notch.

The 120Hz refresh rate, now a constant throughout three Ally generations, is more than enough for 3D titles. However, when you opt to play a game like Hollow Knight: Silksong or Hades II, and your game can easily net over 160 fps on the lowest power settings, you may start to feel a little cheated after paying $1,000 for a handheld like this.

Sound quality through the dual speakers was nothing to write home about either. Audio got plenty loud, but unlike when using the Legion Go 2, I wanted to reach for a pair of gaming headphones or earbuds more often. It wasn't terrible, and neither were the visuals, but the whole affair did feel a bit lackluster for a third-generation device in the Ally's price category.

Handhelds don't have great battery life. The Xbox Ally X, with its 80Wh battery, can claim more playable time than most other handhelds. The Lenovo Legion Go 2 and MSI Claw 8 AI+, with their larger screens and higher resolution, will sap energy faster. The Switch 2 has notoriously poor battery life, and you'll be lucky to get two hours out of that. Still, don't count on the Ally to get you through long-haul flights. I eked out around three and half playable hours of Hades II at low power before the device was begging for the sweet embrace of a power cable. More intense titles could cut another hour off that span.

The Xbox Ally X has other problems when trying to go to sleep. There were times I tried to put it to bed by hitting the power button, only to receive a gray screen and be prompted to restart my game.

There were also multiple instances in which I thought I'd successfully put my review unit to sleep via the power button, only to later find it had been sucking power for hours and eventually died. The fans would occasionally kick in while asleep, which indicates to me there's an issue Microsoft needs to fix before I can safely store the device away after a quick gaming session.

It's clear Microsoft was working on this software until the last minute, and that means there's still work needed to clear up these glitches. The issues were enough to diminish what would otherwise have been a glowing review.

High-end handhelds now cost more than $1,000. Sorry, but that's what we should expect from now until Sony releases a handheld PlayStation 6. The base ROG Xbox Ally, available in in white, features a lower-end Ryzen Z2A chip that I have not yet had the opportunity to fully test. That system is positioned to compete with the $550 Steam Deck OLED and Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS. Inevitably, because of tariffs and trade retaliations from China, we shouldn't expect many budget handheld releases aside from Nintendo's more restrictive hybrid console.

There's a part of me that believes prospective handheld buyers should hold off for the next generation. Today's Z2 Extreme devices are running on an RDNA 3.5 GPU. Tomorrow's may instead include a chip based on AMD's RDNA 4 architecture, which would mean access to AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution 4. That would offer improved AI upscaling, making games appear to run at higher resolutions than they actually are. The technology may be a staple of future consoles, and Microsoft and Sony will likely push developers to use it. The Xbox Ally X will be left out of the loop.

On the other hand, Microsoft seems keen to improve the FSE in preparation for a next-gen Xbox console. Hopefully, that means Xbox has enough incentive to fix what's broken and polish the experience to a squeaky-clean shine. Is that enough to make me abandon the Steam Deck? Maybe one day. Is it enough to give Xbox gamers the new hardware they're looking for? It'll depend on their tolerance for the PC gaming lifestyle.

No word on M5 Pro or Max, yet.

After teasing a new product launch on X earlier today, Apple has just announced the 2025 refresh to its 14-inch MacBook Pro lineup, now equipped with the shiny new M5 chip. The press release, accompanied by a separate M5 announcement, was just published on the company's website, unpacking the new laptop in great detail. It's largely an iterative update, with the new chip nicely slotting in for yesteryear's M4 in an otherwise largely unchanged package.

There are no design tweaks or exciting features to speak of. The chassis, including the 14-inch Mini LED display, is identical to previous models — just like all the other core features such as ports, speakers, keyboard, trackpad, and even the 12 MP webcam. The battery is once again quoted to last 24 hours in video playback, and you still only get Wi-Fi 6E. However, the SSD is 2x faster compared to last gen, and you can now spec it up to 4 TB, twice as much as previous gen.

 




It's clear that Apple is entirely focused on what's inside, the latest generation of its homegrown M-series silicon — M5. This swap is what likely enables the memory bandwidth to be upgraded from 120 GB/s on the M4 to now ""over 150 GB/s"" on the M5.

The SoC package includes a 10-core CPU, a 10-core GPU with ""a Neural Accelerator in each core,"" and a 16-core NPU for on-device AI. The M5 chip is built on TSMC's N3P node and has a faster GPU that can deliver 1.6x more FPS in games, 20% faster multi-core CPU performance, and 1.7x quicker render times in Blender — all versus the M4. Apple even says it's 86x more powerful than Intel-based Macs in AI applications.

The price for the new 14-inch MacBook Pro remains the same as last year, with the base model starting at $1,599, offering you a 512 GB SSD and 16 GB of RAM. Keep in mind that, just like M4, the base M5 isn't available on the 16-inch models as they start out with a Pro chip (so, presumably M5 Pro). The device is available to pre-order right away, with general availability beginning next week on October 22. Alongside the MacBook Pro, Apple also refreshed the Vision Pro and the iPad Pro with the new M5 chip.

 




The tablet gets Apple's in-house C1X modem and N1 networking chip that brings Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6 support, offering faster connectivity across the board with 30% less power usage compared to the M4 iPad Pro. On the other hand, the mixed reality headset now has a new Dual Knit headband, also available for purchase separately for $99. Therefore, M5's improvements in performance, battery life, and AI-powered workflows are present on the Vision Pro and iPad Pro as well.

Accompanying that is the fresh software for each of these devices, including the MacBook Pro, with the latest OS versions adding newer features and, of course, the Liquid Glass visual overhaul. Prices remain the same as last gen for both the iPad and Vision Pro as well.

Apple's 3nm M5 is here


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Cupertino just launched its 5th-generation Apple silicon, the M5 chip, with the company saying that it has embedded a neural accelerator in each GPU core, allowing it to run AI workloads much faster. Aside from that, Apple says that the base M5 chip now has a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU, giving the newer processor two extra cores in both the graphics and general compute departments compared to the previous generation's entry-level SoC.

“M5 ushers in the next big leap in AI performance for Apple silicon. With the introduction of Neural Accelerators in the GPU, M5 delivers a huge boost to AI workloads,” Apple Senior Vice President of Hardware Technologies Johny Srouji said. “Combined with a big increase in graphics performance, the world's fastest CPU core, a faster Neural Engine, and even higher unified memory bandwidth, M5 brings far more performance and capabilities to MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Apple Vision Pro.”

Although it still uses 3nm technology from TSMC, the N3P process node used on the M5 (versus N3E on the M4) delivers improved capability through slightly higher transistor density. The company says that it has four times the peak GPU performance when it comes to AI processing over the M4, and that it offers up to 45% better graphics quality, plus third-generation ray tracing capability. There's also a 30% bump in memory bandwidth, with the speed going from 120GB/sec to 153GB/sec in the M5, and, of course, a 15% improvement in multithreaded performance.

Apple's press release mostly focuses on the chip's better performance in artificial intelligence workloads, but we're also hopeful that these numbers will translate to a better gaming experience on the Mac. Unfortunately, we don't know how the chip will perform compared to its competitors from AMD and Nvidia in the 14-inch MacBook Pro, as we haven't seen benchmarks yet. However, a leaked Geekbench result of an M5-powered iPad Pro showed the base M5 matching the M4 Max and beating every other competitor in the single-core test.

Those who want to be on the latest, cutting-edge Apple hardware can now pre-order the Apple M5 chip inside the MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Apple Vision Pro. The company expects these devices to ship on the 22nd, with in-store availability arriving on the same day.

Those who are already on Apple M3 or newer should wait for third-party benchmarks to appear, just so they know if the M5 is worth upgrading to or if they should wait a couple more years. We also don't have the Pro and Max versions of the M5 (or the M4 Ultra) just yet, but the company typically waits a few months before releasing them to the public.

'We clarify that MSI has never officially sold or distributed the GeForce RTX 5090 in China'


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


MSI has issued a statement clarifying that it does not sell Nvidia's RTX 5090 GPU, following a spate of rumors and a photograph circulating online depicting hundreds of MSI-branded cards at an unspecified location in the country.

Three days ago, a user on Reddit posted an image showing unattended pallets of RTX 5090 GPUs lying in a street in China. This prompted online chatter pertaining to a lack of enforcement for export controls, as the RTX 5090 is one of many high-end cards that are banned from export to China. Aware of the PR connotations of getting caught, or even accused, of dealing the GPUs in the region, MSI was quick to issue a rebuttal.

In a new statement posted on its site, the company has clarified that it had nothing to do with the RTX 5090 shipments spotted in China, and claims the global serial number tracking has confirmed they are parallel imports — when a genuine product is imported through questionable means, without the explicit permission of the parent company.

Dealers skirting export controls on high-demand GPUs remains a headache for Washington. Just recently, a Singaporean company was accused of helping smuggle $2 billion worth of Nvidia GPUs into the country. We've known for a while now that underground markets exist in the region, where cards are regularly modded with increased VRAM to make them better for AI applications.

All of this leads to a precedent where, even though Beijing shouldn't be the recipient of high-end AI cards on paper, reality begs to differ. Nvidia has made region-specific RTX 5090D and 5090D V2 models for China, but they carry neutered specs, which leads to shady, black-market shipments thriving. Nvidia has always held the position that China is an important market for the chipmaker, but that it, too, has nothing to do with how the region keeps getting its hands on banned GPUs.

 




MSI reiterated that it only sells its RTX 5090 in the U.S., Europe, and some Asia-Pacific markets, and that any unauthorized units obtained via grey channels are not covered under warranty. These illicit GPUs allegedly arrived in China through third-party resellers and retailers in overseas markets who bypassed regulations and illegally imported the cards.

While there was no word on any active investigations or whether the hardware manufacturer plans to take action, MSI did note that any products bought through non-official channels may have been resold or tampered with, and aren't eligible for warranty, repair services, or technical support. MSI is a Taiwanese company, a country that remains imperative in the ongoing U.S.–China trade war, and is an extremely sensitive region geopolitically. A significant portion of MSI's production facilities is located in Mainland China.

The GPU shortage during COVID could soon look like child's play.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AI datacenters are eating up the world's supply standard DRAM memory, NAND flash for SSDs, and hard drives. Adata chairman Simon Chen just made it extremely clear that in his three-decade tenure in the industry, he's never witnessed a simultaneous shortage of all of the aforementioned components, via a DigiTimes Asia report.

Chen goes on to explicitly state that Adata and its usual competitors aren't fighting between themselves for supply in what would be businesss as usual. Instead, cloud service providers (CSPs) — almost always AI datacenters in this day and age — are now gobbling up all available capacity of these components.

As if all that wasn't enough, Chen believes that the shortage of hard drives is incentivizing customers to try and purchase SSDs for non-volatile storage needs instead, further twisting the spiral of storage scarcity. Adata's sales team has purportedly gotten instructions to ""sell sparingly"" and ""give priority to loyal customers"" in turn.

Additionally, the inventory at upstream suppliers is charitably described as barebones, with only two to three weeks' worth of supply, down from the usual two-to-three months of capacity. In other words, that means that SK hynix, Samsung, Micron, Kioxia, and Western Digital are selling most everything they make to AI projects.

In case you're not entirely convinced of how big a deal Chen's suspicion-confirming statements are, Adata had a 11% share in the SSD market in 2024, and holds a 5% slice of the memory market. Those are small percentages, but they're for the entire world, meaning that Adata purchases memory and flash chips at large volumes and careful negotiated prices. The deals are likely done multiple months in advance, and Adata certainly would otherwise have far bigger negotiation power than, say, Joe's Discount Memory.

The company's stock price has climbed sky-high since August, and it hit a 15-year revenue high in Q2 2025. That's keeping in tandem with the general industry trend, with DRAM revenue jumping 17.1% in the past fiscal quarter, and enterprise SSD revenue boosting by 12.7%. Even CPU/GPU chipmakers are charging gigantic premiums for their top-shelf wares, too.

All of this AI-fueled demand is now affecting the supply chain for all modern consumer electronics. Most any advanced device, including phones, TVs, consoles, and cars, all need one or more of the components that are now in high demand. If you're on the fence on whether to purchase a new handset, computer, or television, you'd be wise to consider moving sooner rather than later. Even if AI isn't taking all of our jobs, it seems poised to take all of our silicon.

MINTernet is the latest in the growing field of home 5G internet services


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Several cell providers have hopped on the 5G home internet service bandwagon, with T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon offering service in select areas across the United States. Now, a new player is entering the fray: Mint Mobile. Mint Mobile is a subsidiary of T-Mobile, which is a known quantity in this segment, and its new service is called MINTernet.

Unsurprisingly, MINTernet operates on T-Mobile's nationwide wireless network, offering unlimited 5G service. Now, whenever unlimited data is mentioned in the 5G realm, you should always look at the fine print. In this case, Mint Mobile says that once you consume over 1TB of data within your billing cycle, ""network speeds vary and may be reduced."" This is similar to the T-Mobile Home Internet policy, where the restriction is implemented after exceeding the 1.2TB threshold.

Regarding the speeds you can expect, the ""Broadband Facts"" label for MINTernet indicates that typical download speeds will range from 133 to 415 Mbps, while uploads should reach a maximum of around 55 Mbps. As for latency, expect to see 16 to 28 ms in most situations.

MINTernet costs $40 per month if you opt for the introductory 3-month offer, and this price is contingent upon paying the entire cost upfront ($120). However, if you already have a Mint phone plan (or intend to add one at the time of signup), your monthly cost drops to $30 ($90 upfront).

A 6-month plan is also offered at $45/month ($270 upfront) or $35/month ($210 upfront) with a phone plan. Finally, there's a 12-month plan that drops back down to $40/month ($480 upfront) or $30/month ($360) with a qualifying phone plan. All customers will get a free 5G gateway (modem/Wi-Fi router) with their order, along with a 14-day money-back guarantee.

Considering that MINTernet runs on T-Mobile's 5G network, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that my first run-in with its 5G home internet service ended in disaster in 2022. However, I revisited the service in 2024 with much better results, averaging over 600 Mbps for downloads and over 50 Mbps for uploads. T-Mobile Home Internet costs $50/month with autopay, so if you tick the right boxes, MINTernet will save you up to $20/month.

The Asus ROG Xbox Ally X has excellent ergonomics thanks to controller-style grips, and Microsoft's handheld-focused Xbox experience is far better than using the Windows 11 desktop. The AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme delivers improved performance, but it may not be worth upgrading if you have an existing Ally.

Comfortable with controller grips and balanced weight

Xbox Full Screen Experience is way easier to use than standard Windows 11

Improved performance, especially at 720p

Finally, an Xbox button

More expensive than last-gen ROG Ally X

Screen isn't as vivid as OLED-based competition

No included carrying case

Some features are promised down the line, so this isn't finished yet

Outside of Valve's Steam Deck, the weakest link in PC gaming handhelds has been Windows 11. Time after time after time, Windows 11's lack of a true gaming-first mode has made it just short of a dealbreaker even on some of the best PC gaming handhelds.

But when Asus teamed up with Xbox on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X ($999.99 as tested), it didn't just mean new hardware with the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme chip and comfortable grips; it also meant a full-screen Xbox mode that is easy to navigate with a controller and even hides some of the components from Windows 11 that can slow down gaming. It doesn't have Steam Deck levels of polish, but it's a revelation compared to the standard Windows desktop.

But that Xbox menu hides PC levels of customization and complexity. Me? I loved having my Steam and Epic libraries next to games from my Xbox collection. (Or at least, the ones that support Xbox Play Anywhere.) But to Xbox purists or those who haven't dipped a toe into PC gaming before, I think this might be frustrating, and will raise questions about what an Xbox is and what the future of Xbox looks like.

All in all, the ROG Xbox Ally X feels far more like an Asus gaming handheld than an Xbox one. But outside of tremendously comfortable ergonomics, it's Microsoft's software engineering that makes the Xbox Ally X one of the best PC gaming handhelds around. That is, at least until Microsoft makes the updated operating system available on all Windows 11-based gaming handhelds.

Reviewer's note: Our ROG Xbox Ally X came without a final build of the Xbox Full Screen Experience. My first hours with the device were spent setting it up through my Xbox Insider account and installing the latest drivers and BIOS updates, which customers won't have to do. Still, that means there could be a few changes in the final software, including what should be an improved device setup experience. If we learn of any major changes, I'll amend this review.

The Xbox controller is effectively the default controller in PC gaming (other than a mouse and keyboard). So it's honestly a bit surprising it's taken this long for a major PC company to copy that gamepad's comfortable prongs and adapt them to a gaming handheld. It worked for the PlayStation Portal!

Otherwise, though, this Ally looks much like the 2024 Ally X that came before it, with an angular design, plenty of ROG branding, and dedicated buttons for Asus' Armory Crate. Other than an Xbox button, which Windows 11 handhelds have desperately needed for a while now, there is nothing that makes this feel like an Xbox based on Microsoft's current console designs (although there is a repeating ROG XBOX pattern in tiny print on the device). If Asus had released this design without calling it an Xbox, I'd be none the wiser. It has a blacked-out color scheme with hints of red on the buttons. I would've liked to see the Xbox-colored buttons on the vanilla ROG Xbox Ally.

The prongs feel great. This is the most natural a handheld has felt in my hand so far since the Steam Deck. These grips do make the system wider than some other systems, however, which makes it a bit bulky for travel. I was surprised at how good the system felt in my hands. It's wide in a way that makes it look like it would be awkward, but the weight is distributed very evenly, and I was comfortable even for long play sessions. It really does feel like you're using a controller.

Other than that, the general look of the system is almost identical to the ROG Ally X from 2024. You get a very classic Xbox layout here, with ABXY buttons, offset joysticks, and a D-pad sitting on a disk. These are not, however, identical to what you see on an Xbox wireless controller, with all of the Asus ROG styling. I love the rubberized coating around the edges of the joysticks' caps (that reminded me of an Xbox controller), and the buttons are clicky and tactile, if a bit loud. Each joystick is surrounded by a moat of RGB light, which you can customize in Asus's Armoury Crate software. Unlike the Lenovo Legion Go 2, there's no sign of Hall Effect joysticks here.

There are standard bumpers and triggers, though the new Xbox-branded Ally systems use what Xbox calls ""impulse"" triggers with motors for vibration. Asus notes that these are Hall Effect triggers, so at least they're using that tech somewhere! The bumpers feel a bit cheap for my liking, with clicky plastic, and the trigger vibration, though kind of fun in racing titles like the Forza Horizon series, isn't terribly powerful.

There are just two macro buttons, one on each side of the rear of the device. That's fine for me, but some people may prefer the Legion Go 2's three buttons or the four on the back of the Steam Deck.

The Xbox button is to the right of the left thumb stick. This is as good a place for it as any, and never got in my way. On the left side of the screen are buttons for Armoury Crate and the View button, while the right side features a button to bring you to your library (or, with a long press, call up Copilot) and the standard Menu button.

What there isn't is a touchpad. If you want one, you're better off looking at the Steam Deck. I like touchpads, but their absence here is far from a dealbreaker for me, and I didn't really miss them.

On top of the system, there are two USB Type-C ports: one with USB4 and the other using USB 3.2 Gen 2. The USB4 port is Thunderbolt 4 compatible, and I had no issue plugging it into a Thunderbolt dock to play games on my monitor. There is also a microSD card slot, a 3.5 mm headphone jack, and a fingerprint reader built into the power button. All of the ports are on top.

Like the previous Ally, there are vents in the back of the system between the macro buttons. That brings cool air in to chill the processor, which is then ejected out of the top of the system.

The Xbox Ally X weighs 1.58 pounds, which feels substantially lighter than the Lenovo Legion Go 2's 2.03 pounds. It's a slight bump over the original Ally X (1.49 pounds), while the Steam Deck OLED is lighter than its Windows-based counterparts (1.41 pounds).

If you include the prongs (and the prongs are permanently attached, so you have to), the Ally X measures 11.42 x 4.76 x 2.00 inches, though it's 1.08 inches deep at its thinnest point. That means that it's technically thicker than the Lenovo Legion Go 2 (11.64 x 5.38 x 1.66 inches), though it doesn't feel as hefty.

The original Ally X measured 11.02 x 4.37 x 1.45 inches, so this iteration is larger all around, while the Steam Deck OLED is still the widest option at 11.73 x 4.6 x 1.97 inches.

The system comes with a small cardboard stand in the box. I'd rather it come with a carrying case, like the Steam Deck and Lenovo Legion Go 2. Instead, you have to pay an extra $70 if you want an official case for this handheld.

Asus is using the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme. This chip is almost identical to the regular Ryzen Z2 Extreme we saw in the Legion Go 2, except that it has a 50 TOPS NPU on board, as well as three Zen 5 cores and five Zen 5c cores. The Z2 Extreme has a max boost clock of 5 GHz on the Zen 5 cores, (3.3 GHz on the Zen 5c cores) and a base clock of 2 GHz. That max boost is actually 0.1 GHz slower than the Z1 Extreme.

The Z2 Extreme goes up to 35 watts with its configurable TDP. Here's how Asus uses that with its performance modes, with comparisons to previous models:

Whether you need an NPU in a gaming handheld is debatable. I tried it with Microsoft's Gaming Copilot, but considering it was often wrong and unhelpful about what to do in games, the NPU is more for upcoming features regarding AI-powered upscaling.

There's a 16-core GPU using integrated Radeon RDNA 3.5 graphics. Asus has opted for 24GB of RAM, the same as in the original Ally X but less than the 32GB in the Legion Go 2. The 1TB M.2 SSD is in a standard M.2 2280 form factor. And the 80 WHr battery is identical in size to the cell used in the original Ally X.

The Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme has a 16-core integrated GPU with RDNA 3.5 graphics. The CPU and GPU have a shared memory pool, which defaults to 8GB of memory assigned to the GPU in Asus's Armoury Crate SE software. You can customize this, but we ran it at the out of the box settings.

By default, the system runs in a 25W performance mode while unplugged and a 35W turbo mode while plugged in. Again, we stuck to these values in our testing. We ran games at both 720p and 1080p. In our comparisons, the Legion Go 2 and Steam Deck were tested at 1280 x 800 and 1920 x 1200 to fit their 16:10 screens.

Using the Xbox Full Screen Experience should free up some memory and provide performance advantages, as it doesn't load some Windows components. We benchmarked games through the FSE, with the exception of our stress test, which requires additional logging software.

In my spare time with the Xbox Ally X, I played Marvel's Midnight Suns, mostly on battery power. At 720p and medium settings, the game ran between 75 and 111 FPS in missions, though when exploring the Abbey, it was sometimes closer to 60 FPS.

I also tried Alan Wake 2, which I couldn't run on handhelds with the Z1 Extreme. Here, it worked, albeit with some serious caveats. With the screen at 720p and using a 640 x 360 performance render resolution with FSR2 upscaling, the game ran between 32 and 53 FPS is a nightmare version of New York. Down in the subways, away from the open world level, the game hit the 60 FPS cap I had invoked to save the battery. But the game generally looked terrible and blurry from the low resolution.

On the Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark (medium settings, DX12), the Xbox Ally X hit 64 FPS at 720p plugged in and 79 FPS unplugged. At 1080, those boosted to 45 and 52 FPS, respectively. Those results are similar to the Legion Go 2, and show a nice but not extraordinary bump over the Asus ROG Ally X.

Cyberpunk 2077's Steam Deck preset showed off the system's power when plugged in, where it hit 63 FPS at 720p and 40 FPS at 1080p. Those both beat the Legion Go 2, though that had the disadvantage of having to push a few more pixels to power its 800p screen.

Red Dead Redemption 2 (favor performance, Vulkan), the Xbox Ally X showed off gains at 720p while unplugged, hitting 66 FPS. It scored almost identically to the Legion Go 2, but showed upticks over the original Ally X all around.

Borderlands 3 (medium, DX11) was the only misstep. At 59 FPS at 720p unplugged and 68 FPS plugged in, it came in behind the Legion Go 2 at 800p. 1080p performance, however, was comparable. In fact, at 720p, the Xbox Ally X had effectively no gains over the original Ally X in this game, though 1080p performance was improved.

Now that we've seen handhelds getting slightly more power, we've upped our stress test. It's still Metro Exodus running 15 times at 720p to simulate about half an hour of gameplay, but we've moved from low to medium settings. The Xbox Ally X achieved an average frame rate of 63.44 FPS on the benchmark.The consistency across the 15 runs suggests the cooling is adequate for the chip.

The Xbox Ally X's three Zen 5 cores ran at an average of 3.24 GHz during the stress test, while the Zen 5c cores hit 2.15 GHz.

The Xbox Full Screen Experience is significantly better for handhelds than standard Windows 11.

You boot straight into a version of the Xbox app featuring a home screen with recently played games, though like a standard Xbox, the app also advertises game deals, Game Pass, and has curated lists of games. The most important part is your library (there's even a hardware button for it), which brings everything together from Xbox and launchers like Steam, Epic Games, Battle.net, GOG Galaxy, and Ubisoft Connect.

Wherever you are in the system, you can see a miniaturized version of this experience by hitting the Xbox button, which shows recently played games, launchers, quick settings, your friends list, and most of the features from Xbox Game Bar on PC.

Most importantly, loading directly into the Full Screen Experience means that Windows doesn't even bother loading certain components of the OS that aren't used for gaming, making it lighter, saving RAM, and putting more resources toward games. The handheld even came with Steam preinstalled, booting right into big picture mode. That's a nice welcome mat for PC gamers, though I later did end up in the traditional Steam interface upon further boot ups.

Launchers, however, don't always work well. For instance, if you go into Steam's Big Picture mode, you'll get a great experience with the Xbox controller. But if you end up in Epic Games, as I did after quitting games like Borderlands 3 and Marvel's Midnight Suns, I found myself in an environment where I had to use this PC-style launcher with touch, as there was no mouse control. Even then, when I had the system at 720p, I'd have a gray box around the launcher, making it even harder to hit the touch targets. I had similar issues launching Cyberpunk 2077 from Steam, which forces you to go through CD Projekt Red's launcher. When you pick a game from the Xbox menu, launchers still have to boot and run in the background, which sometimes leaves you with a minute or so of hangtime. You don't have these problems when playing games from the Xbox Store.

Games from the Xbox Store also get other bonuses, like nicer artwork and, if you buy from the Xbox Store, analysis of how well the game will play on your PC.

You can still boot into the desktop (and load all of those extra Windows components upon doing so). If you want to use this system as a standard Windows 11 PC, there's nothing stopping you. It has all of the flaws of other gaming handhelds running Windows, but I'm glad the option is still there. I'm sure there will be at least some people who use the handheld with a keyboard and mouse or just want to tinker.

There are a number of waypoints in and out of the Full Screen Experience, but they feel bolted on to the Xbox app. But the sheer number of ways to get back into it means most people won't get lost. If you do go to full screen Windows 11, it will load the rest of the OS components, likely affecting gaming performance, so you'll want to restart when switching between the Xbox FSE and Windows (the system encourages you to do so).

 




And there are still aspects of Windows you can't control. Install a game or launcher that Windows runs through User Account Control? UAC doesn't pop up on an Xbox, but it still happens here. Asus also includes some unnecessary software, like MyAsus and GlideX for screen sharing, which feel out of place on a gaming handheld.

One of SteamOS's biggest advantages is a rating system that gives you an idea of how well a game works on the Steam Deck. Microsoft is doing something similar in the Xbox FSE, called the Handheld Compatibility program. Games are labeled as ""Handheld Optimized"" with a green checkmark, or ""Mostly compatible"" with a blue icon, suggesting you need to change some settings to get the game to run well. These badges are buried in the Xbox Store, so you won't see equivalents for other launchers. But Microsoft does keep a list of games it and studio partners have tested for handheld compatibility.

Asus's Armoury Crate SE is still here, both as a full application and as a smaller ""Command Center"" built into the Xbox interface and available through Windows 11. It's important as you switch through performance modes, change wattage to the processor (which can greatly affect battery life), and make other adjustments. (It is nice to have it baked into the Xbox FSE, and accessible easily through the Xbox button). The full Armoury Crate SE software does double up on some features though, including its own unified game library.

All of this leads to one question: Is the new Ally X an Xbox? For almost a year, Microsoft has been pushing a campaign that anything can be an Xbox, from laptops to car entertainment systems to phones – and now, gaming handhelds running Windows.

If you're coming from using an Xbox Series X or Series S, though, this is a fundamentally different experience in many ways. While Xbox Play Anywhere features over 1,000 games and lets you share save states and achievements, it also assumes you bought those games from the Microsoft Store. And plenty of games don't support Play Anywhere, including some of Microsoft's own. (It's nice to see that Doom: The Dark Ages got support after Doom Eternal didn't).

Microsoft needs to get to a point where all Xbox games are playable anywhere with this support to compete with the user experience Valve offers on Steam Deck. It's tough to call something an Xbox when it doesn't play every Xbox game. That will certainly confuse some people. Xbox gamers will also get their choice of using Game Pass or using Remote Play from their console, so there's a lot of flexibility here.

But as a PC handheld, this system also supports Steam, Epic Games, and every other launcher under the sun. All of those launchers, and all of the games within them, have far more settings to tinker with than ever before. Add in the fact that Asus' software gets deep into TDP, and this is a system with far more options than any Xbox owner ever had before. Enthusiasts will love that. But I also think there will be a number of console devotees who wonder how the heck this thing is an Xbox. It sure feels a lot more like an Asus gaming PC.

Microsoft is promising a bunch of upcoming features early next year, but we can only judge the Ally X on what's available today. Promised updates include automatic super resolution to use the AI Z2 Extreme's NPU to upscale games at the system level with no changes needed in game, as well as a game save sync indicator to make sure your save is stored, and improved library management for SD cards, making it easier to store and manage your games from the FSE.

Even without those, though, the Xbox FSE makes the Xbox Ally X the best PC gaming handheld with Windows because it's so much easier to use, despite the fact that Microsoft clearly has work to do to make launchers less janky and make the whole thing more full-featured. None of this is as polished or as easy as Valve's SteamOS, but it's significantly closer than using the regular Windows 11 UI. I can't wait for Microsoft to let every gamer with a handheld get a better experience than they do on the standard Windows 11 desktop.

Asus is using a 7-inch, 1920 x 1080, IPS touchscreen that runs up 120 Hz on the Xbox Ally X. If that sounds familiar, it's because it's probably the same screen on the previous Ally X. The 16:9 aspect ratio differs from what Valve and Lenovo have done, with taller 16:10 screens that also use OLED technology. In fact, this screen doesn't support HDR.

In general, the screen looks good. In Marvel's Midnight Suns, the Abbey is filled with colorful characters. Agatha's altar includes many blue flames (and, oh, yeah, Agatha Harkness's blue ghost), which created a haunting effect that contrasted against greenery at night. It doesn't, however, look anywhere near as vivid as the Lenovo Legion Go 2 I just tested.

 




The ROG Xbox Ally X's screen tested almost identically to the ROG Ally X we tested last year. Given they have the same specs, they're almost certainly same panel. The Xbox Ally X's panel covers 110% of the DCI-P3 color gamut and 77.9% of the more challenging DCI-P3 space by volume. That's easily beaten by the OLED screens on the Legion Go 2 and the Steam Deck OLED.

At 515.8 nits of brightness, this panel is more luminous than the Legion Go 2, though the Steam Deck OLED took the crown at 597.2 nits.

Battery life on a handheld, like its competitors, is largely dependent on your settings and the game you play. I tend to play games in a way to try to preserve battery life as long as possible. If you play low-impact games like Stardew Valley or even Hollow Knight: Silksong, you may experience longer battery life than the effects-heavy games I tested.

One evening when testing the Xbox Ally X, I played some Marvel's Midnight Suns with the system in Performance mode. At medium settings at 720p with the screen locked to 60 Hz and 50% brightness, the battery had dropped to 50% after an hour and 32 minutes.

When I played Alan Wake 2, I kept the same 17W Performance mode, 50% brightness, and 60 Hz refresh rate. At 720p using FSR2 upscaling on a performance-focused 640 x 360 render resolution and low settings preset without ray tracing, the handheld hit 50% in an hour and 35 minutes.

If you extrapolate from these, those suggest about 3 hours on battery, and that's with the limitations I put in place. That seems about standard when compared with the Legion Go 2.

The twin speakers on the Xbox Ally X are front facing, playing the sound right toward you. This is the optimal location, similar to what you find on the Steam Deck OLED. Some other handhelds have the speakers facing out of the top, away from you.

I used some of my time with the ROG Xbox Ally X to play a bit of Tetris Effect, which I had through Xbox Play Anywhere. The game sounds best with headphones, but the speakers did a solid job. The ""Prayer Circle"" level in journey mode features bells and xylophone sounds, which were clear and focused. Some deeper bass sounds, like gongs, were muted at best, however.

In Marvel's Midnight Suns, the speakers swelled with orchestral music during a battle, and kept the dialogue clear even over whirring Hydra helicopter blades. And the game got nice and loud, too, easily filling a whole room.

We measured skin temperatures while running our Metro Exodus stress test. Like other handhelds we've tested, the design ensures your hands don't touch any hotspots. The prongs and controls ran from 84 degrees Fahrenheit at the furthest point to 90 F closer to the screen. On the top, the hottest point was at the exhaust vent, which reached 113.7 F. On the rear, the hottest point was near the intake vent, far enough from the two back buttons that you wouldn't place your hands there.

Internally, the CPU package measured an average of 74.7 degrees Celsius, while the integrated graphics reached 70.59 C.

Here's one way in which the ROG Xbox Ally X is definitively more like a PC than an Xbox: You can crack it open and upgrade it. The back of the system is held on with eight Phillips-head screws. There are five screws on the back and three on the bottom. Of those, the top middle screw on the rear is captive; the rest all come out.

You'll have to pry carefully from the top and all the way around the sides of the controllers to get the back off. It can be nerve-wracking and time-consuming, as there are a lot of plastic clips to disengage. But go slow — there's a ribbon cable connecting the back to the motherboard to control the M1 and M2 buttons. I would love to see a design in the future with a door that leads directly to the SSD (perhaps similar to what Microsoft has done on some Surface designs) so you don't have to deal with so many screws and tabs. For those without any DIY PC experience, adding storage with the microSD card slot may be the way to go.

 




The major component you can upgrade is the standard M.2 2280 SSD, which is right at the center when you open the system. The battery cable runs over the SSD, and while you'd probably want to disconnect that before doing work anyway, you'll have to do so to have room to remove the existing drive.

Like the original Ally X, you can see the modular thumbsticks. Since Asus isn't using Hall Effect joysticks, these will probably, eventually, be prone to drift. Asus didn't sell replacement sticks for the initial Ally X, but I'd love to see them do it for this system.

The Asus ROG Xbox Ally X comes in a single configuration, with a 7-inch, 1080p display, AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor, 24GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. It costs $999.99, up from $799 on the 2024 Ally X with a Z1 Extreme. That's a big jump for the new processor and slightly new design.

There is another model, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, which ditches the Xbox Ally X's blackout color scheme for a white controller and colorful buttons. That system, which costs $599.99, uses an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor, which on paper is similar to what you can find in the Steam Deck OLED. It also has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD.

The Asus ROG Xbox Ally X makes two things very clear:

1. More handhelds need controller-style prongs.

2. Windows 11 on gaming handhelds has a chance.

The Xbox Ally X has superior ergonomics to every other Windows handheld on the market, and will be more comfortable for some than the Steam Deck, which until now has been the best in this area. It looks a little silly, but controllers have those grips for a reason. Add in some great weight-balancing, and you have a comfortable gaming handheld. Too bad it doesn't come with a case to carry it around in.

 




The performance of the Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme is strong, but I'm not sure it's such a jump that if you already have an Asus ROG Ally X with Z1 Extreme, you need to upgrade.

At $999.99, this is a pricey handheld. Still, there are more fully featured options out there. If you're willing to skip the Xbox Full Screen Experience (for now), the Lenovo Legion Go 2 adds detachable controllers with Hall Effect joysticks and a gorgeous OLED screen, along with more RAM. But that device is bigger and heavier, and is even more expensive at $1,349.99. The Steam Deck OLED, which is cheaper at $549 for 512GB and $649 for 1TB, also has an OLED screen, though its chip quite as powerful as the Z2 Extreme.

For now, the Xbox Full Screen Experience is exclusive to the Xbox Ally X. All other things being equal, that's the big reason to buy this system. Using it is simply easier, even if Microsoft has plenty of rough edges to clean up.

If you're just now jumping into the gaming handheld market and want something that just plays games and runs Windows, this is the one to get. It's comfortable and is finally starting to get close to the ease of use that Valve offers with SteamOS. When the Xbox Full Screen Experience becomes available more widely, however, the field may blow open.

The implementation of a modified Skin and Ultraviolet Neoplasia Transplant Risk Assessment Calculator (SUNTRAC) risk-based surveillance program, which included primary care, dermatology, and transplant specialties, increased screening rates and early detection of skin cancer in high- and very high-risk solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, without raising healthcare utilization.

“This cohort study confirms the elevated skin cancer risk in SOT recipients and supports the clinical utility of SUNTRAC in guiding risk-targeted cancer screening programs,” wrote the authors of the study. “Although the instrument was originally developed to be used by transplant teams to send timely referrals, this study demonstrates that dermatologists and primary care teams may also use SUNTRAC to triage SOT recipients and encourage timely skin cancer screening visits,” the author of an accompanying editorial wrote. “This study adds to the body of evidence on using a risk-based screening model to accurately identify the highest-risk patients, thereby focusing the utilization of healthcare resources,” the editorial noted.

The study was led by David S. Lee, MD, Department of Dermatology, KP Northern California, Pleasanton, California, and was published online on October 15 in JAMA Dermatology. The accompanying editorial was authored by Anokhi Jambusaria-Pahlajani, MD, MSCE, of the Division of Dermatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Dell Medical School, University of Texas at Austin.

The study was conducted within a single regional health system with brief postimplementation follow-up period of 2.3 years. Screening and cancer data based on electronic records could underestimate cancer rates. Self-reported cases of pretransplant skin cancer lacked accuracy verification, and race and ethnicity categories might not reliably reflect skin phototype. The COVID pandemic potentially introduced detection bias due to clinic restrictions and greater hesitancy among transplant recipients to seek in-person care.

This study was funded by an award from The Rapid Analytics Unit, KP Delivery Science and Applied Research, The Permanente Medical Group. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest. Jambusaria-Pahlajani reported consulting fees from Sun Pharma and Regeneron outside the submitted work.

The implementation of a decision aid for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in US clinics improved patient outcomes, including reduced decisional conflict and enhanced shared decision-making. Over 80% found the aid balanced for information on immunosuppressive drugs vs glucocorticoids, and outcomes remained favorable over 6 months.

“The SLE patient decision aid can improve patients' knowledge of the key risks and benefits of the most commonly used SLE medications without a commercial bias and can encourage patient-provider dialogue on treatment,” the authors of the study wrote. “The SLE patient decision aid seems feasible for widespread dissemination to rheumatology care settings in the USA and other countries. A focus on effective strategies for durable and self-sustained widespread implementation is needed,” they added.

The study was led by Jasvinder A. Singh, MBBS, MPH, Medicine Service, Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Houston. It was published online on September 17, 2025, in The Lancet Rheumatology.

The study's observational design may introduce confounding and selection bias. Digital accessibility and literacy were not assessed, potentially excluding some participants. The refusal of 110 patients to participate limited the generalizability of the findings. Not all participants completed every follow-up survey, so long-term data were available only for those who did.

The study was supported by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. Some authors disclosed receiving consultancy fees, speaker fees, honoraria, and institutional research support from various organizations; holding stock options in several companies; serving on advisory boards; and having other ties with various organizations. One author reported receiving consultancy fees from Medscape Medical News and WebMD.

Neurons in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus that express the cholecystokinin b receptor (VMHCckbr neurons) appear to support glucose production during hypoglycemia without broadly controlling energy homeostasis, according to a recently published study in Molecular Metabolism. Until now, the role of these neurons in day-to-day glucose physiology and the mechanisms they use to mobilize glucose mobilization was unclear.

In the new study, researchers used continuous glucose monitoring in mice with VMHCckbr neurons that were chronically silenced using a tetanus toxin-based approach. They also performed acute optogenetic activation experiments and assessed hepatic glucose metabolism and white adipose tissue (WAT) lipolysis.

The findings suggest VMHCckbr neurons represent a distinct subset of glucose-mobilizing VMH neurons that support physiologic glucose homeostasis, possibly via beta 3-adrenergic receptor (beta 3-AR)-mediated mobilization of gluconeogenic substrates and lipolysis.

“The presence of different glucose-mobilizing neuronal populations that engage distinct mechanisms in a context-dependent manner may provide the brain with flexibility to coordinate the appropriate glycemic response to different circumstances,” the authors wrote.

The VMH controls sympathetic outflow to multiple metabolic target organs, including the pancreatic islets, the liver, WAT, and brown adipose tissue. Consistent with prior reports, VMHCckbr neuron activation supported that lipolysis and signaling through the beta 3-AR was required for glycerol mobilization. It is unclear whether this occurs via direct sympathetic nervous system (SNS) innervation of WAT or through changes in circulating catecholamines, although levels of the latter have been shown to increase following VMHCckbr neuron activation.

The authors noted that a high-fat diet can rapidly increase insulin resistance through excessive SNS activity and WAT lipolysis. The researchers' next plan to examine whether dysregulation of VMHCckbr neurons and related central nervous system circuits that contribute to SNS outflow and lipolysis occur during obesity and diabetic states.

“We wanted to understand whether it is also important in controlling blood sugar during day-to-day activities because that's when diabetes develops,” said Alison Affinati, MD, PhD, assistant professor of internal medicine and member of Caswell Diabetes Institute at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, in a press release. “In the first 4 hours after you go to bed, these neurons ensure that you have enough glucose so that you don't become hypoglycemic overnight.”

These new findings may help explain what happens in patients with prediabetes, who often have increased lipolysis during the night. The researchers believe that in these patients, the VMHCckbr neurons could be overactive, contributing to higher blood sugar.

“Our studies show that the control of glucose is not an on-or-off switch as previously thought,” Affinati added. “Different populations of neurons work together, and everything gets turned on in an emergency. However, under routine conditions, it allows for subtle changes.”

Looking forward, it is hoped that VMHCckbr neurons may represent a pharmacologic target to improve glycemic control in multiple forms of diabetes. The VMH comprises several populations of glucose-mobilizing neurons that engage different mechanisms, such as controlling WAT lipolysis and providing substrates for gluconeogenesis to regulate glucose metabolism across multiple contexts.

The authors propose that VMHCckbr neurons, and the central nervous system more broadly, help maintain adequate blood glucose during the transition from feeding to fasting. During early fasting, insulin decreases while hormonal and nutrient signals shift liver physiology toward gluconeogenesis. At the same time, the brain increases lipolysis through SNS activation to provide glycerol for gluconeogenesis.

Vincent Foundation, and Novo Nordisk. This work was also supported in part by a National Institutes of Health grant.

Professor and Chief of Cardiology, Leipzig University Hospital, Leipzig, Germany

Disclosure: Ulrich Laufs, MD, PhD, has disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

A study presented at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress 2025 by German and US cardiologists shows that patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) who were treated with semaglutide or tirzepatide had a more than 40% lower risk for hospitalization. Experts at the American College of Cardiology have also, for the first time, recommended semaglutide and tirzepatide as possible therapies for HFpEF.

In an interview with Medscape's German edition, Ulrich Laufs, MD, PhD, professor and chief of cardiology at Leipzig University Hospital, Germany, commented on whether the weight‑loss injections are becoming heart drugs and who might benefit.

Studies show that patients with heart failure and preserved pump function who were treated with semaglutide or tirzepatide had improved functional capacity and a lower risk of hospitalization. Are weight‑loss injections becoming a therapeutic option in heart failure?

Yes. We have seen two large study programs that enrolled patients with heart failure and preserved pump function (ie, HFpEF). This is a large patient group in Germany characterized by a high symptom burden and reduced life expectancy, and until now, we have had relatively few evidence‑based pharmacologic treatment options for them. To date, SGLT2 inhibitors and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are available for these patients. So far, we have not had positive trials for other drugs.

The STEP‑HFpEF trial included obese patients (BMI ≥ 30) with heart failure and preserved pump function who were treated with the GLP‑1 receptor agonist semaglutide. The SUMMIT trial likewise enrolled obese patients with heart failure and preserved pump function and treated them with tirzepatide, the dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP‑1 receptor agonist. Both trials documented a clear symptomatic benefit for patients. The evidence we now have therefore relates to a large and relevant patient population with high unmet need.

For patients with heart failure and markedly reduced pump function (ie, reduced ejection fraction), we cannot make as many statements yet because that population has not been fully investigated.

What role would semaglutide and tirzepatide have in therapy?

The European and German cardiology societies already recommend primarily using GLP‑1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors rather than metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. That group includes many patients with heart failure.

In the large SELECT trial, patients with obesity but without diabetes had a mortality benefit from semaglutide. The effect of GLP‑1 receptor agonists appears to be additive to that of SGLT2 inhibitors; subgroup analyses showed no heterogeneity between people treated with and SGLT2 inhibitors and those who did not receive these agents, supporting an additive effect.

Which heart failure patients benefit from GLP‑1 receptor agonists?

In descending order of priority, current guidance and evidence support use in, first, patients with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis, and patients with HFpEF. 

The second group comprises patients with type 2 diabetes and HFpEF but without manifest atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

The third group is patients with obesity and HFpEF but without diabetes. For this population we now have recent trial data, although the medication is not yet reimbursed for this indication in some health systems.

An open question is whether these agents also benefit patients with heart failure and markedly reduced pump function (reduced ejection fraction). There are signals, but this population has not yet been fully investigated.

What about normal‑weight patients with HFpEF? Could they also benefit?

That is not known. Separately from heart failure, the SELECT trial enrolled patients with increased cardiovascular risk and obesity but without type 2 diabetes and treated them with semaglutide. In subgroup analyses, there was no heterogeneity when comparing patients with a BMI under 30 vs those with a BMI over 30; the subgroup with BMI less than 30 still included more than 5000 patients. This suggests that people who are overweight — not only those with morbid obesity — may benefit from GLP‑1 receptor agonists.

However, you cannot extrapolate these findings to people with a BMI below 25, because that group was not studied. There is a strong rationale that weight loss reduces the pathologic effects of adipose tissue, particularly inflammation, and that this is an important mechanism of benefit. Thus, patients with large amounts of pathologic adipose tissue are likely to gain most from its reduction.

Normal‑weight individuals may nevertheless have pathologic adipose tissue — outcomes depend not only on total body weight but also on fat distribution and metabolic characteristics. Experimental data suggest there may be weight‑independent effects of this drug class, because the GLP‑1 receptor is expressed in many organs. Whether such effects translate into clinically favorable outcomes in lean patients is not yet known.

At present, there is no basis to recommend or routinely use incretin‑modulating agents for nonobese HFpEF patients, but there are good reasons to study selected nonobese populations in clinical trials.

Do you think semaglutide and similar drugs will have their indications expanded for HFpEF with obesity?

One must distinguish regulatory approval from reimbursement. Semaglutide and tirzepatide are authorized for obesity: for BMI over 30, or for BMI of 27-30 with a comorbidity, even in the absence of type 2 diabetes. In Germany, statutory health insurance currently reimburses these agents only for patients with type 2 diabetes in addition to metformin. For patients without diabetes who have HFpEF and obesity, semaglutide or tirzepatide can at present generally only be prescribed on a self‑pay basis.

The first full-length structures of two heat shock chaperone proteins in a complex reveal the key structural region regulating their function, according to a new study from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The chaperone complex binds misfolded proteins and gives them another chance to fold correctly. This process is essential for cells because improperly folded proteins tend to aggregate, potentially causing a diverse array of diseases. However, the mechanism by which these two major heat shock chaperone proteins, Hsp40 and Hsp70, bind each other and misfolded peptides was unclear. The new structures enabled the scientists to identify how the cellular machinery works. The findings were published today in Molecular Cell.

""Heat shock chaperone proteins form the first line of defense against protein misfolding and aggregation, a precursor to many diseases,"" said corresponding author Charalampos Babis Kalodimos, PhD, St. Jude Department of Structural Biology chair.

We showed how these two particular heat shock chaperone proteins come together, revealing a previously unknown set of mechanisms explaining how they work in tandem, and how they can malfunction.""

Charalampos Babis Kalodimos, Department of Structural Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital

Heat shock chaperone proteins are essential in most organisms, with similar versions present from bacteria to humans. Bacterial Hsp40 and Hsp70 are known to help misfolded proteins correctly refold, with decades of research into their function as chaperone proteins. The human versions of these proteins are also linked to several diseases. However, exactly how Hsp40 and Hsp90 bind a client protein and each other was unknown, because no one had been able to overcome the technical hurdles involved in capturing the massive full-length structure. 

Instead of using a single approach, the St. Jude scientists combined cryogenic electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and X-ray crystallography data to finally solve the bacterial complex's structure. They captured multiple forms of the structure, consisting of dimers (pairs) of Hsp70 interacting with dimers of Hsp40, in several different states of binding client proteins.

""Most importantly, we captured the full-length structures of the active and inhibited states, bound to an incorrectly folded protein,"" Kalodimos said. ""But we also solved multiple smaller pieces. By assembling them together, they've given us a new model of how the Hsp40 and Hsp70 complex really functions.""

Mutations in a specific region of Hsp40 are associated with an array of ailments, including many neurodegenerative diseases, but how those mutations disrupt normal functions was unknown. The region is rich in highly conserved amino acids called glycines and phenylalanines, though their exact functions were unclear. The structures revealed that this region of Hsp40 binds a client protein first, then a particular phenylalanine binds to the substrate binding site on Hsp70. That phenylalanine then pulls the misfolded protein into the substrate binding site, displacing itself, though the rest of Hsp40 remains bound to Hsp70. After the handoff, the misfolded peptide is then unfolded by Hsp70.

""We first uncovered the mechanism of handover, where Hsp40 gives the client to Hsp70 by initially tucking in a phenylalanine into the binding pocket, which subsequently transfers the client into the same site,"" Kalodimos said. ""But then, by having structures of the complex in multiple states, we also saw how the complex releases client proteins.""

The scientists found that when ATP, the energy currency of the cell, binds to Hsp70, Hsp70 changes shape, pushing the phenylalanine back into the binding pocket, which in turn pushes out the client protein and releases it into the cell. Afterward, Hsp40 leaves Hsp70 and is then available to bind another misfolded protein, starting the process again.

""We now understand mechanistically how the chaperones and protein client form this very big complex, how they are released, and how they cycle through these states,"" Kalodimos said. ""Using that knowledge, we have a starting place to look for therapeutic interventions to compensate for disease-causing mutations, to exploit as drug targets in cancers or inspire next-generation antibiotics.""

A comprehensive peer-reviewed invited review published today in Psychedelics by Dr. Kenji Hashimoto and colleagues (Dr. Mingming Zhao and Dr. Jianjun Yang) synthesizes the evolving landscape of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, examining robust clinical evidence in treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder while identifying promising applications in autism spectrum disorder, eating disorders, and existential distress. The review traces the complex journey from early therapeutic promise through prohibition to current regulatory challenges, providing critical analysis of safety profiles and novel resilience mechanisms mediated by the gut-brain axis.

The review encompasses MDMA research spanning from its 1912 synthesis at Merck through contemporary Phase III clinical trials. Dr. Hashimoto and colleagues systematically analyze how this distinctive entactogen reverses the serotonin transporter to massively increase synaptic serotonin while simultaneously engaging oxytocin and catecholaminergic pathways. The authors examine 126 primary sources to construct a comprehensive narrative of how MDMA produces its unique prosocial and therapeutic effects through multiple neurobiological systems.

This synthesis arrives at a critical juncture following the FDA's August 2024 decision requesting additional Phase III trials despite earlier Breakthrough Therapy designation. The review methodically addresses concerns about functional unblinding and protocol standardization that contributed to regulatory delays while maintaining focus on the substantial therapeutic potential demonstrated across multiple psychiatric conditions.

The authors identify consistent patterns across diverse clinical applications, with PTSD trials showing particularly robust outcomes. Phase II and III studies demonstrated remission rates approaching 80 percent in treatment-resistant cases, with benefits persisting for years following treatment. The synthesis reveals how MDMA-assisted therapy achieved significant symptom reductions where conventional approaches failed, though regulatory approval remains pending due to methodological concerns about blinding integrity and psychotherapeutic protocol standardization.

Beyond PTSD, the review synthesizes emerging evidence in autism spectrum disorder, where controlled trials demonstrated significant reductions in social anxiety. The authors analyze how MDMA's oxytocin-mediated effects may specifically address core social deficits in autism. Similarly promising signals emerge from studies in eating disorders with comorbid PTSD and in patients experiencing existential distress from life-threatening illness.

A particularly innovative contribution involves the authors' synthesis of recent discoveries regarding MDMA-induced resilience through vagus nerve-dependent gut-brain signaling. The review integrates findings from multiple preclinical studies demonstrating that MDMA pretreatment prevents stress-induced behavioral and neurobiological changes through modulation of gut microbiota composition and bile acid metabolism. These mechanisms appear distinct from acute therapeutic effects, suggesting MDMA may confer lasting stress resilience through peripheral as well as central pathways.

Dr. Hashimoto and colleagues analyze how subdiaphragmatic vagotomy abolishes both MDMA-induced oxytocin release and its resilience-enhancing effects, establishing the vagus nerve as critical for therapeutic action. The synthesis connects these findings to epidemiological data associating MDMA use with reduced depression and suicidality at population levels, though the authors carefully note limitations in establishing causality from observational studies.

The review provides comprehensive analysis of acute and chronic safety concerns, synthesizing evidence on hyperthermia, hyponatremia, sympathomimetic overstimulation, and potential neurotoxicity. The authors detail how controlled trials demonstrate an average 3 milliequivalent per liter sodium reduction with unrestricted fluids, with approximately 31 percent developing hyponatremia. They identify oxytocin-mediated antidiuresis as the primary mechanism while noting arginine vasopressin contributions under specific conditions.

Regarding neurotoxicity concerns, the synthesis examines convergent evidence from human neuroimaging, cognitive studies, and animal models demonstrating selective serotonergic terminal injury amplified by hyperthermia and oxidative stress. The authors emphasize how controlled clinical settings with temperature monitoring, fluid restriction, and dosing limits can substantially mitigate these risks while preserving therapeutic benefits.

The review proposes specific strategies for advancing MDMA-assisted therapy toward clinical implementation. The authors advocate for incorporating biomarkers including threat-evoked functional magnetic resonance imaging and oxytocin receptor genotyping to guide patient selection. They emphasize standardizing both pharmacological protocols and psychotherapeutic components while developing consensus on acceptable unblinding thresholds in controlled trials.

Dr. Hashimoto, Professor at Chiba University Center for Forensic Mental Health, brings extensive expertise in neuropharmacology and stress resilience mechanisms. The international team combines clinical psychiatry experience with fundamental neuroscience perspectives, positioning them uniquely to synthesize this complex, multidisciplinary field.

This comprehensive peer-reviewed review article represents a critical synthesis of the current state of knowledge in MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, providing researchers, clinicians, and policymakers with a comprehensive framework for understanding this emerging therapeutic modality. By systematically analyzing and integrating findings from across the literature, the authors offer both a historical perspective on how the field has evolved and a roadmap for future investigations. Such comprehensive reviews are essential for identifying patterns that may not be apparent in individual studies, resolving apparent contradictions in the literature, and highlighting the most promising avenues for advancing the field. The synthesis presented here serves as a valuable resource for both newcomers seeking to understand the field and experienced researchers looking to contextualize their work within the broader scientific landscape.

The brain's mechanisms for repairing injuries caused by trauma or degenerative diseases are not yet known in detail. Now, a study by the University of Barcelona describes a new strategy based on stem cell therapy that could enhance neuronal regeneration and neuroplasticity when this vital organ is damaged. The results reveal that the use of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), combined with stem cell-based cell therapies, could help in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases or brain injuries. 

The study, published in International Journal of Molecular Sciences, is led by Professor Daniel Tornero and researcher Alba Ortega, from the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences and the Institute of Neurosciences of the University of Barcelona (UBneuro). The study involves the decisive participation of a group of UB students who were awarded one of the gold medals in the international synthetic biology competition iGEM 2024, the most important international synthetic biology competition for young researchers. 

BDNF is a protein that is synthesised mainly in the brain and plays a key role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. Several studies have described its potential to promote neuronal survival and growth, findings that are now extended by the new study.

The findings indicate that BDNF can promote the maturation and increase the activity of neurons generated in the laboratory from donor skin cells. The skin cells must first be reprogrammed to become induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and then differentiated to obtain neuronal cultures.""  

Daniel Tornero, UB's Department of Biomedicine and the CIBER Area for the Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED)

In this way, the study combines cell therapy with the production of BDNF in the same cells. This study confirms the beneficial effects of this growth factor in neuronal cultures derived from human stem cells, the same cells that are used in cell therapy to treat, for example, stroke in animal models.

""This strategy is being applied at an experimental level to design cell therapies and to generate laboratory models to help study brain diseases,"" says Tornero. When these neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are modified to continuously overexpress the BDNF protein, ""we obtain more mature and active neuronal cultures, without altering the normal organization of their connections or the functional networks,"" explains researcher Alba Ortega.The study focuses on the more functional aspects of neuronal regeneration, such as neuronal activity and axon generation, which are directly involved in the integration of cells that are transplanted into the brain.

""In addition, cells that produce BDNF are able to attract axons — the extensions that allow communication between neurons — more efficiently. This chemo-attraction effect would be related to the production of this factor,"" says the researcher.

BDNF's ability to attract growing axons has been described previously. Now, the team shows this effect for the first time in neurons derived from human stem cells using a microfluidic chip system. This innovative technology — with two chambers that isolate populations of neurons with or without the ability to produce BDNF — makes it possible to grow populations of neurons communicating through small channels and thus observe precisely how they interact with each other.

""The cells that produce BDNF generate a concentration gradient in these channels, which we believe guides and facilitates the formation of neuronal projections in a specific direction,"" says student Santiago Ramos, representing the group of students who have contributed an innovative perspective to the conceptual and experimental design of the study.

Neurodegenerative diseases and neuronal injuries, which are increasingly frequent in the population, are one of the major challenges for healthcare systems. As the endogenous regenerative capacity of the human brain is very limited, lesions only partially recover and affected patients are often left with motor and cognitive sequelae. In this context, there is an urgent need to design strategies that complement these endogenous brain mechanisms with human stem cell-based therapies to promote neuronal repair, functional integration and more efficient recovery.

In this regard, the team plans to transfer these results to animal models, a line of research developed for some time in this laboratory to improve human stem cell therapy in ischaemic stroke lesions affecting the cerebral cortex.

The application of preclinical advances in patients will mark a turning point in the treatment of many neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are still many obstacles to implementing stem cell-based therapies and avoiding potential side effects (tumour generation, etc.). Some international clinical trials based on stem cell transplantation for the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease (in Japan, Sweden and the United States) are showing promising results.

""Although there are many challenges, progress in Parkinson's clinical trials shows that we are closer than ever to applying these therapies safely in patients with stroke or other neurodegenerative diseases,"" the experts conclude.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study provides new framework for understanding domestic violence","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251015/Study-provides-new-framework-for-understanding-domestic-violence.aspx","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 05:22:00 GMT","

Before going on to commit violence, domestic abusers use a mix of intense affection and emotional cruelty, combined with tales of their own childhood trauma, to generate a deep psychological hold that can feel like an ""addiction"" according to some victims. 

A new study by a University of Cambridge criminologist outlines a tactical playbook deployed by male abusers to engineer a ""trauma bond"": an attachment based in cycles of threat and relief that leaves victims desperate for approval.

While this bond is typically viewed as a response to violent trauma, researcher Mags Lesiak argues it is, in fact, intentionally manufactured by perpetrators using strategic systems of control long before they leave visible marks.

As such, Lesiak says that recovery strategies relying on theories of codependency ""shift blame onto victims"" while ignoring the ""deliberate brainwashing"" by abusers.

For a study published in the journal Violence Against Women, Lesiak conducted extended interviews with eighteen women who had suffered repeated domestic violence during a relationship. 

To investigate the roots of attachment beyond ""captivity"" – the active threat of harm, or control via shared housing, children or finances – women recruited for the study were economically independent and often lived away from abusers during the relationship.

Importantly, the women's relationships had all safely ended. Yet most held a seemingly inexplicable desire – even to themselves – to return to the abuser. Participants included doctors, a dentist, a science teacher and a chef. 

""Patterns of manipulation, grooming and coercion were so consistent it was as if all these women were talking about the same man,"" said Lesiak, who is conducting a PhD at Cambridge's Institute of Criminology.

This is a distinct perpetrator profile. Specific techniques are used to construct and then weaponise love to produce a form of psychological captivity. As with the victims in this study, it can tether women to abusers even without physical or financial coercion.""

Mags Lesiak, Institute of Criminology, University of Cambridge

""Victim attachment to an abuser is not a passive trauma response, but the result of deliberate brainwashing by a perpetrator,"" Lesiak said.

""The abuser's psychological tactics can get obscured by ideas of codependency, which suggest that a victim is partly culpable due to something broken or masochistic within. Domestic abuse isn't about victim pathology but perpetrator strategy.""

Lesiak, who spent a decade in frontline mental health and domestic violence services, identified three core themes running through the interviews. An experience all the women shared is what Lesiak terms the ""two-faced soulmate"".

Abusers displayed an outward charm and often a fierce devotion to their partner, particularly early on. This gave way to cruelty, with verbal and then – months later – often physical abuse randomly juxtaposed with a return to warmth and affection.

""It fits patterns of intermittent reward and punishment, a staple of grooming,"" said Lesiak. ""Many women described classic love-bombing in the early stages. Some spoke of such intense happiness that other non-abusive relationships paled in comparison.""

""These relationships start with enchantment. The coercion and abuse that follows is so disorientating, it leaves victims desperate to preserve the earlier image of their abuser.""

Study participants all reported childhood trauma – from emotionally distant parents to sexual abuse. The perpetrators cultivated a sense of shared pain, coaxing personal histories out of the women by sharing accounts of their own traumatic childhoods.

This information was exploited by abusers as a tool of control, either to generate false intimacy, or through humiliation: belittling their partner over who had it worse, or using it to mock them in front of others.

""All the perpetrators co-opted the healing potential of mutual trauma to justify abuse, foster dependency, and obscure responsibility for their own actions,"" said Lesiak.

Lastly, when asked how they felt about their former partner, most women compared their situation directly to addiction, and admitted retaining a compulsion to see their abuser despite clear cognitive understanding of this impulse as destructive.

""While it is uncomfortable, I must respect the language used by the participants, and it was explicitly that of addiction and craving. Several women related it directly to hard drug use,"" said Lesiak. In fact, three study participants relocated to new cities just to reduce the chances they would reinitiate contact. 

""Abusers make sure their partners experience euphoric highs and desperate lows,"" said Lesiak. ""This creates a powerful psychological reward system that operates on the same logic as a slot machine, with unpredictable wins, sudden losses, and escalating self-blame.""

Lesiak argues that professional training for police and other frontline workers should include recognising non-physical forms of entrapment – such as the ""two-faced soulmate"" profile – as indicators of coercive control.

""All human bonds involve care, endurance, and sometimes pain. By coupling cycles of affection and cruelty with the exploitation of shared trauma, abusers create a bond they can use as a tool of control.""

Peginterferon-α treatment exhibits low rates of the serological conversion rate of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and the negative conversion rate of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, with significant myelosuppression leading to treatment discontinuation in some patients. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may ameliorate liver inflammation and modulate immune responses. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of combining TCM with pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN) α-2b and its impact on myelosuppression adverse effects.

This study included 117 HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients who started initial antiviral therapy at Xiamen Hospital of TCM between June 2018 and January 2023. According to the treatment regimen, patients were divided into the observation group (n = 56, receiving PEG-IFN α-2b combined with Licorice 15 g, Angelica sinensis 20 g, Poria 20 g, Paeonia lactiflora 20 g, Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae 20 g, Radix Bupleurum Chinense 20 g, Mentha piperita 3 g, Ginger three slices for more than six months) and the control group (n = 61, receiving PEG-IFN α-2b alone). This study retrospectively analyzed etiological indicators, liver biochemical indicators, and blood routine tests before and after treatment.

After 24 and 48 weeks of treatment, the observation group demonstrated significantly superior outcomes to the control group in quantitative reduction of hepatitis B surface antigen, the serological conversion rate of HBeAg, and the reduction in HBV DNA quantification (P < 0.05). By week 48, the HBV DNA negative conversion rate in the observation group (46.67%) was significantly higher than that in the control group (26.67%) (P < 0.05). Regarding safety, the incidence of myelosuppression in the observation group was significantly lower than that in the control group at both 24 and 48 weeks of treatment (P < 0.05)

Real-world findings demonstrate that adjunctive TCM significantly enhances the antiviral efficacy of peginterferon α-2b in HBeAg-positive CHB patients while concurrently mitigating treatment-limiting myelosuppression. This combination strategy may represent a clinically valuable approach to optimizing interferon-based therapy for CHB.

In a compelling Genomic Press Interview published today in Genomic Psychiatry, Dr. Najaf Amin unveils transformative insights that fundamentally reshape international understanding of depression genetics. The Oxford University Associate Professor, ranked among the top scientists globally in genetics and the top women in science worldwide, shares ground breaking discoveries that promise to revolutionize how researchers across continents approach major depression. With over 350 peer-reviewed publications and an exceptional h-index of 125, Dr. Amin has positioned herself at the vanguard of molecular epidemiology, challenging long-held paradigms about depression pathogenesis through innovative multi-omics approaches that extend far beyond traditional genetic frameworks.

The interview, published as part of the Innovators & Ideas series, reveals how Dr. Amin transformed early career setbacks into scientific breakthroughs that now influence research laboratories from Europe to Asia. Her journey from Pakistan to becoming one of Oxford's leading molecular epidemiologists exemplifies the power of perseverance in advancing global medical knowledge. When traditional genome-wide association studies failed to produce significant results for depression, Dr. Amin pioneered alternative approaches that have since yielded extraordinary discoveries benefiting researchers and patients worldwide.

Dr. Amin's identification of the RCL1 gene mutation represents a watershed moment in depression research, opening entirely new avenues for understanding the disorder's biological mechanisms. This discovery connects primate-specific interlaminar astrocytes to depression pathogenesis, providing researchers worldwide with novel therapeutic targets previously unexplored. Her work challenges the conventional view of depression as primarily a neurotransmitter imbalance, instead revealing it as a systemic disease involving multiple bodily systems.

The scope of her contributions extends beyond single gene discoveries. Leading the most extensive published studies on epigenomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiome in major depression, Dr. Amin has identified 124 metabolites associated with the disorder, with 49 being entirely novel discoveries. These findings, published in prestigious journals including Nature Communications and JAMA Psychiatry, provide the international scientific community with crucial biomarkers that could revolutionize diagnosis and treatment approaches globally.

The interview reveals Dr. Amin's paradigm-shifting perspective on depression as fundamentally a systemic disease rather than purely a brain disorder. This conceptualization transforms how researchers worldwide approach the condition, encouraging investigation of immune system disturbances, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction, oxidative stress, and metabolic perturbations. Her integrative approach, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and single-cell analysis, provides unprecedented molecular insights that benefit laboratories across continents pursuing personalized medicine approaches.

Dr. Amin emphasizes the critical importance of understanding feedback loops among biological, psychological, and social factors in depression development and maintenance. This holistic view influences treatment strategies globally, moving beyond one-size-fits-all models toward personalized interventions tailored to individual biological markers, life histories, and environmental contexts. The implications extend to public health policies worldwide, as her research demonstrates why depression contributes to higher morbidity and mortality through its effects on multiple physiological systems.

The interview provides intimate glimpses into the personal challenges that shaped Dr. Amin's scientific philosophy and resilience. Her transition from electronics enthusiast to world-renowned geneticist began with her own diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome at age 19, sparking curiosity about genetic mechanisms that would define her career. The narrative of overcoming significant personal and professional obstacles, including navigating academia as a brown woman from a developing country, resonates with scientists worldwide facing similar barriers.

Dr. Amin candidly discusses critical moments that nearly derailed her career, including the departure of her supervisor early in her doctoral studies and initial project failures that left her without publications. Her mentor, Professor Cornelia van Duijn, played a pivotal role in transforming these setbacks into opportunities for growth. This relationship exemplifies the importance of mentorship in fostering scientific excellence across cultural and geographic boundaries.

Her advocacy for equality, diversity, and inclusion in scientific grant awards and promotions addresses systemic issues affecting researchers globally. Dr. Amin's observation that she must invest ""at least twice the effort"" of many European counterparts to achieve comparable outcomes highlights persistent inequities requiring international attention and reform.

Looking forward, Dr. Amin outlines ambitious goals for experimentally verifying causal associations between genetic and environmental risk factors for depression. Her vision encompasses developing integrated models spanning the entire chain of causation from risk exposure to molecular perturbation to clinical outcomes. This comprehensive approach promises to benefit healthcare systems worldwide by enabling more effective prevention and intervention strategies.

Since ancient times, it was thought that painful stomach ulcers were caused by eating spicy foods or having an unhealthy diet. But since then, researchers have found that Helicobacter pylori—a common bacterium found in over 60% of the world's population—was the real culprit behind most stomach ulcers and a high risk for stomach cancer.

Now scientists from the Ateneo de Manila University School of Science and Engineering's Department of Biology are on the way to finding a vaccine to fight off the bacterium, possibly preventing stomach ulcers and lowering the risk for stomach cancer.

Ateneo biologists Demy Valerie Chacon, Kiana Alika Co, Daphne Noreen Enriquez, Aubrey Love Labarda, Reanne Eden Manongsong, and Edward Kevin Bragais used a cutting-edge approach called ""immunoinformatics"" that combines computer science with immunology to scan the genetic makeup of pathogens and predict which parts of them can trigger a strong immune response. By running thousands of gene sequences through these computational tools, researchers can narrow down the most promising vaccine targets much faster and at lower cost than through trial-and-error lab work alone.

The Ateneo biologists have identified key proteins produced by H. pylori that help it survive stomach acid, stick to the stomach lining, and evade the body's natural immune system. Their analysis also identified parts of these proteins that are most likely to be safe, non-allergenic, and capable of activating protective immune cells.

While their research findings are still preliminary and based on computer simulations, the next steps include laboratory testing to validate these predictions. To date, there are no approved vaccines against H. pylori despite ongoing tentative research in other laboratories around the world. However, if successful, the Ateneo research could pave the way for the first-ever H. pylori vaccine that could help guard against stomach ulcers and cancer.

Liver cancer is one of the world's deadliest malignancies, ranking as the third leading cause of cancer-related death. While advances in surgery have improved safety, recurrence after hepatectomy remains a formidable challenge. Among the various patterns, hyper-progression recurrence (HPR) stands out for its speed and severity—multiple tumor nodules erupt within months, overwhelming the liver's capacity and leaving patients with few curative options. Conventional staging systems fail to capture this risk, leaving clinicians without clear guidance. Because of these challenges, it has become essential to develop predictive models and molecular insights that can help identify high-risk patients and guide more effective strategies.A research team from Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital and partner centers conducted one of the largest studies to date on liver cancer recurrence, following 3,125 patients across eight hospitals. Published (DOI: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2024.0514) online July 11, 2025, in Cancer Biology & Medicine, the work reveals a set of predictive nomogram and inference tree models capable of stratifying patients before and after surgery. By combining clinical predictors with molecular profiling, the study not only delivers practical tools for doctors but also highlights MYCN/HMGA2 as a key molecular signature of aggressive recurrence.Over 16,000 liver cancer patients were initially screened, with 3,125 meeting strict inclusion criteria. Among them, 16.2% experienced HPR, often within the first four months post-surgery. These patients had markedly lower survival rates and were almost entirely limited to palliative or supportive care.Through statistical analysis, nine independent risk factors emerged, including young age, elevated alpha-fetoprotein, large tumors, multiple nodules, vascular invasion, microvascular invasion, high Ki67 index, incomplete tumor capsule, and postoperative complications. A preoperative nomogram built from six of these predictors achieved striking accuracy, with an area under the curve exceeding 94%. When combined with a conditional inference tree, the model effectively distinguished patients at very low, moderate, and very high risk, enabling tailored surgical decisions.To extend this framework, a postoperative model incorporated all nine predictors and further guided the use of early adjuvant therapies. Patients at high postoperative risk who received transcatheter chemoembolization or hepatic artery infusion therapy had improved outcomes compared to those without additional treatment. At the molecular level, nearly 5,000 genes were differentially expressed in HPR tumors. Enrichment of cell cycle pathways, immune exhaustion, and especially co-expression of MYCN and HMGA2 underscored the biological aggressiveness driving this recurrence type.

Our findings move beyond observation to action. We now have reliable tools to predict which patients are likely to face this devastating recurrence and can adapt treatment plans accordingly. For some, surgery may not offer benefit, while others could gain from early adjuvant therapies. Equally important, the discovery of MYCN/HMGA2 co-expression gives us a molecular marker to pursue in future drug development. This dual approach—clinical prediction and biological understanding—brings us closer to precision oncology in liver cancer.""

Dr. Lunan Qi, senior author of the study

The study provides a roadmap for managing one of the toughest challenges in liver cancer care. Preoperative models can help identify patients who may not benefit from surgery, reducing unnecessary risk, while postoperative models guide the timely application of adjuvant therapies. This tiered strategy allows for more personalized treatment, improving the chances of longer survival and better quality of life. At the same time, the identification of MYCN/HMGA2 as a marker of poor prognosis opens doors for new targeted therapies. Together, these insights offer clinicians practical tools and scientists fresh directions to tackle aggressive liver cancer recurrence.

Rapid and urgent action on food is needed if the UK is to reboot its flagging economy, save the NHS billions, ensure national food security, and meet climate commitments, according to a new report.

The Roadmap for Resilience: A UK Food Plan for 2050, calls for radical transformation, at a scale and pace not seen since the Second World War. It says if we do not act now, change will be forced upon us by increasing pressures and the UK will lurch from crisis to crisis, including from food price shocks, climate disasters and weakening economic productivity.

Acting now however, allows the UK to decide its own future, and must include three core transformations: more resilient farming, smarter land use, and healthier diets. Government must take the lead with ""decisive and coordinated action"", says the report, and proposes 10 key recommendations and a timeline to 2050.

The report is published as renewed attention is being given to global food system transformation, including through the EAT-Lancet Commission's latest report released earlier this month.

""Achieving this transformation has the power to deliver a food system where everyone in the UK has access to healthy and sustainable food,"" said Neil Ward, Co-lead of the Agri-Food for Net Zero (AFN) Network+, which coordinated the report, and a professor at the University of East Anglia (UEA).

Through these three transformations we can reduce pressure on the NHS and help people lead healthier and more economically active lives. Nature will flourish, emissions will fall and farming will be more resilient and secure for future generations.""

Neil Ward, Professor, University of East Anglia

""Pressures from climate change, global shocks and poor diets mean significant change to our food system is inevitable over the next 50 years. However, if we act now, we still have time to shape our future, and positively impact national security, national health, economic growth and climate change. Our window to act is narrow though - if we do not, change will be forced on us by crisis,"" added Professor Ward.

The report had input from 150 scientists and industry professionals from across research institutes, farming, charities and the food industry, and is the culmination of three years of work by the AFN Network+, a project funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), with 3,000 members and led by a group of 11 universities and research institutes.

The report highlights that the UK food system is a significant source of national greenhouse gas emissions and will become the largest source of emissions by the 2040s. Meanwhile, poor diets cost the economy £268 billion a year in direct healthcare costs as well as indirect costs such as low economic activity, and 7.2 million people now live in food-insecure households - an increase of 80% in just three years. Adding to these challenges, the UK is vulnerable to supply chain disruptions, since it is dependent on imports for 50% of vegetables and 85% of fruit, despite these being essential to healthy diets.

The Roadmap calls for transformation in three key areas:

 

The authors set out 10 priority actions, urging the government to work in partnership with farmers, food companies and local authorities. These include:

Professor Tim Benton, Co-lead of the AFN Network+, said: ""Every year of delay makes transformation harder and more costly. We call on all parties, public institutions, industry and civil society to unite to drive forwards the transformations highlighted in this Roadmap. Change is coming to our food system, but how we shape it is our choice to make.""

Professor Charlotte Deane, Executive Chair of UKRI's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, said: ""Agri-food remains one of the UK's most stubborn sources of emissions.

""The AFN Network+ has brought together a powerful community of research leaders and stakeholders across UK agri-food, third sector organisations, policymakers and agri-food industry professionals to tackle this challenge and now delivered a clear roadmap for change.

""Our investment has resulted in a legacy of insights which will help shape future land use and food strategy, supporting the UK's path to net zero.""
The Roadmap for Resilience: A UK Food Plan for 2050 was developed by the AFN Network+, drawing on insights from across its community of more than 3,000 members. The AFN Network+ is jointly led by UEA, the University of Leeds, University of York, and the University of the West of England.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Why doctors and patients in Italy still rely on oral corticosteroids for asthma","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251015/Why-doctors-and-patients-in-Italy-still-rely-on-oral-corticosteroids-for-asthma.aspx","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 07:18:00 GMT","

Surveys of more than 1,000 Italian patients and clinicians uncover why oral steroid use remains widespread in asthma care, revealing gaps in guideline adherence, patient education, and access to advanced biologic therapies.

Study: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients with asthma: how far is clinical practice from the guidelines? Results from surveys of patients and doctors. Image credit: zlikovec/Shutterstock.com

A recent Frontiers in Allergy study examined usage patterns and barriers to adherence to oral corticosteroid (OCS) treatment guidelines for asthma in Italy. To do so, surveys were conducted with healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients.

Asthma affects an estimated 262 million people worldwide, with the highest incidence seen in children under nine. Globally, its prevalence has increased by about 15% between 1990 and 2019. In Italy alone, around 4 million people live with asthma, including approximately 200,000 with severe asthma (SA), a group that represents a substantial burden on healthcare resources and costs.

The management of SA often requires the use of long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs). Existing guidelines recommend the use of OCS only as a last option due to severe adverse effects, such as growth impairment in children and iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency. Despite this, OCS medications are commonly prescribed in asthma treatment. However, patients have their concerns, and research shows that about 44% of adults report worries about OCS use, sometimes leading them to reduce or discontinue treatment without medical supervision by HCPs. Therefore, a gap exists between clinical practice and guidelines, which needs to be examined.

To address the knowledge gap between guidelines and clinical practice concerning asthma treatment, the Respiriamo Insieme Association in Italy, in collaboration with Sanofi, conducted two surveys among HCPs (survey 1) and patients (survey 2). The current study documents the results of these surveys, which aim to reduce OCS dependence and enhance the quality of life of SA patients.

Survey 1 comprised seven closed-ended questions (six multiple-choice and one rating scale) and gathered insights into the OCS prescribing practices, barriers to proper use, potential overuse patterns, and adherence to current guidelines. Survey 2 explored patients' perspectives on awareness and involvement in treatment decisions, usage patterns, treatment adjustment and monitoring, education provided by HCPs, management of adverse events (AEs), and safety practices concerning OCS use.

A total of 366 HCPs completed the survey, and 82% preferred a 10-day OCS treatment duration. A duration of more than 21 days was preferred by 14% of HCPs, and the remaining opted for longer treatment durations. Ninety-nine percent of HCPs said that either more than 6 months of OCS use per year or 2 or 3 cycles per year was necessary to classify a patient as OCS-dependent. The remaining 1% thought a single cycle was enough. Concerning the annual cumulative corticosteroid use, 28% reported never keeping track of the total OCS dose for their patients, 40% reported doing this, 24% did this occasionally, and the remaining 8% based their calculations on prescribed OCS doses.

Twenty-seven percent of HCPs thought the maximum safe daily dose was 7.5 mg/day, while 43% put this at 5 mg/day. Twelve and 18% thought the safe limits were 2 mg/day and 10 mg/day, respectively. Regarding strategies to minimize the OCS dose in managing SA, 43% responded that changing the ICS/LABA combination was the most effective. This was closely followed by using biologic therapies (37%). More than half of the HCPs thought that a multidisciplinary approach is crucial to prevent adverse effects of OCS, and about 44% recommended monitoring visits for bone densitometry every two years.

Overall, patients and their families/caregivers completed 829 questionnaires, of which 468 belonged to patients with SA. Only two-thirds of patients with non-SA were prescribed OCS, compared with 95% of patients with SA. Around 47% of SA patients used OCS more than once, for at least two cycles per year, compared with 27% of non-SA patients. Overall, 13% of SA and 14% of non-SA patients reported having ceased OCS use. Forty-seven percent of SA patients and 24% of non-SA patients used OCS once a year or more without a valid prescription. Forty percent of SA and 31% of non-SA patients did not taper the dose when stopping, while 52% and 33% of SA and non-SA patients did, respectively.

In about 71% of SA patients, the physician involved them in the decision to take OCS, compared to 43% for non-SA patients. Physicians did not inform 45% of non-SA and 49% of SA patients about the possible alternatives to OCS, respectively. Concerning the long-term strategy, inhaler medications were common in the non-SA group, while biologics were most common in the SA group.

Twenty-two percent of non-SA patients reported being informed about adverse reactions, whereas 35% reported never being informed. Among the SA patients, 41% were informed about potential side effects, while 57% reported not being referred to a specialist. Most patients did not receive a bone health assessment. The study also found that about 40% of patients self-administered OCS at least once per year without a prescription, often due to fear of exacerbations or difficulty accessing healthcare. This reflects the ease of access to OCS without a prescription in Italy. A much higher proportion of SA patients acquired OCS without a valid prescription, relative to non-SA patients.

The findings show a significant discrepancy between guideline recommendations and clinical practice, and OCS use remains very high in Italy. Reducing unnecessary OCS use through biologic therapies could also help lower healthcare costs.

Several unmet needs and proposed systemic reforms: establishing a clearer and pragmatic definition of “OCS dependency,” improving patient education and shared decision-making, increasing access to multidisciplinary care (including psychological support), and using digital or diary-based monitoring tools to track OCS adherence and side effects.

A key limitation of the study was the inability to distinguish between respondents from pediatric and adult care settings. This may have led to misinterpretation of notable differences in OCS use between adults and children. Secondly, the study's cross-sectional nature exposes it to response bias, inaccurate self-reporting, and recall bias. Finally, the results may not be generalizable to other populations as the study was conducted on a selected set of Italian HCPs and patients.

The study underscores the persistence of high OCS use despite guideline recommendations, highlighting the need for coordinated education, standardized monitoring, and integrated psychological and specialist care to reduce unnecessary OCS exposure in severe asthma management.

A low-fat vegan diet that doesn't limit calories or carbohydrates could help people with type 1 diabetes reduce insulin use and insulin costs, according to new research by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine published in BMC Nutrition.

Insulin is a hormone that helps move glucose (sugar) from the blood into muscle and liver cells to be used as energy. People with type 1 diabetes must take insulin because their body doesn't produce enough. Some people with type 1 diabetes may need to take additional insulin, because they have insulin resistance, a condition in which cells don't respond well to insulin and glucose remains in the blood. Insulin resistance is strongly influenced by dietary fat, which can inhibit glucose from entering the cells.

The new research, which is a secondary analysis of a 2024 Physicians Committee study, compared the effect of a low-fat vegan diet to a portion-controlled diet on insulin use and insulin costs in people with type 1 diabetes. The analysis found that the total dose of insulin decreased by 28%, or 12.1 units, per day in the vegan group, compared to no significant change in the portion-controlled group. The reductions in insulin use in the vegan group likely reflect improved insulin sensitivity, or how well the body responds to insulin. Total insulin costs decreased by 27%, or $1.08 per day, in the vegan group, compared to no significant change in the portion-controlled group.

The 2024 study found that a vegan diet also led to an average weight loss of 11 pounds, improved insulin sensitivity and glycemic control, and improved cholesterol levels and kidney function in people with type 1 diabetes.

The new research comes as insulin prices in the United States continue to rise. Spending on insulin in the United States tripled in the past 10 years, reaching $22.3 billion in 2022, due to the increased usage and higher price of insulin, according to the American Diabetes Association. The inflation-adjusted cost of insulin increased by 24% from 2017 to 2022.

As insulin prices continue to rise, people with type 1 diabetes should consider a low-fat vegan diet, which can help improve their insulin sensitivity and reduce the amount of insulin they need, potentially saving them hundreds of dollars a year.""

Older adults, especially those living with health conditions, who hold positive views about aging are more likely to engage in vigorous physical activity, according to a study led by the University of Surrey.

Surrey researchers found that how an individual's outlook on aging - whether they see it as a time of growth or decline - is a significant correlate of their physical activity levels.

The research, published on Healthcare, analysed data from 1,699 UK residents aged 50 and over, and found that positive views on aging were linked to a greater likelihood of engaging in vigorous activity. People with a higher number of non-communicable diseases - such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease - were more likely to engage in vigorous physical activity if they had a more positive view of aging.

Our research suggests that a positive outlook on aging could act as a psychological buffer, helping individuals stay active despite health challenges. Addressing people's beliefs about aging may be just as important as addressing their physical health needs, which should be considered when designing public health strategies to promote a healthy and active lifestyle.""

Professor Victoria Tischler, co-author of the study and Professor of Behavioural Science, University of Surrey

The researchers propose that public health campaigns and interventions should support older people to maintain a positive attitude towards physical activity, even if they experience illness or long-term conditions. So, promoting positive views on aging can be important not only to promote health, but also to improve the quality of life in older people who experience one or more health conditions. These efforts could help older adults reframe aging not as a period of inevitable decline, but as a life stage where it is still possible to maintain an active and engaged lifestyle.

Dr Serena Sabatini, lead author of the study and visiting lecturer at the University of Surrey adds:

""The ultimate goal is to create a society where an active and engaged later life is not only possible but expected, even in the presence of health challenges.""

Rodney Scott, MBChB, MRCP, DipStat, PhD, Division Chief of Neurology, Nemours Children's Health, Delaware Valley, has received a prestigious National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director's Transformative Research Award. Dr. Scott will use the $2.6 million, five-year grant to investigate malfunctions in the brain's hippocampal region, aiming to identify patterns that could lead to shared therapies for patients with autism, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease.

""In disorders like autism, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's, the part of the brain called the hippocampus doesn't function properly. Current treatments target each disease separately, often with limited success,"" Dr. Scott explained.

Instead, our research will look for shared abnormal brain activity patterns across conditions. If found, we will develop novel methods of brain stimulation that could restore healthy hippocampal function across a range of disorders.""

Dr. Rodney Scott, MBChB, MRCP, DipStat, PhD, Division Chief of Neurology, Nemours Children's Health, Delaware Valley

The NIH Transformative Research Awards promote cross-cutting, interdisciplinary approaches, supporting high-risk, high-reward research that could potentially create new paradigms for understanding disease and developing new therapies and preventive strategies.

Dr. Scott's project will analyze patterns of dysfunction in the hippocampus, the region of the brain that regulates memory and emotions. The research is based on the theory that autism, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's may share the same faulty mechanism-specifically, a disruption in the brain's neural networks. Through his NIH award, Dr. Scott and co-principal investigator Matt Mahoney, PhD, Principal Computational Scientist with the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, will devise living and computer models to pinpoint the disruption. Dr. Scott's research team will collect biological data, while Dr. Mahoney and colleagues will lead the effort to develop mathematical models. Together, the investigators will be able to examine a high volume of data and potentially accelerate the pace of discovery.

Dr. Scott joined Nemours Children's in 2021, continuing an accomplished career that has spanned hospitals in Zimbabwe, England, and the United States. He has made groundbreaking advances in the treatment and management of epilepsy, as well as the application of complex adaptive systems theories to neurological disease. In addition to his post at Nemours Children's, he is a Professor of Neurology and Pediatrics at Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University; and a Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Delaware.

""This high-risk, high-reward support from the NIH allows investigators like Dr. Scott to develop and rigorously test innovative ideas that are not in the mainstream,"" said Matthew M. Davis, MD, MAPP, Executive Vice President, Enterprise Physician-in-Chief, and Chief Scientific Officer, Nemours Children's Health. ""Through this research, it may be possible to improve cognitive function and quality of life for patients with a broad range of neurological conditions, in childhood and adulthood. This project demonstrates Nemours Children's commitment to research and academic excellence in the pursuit of advancing science and improving health outcomes for generations to come.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","The role of polyethyleneimine in enhancing polymer-DNA nanoparticle delivery","https://www.news-medical.net/whitepaper/20251015/The-role-of-polyethyleneimine-in-enhancing-polymer-DNA-nanoparticle-delivery.aspx","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 14:53:00 GMT","

Polyethyleneimines (PEIs) are extensively researched as non-viral vectors for gene and medication delivery because of their capacity to condense nucleic acids into nanoparticles known as polyplexes.1

Compared to viral vectors, PEIs have lower immunogenicity, higher loading capacity, and lower production costs.2

However, their clinical translation has been hampered due to low transfection efficiencies.3

The type of polyplex formation, which regulates cellular absorption and intracellular release, is an important element in managing transfection.

Effective delivery systems require polyplexes that are sturdy enough to avoid premature nucleic acid release, while remaining weak enough to release the payload at the appropriate time and position within the cell.4

Understanding the intermolecular interactions and conformational changes involved in polyplex synthesis and stability is critical for enhancing PEI-based delivery platforms. According to Mustafa et al., attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy is ideal for this application.5

It reveals molecular-level information about DNA structure and binding via vibrational modes of the phosphate backbone and nucleobases. This article shows how ATR-FTIR can be utilized to characterize polyplex production using linear and branching PEI architectures.

Mustafa et al. provide a detailed discussion of their procedures. ATR-FTIR measurements were taken using a commercially available FTIR spectrometer with a Harrick ConcentratIR2™ multiple reflection silicon ATR attachment.5

Two PEI structures were investigated: linear (LPEI, 15 kDa) and branching (BPEI, 10 kDa). Polyplexes were generated at N/P ratios ranging from zero to three in 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).

The final concentrations were three millimolar LPEI, five millimolar BPEI, and one millimolar DNA. Before measurements were taken, the samples were incubated for one hour at room temperature.



Figure 2. Diagrams showing the probability of bound DNA by polymers obtained from the ATR-FTIR spectra of LPEI and BPEI polyplexes in the presence of varying NaCl concentrations (50-250 mM). Image Credit: Specac Ltd

To confirm the spectrum interpretation, additional samples were generated at increasing sodium chloride concentrations (50-250 mM) to test for electrostatic interactions. All spectra were background removed, baseline corrected, and normalized.

Figure 1 shows ATR-FTIR spectra of DNA with increasing N/P ratios for LPEI and BPEI. With LPEI, the asymmetric phosphate stretching band at 1222 cm-1 shows a noticeable frequency shift as N/P rises, showing strong electrostatic binding to the DNA backbone.

This frequency shift also signals a conformational change in the DNA structure, from B to Z. Moderate alterations were found in the nucleobase ring stretching region (1400-1500 cm-1) and carbonyl band (1680 cm-1). These modifications imply that LPEI interacts weakly with DNA nucleobases.

The spectra of BPEI-based polyplexes exhibited no shift at 1222 cm-1, but a considerable intensity decrease and splitting of the 1680 cm-1 band, indicating interactions with nucleobases via intercalation, without major disruption of the phosphate backbone.

Salt screening assays supported these interpretations. Figure 2 shows that increasing NaCl reduced LPEI binding by around 70 %, consistent with electrostatic interactions. At the greatest salt concentrations, BPEI binding decreased by just 20-30 %, indicating that interactions with DNA nucleobases primarily aid binding.

This study shows that ATR-FTIR with the ConcentratIR2 accessory may successfully distinguish between binding modes in PEI-DNA polyplexes.

The 1222 cm-1 phosphate band detects electrostatic interactions between LPEI and DNA, while the 1680 cm-1 band indicates BPEI intercalation with nucleobases. These findings serve as a foundation for developing more successful non-viral gene delivery technologies.

After a remarkable career that includes two FIFA Women's World Cup titles and recognition across multiple club leagues, U.S. women's national team and Angel City FC forward Christen Press has announced she will retire following the conclusion of the NWSL season. 

""It's hard to find the words to say goodbye to a sport that has defined my life for over three decades. Football has given me everything, and I will miss being on the pitch so very much. Thank you to my family, friends, teammates, coaches, and community for this beautiful ride. I promise we will continue to reimagine sports in this next life,"" Press said in a statement.

The long-time attacker, known for her iconic cut-backs and clinical finishing, leaves a profound impact on and off the field. As she closes her playing career with Angel City FC, the 36-year-old closes a chapter on an influential tenure in women's soccer. The California native built the beginning of her career at Stanford University and broke school records.

She became the all-time leading scorer with 71 goals, while also setting new benchmarks for career points (183), assists (41), and shots (500). She left the University as a Mac Hermann trophy winner and two-time runner-up at the NCAA Women's College Cup.

Press is part of a larger group of players who helped domestic league soccer grow in the United States. She was part of Magicjack in the WPS and was named 2011 Rookie of the Year. After the league folded, Press was among a wave of U.S. players who continued their club careers in Europe, and played in Sweden with Goteborg FC and Tyreso FF where she became the first American to win the Damallsvenskan Golden Boot (2013) and scored 25 goals in 26 games for Tyreso.

As the NWSL launched, Press returned to the states in 2014 to play in the new American league. She became the Chicago Red Stars' leading goal scorer with goals (35) during her time with the club. She later joined Utah Royals FC in 2018 after a brief return in Sweden, and also played in England's Women's Super League with Manchester United in 2021 before returning to her hometown, Los Angeles, and became Angel City's first player signing. 

The success across club performances led to titles at the international level. Press leaves the U.S. women's national team with 155 appearances and 64 goals, while being a key member of the USWNT's iconic era, winning back-to-back World Cups in 2015 and 2019, and a 2020 Olympic bronze medal. She was an integral part of the USWNT's legal battle against U.S. Soccer for equal pay.

Her impact had a ripple effect on and off the pitch and forever changed women's soccer in the United States when she came forward alongside former teammates and anonymous sources with her early experiences in NWSL. She discussed her time in Chicago and the conditions of a toxic workplace and abusive environment. The reporting led to more investigations into player wellness across women's American soccer, including the Sally Yates report and the NWSL and NWSL Players Association joint investigation report. 

Press' legacy will continue through advocacy, entrepreneurship, media, and philanthropy. She's been a long-time global ambassador and board Member for Grassroot Soccer, an adolescent health organization that uses soccer as a tool to educate and inspire youth in developing countries.

In 2019, she launched RE-INC, a gender-neutral lifestyle brand that aims to reimagine the status quo and create a more inclusive landscape in sports media. The RE-CAP Show she hosts alongside her wife, Tobin Heath, has become a platform to center female athletes and champion inclusivity. She's been vocal about the importance of visibility and respect for LGBTQ and Black players and communities. 

Her final season with Angel City has been a powerful comeback story. Press returned in 2024 following a grueling two-year journey that included four surgeries after tearing her ACL in 2022. She scored her first home goal since her injury in May 2025.

Press's career is an inspiring story of a great goalscorer who ultimately became a builder of greater things. As she savors her final moments on the field, she leaves the game in a far better position than she inherited. She'll be remembered not only for the records she broke or titles she won, but for the many she inspired along the way and the barriers she helped tear down.

Trinity Rodman, one of the scoring stars of the Olympic gold medal run in Paris last year, is returning to the U.S. women's national soccer team in time for its match at Rentschler Field on Oct. 26.

Rodman, who scored three goals at the Olympics, including a game-winner in the knockout stage against Japan, has been sidelined much of the last 15 months managing recurring back injuries. But she has returned to her pro team and was called up to the 26-player USWNT roster announced Wednesday by coach Emma Hayes.

“We are extremely excited to get back together with the team,” Hayes said as the roster was revealed on Wednesday. “There has been a big gap from July until now and we've watched many club games. Now, it's time to start the build toward qualifying for the 2027 World Cup. We want to maximize every minute we have together, push the players, and keep the momentum going. These three fantastic games ahead of us will help us do that.”

From a modest beginning in CT, Patrick Agyemang is returning home a soccer sensation with USMNT



The U.S. team has three friendly matches lined up: Portugal on Oct. 23 in Pennsylvania and again in East Hartford on Oct. 26, then New Zealand in Kansas City on Oct. 29.

Stratford's Alyssa Naeher, who retired after a history-making career as America's goalkeeper, will be honored before the game at Rentschler at 4 p.m., following the U.S. men's deaf national team's friendly match against Germany, which starts at 1 p.m.

Rodman, 23, the daughter of former NBA star Dennis Rodman, turned pro in 2021, joining the Washington Spirit in 2021. She has been with the USWNT since 2022, making the 18-player roster for the Olympics.

Her back injuries kept her out until April 2025, when she scored a goal for the U.S. in a win over Brazil, and a recurrence kept her out until recently. But Rodman has five goals in 11 games since returning to the Spirit.

“When she came in in April, I think she really felt she was in a good place, but the reality was having so much adrenaline got us through that game,” Hayes told reporters on a Zoom call Wednesday. “But afterwards, that reality hit home that there were some issues in her back that were unresolved and, collectively with club and country, we took the time to say, look, we've got to get it right for the long term. And I think that club and country collaboration has really put her in the position she's in right now.”

CT's Alyssa Naeher posts third straight shutout as US women's soccer team clinches gold



Over her career, Rodman has played 47 games with USWNT, scoring 11 goals.

Hayes gave many of her European pro players a break from action during the summer, but has reassembled most of her top players for this game in East Hartford, in which she will probably have 23 active. The rest of her roster:

Forwards: Michelle Cooper, Catarina Macario, Trinity Rodman, Yazmeen Ryan, Emma Sears, Ally Sentnor, Alyssa Thompson.

Midfielders: Sam Coffey, Lindsey Heaps, Claire Hutton, Rose Lavelle, Sam Meza, Olivia Moultrie, Jaedyn Shaw, Lily Yohannes.

Defenders: Jordyn Bugg, Emily Fox, Lilly Reale, Tara McKeown, Avery Patterson, Emily Sams, Emily Sonnett, Kennedy Wesley.

Goalkeepers: Claudia Dickey, Mandy McGlynn, Phallon Tullis-Joyce.

Where do you even begin when talking about a legendary career like the one Angel City FC and USWNT superstar forward Christen Press has had? Today was the day plenty of women's soccer fans likely saw coming, but were absolutely looking to avoid. Even now, if you listen hard enough, you can probably hear a swelling of ‘la-la-la-la-la-‘ with hands over ears, hoping that if they don't hear the words, then it can't make it true. Unfortunately for the game, it is true, as Christen Press has announced her retirement from soccer, with these final two games in the NWSL 2025 season, being her last.

Thank you, Christen 🖤
Angel City Football Club forward Christen Press has officially announced her retirement from professional soccer, concluding one of the most accomplished and influential careers in the modern era of the sport.

“It's hard to find the words to say goodbye to a sport that has defined my life for over three decades. Football has given me everything, and I will miss being on the pitch so very much. Thank you to my family, friends, teammates, coaches, and community for this beautiful ride. I promise we will continue to reimagine sports in this next life!!” shared Christen Press as she reflected on her retirement.

In a statement, Angel City FC CEO and Co-Founder Julie Uhrman said “Christen retires as one of the most decorated and respected forwards in U.S. soccer history, a pioneer whose legacy is woven into the very fabric of our club. As Angel City's first signing, Christen's contributions to the club have been unparalleled. From her extraordinary skill and relentless competitiveness on the pitch to her unwavering commitment to making the game and our community more equitable, inclusive, and impactful. On behalf of everyone at Angel City, we thank Christen for everything she has given to the sport, our club, and future generations of athletes and fans.”

Christen Press wraps up her career as not only one of the best players this sport has ever seen, but as one of the most influential off the pitch that this sport has had the honor of knowing. She finishes as one of the leading scorers in USWNT history, netting 64 goals in her 155 International caps. She played a critical role in helping the National Team win back-to-back World Cup titles (2015 and 2019) as well as helping secure Olympic Bronze in the 2021 Olympic Games.

Then there's the domestic list of achievements. Press is a Hermann Trophy winner from her time at Stanford University, where she set multiple scoring records. She has played in four different leagues, WPS, NWSL, FA WSL, and Sweden's Damallsvenskan. She won the Golden Boot in Sweden as a member of Tyresö FF, scoring 25 goals in 26 appearances that season. In the WSL she featured in 14 matches for Manchester United where she scored four goals, but most will know her for her time in the NWSL, where she has played for Chicago Stars, Utah Royals, and most recently her hometown team Angel City FC, where she became the club's first signing back in 2022, acting as an ambassador for the club's mission of equity and inclusion. She has scored 49 regular-season goals across her 122 NWSL appearances.

Beyond her on-field achievements, Press has been a driving force in athlete advocacy and the evolution of women's sports. Through her company RE—INC, she has championed athlete ownership, creative expression, and social progress, continuing to shape the landscape of sport long after the final whistle. Which is what makes this announcement such a bittersweet moment. For so many women's soccer fans, she was the entry point. A creative, technically precise, high work-rate forward who made the game look easy at times. Exuding confident and kindness, Press has been the type of player even the most casual of ball knowers have heard about. Her impact on this sport will last for generations, and she retires as one of the most decorated and respected USWNT players. With just one last home match remaining in the 2025 NWSL season, expect the Los Angeles soccer legend to make it a day to remember, with what will likely be a packed BMO full of fans, family, friends, admirers and those who gained inspiration from Press all showing up to say their goodbyes, and thank her for the honor of being able to watch her approach this game not just with immense talent and ability, but with incredible dignity and strength.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

The U.S. women's national team will be back in action after 113 days. The program will play a three-game series in October against Portugal and New Zealand, and head coach Emma Hayes has named a 26-player roster for the upcoming matches. Two of the three games will feature retirement celebrations for Alex Morgan and Alyssa Naeher as the group aims to build off their previous meeting, a 3-0 win over Canada, in July.

""We are extremely excited to get back together with the team,"" said Hayes. ""There has been a big gap from July until now and we've watched many club games. Now, it's time to start the build towards qualifying for the 2027 World Cup. We want to maximize every minute we have together, push the players, and keep the momentum going. These three fantastic games ahead of us will help us do that.""

The three game window will begin against Portugal on Oct. 23 and Oct. 26 before concluding against New Zealand on Oct. 29. The expanded roster is to help manage player minutes and match load with the upcoming NWSL playoffs set to begin in November, and Hayes will only name 23 players on matchdays.

Forward Trinity Rodman returns to the USWNT camps for the first time since April. The lengthy absence was due to a back injury, and she has since returned to play with her club, Washington Spirit. Rodman scored the game-winner in her last USWNT appearance, a 2-0 win against Brazil. Gotham FC midfielder Jaedyn Shaw also marks her return to the senior team after featuring with the U-23 team since April. 

While Hayes is narrowing down her pool of players ahead of FIFA Women's World Cup qualifiers in 2026, there are still players earning first-time callups. Second-year San Diego Wave defender Kennedy Wesley was named to the roster and could make her senior debut over the three friendlies after spending time with the U-23 program earlier this year.

The October international window will have continued training camps running alongside the senior team. The U-23 program will be in Philadelphia, and the U-20 team will be in Kansas City, concurrent with the USWNT. The dual camps are an example of the U.S. Soccer's development philosophy, the U.S. Way, which focuses on and encourages increased opportunities for youth national teams.

Also returning to the roster are several Americans who play abroad. Five players, midfielder Lindsey Heaps, defender Emily Fox, forward Catarina Macario, midfielder Lily Yohannes, and goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, were given the summer window off. Alyssa Thompson joins the roster from Chelsea FC, her first call-up since moving to Europe. Each player is currently playing in the UEFA Champions League. Fans can watch every UWCL match across CBS Sports platforms , Paramount+, CBS Sports Network , and CBS Sports Golazo Network.

Take a look at the official roster:

Goalkeepers (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 2), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 4), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United, ENG; 3)

Defenders (8): Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC; 2/0), Emily Fox (Arsenal FC, ENG; 67/1), Lilly Reale (Gotham FC; 2/0), Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit; 8/0), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash; 6/1), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride; 5/0), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC; 110/2), Kennedy Wesley (San Diego Wave; 0/0)

Midfielders (8): Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC; 38/4), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 167/38), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current; 6/1), Rose Lavelle (Gotham FC; 113/25), Sam Meza (Seattle Reign FC; 2/0), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC; 9/2), Jaedyn Shaw (Gotham FC; 26/8), Lily Yohannes (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 8/1)

Forwards (7): Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current; 8/1), Catarina Macario (Chelsea FC, ENG; 24/11), Trinity Rodman (Washington Spirit; 47/11), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston Dash; 12/2), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville; 8/1), Ally Sentnor (Kansas City Current; 12/4), Alyssa Thompson (Chelsea FC, ENG; 22/3)

Tara McKeown and Trinity Rodman will join USWNT for friendlies against Portugal and New Zealand 

Washington, D.C. (10/15/2025) – Washington Spirit defender Tara McKeown and forward Trinity Rodman have been called up to the U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT) for the side's October friendlies, U.S. Soccer announced today. The U.S. will take on Portugal and New Zealand in three friendly matches later this month. 

McKeown earns her sixth consecutive call-up to the U.S. senior team in just her third season at center back. Making her first appearance and start for the USWNT against Colombia in this year's SheBelieves Cup, McKeown also tallied her first international assist when she connected with Ally Sentnor for a second half goal. In a July friendly against Canada at the Spirit's home ground of Audi Field, McKeown earned her second assist from the back line. The defender has tallied eight total appearances and two assists for the USWNT. 

Rodman returns to the USWNT for the first time since early April after taking time over the spring and summer to rehab her back. In her most recent call-up, the standout scoring threat netted a goal just five minutes into a friendly against Brazil in front of over 32,000 fans at Sofi Stadium in Los Angeles. With the senior team, Rodman has tallied 11 goals and nine assists across 47 appearances. 

USWNT's October Friendly Schedule: 

McKeown moved from forward to defender after the 2022 season and has been a stalwart for the Spirit, appearing in 71 regular season matches since. An NWSL Defender of the Year finalist and Iron Woman in 2024, the standout also earned NWSL Player of the Week honors last month for her performance in the Spirit's away shutout of the Shield-winning Kansas City Current. 

Rodman has had a stellar second half of the regular season with the Spirit, tallying five goals and two assists so far and earning NWSL Player of the Month honors for September. The star forward's play since the start of August has helped Washington clinch the second overall seed and home-field advantage in the NWSL Playoffs for the second consecutive season. 

The Spirit will return to Audi Field for a championship rematch with the Orlando Pride on Saturday, October 18 at 12:30 p.m. EDT. The match will be Washington's final home match before the playoffs. Tickets are available here.

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — A bittersweet result for the U.S. men's team as the march toward next summer's World Cup continues.

The good news? Haji Wright scored twice to secure the first come-from-behind win under coach Mauricio Pochettino. The bad? USMNT star Christian Pulisic was forced to leave the friendly in the first half because of what appeared to be an injury to his right hamstring. 

Here are my takeaways:

The country's best attacking player came into this two-match window nursing a hamstring problem that Pochettino said has been bothering him since AC Milan's preseason. It swelled up following last Wednesday's training session in Austin, Texas — ruling Pulisic out of Thursday's practice and limiting him to less than 20 minutes off the bench a day later.

But there Pulisic was back in the starting lineup at Dick's Sporting Good Park — much to the delight of the home fans. That feeling didn't last. After being on the receiving end of two crunching early tackles, Pulisic — wearing the captain's armband in Tim Ream's absence — limped to the U.S. dressing room after being replaced by Diego Luna. There was no immediate word on Pulisic's condition, but it was a worrying sight nonetheless.

""He is still being assessed,"" a USMNT spokesperson said. ""We'll have an update after the game.""

Wright made his first career start under Pochettino and just his his fifth overall. Two of those came at the 2022 World Cup. But his last five appearances had all been off the bench. So had 14 of his previous 18.

Playing the center forward role Folarin Balogun excelled in over the last three games, Wright took advantage of the opportunity. Fourteen minutes after the visitors opened the scored, the rangy Los Angeles native pulled the Americans level by finishing off a passing sequence that included Richards, Weston McKennie and Roldan, who sprung Wright and was rewarded with the assist:

Wright's second goal was even better. Roldan again set up the strike by taking a quick free kick following a foul about 80 yards from the Aussies' goal. Wright ran onto the service, then turned center-back Cameron Burgess inside out with a cutback before curling his shot inside the far post:

For the second match in a row, sloppy play by the Americans allowed their opponent to score first, leaving the hosts chasing the game against a stout defensive foe. In last week's 1-1 tie against Ecuador, an Aidan Morris turnover sprung a counterattack that finished with U.S. keeper Matt Fresse picking the ball out the back of his net.

On Tuesday, the USMNT committed an even more egregious error, as the Socceroos opener came following a throw-in deep in their own half — a cardinal sin at any level, let alone the highest one. Defender Chris Richards and defensive midfielder Cristian Roldan were both slow to react when James Sands got a toe on the throw by Australia's Jordan Bos. Roldan eventually stepped to the ball, but he was only able to deflect it into the midsection of Bos. The Feyenoord left back controlled, then blasted home a shot that Freese had no chance of saving:

With just two training camps remaining before Mauricio Pochettino names his roster for the 2026 World Cup, the tournament co-hosts must tighten that up in short order to hav any chance of making a deep run on home soil next summer. ""We conceded a goal,"" Pochettino told TNT's Melissa Ortiz at halftime, ""that we shouldn't concede.""

During his pregame press conference on Monday, the former Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham Hotspur manager suggested that he would rotate players for the back end of the two-contest set given the cooler temperatures and mile-high altitude in the greater Denver area. He ended up switching out more than half of his starting lineup, making six changes in all. 

Along with Balogun, Ream was also on the subs bench along with Morris, Max Arfsten, Tanner Tessmann and Malik Tillman, who wasn't even in uniform. (Arfsten, Balogun and Tessmann entered in the second half, as did Brenden Aaronson, who didn't feature last week.)

In their places were Roldan, Wright, Alex Freeman, Mark McKenzie and defensive midfielder James Sands, who won his first cap in more than two years. All acquitted themselves well, with center back McKenzie teaming with Richards and Miles Robinson for the first time. That's a high-quality problem for Pochettino to have going forward.

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. – If there's ever been evidence that the U.S. Men's National Team is growing under head coach Mauricio Pochettino, it might be best encapsulated by the team's last three matches. 

The team is riding a three-match unbeaten streak, dating back to September. The trio of games began when the U.S. put together a resounding 2-0 win over Japan on Sept. 9 led by a technically superb volley from Alex Zendejas and a skillful second-half finish from Folarin Balogun. 

The second was the first match of the October window. When facing a surging Ecuador side that had only given up one goal in its 10 previous matches, the U.S. didn't flinch. The Americans rallied after conceding an early goal and equalized against a very strong defensive side to draw the match in Austin, Texas. 

Finally, the third was the team's latest performance against Australia on Tuesday night. Haji Wright and Cristian Roldan linked up twice to steer a massive come-from-behind win in Commerce City, Colorado and record the first comeback win in Pochettino's tenure with the USA. 

“Any time you can win against these kinds of opponents, it's a big confidence boost,” said James Sands, who started alongside Roldan in the central midfield Tuesday night. 

In all three matches, the United States showed flashes of goal-scoring and a fighting mentality. Twice, the Americans trailed – twice they fought back. And in each match, Pochettino found positives to take away. 

One of those major takeaways was the quality of the competition. 

All three opponents the United States has faced during this unbeaten run are teams that have already secured qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. These nations are among the top in their confederations. Ecuador finished second in CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifying, just after 2022 champion Argentina. Japan was the first team outside of the host nations to qualify for the 2026 tournament. Australia is a top-ranked squad in the AFC. 

Two of these teams, Ecuador and Australia, were riding double-digit unbeaten streaks heading into their matchups with the U.S. 

Given these strong resumes, the U.S. has approached these matches seriously. While the matchups are labeled as international friendlies, the U.S. has adopted a competitive mindset with only so many windows together before next summer's tournament — a message that has come from Pochettino and his coaching staff. 

“It's important to size ourselves up against these nations because we understand that we're going to be competing against these guys at the World Cup,” Roldan said. “It's really important these last two windows, and hopefully our next window, we can show a little progress and confidence after some of these good performances.” 

Pochettino has been reiterating the importance of progress this year in the lead-up to the World Cup. He's still learning things about his team – following both matches in the October window, the manager was positive but expressed that there are details the team needs to iron out. He's still putting different combinations of players on the pitch. For example, against Australia he made six changes to the starting lineup from the Ecuador match. Pochettino is also observing players in different situations and seeing which connections are fruitful – like Wright and Roldan on Tuesday night. 

“It does wonders,” Wright said of the confidence this win gives them. “We're playing against quality opposition now, so we're gearing up for the final test before the World Cup starts, and we're happy with a win today.” 

The U.S. has been progressing in this build-up which is starting to dwindle as the World Cup draws nearer. Even going back to earlier this summer with the USMNT's Concacaf Gold Cup run, which featured 14 players on this October roster, progress was made. Under Pochettino, the team gave up just one goal in the group stage and advanced all the way to the final. Players emerged in that tournament like Matt Freese, who made his debut this summer and has gone on to become a valued piece in the goalkeeping room. The 24-year-old goalkeeper has started 10 straight matches for the USMNT, including Tuesday's win. 

“It's important to start building confidence, but it's also very important to continue to improve and trust in the process,” Freese said. “As each result comes, we want to be putting together results, but we also want to be putting together performances. Over the long run, that leads to more successes. As we lead into the World Cup next summer, these friendlies are not so friendly. It becomes about getting a result and showing that next summer when the whistle blows, we're there to get a win.” 

The October window closed on a high note for the group, and November is just around the corner. The United States will have a chance to extend its current unbeaten run against two more World Cup-bound nations: Paraguay and Uruguay. 

The goal for that window, as center back Chris Richards put it, is to ""keep stacking them up."" 

“It gives us confidence knowing that we are not even close to being 100 percent,” Richards said. “That's probably the biggest takeaway from these two games we've had is that we still have so much more to grow and so much more potential – it's kind of untapped right now. It's a process. It's a journey. I know by the World Cup next summer, we'll be ready for it.”","{'href': 'https://www.ussoccer.com', 'title': 'US Soccer'}","soccer"

Alejandro Bedoya believes the USMNT's 2-1 win over Australia was ""a good exercise"" for Mauricio Pochettino's squad. (2:14)

A little more than a month ago, the U.S. men's national team seemed to be in disarray. The results were poor, the individual performances offered little in the way of hope, and the push for competition within the team seemed based more on wishful thinking than reality.

Yet with the October window now concluded, it's clear that the recent gathering of USMNT players was a success, and there has been discernible progress made in terms of the team's preparations for next summer's FIFA World Cup. The team's momentum has never been higher this cycle. Granted, that's a low bar given where they've been, but they're evolving nonetheless.

The results have improved to the point that the U.S. is now unbeaten in its past three games, two of them wins, all against teams who have punched their ticket to the World Cup. More importantly, there is competition for places everywhere on the field.

At forward, Haji Wright has emerged to challenge Folarin Balogun, even as the latter still has an edge in terms of securing a starting spot.

The midfield seems jumbled, but in a good way. Before there didn't seem to be many candidates actually making a strong case for inclusion on a World Cup roster; now the likes of Tanner Tessmann, Aidan Morris and Cristian Roldan -- the ultimate late bloomer if there ever was one -- all look capable of making a contribution on the biggest stage.

The attackers sitting behind the central striker are making cases as well. Weston McKennie looks to have come in from the cold after being frozen out by manager Mauricio Pochettino in September. Against Australia, Diego Luna reminded everyone why he's a Pochettino favorite, with his high-energy and incisive play giving the USMNT a boost. Malik Tillman looked sharp against Ecuador.

The backline, with the help of a 3-4-3 system (at times) looks to be more stable than what was on display in the sobering 2-0 defeat to South Korea barely a month ago.

Yet for all the progress made, in some respects, the October window left one wanting more.

Christian Pulisic was a bit-part player, limited to a total of 45 minutes over two games due to an ankle injury and a hamstring ailment sustained against Australia. Tillman was limited as well, unable to take the field against Australia due to a tender hamstring of his own. Alejandro Zendejas, one of the heroes of September, was sidelined with a knee issue. Left back Antonee Robinson, whose return from offseason knee surgery had been hugely anticipated, never made it onto the field, with his recovery from the aforementioned procedure dragging on and on. This is on top of players like Tyler Adams, Ricardo Pepi and Johnny Cardoso also being absent, with the latter two ruled out with injury.

Getting all of the U.S. teams' best players on the field at the same time -- or even most of them -- remains an elusive goal, and there aren't many more opportunities to see what that looks like prior to the start of the World Cup.

The positive is that despite these absences, the U.S. was still able to not only get results, but for the most part look good doing it. The competitiveness within the squad has also reached a point where those who were absent -- besides Adams and perhaps Robinson -- have fallen down the depth chart, and are at risk of being left behind.

Harder to overlook is the USMNT's maddening habit of slow starts that have resulted in conceding the first goal -- something that has happened seven times in 16 matches in 2025 -- which was the case this window against both Ecuador and Australia. Even aside from the goal against the Socceroos, the USMNT seemed flummoxed by Australia's high defensive line. The U.S. recovered in both matches, even securing a comeback win against the Socceroos, the first come-from-behind win of the Pochettino era.

The U.S. manager alluded to the ""good and not-so-good"" of the team's comeback ability. When the World Cup starts for real in June, the Americans won't be able to afford to make the kind of defensive mistakes that led to them falling behind in these matches.

But the USMNT's resolve, oftentimes suspect this cycle, now seems to possess more solidity. Pochettino noted that ""it's no coincidence"" that the U.S. recorded a comeback win now that the team's culture is in a better place. ""Culture"" has long been one of those squishy, imprecise words that gets thrown around a lot to explain both successes and failures, but when Pochettino talks about it, the picture conjured up in the mind's eye is more like razor wire than a down pillow. There is steel behind his words and actions.

The U.S. manager's message appears to have been received loud and clear by the players, with McKennie among those who have taken it to heart the most. The Juventus midfielder was active in both matches, and against Ecuador seemed especially adept at finding Balogun in behind the defense. The question now is whether he fends off the likes of Tillman and Zendejas to keep his spot on the field as an attacking midfielder. McKennie at his peak would be hard to displace from the lineup.

That is the kind of battle that adds plenty of intrigue to the November window, which will include matches against Paraguay and Uruguay. The battle for the two double-pivot spots in midfield will be intense, too, as will the starting striker position.

Health will play a part in determining who rises and falls. No team enters a World Cup completely injury-free. There are always players who miss out. All the more reason why the sight of performers stepping up -- be it Roldan or Luna or Wright -- is encouraging.

Now the U.S. finds itself on an upward trajectory again. The looming World Cup, once looked at with a certain level of dread, is generating excitement again. There is a greater sense that this team can do the country proud.

Credit Pochettino for the turnaround, although he knows better than anyone there is still work to be done.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Midfielder has two assists in 2-1 win over Australia.

Given a massive opportunity to strengthen his World Cup spot, Cristian Roldan delivered arguably his best-ever performance for the United States men's national team. Roldan started as one of the double-pivots in Maurcio Pochettino's 3-4-3 and registered two assists to help lead the USMNT to a 2-1 win over Australia on Tuesday.

The performance drew rave reviews from Pochettino.

“He's what we need,” the USMNT head coach said. “We need players with confidence, with some belief, with a little bit of competitiveness. 

“Cristian is an example of how if you want to build your perfect player, he has a little bit of everything. Off and on the field, that's what we find.”

The match did not start out quite so well for Roldan, though, after he struggled to clear a ball into the box that allowed Australia to jump out to a 1-0 lead in the 19th minute.

But Roldan didn't let that get him down and just 15 minutes later he slipped in Haji Wright with pass that cut out several defenders. Wright did the rest with a first-time finish.

RIGHT FOOT. WRIGHT FINISH! 

#USMNT x VW

Early in the second half, Roldan showed off the trademark combination of smarts and skill that have made him so good with the Seattle Sounders. After a foul in the USMNT's end, Roldan noticed Wright making another run. He immediately played a ball into the channel where Wright controlled, made a move to open some space and then hit a perfect curling shot.

Haji is Wright twice tonight. We've got the lead!

#USMNT x VW

Roldan was eventually pulled in the 76th minute with a stat line that looked like this: 4/4 on duels, five recoveries, two interceptions and 47/52 passing. 

“I'm riding the wave. I've had such a great second half of the year. It's been great to enjoy the moment. I'm continuing in that way and not being satisfied. I know I can reach another level.”

There's obviously a lot of time between now and next summer's World Cup. But considering it was just about a month ago when Roldan had not been called into the USMNT in two years, he's now remarkably close to making that dream a reality.

“I'm not saying he's going to be in the next roster or World Cup,” Pochettino said. “But with what we've seen so far, he's a player we wanted to give an opportunity, and look what's going on.”","{'href': 'https://www.sounderatheart.com', 'title': 'Sounder at Heart'}","soccer"

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — From the moment Mauricio Pochettino named his 26-man squad for the United States' two World Cup tuneups this month, he repeated variations of the same message.

""Nobody's place is guaranteed,"" the coach said again the day before Tuesday's come-from-behind win over Australia that concluded the October international window.

Some questioned this approach. The argument against it, Pochettino acknowledged after Haji Wright's two goals led the Americans past the Socceroos, was that he needed to pick a starting lineup and stick with it to build continuity with just two more training camps left before the Argentine must pick his roster for the 2026 World Cup co-hosted by the U.S. next summer.      

Tuesday's victory validated Pochettino's strategy.

The former Chelsea, PSG and Tottenham manager rotated out more than half of his starting lineup from last week's 1-1 draw with Ecuador, and was rewarded. With star attacker Christian Pulisic forced to the locker room in the first half with what was later revealed to be a hamstring issue, the Americans overcame a 1-0 deficit for their first comeback victory in Pochettino's tenure.

""That's not a coincidence,"" the coach added.

Reserve midfielder Cristian Roldan set up both goals with beautiful passes to Wright, who was making his first start under Pochettino. Wright took his rare opportunity to start with aplomb. His second goal was particularly classy, and it could go a long way toward helping the big striker make his second consecutive World Cup trip.

""They've got fantastic players, and I'm sure these players will keep growing with this manager,"" Australian boss Tony Popovic said of the U.S. squad. ""And I'm sure they'll have a large pool of players to choose from. I'd be pretty confident if I was a USA fan at the moment.""

Slowly but surely, belief is growing among the American players, too.

""It gives us confidence knowing that even without one of our best players, we can continue to score goals against top teams,"" said U.S. defender Chris Richards.

This month's opponents were certainly that. Ecuador finished second in South America's World Cup qualifying tournament. The Aussies arrived riding a 12-game unbeaten streak dating back more than a year. They, too, will be back for the 48-team main event next June.

All three U.S. goals this month came without Pulisic on the field. Pochettino's side was also minus several other projected starters, including 2022 World Cup captain Tyler Adams and injured fullbacks Sergiño Dest and Antonee ""Jedi"" Robinson.

Captain Tim Ream was rested on Tuesday. So was Folarin Balogun, who had scored in each of his two previous appearances and eventually came on as a second half substitute.

In the thin air at Dick's Sporting Goods Park, the understudies got the job done.

But a perfect performance it wasn't. The goal the Americans allowed was weak. Richards and Roldan both admitted that they should've been quicker to react to the danger.

""In the World Cup, if you start the game in the way that we started and concede a goal like this, then it's difficult to have another chance,"" Pochettino said. ""In all areas, we need to improve.""

Still, the response was encouraging.

""After getting scored on, it was kind of like the punch that we needed to wake us up. A lot of teams would crumble, especially because it's a friendly,""Richards said. ""People say they don't mean anything, but for us, it means everything. 

""Going into a World Cup, we want to win as many games as possible. We had to fight. We just kind of needed that wake-up. I bet they probably regret waking us up like that.""

Wright was a worthy Man of the Match. But the award could've easily gone to Roldan, the 30-year-old Seattle Sounders veteran who had not played for the USMNT in more than two years before being recalled last month. Known as a glue guy, Roldan proved Tuesday that he can help on the field as much as in the meal room.

""I'm a player that doesn't necessarily get on the stat sheet a whole lot,"" said Roldan, who was an unused sub at the last World Cup in Qatar. ""To contribute in that way, it's obviously amazing.""

The U.S. will look to build on the win when they reconvene in the Philadelphia area next month for another pair of exhibitions.

""The next two games are going to be very difficult, like Ecuador and Australia,"" Pochettino said. ""Paraguay and Uruguay are two very good teams, very competitive. And I think they are going to help us to continue growing.""

Who starts those matches is anyone's guess.

""I think I have to continue to perform, Wright said when asked if he felt he'd helped make his World Cup case with the two goals. ""If I just shut off now, chances will probably diminish. But I'm happy that it happened. And I try and build off that.""

That's the idea.

""I am happy,"" Pochettino said. ""I am not satisfied.

""I'm pleased, but I wanted more,"" he continued. ""I wanted to see more. I wanted to perform better. I wanted to see individual players doing better. But that is my competitive blood. Because I always want to win, but I want to play better.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Folarin Balogun is living up to the hype as a long-awaited top striker for the USMNT","https://www.inquirer.com/soccer/folarin-balogun-usmnt-world-cup-mauricio-pochettino-20251016.html","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 16:07:17 GMT","

Along with Haji Wright, who scored both goals Tuesday against Australia, Balogun has given the U.S. soccer team a desperately needed scoring threat.

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — It's one of those things that befuddles soccer's devotees as much as its critics.

The net is big, and the field is vast. So why do people in the sport often say that scoring a goal is the hardest thing to do?

It surely can't be that difficult to run forward, have a teammate pass you the ball, and shoot it in.

During the last men's World Cup in 2022, U.S. fans had to spend the Monday after Thanksgiving explaining to their office colleagues why a 0-0 tie — a most un-American result — against England was one of the best games the team has ever played.

The retort was obvious: If it was that good, why didn't they score?

Three years is a long time to wait for answers. But as next year's tournament draws closer, the new American squad may have finally found them.

Haji Wright is one. He carried his strong club form with Coventry City of England's second division into Tuesday's 2-1 win over Australia, scoring both U.S. goals with style.

Ricardo Pepi is another, though he hasn't shown it for a bit. He's just back from a long injury absence that has kept him from the national team since last November. Hopefully he'll return for next month's games, including a matchup vs. Paraguay at Subaru Park.

But the biggest answer is Folarin Balogun. Two-and-a-half years since he joined the senior U.S. national team, he has seized the mantle for his country.

The 24-year-old Brooklyn native has scored goals in two of the Americans' four games so far this autumn, taking his career total to seven tallies in 21 national team appearances. Both numbers likely would be bigger if not for shoulder and ankle injuries over the last 12 months.

“It was a fantastic and unique journey for me to begin playing with the men's national team,” Balogun said, a journey that included being recruited to the U.S. program with all the flash of a college football team chasing a quarterback. 

» READ MORE: The USMNT seems on course to do something it hasn't done in nearly a quarter century

He delivered an early payoff with a goal in the 2023 Concacaf Nations League final, and scored twice in last year's Copa América group stage — one of the only U.S. players who wasn't a flop in the tournament.

But then came those injuries, halting his momentum and that of the national team. We'll never know how much better things could have gone at this year's Nations League final four had Balogun been there.

“Last year was frustrating, being out for so long with a shoulder injury, but all I can do is just focus on the present and focus on what I can control,” Balogun said. “I've had the game[s], obviously, in the last camp [in September], and that was just important for me to be around the team again and just to reintegrate. And for me it's about building momentum, consistently being a part of the team, and being available — the most important thing for any athlete is to be available.”

When he said that, no one thought to ask if he knew that phrase was popularized by another former New Yorker years ago. But then again, Balogun was six months from being born when Bill Parcells departed the Jets in January 2001. (Of the current U.S. squad's 26 players, only 38-year-old Tim Ream was alive when Parcells left the Giants in 1990.)

“I want to prove that to myself, prove that to the coaching staff,” Balogun said of hoping to stay healthy. “And, yeah, I think once I'm on the pitch, and the longer I'm on the pitch, building confidence, good things are going to happen. It's a process, but I'm definitely happy with how it's going.”

So is manager Mauricio Pochettino.

“Well, what I like the most is that he is scoring,” he said earlier this week, a line that even soccer critics might like. “When they score is what I like the most in a striker. And then I think, his work ethic: available to drop and to play and to connect.”

» READ MORE: Folarin Balogun's goal earns the USMNT a creditable 1-1 tie with Ecuador

As Pochettino spoke, he was interrupted by a banging noise from a nearby wall. Alas, it did not come from a chorus of those critics wishing to thank him. It was just the wind outside, flying down from the Rockies and slamming into a closed door.

“I think [there are] many things about the game, not only to score — that is what I like the most — but also it's the capacity to link with the team,” Pochettino said. “He's a player who can drop and play, as you see with our offensive players and midfielders, and going to the [open] space, running. [He] has a little bit of everything that I like.”

Just as significant as Balogun's form and skills are the players around him. Pochettino's 3-4-2-1 formation allows for the striker to get service in multiple ways, from the wingbacks out wide and the attacking midfielders more centrally. The ball might come through the air or on the ground, via a cross or via a threaded ball up the middle — the kind Balogun fizzed home against Japan.

“He's taken his opportunities, and that's all you can ask for [from] a No. 9,” fellow New Yorker Tim Weah said, referring to a striker's traditional jersey number. And he would know, as a former forward who now plays as one of those wingbacks for the U.S. and Italian club Juventus.

» READ MORE: The USMNT is finally back on track, and Mauricio Pochettino has done what he said he'd do

“We all know he's an amazing player and he can help us save a game,” Weah continued. “He's sticking his foot out in actions, he's running behind, fighting the defenders. … Hopefully we can feed him some more and get him some more goals.”

Nor is it a coincidence that the assist for Balogun's goal vs. Japan came from Christian Pulisic, and the one for his goal vs. Ecuador on Friday came from Malik Tillman. Their dynamism and creativity sets up Balogun to be his best, and that's a big part of why they're now atop the attacking midfield depth chart. 

Weston McKennie can add another element, as can Alejandro Zendejas, Brenden Aaronson, or Gio Reyna if he can regain a place on the squad.

“He's always going off the back shoulder — he's really difficult to deal with, because he's always dribbling, going at players, and also going in behind,” the Medford-born Aaronson said. “He's got two different [ways] that he can play: He can hold up the game, and he can also go in behind and create chances by himself. He's a really good player, and he's really good for this squad.”

» READ MORE: After missing last month's USMNT gmaes, Brenden Aaronson hoped to make an impression this time

Balogun appreciates how he fits in with his teammates, and with Pochettino's system.

“I feel like the manager gives us that freedom to just do what we want up there, and I think that shows in the way we play,” he said. “Everything's kind of just freestyle. But we're good enough players to figure it out, and he believes in us.”

As Balogun has grown into the U.S. team on the field, he has grown into the country off it, too. Though he was born in Brooklyn, he moved to London with his Nigerian parents after just a month. He has spent his entire professional career in Europe, only able to visit the United States for national team games and too-rare vacations.

So he makes the most of those moments when he can.

“I love being back here — especially in New York, my favorite city,” he said. “I definitely feel like I get my trips in. I would like more, and after my career, I think it's somewhere I would like to live. Being in Europe, balancing that with international football, I'm not going to get as much time as I want, but I definitely feel like I do get enough time there.”

U.S. fans in Philadelphia might have to forgive Balogun next month for his choice of city. But they know as well as his team that right now, he's on the way to the greatest trip home of all.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Updated B/R Men's International Football Power Rankings for World Cup 2026","https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25260858-updated-br-mens-international-football-power-rankings-world-cup-2026","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 14:15:00 GMT","

The penultimate international break of 2025 may have robbed us all of club football action, but it at least made the 2026 World Cup picture a little clearer.

England, Egypt, Algeria, Ghana, South Africa, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Cape Verde punched their tickets for the showpiece event in North America in October, with the latter set to make its first appearance at the global football tournament. 

That brings the confirmed party guests up to 28 nations, with another set of fixtures in November expected to yield a few more RSVPs.

While FIFA's official world rankings provide a useful gauge of where each country stands in the international game, it doesn't exactly account for nuance. 

That's where we come in. Read on for the latest power ranking of the top 20 men's international football teams. 

20. Ivory Coast

FIFA ranking: 44

B/R September ranking: New entry

After dropping out of B/R's international power ranking in September, having landed in 20th in March's edition, the Ivory Coast is back.

While fellow World Cup qualifiers from Africa might be higher in FIFA's ranking—Algeria (38th), Egypt (35th), Senegal (18th)—the Elephants are the reigning Africa Cup of Nations champions, which gives them an edge in this context. 

Ivory Coast just pipped Gabon to the top of qualifying Group F courtesy of a 7-0 win over Seychelles and a 3-0 victory against Kenya in October. 

With that, the Elephants return to the World Cup after last appearing in 2014. In North America, they will be hoping to progress from the group stages for the first time in their history. 

19. Ecuador 

FIFA ranking: 24

B/R September ranking: 16

After landing as high as 11th in B/R's world football rankings in March, Ecuador has been gradually slipping away.

That high spot was as a result of incredible form in CONMEBOL qualifying, in which La Tri finished second. 

While Ecuador can be proud of that placement, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was helped by the underperformance of other South American nations.

In fact, while La Tri are undefeated in their last seven games, they have only won one, albeit an impressive 1-0 victory over Argentina. 

Momentum seems to be flagging a bit, and that's reflected in their drop in power ranking.

18. USA

FIFA ranking: 16

B/R September ranking: 18

In 10 games since the start of the Gold Cup on June 15, the United States has lost just two matches.

That might be an overly optimistic way of looking at the team's run of results, but it still reads well, and it includes games played in a tournament setting. 

The Stars and Stripes finished the October break with a draw against Ecuador and a victory against Australia, two teams that will also be playing in next summer's tournament. 

With Ecuador finishing second in CONMEBOL qualification ahead of Brazil, Uruguay, and Colombia, that 1-1 stalemate doesn't look as problematic either.

It's not exactly Earth-shaking form, but the Stars and Stripes are starting to look solid while approaching their co-hosting duties.

17. Japan

FIFA ranking: 19

B/R September ranking: 19

Japan has been disappointing since sealing World Cup qualification in March, with just two wins in six matches from June onwards.

However, on Tuesday, the Samurai Blue came back from 2-0 down to secure a 3-2 friendly win over Brazil.

Of course, it's easy to point to that result coming in an essentially meaningless game, but it demonstrates the team's resilience, and Brazil still put out a strong XI. 

For Japan, it's now about fine-tuning ahead of the World Cup in June, and more results like the one against the Seleçao Canarinho will set it up nicely for North America. 

16. Uruguay 

FIFA ranking: 15

B/R September ranking: 15

Uruguay has demonstrated a notable level of consistency in the last two international breaks, going undefeated in four games and winning three.

For a squad that was criticized for being frustrating in September's B/R rankings, that's a notable improvement.

However, with teams surrounding Uruguay performing at a similar level in the last few months, and the level of competition it faced not as strong—Peru (48th), Chile (57th), Dominican Republic (142nd), and Uzbekistan (54th)—it falls a place to 16th.

Friendly matches are an opportunity to rotate and test tactics, so underperforming is to be expected. Still, if La Celeste wants to establish a dark horse reputation for themselves heading into the tournament, like they have in years past, they will need some better results.

15. Norway

FIFA ranking: 31

B/R September ranking: 17

Norway stormed into September's B/R power rankings, and it looks intent on staying there on the way to its first World Cup appearance since 1998.

Largely thanks to the most deadly striker on the planet, Erling Haaland, the Scandinavians are at the top of qualifying Group I with a staggering goal haul of 29, seven more than the next top-scoring team, the Netherlands. The 25-year-old is responsible for 41 percent of them. 

As long as Haaland is around, Norway is a potent threat. Despite having the lowest FIFA ranking of any team listed here, they should not be underestimated. Rather, Norway should be feared. 

However, that reliance on Haaland was demonstrated in his absence on Tuesday. Without the Manchester City striker, Norway could only manage a 1-1 draw with New Zealand. 

Manager Ståle Solbakken will be frantically placing an order for bubble wrap. 

14. Belgium

FIFA ranking: 8

B/R September ranking: 13

Manager Rudi Garcia has brought a spark back to the Belgian men's national team. 

The Frenchman has guided the Red Devils to five wins in eight matches in charge, and they sit on top of World Cup qualifying Group J with a game in hand over North Macedonia.

Now, it looks certain Belgium will be heading to the World Cup, and the squad will be full of confidence after scoring 20 in the last five games

Despite North Macedonia playing at a standard well above their 63rd-place FIFA world ranking, the fact that the Red Devils couldn't crack them over two qualifying games—including a 0-0 draw in October—will be a mild concern. 

13. Italy

FIFA Ranking: 10

B/R September Ranking: 14

With two matches to go, Italy is still trailing Norway in qualification Group I. That means a trip through the playoffs is the most likely scenario to seal their spot in the global soccer showcase.

The Azzurri will surely fancy their chances should it come to that, but it's an extra layer of jeopardy they would undoubtedly rather not have to deal with. 

Italy has not qualified for a World Cup since the 2014 edition in Brazil, and being on the outside looking in once again will surely be too much to bear for the nation's football-mad fans.

Thankfully, Italy is on a good run of form, picking up five consecutive wins and scoring 18 in the process.

12. Mexico

FIFA ranking: 14

B/R September ranking: 10

Mexico is having a serious Gold Cup hangover. No wins in four games since lifting the trophy is a hugely disappointing run, with their co-hosting duties approaching.

Among those results was a crushing 4-0 home loss to Colombia in October. While the friendly fixture provided an opportunity to test potential options before the nation opens its doors in June, the nature of the defeat will dampen what would otherwise be jubilant preparations. 

While still the most promising among the host nations in terms of possible success, Mexico needs to turn things around with a little over six months to go.

11. Colombia

FIFA ranking: 13

B/R September ranking: 11

After no wins in six from November 2024 to the end of August 2025, some alarm bells were sounding for Colombia.

However, World Cup qualification was sealed in September, and Los Cafeteros have now won three of their last four while scoring 13 in the process.

James Rodriguez is still performing international miracles at the age of 34, scoring once and providing four assists in those fixtures. 

Meanwhile, Luis Diaz's hot start to life with Bayern Munich will give the South Americans even more hope for a long stay in the neighboring northern continent.

10. Croatia

FIFA ranking: 9 

B/R September ranking: 12

Croatia keeps plugging away, picking up decent results to keep them top of UEFA qualification Group L.

An away draw with Czechia in their most difficult remaining game of the qualifying stage would have been greeted positively, although the bafflingly brilliant form of the Faroe Islands will at least give the Vatreni cause for concern in their penultimate qualifying fixture.

While only three points separate Croatia from Czechia in second, the former has a game in hand, which at least provides some margin for error on the road to the World Cup.

9. Brazil

FIFA ranking: 6

B/R September ranking: 6

Consistency is an increasing concern for Brazil. Granted, that's difficult to achieve on the international stage, given issues with establishing chemistry and the difficulty of squeezing a raft of talent into XI spots.

However, for a team of Brazil's enviable selection options and a manager of Carlo Ancelotti's caliber, things don't look so promising ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

In six games in charge, the Italian has only managed to guide the Seleçao Canarinho to three wins. That includes a 1-0 loss to 77th-ranked Bolivia and a 3-2 collapse against Japan when they were 2-0 up.

There's a lot of work to do between now and June if Brazil wants to reestablish its previously feared reputation.

8. Morocco

FIFA ranking: 11

B/R September ranking: 9

By rights, Morocco should be much higher in the international power rankings.

Outside of the African Nations Championship—a tournament that European-based players don't participate in—the Atlas Lions have lost just once since January 2024.

However, the strength of opponents has to be factored in, with Morocco not often tested by low-ranked African nations. 

That's still a remarkable streak, though, and one that shouldn't be taken lightly. Victories breed victories, after all. 

With Achraf Hakimi in the form of his life, fresh off being ranked the sixth-best player in the world at the 2025 Ballon d'Or awards, he'll be a driving force as captain in North America.

7. Germany

FIFA ranking: 12

B/R September ranking: 8 

After a woeful run of form that saw Germany go winless in four matches from late March to early September (including three defeats), things are looking up for the Die Nationalelf.

With World Cup qualification looking in peril after a shocking opening-game loss to Slovakia, Germany has rattled off three consecutive wins to top Group A on goal difference.

That sets them up nicely heading into November's crucial qualifying games, where Slovakia will be waiting in the final, likely decisive matchup.

Still, just eight goals scored in four qualifying games will be troubling, especially since half of those came in a 4-0 victory over 96th ranked Luxembourg.

6. Netherlands

FIFA ranking: 7

B/R September ranking: 7

The Netherlands just loves scoring goals.

In the last three games, the Oranje have smashed in 11, conceding just two in the process. Take it back a little further, and the Netherlands has 20 goals in its last five games, with only three conceded. In October, the Dutch defense didn't surrender a goal.

For a nation that always seems to have an enviable collection of stars, the Netherlands has never won a World Cup final, despite reaching the tournament's climactic game three times.

With manager Ronald Koeman finding the secret to international scoring success while maintaining a stingy back line, the Oranje might again manage a deep tournament run.

FIFA ranking: 2

B/R September ranking: 4

France had the chance to seal 2026 World Cup qualification with a win on Monday.

While Ukraine ensured that wouldn't be possible after notching a 2-1 victory over Azerbaijan, France didn't hold up its end of the bargain, either.

Les Bleus stumbled to a 2-2 draw against world No. 74 Iceland, meaning they will have to wait until November to find out if they should buy some plane tickets to North America. 

A 3-0 win over Azerbaijan at least made October's international slate a little less concerning. However, manager Didier Deschamps might come under scrutiny for his tactics and team selection in the subsequent stalemate, when a win could have eased the pressure on his side significantly.

FIFA ranking: 5

B/R September ranking: 3

Portugal has been living a little dangerously, needing a late goal in two of its last three World Cup qualifying games to seal victory and conceding a late equalizer on Tuesday. 

If not for Dominik Szoboszlai's strike, A Seleçao would have confirmed their spot in the 2026 World Cup. However, they will now have to wait until November.

In addition to that disappointment, Portugal slips in the B/R power rankings because its results simply aren't convincing at the moment. 

While Cristiano Ronaldo found the goal (and then another) that took him to the top of the all-time World Cup qualifying top scorer list, his remarkable exploits are not enough on their own for Portugal to rely on.

FIFA ranking: 3

B/R September ranking: 2

After dropping from first to second in September's B/R power ranking, Argentina's descent continues as it lands in third. 

Although qualification for the World Cup had already been secured at that point, it succumbed to a 1-0 defeat against Ecuador in September. The 1-0 victory over 49th-ranked Venezuela that followed in October wasn't entirely convincing.

La Albiceleste did secure a 6-0 win against Puerto Rico on Tuesday, but beating the 155th-ranked team isn't much to be pleased about. 

Following a disappointing defeat in Ecuador and with little else to boast about from their recent outings, Argentina has slipped after more impressive results from another nation. 

FIFA ranking: 4

B/R September ranking: 5

England has steamed into second with the Thomas Tuchel train hitting full speed. 

A 3-0 friendly victory over Wales without Harry Kane was a welcome result for U.K. bragging rights, but the 5-0 win over Latvia was significantly more important.

With that, the Three Lions will have the opportunity to end 60 years of hurt in Canada, Mexico, and the United States, with World Cup 2026 qualification sealed.

England is the only European nation to confirm a berth in the competition so far, doing so with six wins from six in Group K and no goals conceded.

Tuchel's tenure started with a concerning lack of goals, but the German has well and truly opened the attacking floodgates. That's 13 goals in the last three games, with Kane providing just three of them. 

For a team that has been so reliant on its talismanic No. 9 for the better part of a decade, that's a really promising sign. 

Tuchel has been ruthless in his selection, relying on players who are showing their best form rather than counting on reputation, and it's paying off.

FIFA ranking: 1

B/R September ranking: 1

Spain simply looks unshakable at the top of B/R's international football rankings.

FIFA apparently agrees, having put the country at the summit of its own ranking list in September's update. 

If you ignore the penalty-shootout loss to Portugal in the Nations League final, La Furia Roja haven't been defeated since a March 2024 friendly against Colombia, in which usual starters were rested.

In October, Spain brushed aside Georgia and put four past Bulgaria with no reply, putting it comfortably atop Group E and within touching distance of automatic World Cup qualification. 

With inconsistencies from many of the typically favored nations, Spain must be considered the favorite when the action starts in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. ","{'href': 'https://bleacherreport.com', 'title': 'Bleacher Report'}","soccer"

As continental qualification for the FIFA World Cup 2026 nears its end, the focus is shifting to the tournament itself.

The picture for the FIFA World Cup 2026 became a lot clearer on Tuesday when a number of top teams across the continents booked their place at football's global showpiece.

The number of confirmed teams has now risen to 28 following the latest round of qualifiers, with another 20 still to be filled by various confederational playoffs, intercontinental playoffs, and – in Europe's case – the main qualifying stage, which still needs to be completed.

England, South Africa and Qatar were among the headline names to book their place at the tournament on Tuesday.

Al Jazeera Sport takes a look at the tournament that the nations around the world are all vying to reach.

The tournament is being staged across the United States, Canada and Mexico. The first match will be played in Mexico City on June 11, while the final will be staged in New Jersey, US, on July 19.

Due to the expansion of the tournament – from 32 teams to 48 – the 39-day event is the longest in its history.

FIFA's intercontinental playoffs will be the last chance saloon for teams around the world to reach next summer's event. The finale of that route will be on March 31, 2026, less than three months before the World Cup kicks off. The European qualification process runs until March, but most of the remaining confederations will have finished their continental qualification processes long before then.

Once the respective confederations finish their qualification process, FIFA offers two final spots to be contested by the best-placed team from each of the six continental routes that have not already qualified.

Although we will not know the full list of teams for the event until the end of March 2026, the draw will take place on December 5, 2025.

The draw will take place in the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. US President Donald Trump confirmed the location while speaking in the Oval Office at the White House, flanked by Vice President JD Vance and FIFA boss Gianni Infantino. He did not rule out overseeing the draw itself.

With the expansion to 48 teams, the World Cup will now feature 12 four-team groups. That in turn will lead to a round of 32, an extra knockout round to previous editions.

Indeed, the tournament has doubled in size since it was staged in the US in 1994, when only 24 teams competed.

Trump has been quite clear and consistent on the staging of games within the US, saying he will move the games from any cities that he deems to be unsafe.

On September 26, when Trump was asked about games being moved, he warned: “Well, that's an interesting question … but we're going to make sure they're safe. [Seattle and San Francisco are] run by radical left lunatics who don't know what they're doing.”

The US will stage games in 11 cities: Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New Jersey/New York (joint host region), Philadelphia, San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle.

Canada will host 13 games in total, split between Toronto and Vancouver. Mexico will also get 13 games, which will be played in Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey.

The US will stage the final, which will be played at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

Argentina won the last edition of the FIFA World Cup, beating France in the final of Qatar 2022.

With the game level at 3-3 after extra time, Argentina won the penalty shootout 4-2.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup was staged in the US, and the heat and resulting thunderstorms proved to be a huge problem for the tournament.

Three stadiums – in Arlington, Atlanta and Houston – have retractable roofs that are expected to be closed due to the summer heat, while Inglewood and Vancouver have fixed roofs.

After the latest round of qualifying matches, here is a breakdown of the confirmed contenders from each of the six regions:

Hosts: Canada, Mexico, USA

Asia: Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Uzbekistan

Africa: Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia

Europe: England

Oceania: New Zealand

South America: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay

Africa: Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon and Nigeria will play off for the final intercontinental spot from the continent. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has announced November 13 for the first matches, followed by a deciding match three days later.

Asia: UAE and Iraq will vie for one intercontinental playoffs spot when they compete over two legs in the final stage of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) qualifiers on November 13 and 18.

Europe: 53 of the 54 European teams vying for 16 qualification spots can still confirm their berths, alongside England, as their first-round matches will run until November 18. European qualification will run until March, just before the intercontinental playoffs begin.

North, Central America and the Caribbean: Three spots remain up for grabs, given the World Cup hosts take up three spots already. Bermuda, Costa Rica, Curacao, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Haiti, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago have all advanced to the third round, with the winners to be decided by November 18. The three second-placed teams from each group will then fight for the intercontinental playoffs spot.

Oceania: New Caledonia have qualified for the intercontinental playoffs.

South America: Bolivia have qualified for the intercontinental playoffs, having missed out on one of the six automatic qualifying positions.

Trump claimed Fifa president could ‘easily' move games

Wu says Trump comments are ‘targeting Boston values'

The mayor of Boston, Michelle Wu, implied the city was ready for a face-off with the US president Donald Trump over his claim he could order Fifa to remove World Cup games from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, 22 miles south-west of the city.

Wu appeared on local podcast “Java with Jimmy” on Wednesday to respond to Tuesday's criticism from the White House, which labeled the Democrat as “radical left”. Trump threatened he would make a call to the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, if Boston did not “clean up its act”.

“Much of it is locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it,” Wu said. “We're in a world where for drama, for control, for pushing the boundaries … ongoing threats … are issued to individuals and communities who refuse to back down and comply or be obedient to a hateful agenda.

“We are going to continue to be who we are and that means, unfortunately, we are going to be in a conversation in a way that is targeting Boston's values,” Wu added. “Ten toes down for Boston.”

Infantino appeared in photographs alongside Trump at the Gaza summit earlier this week. The Fifa president has also visited the Oval Office and presented World Cup and Club World Cup trophies to Trump as gifts.

On Tuesday, Trump was asked about recent disturbances in South Boston that included a police vehicle being set on fire. “If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni [Infantino] – the head of Fifa, who's phenomenal,” Trump replied.

“I would say: ‘Let's move into another location' and they would do that. He wouldn't love to do it. But he would do it very easily.” Trump also directly criticised Wu, saying: “Their mayor is not good … she's radical left, and they're taking over parts of Boston. That's a pretty big statement, right?”

Trump has made previous comments suggesting he would take up the same conversation with Infantino about moving games from Seattle and San Francisco, which are among the 16 host cities across North America.

Driving through the Highway 99 tunnel in Seattle could be pricier during next summer's FIFA World Cup.

With traffic expected to surge when the city hosts several matches, the Washington State Transportation Commission may temporarily hike tolls for the two-mile tunnel to defray additional costs associated with the international sporting event.

Commissioners heard Tuesday that their staff are evaluating potential increases of 50 cents and $1 that would be imposed between June 1 and July 15, 2026, the period in which six World Cup contests are scheduled at Lumen Field in downtown Seattle. 

State lawmakers directed the commission to consider a temporary increase and use the money to cover added costs of managing traffic around the stadium and throughout the Puget Sound when fans flood the region in those six weeks.

Doing nothing is an option too, said Carl See, the commission deputy director. While commissioners need to keep in mind the impact of the influx of visitors, they also need to remember any increase “may have an impact on those who have no interest” in taking part in what will be a “monumental event” for the state, he told the panel.

The Pacific Northwest will host 13 World Cup matches — six in Seattle and seven in Vancouver, B.C. Conversations have been underway for months on how to avert monumental backups at the U.S.-Canada border and assist fans moving between the host cities.

About 750,000 people are anticipated to come to Washington state in the course of six weeks. In addition to matches, teams will be practicing at the University of Washington in Seattle and Gonzaga University in Spokane. There will be training locations and fan zones in the state, too.

State lawmakers earmarked roughly $24 million in the current transportation budget for World Cup-related expenses. Additional dollars were cribbed into the operating and capital budgets for security and field upgrades.

With transportation, there's $14 million for transit, including $5 million for expanding intercity bus service in the state, and another $8.25 million for operational improvements aimed at keeping people moving. 

There's $2 million for maintenance in the vicinity of the tunnel. Those dollars will come out of the tunnel toll revenue account. Lawmakers assumed that sum could be covered from a temporary toll rate increase but didn't mandate one.

Roughly 47,000 vehicles travel through the tunnel each day based on a July 2024 analysis.

Tolls vary based on time of day with higher rates in peak commute hours and lower rates on nights and weekends. They are collected in both directions as one exits the tunnel. 

Weekdays, the cost ranges from $1.25 to $1.85 per trip with a Good to Go pass. It is $1.25 on weekends. Drivers pay an extra 25 cents per trip with the Pay By Plate option, in which they register their license plate on a Good To Go! account without a pass. There is a $2 fee tacked on if you pay by mail.

What will be studied are potential increases of 50 cents per trip and $1 per trip that would be imposed at all times, including on weekends.

In December, staff will present the commission with projections of how much money might be generated from those assessments and how many drivers might choose to use local roads and Interstate 5 to avoid higher tolls.

See cautioned that he didn't want to “overpromise” what data would be delivered. If approved, this would be the first such temporary toll-rate hike, he said. Given the short six-week duration and uniqueness of the sporting event, it will be hard to model for every possible factor with precision, he said.

If the commission decides to proceed with a one-time temporary toll rate increase, it would conduct a rate-setting process including gathering public input on potential rate options.

You have come to the ESPN Africa edition, for other ESPN editions, click above.

Colin Udoh reveals the role he played in 'helping' Nigeria secure a World Cup play-off place after their 4-0 win over Benin. (1:47)

South Africa's 3-0 win over Rwanda that booked them a place in the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico was not only a strong footballing performance but also a symbol of the resilience that coach Hugo Broos has instilled in the team.

Bafana Bafana faced a self-made crisis heading into the final game, as they trailed Benin by two points at the top of Group C. After relinquishing top spot by having their March win over Lesotho overturned for fielding the ineligible Teboho Mokoena, they dropped two more points in a 0-0 draw with Zimbabwe on Saturday.

However, Benin 's 4-0 defeat by Nigeria left Bafana with a fighting chance: Victory over Rwanda was all they needed to progress. In the past, this is the sort of opportunity that South Africa had become accustomed to squandering.

When Broos watched Bafana Bafana lose a decisive 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier to Sudan five years ago, when they needed only a draw to make the tournament in Cameroon, he saw a team backed by a relative abundance of resources but foiled by a lack of mental fortitude.

That match led to the departure of his predecessor, Molefi Ntseki, and the Belgian's subsequent appointment as head coach. Almost five years later, he has delivered on his mission to overhaul Bafana Bafana's belief in their own abilities -- with his focus on youth paying off.

""I saw the game against Sudan, and Bafana Bafana needed only one point, and when I see the way they played the game there in Sudan... I couldn't understand it,"" Broos told ESPN in 2021 after making early progress in changing the results and culture of the team. ""You go until the end -- until you die -- but you need that point. This was not the mentality I saw.

""So then I started to see who was playing. There were so many players of 27, 28, 29 years old. Afterwards, there was someone who was telling me: 'Yes, coach, but those players are experienced.'

""I said: 'Yes, that's right, but if you do not play the younger players, then when are they going to have experience?'

""So, therefore, I started also with young players who had quality. This is the first thing they need to have, and that's why we have such good results.""

That process has now paid dividends, with a dominant performance led by young players who were cool, calm and collected from the first whistle to the last. Bafana led 2-0 at halftime, courtesy of a long-range Thalente Mbatha strike and a curling finish by Oswin Appollis, before Evidence Makgopa's 72nd-minute header sealed the win that saw South Africa qualify for their fourth World Cup -- and their first since they hosted the tournament in 2010.

Broos, alone, cannot take credit for the development of players such as Mbatha, Appollis and Makgopa -- Orlando Pirates stars in their mid-20s -- but the former Cameroon head coach, who won the 2017 AFCON against all odds, was a driving force for South Africa's nationwide shift in attitudes towards young players. Makgopa, in particular, was a beneficiary, as he scored a brace on his Bafana Bafana debut in Broos' first match in charge -- a 3-2 win over Uganda in June 2021. Then at Baroka FC, Makgopa had not been fancied to lead the line at international level, but Broos took a chance on him and it paid off.

Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns -- the two dominant clubs in South Africa over the past decade -- also deserve their fair share of credit.

Sundowns have invested heavily under the ownership of Confederation of African Football president Patrice Motsepe, who bought a controlling stake in 2003 and then the remaining shares the following year. However, the culture of the club changed specifically during Pitso Mosimane's tenure as head coach from 2012 to 2020.

Off the back of a disappointing spell in charge of Bafana Bafana, a reinvigorated Mosimane led Sundowns to their first CAF Champions League title in 2016 -- only the second by a South African club; Pirates previously won it in 1995.

That triumph -- and Sundowns' dominance of the South African Premiership under Mosimane and successors Manqoba Mngqithi, Rhulani Mokwena and Miguel Cardoso -- forced their rivals to level up and take continental competitions more seriously.

None could quite match the financial might of Sundowns, but Pirates improved their talent development and recruitment structures -- and their streamlined squad has closed the gap on a Sundowns side now struggling with fatigue and player discontent after the FIFA Club World Cup, a tournament that saw them impress on the global stage but face struggles keeping their players away from prying eyes elsewhere in the world.

Broos has often encouraged Bafana Bafana players to move overseas, but facing an injury crisis heading into a decisive qualifier, he started with an entirely locally-based XI. South Africa started five Sundowns players -- Ronwen Williams, Khuliso Mudau, Aubrey Modiba, Mokoena and Thapelo Morena -- five Pirates players -- Mbatha, Appollis, Makgopa, Nkosinathi Sibisi and Sipho Mbule -- and one from TS Galaxy, Khulumani Ndamane.

That, alone, speaks volumes of the quality in South Africa's club football.

However, this is nothing new.

What is new -- first and foremost -- is the apparent end of the days when South African players were viewed as too comfortable and pampered to win when the going got tough.

Having finished third at AFCON 2023 in Ivory Coast, Bafana are among the favorites for the tournament in Morocco in December and January. At the World Cup, the goal will be to make the knockout rounds for the first time.

The qualification campaign exposed that the South African Football Association still has a long way to go before it can offer Bafana the support they need to reach their full potential; but if the mentality in the upper echelons of the organization still needs to change, the players and coach are now embodiments of the promise of what South African football is capable of being.","{'href': 'https://africa.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

President Donald Trump suggested he will work to have 2026 FIFA World Cup games pulled out of Boston if the city's mayor, Michelle Wu, does not curb crime that recently included a violent street takeover targeting police.

Trump made the suggestion while taking questions from the media during Tuesday's meeting with Argentinian President Javier Milei at the White House, threatening to call FIFA President Gianni Infantino to have the games moved to cities that do cooperate, citing safety concerns.

“We can take them away. I love the people of Boston. And I know the games are sold out, but the mayor is not good. There are worse than her. At least she's intelligent. You know, some are extremely low IQ. Those bother me more. She's intelligent, but she's radical left,” Trump said. 

“The answer is yes, if somebody's doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location,' and he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it, very easily he'd do it. And this is the right time to do it.” 

Trump's comments come after a group of people took over one of the city's streets in a violent incident this week.

The president of a union that represents Boston police officers said that people who took part in a recent street takeover in the city were “hell-bent” on attacking law enforcement officials.

According to the Boston Police Department, over 100 people were involved in the takeover that involved street racing just after 2 a.m. on Oct. 5. 

Officers found people trying to attack police cruisers with fireworks, cones, poles and other items.

One police cruiser was destroyed by flames and needed to be towed away from the area, officials said.

Boston is currently set to host seven matches when the World Cup comes to North America next summer.

The slate includes five group-stage games, one Round of 32 fixture and the first quarterfinal on July 9.

Fox News Digital has reached out to Wu's office for further comment.

Trump added that he would also consider pulling the 2028 Summer Olympics out of Los Angeles for similar reasons. 

“I could say the same thing for the Olympics,” he said. 

“If I thought LA was not going to be prepared properly, I'd move it to another location.”

Wu has accused the Trump administration of being a party that “doesn't follow the law.”

“At a time when this federal administration is already causing so much fear and harm in our communities, these threats are serious and consequential,” Wu said in August. 

The remarks came after the Trump administration warned it could sue or cut federal funds if cities refused to cooperate on immigration enforcement.

Who will make Thomas Tuchel's World Cup squad?

England first European team to qualify for 2026 World Cup

Which other teams have also qualified

Fans aim chants at Tuchel after he criticised Wembley atmosphere

Tuchel says he accepts chants ""in good humour""

Written by Ben Ramsdale, Alex Fletcher, Craig Nelson & Mel Edwards.

That's all we have for you guys today. 

A busy one full of reaction to England's 2026 World Cup qualification.

Here's a recap of what we covered: 



Some important dates for your calendars.

The 2026 World Cup finals open at Mexico City's famous Azteca Stadium on 11 June.

And the final will be held at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Sunday, 19 July.

Home to the New York Giants and New York Jets of the NFL, MetLife has a capacity of 82,500.

Ask Me Anything

Heat was an issue at the Club World Cup in the USA this summer and will once again be a concern for next year's World Cup.

Paris St-Germain manager Luis Enrique complained about his team having to play in near 40-degree heat in their Club World Cup opener against Atletico Madrid in Los Angeles, which started at noon local time.

Numerous coaches and players were affected by the heat and humidity, with Chelsea's Enzo Fernandez complaining of dizziness while playing.

Fifa is likely to schedule World Cup matches involving major European nations after midnight UK time in an effort to combat heat issues.

It is anticipated World Cup kick-off times will mirror those at the Club World Cup, when the earliest games started at 17:00 BST, followed by 20:00, 23:00 and 02:00.

Ask Me Anything

Sixteen cities will host games during next summer's World Cup - 11 in the United States, three in Mexico and two in Canada.

These are the 2026 World Cup host cities:

USA:

Mexico: 

Canada:

Some iconic moments there from past tournaments in Mexico and the United States. 

But who will we be talking about in years to come after the 2026 World Cup finals, and where will those iconic moments take place?

Let's have a run through the host cities...

If Pele was the game's most iconic star, then the next global posterboy to lift the World Cup in Mexico's Azteca Stadium could lay claim to being its anti-hero. 

Maradona dragged Argentina to the final of the 1986 World Cup with a heady mixture of dazzling dribbling and dastardly foul play. 

Well, that's how a generation of England fans saw it after the Napoli forward called upon the ""hand of God"" to help see off the Three Lions in the quarter-finals. 

Perhaps the rest of the football world will remember that 2-1 victory in the Azteca for his march through the England team to score what turned out to be the winning goal. 

But that had followed a blatant handball that all the world saw - except, it seemed, the match officials.

Maradona scored another two virtuoso goals in a semi-final win over Belgium before Argentina beat West Germany 3-2 in the final.     

Some of the greatest ever footballers to grace the world stage enjoyed their crowning achievement in Mexico.

The 1970 World Cup was won by arguably the most revered Brazil team of all time. 

Legendary players like Jairzinho, Rivellino, Gerson and Carlos Alberto joined forces with talisman Pele to lift the Jules Rimet Trophy for a third time.

Only the brilliance of captain Bobby Moore and goalkeeper Gordon Banks helped defending champions England hold Brazil to a respectable 1-0 defeat in the early stages of the tournament. 

And the style and flair of their 4-1 victory over Italy to seal the title is still held up today as the most complete performance in a World Cup final. 

Pele was the team's undoubted figurehead and, following victories in 1958 and 1962, a decision was taken to let Brazil keep the trophy.

A host of talented stars made their name at the 1994 World Cup in the United States.

Romania's Gheorghe Hagi and Italy's Roberto Baggio provided some of the most memorable displays of the tournament.

In the end it was Brazil's latest crop of world beaters who took the spoils, with the likes of Romario and Bebeto powering them to a fourth world title. 

But ask anyone who was there and one clear memory stands out...Diana Ross's goal-breaking penalty.

It's funny you should say that, Adrian.

Anybody for some World Cup nostalgia?

Will Diana Ross be at the World Cup Draw?

I don't care who is on the plane- I'm happy if we start with Crouch and Welbeck up front if it means we win- 60 years is just too long, we can play the most boring containing football and win 1-0 every game and the whole country will be happy!

Fans eager to start planning a World Cup vacation will need to put this date in their diary. 

The World Cup draw takes place on 5 December at the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington DC.

England will find out the host cities of their group stage matches and get a good idea of who they will be playing, although the identity of some opponents may still need to be determined. 

The European play-offs and inter-confederation Play-Off Tournament will be held in March, when the final eight qualifiers will be confirmed.

The 12 group runners-up in the European section of qualifying will participate in the play-offs.

They will be joined by the four best-ranked group winners of the 2024-25 Nations League that did not finish in the top two of their European qualifying groups.

The 16 teams who enter the play-offs will be drawn into four play-off paths, with four teams featuring in each.

Play-off matches will consist of single-leg semi-finals followed by single-leg finals, taking place on 26 and 31 March 2026.

Wales are assured a place in the play-offs, regardless of where they finish in the group.

That's because of their success in the Nations League last year.

Four places in March's play-offs are kept aside for teams who won their Nations League group – but only used if they don't finish in the top two of their current qualifying group.

With all Nations League group winners above them – Spain, Germany, Portugal, France, England and Norway – either certain of or about to guarantee finishing first or second in their qualifying group, Wales can still claim that safety net play-off place if they fail to topple North Macedonia.

But there is a downside to that route as it will mean Wales will be among the lowest seeded sides in the play-offs – and face a far tougher route to the World Cup.

All kick-off times 19:45 GMT unless stated

A damaging 4-2 defeat at home to Belgium all but ended Wales' hopes of automatic qualification, although Craig Bellamy's side can still finish top if results go their way. 

They are four points below the Belgians, who lead Group J, with two matches remaining. 

Belgium travel to Kazakhstan in their penultimate game, while Wales are at bottom side Liechtenstein. 

The more realistic chance of progression for the Welsh now looks to be via the play-offs. 

They are three points behind second-placed North Macedonia, who have played a game more, and host them in their final match, which looks set to be a straight shootout for the runners-up spot.

Finally, this leads us on to Wales.

Bear with me whilst it gets a little complicated.

Northern Ireland's narrow 1-0 defeat at home to Germany left them in third place in Group A, three points behind the Germans and Slovakia, who are level on nine points. 

But Michael O'Neill's side still have destiny in their own hands, with games in Slovakia and at home to bottom side Luxembourg to come. 

Four points from those two games may well be enough to secure a second-placed finish and a berth in the play-offs, while they could even top the group with two wins.

All kick-off times 19:45 GMT

Victories over Greece and Belarus in the international break ensured Scotland can finish no worse than runners-up in Group C. 

They go into their final two matches knowing a place in the play-offs is secured, but with a genuine chance of automatic qualification as group winners. 

Steve Clarke's side are level on points with leaders Denmark, but below them on goal difference. 

Denmark host bottom side Belarus in their penultimate game, while Scotland face a tricky trip to third-placed Greece before hosting the Danes in their final match.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Could Trump really move World Cup games? The facts behind his threats","https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/15/trump-world-cup-threats-explained","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 18:07:00 GMT","

Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed he could take World Cup matches away from US cities he deems “unsafe”. Here's what he said – and what powers he does and doesn't have

Which time? Tuesday was the second time Trump has threatened to take away World Cup games from US host cities on the basis of their political leadership or opposition to his policies. However, it's important to note that this suggestion of moving games is not something Trump has suggested organically, of his own volition. In both cases, the US president was responding to leading questions centered around the idea of moving games. 

On 25 September in an Oval Office event, a member of the White House press corps asked Trump about cities that have demonstrated against Trump's use of federal agencies for immigration and crime crackdowns. The reporter mentioned Seattle and San Francisco as two cities that have seen demonstrations, and pointed out that both cities are World Cup hosts (though San Francisco is not a host city, but part of the San Francisco Bay Area that will host games at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara). The reporter then asked Trump if the demonstrations could result in the loss of World Cup games from those host venues. 

“I guess, but we're going to make sure they're safe,” Trump said. “They're run by radical left lunatics and that don't know what they're doing.” 

Later Trump said that Chicago would be safe for the World Cup after he sends in federal agencies in a similar manner as Washington DC. Chicago is not a 2026 World Cup host city. 

“If any city we think is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup … we won't allow it to go to it. We'll move it around a little bit,” Trump said. 

Three weeks later, on 14 October, Trump was asked about another host city, Boston, even though the games themselves will be held in suburban Foxborough, Massachusetts. Towards the end of that day's press event, a reporter asked Trump about a recent “street takeover” in Boston that saw police officers attacked and a police car set aflame, and if the concerns raised by the incident could result in the revocation of hosting duties for next year's expanded 48-team soccer tournament. The reporter also asked if Trump would work with Michelle Wu, the Democratic mayor of Boston, to address the issue.

“We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. “Their mayor is not good … She's radical left, and they're taking over parts of Boston. That's a pretty big statement, right?”

Street takeovers, a social media-driven phenomenon that sees large crowds of people gather on city streets late at night to perform stunts in cars, have been a repeated nuisance in American cities since the Covid-19 pandemic shutdowns. Recent such gatherings have turned violent in Massachusetts, including in Boston. However, the gatherings are generally not seen as being tied to any particular political ideology, nor have they been touted as a large-scale safety concern for World Cup attendees. 

“If someone is doing a bad job, and I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni [Infantino], the head of Fifa, who is phenomenal, and say let's move it to another location,” Trump said on Tuesday. “And he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it. Very easily, he'd do it.”

Later in that same event, Trump for the first time broached the possibility of moving the 2028 Olympics from Los Angeles as well. 

“If I thought LA was not going to be prepared properly, I would move it to another location if I had to,” he said. “On that one I'd probably have to get a different kind of a permission, but we would do that.”

In short: No. At least not unilaterally. In the World Cup's case, the host city agreements are signed between Fifa, soccer's global governing body, and the local municipalities. Though the deal involves a public government, it is essentially a private business deal, and the US president does not have authority to cancel it on his own.

That said, Trump can apply pressure to the various parties to back out of the deal if he is truly committed to removing games from the cities in question. That could include withholding federal funding from the cities as he has for various other aspects of American life. It could also include an appeal to Fifa president Gianni Infantino, who has carefully cultivated a close relationship with Trump since the US president's return to office.

Theoretically, yes. We can say this with relative surety thanks to Seattle, which released the host city agreement it signed with Fifa. Within that agreement there is a clause (4.5, to be exact) that addresses the possible revocation of host city selection. The clause essentially states that by agreeing to be a World Cup host city, Seattle also agrees to do a number of different (and often expensive) things to increase public safety, including the deployment of additional security measures and transportation methods, plus the assumption of various financial liabilities.

Fifa could in theory point to that clause as reasoning for revoking Seattle's status as a World Cup host city if it feels like safety standards are woefully behind. It's hard to imagine it being all that likely, though. Any World Cup is a gigantic logistical affair, let alone one spread across three countries and 16 host cities featuring more teams than ever before. It's hard enough for Fifa to create the match schedule and oversee teams' travel. Introducing a reduction in venues, or a change in venues, or multiple of them, would be a gargantuan undertaking so close to the actual event. It's easy to assume it would be the subject of legal action on behalf of the host city as well. 

So far, it has been mostly promotional and/or threatening in nature. Trump convened a World Cup task force earlier this year headed by Andrew Giuliani, with a stated mission of “facilitat[ing] comprehensive planning, organization, and execution of the largest sporting events in the history of mankind.”

The federal government also has a role in approving visas for visitors from other countries, but processing times for those have ballooned to such a level that many fear that they won't have visas approved in time for the games themselves. 

There is also the public safety aspect. One can presume that FBI agents and potentially those from Homeland Security and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) will be dispatched to World Cup host cities with the stated intention of providing an additional layer of security on top of local police.

So far, Fifa president Gianni Infantino has said nothing publicly about Trump's threat. He did, however, find time to travel to Egypt to be alongside Trump at the Gaza summit – a curious move for someone whose role in the world is nominally about sports. 

Fifa vice-president Victor Montagliani, a Canadian, was far more direct speaking at a London conference in early October, responding to Trump's comments about Seattle and San Francisco. 

“It's Fifa's tournament, Fifa's jurisdiction, Fifa makes those decisions,” Montagliani said. “With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans. That's the beauty of our game, that it is bigger than any individual and bigger than any country.”

A Fifa spokesperson told Politico “Safety and security are of the utmost importance at all FIFA events worldwide and it is ultimately the government's responsibility to decide what's in the best interest of public safety. We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to fulfill all necessary requirements for a successful 2026 World Cup.”

Outside of Fifa, Wu responded to Trump's threat by pointing out that much of Fifa's host city agreements are “locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it.

“We're in a world where for drama, for control, for pushing the boundaries … ongoing threats … are issued to individuals and communities who refuse to back down and comply or be obedient to a hateful agenda.”

Only in cases of extreme and/or unexpected health and safety concerns, war, or other political disturbance. The 2003 Women's World Cup was the last senior-level tournament with that name to be moved – it was originally due to be held in China but was shifted to the US due to that year's Sars outbreak. 

Fifa also pulled the 2023 Under-20 World Cup from Indonesia after several members of that country's government and large sections of the populace opposed the inclusion of Israel in the tournament. Indonesia does not maintain formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has broadly supported Palestine. Indonesia later hosted that year's U-17 World Cup after Peru pulled out of hosting. 

The Olympics have been canceled due to wars or postponed a year in the case of Covid-19 and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but they have not changed host cities since 1908, when the eruption of Mount Vesuvius forced the Rome games to decamp to London.

Likely because he has made that topic a feature of his administration. It is the guise under which he has deployed the national guard, Ice, and other federal agencies to Washington DC, Chicago and other cities. The fact that safety is a genuine and justified concern at any major gathering of people – especially one as vast as the World Cup – makes it an easy line to fall back on for his administration.

That'll be the real test, won't it? When Washington has intervened in many other aspects of American life, the targeted institutions have often complied or tried to negotiate. It remains to be seen if Fifa or the IOC will take that path – if indeed Trump decides to pursue this at all.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Donald Trump says he could call up the head of FIFA, Gianni Infantino, and he would do what he suggested.

Wednesday 15 October 2025 19:11, UK

FIFA has told Sky News the US government does have the right to determine if cities are safe for the World Cup - after Donald Trump threatened to remove the Boston area from hosting.

The US president stepped up his criticism of crime in Democrat-run cities at the White House after previously claiming California could be stripped of matches at the FIFA event next year, and at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino is a close ally of President Trump's - attending his Gaza peace summit in Egypt this week - and is not pushing back on his World Cup interventions.

In a statement to Sky News, FIFA said: ""Safety and security are the top priorities at all FIFA events worldwide.

""Safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety.

""We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfill all necessary requirements.""

FIFA did not directly comment on changing any of the 11 venues in the US for the expanded 48-team men's football World Cup which will see the Americans host 78 of the 104 fixtures, including the final in New Jersey.

The remaining games are in Canada and Mexico.

Boston does not have matches itself, but the home of the NFL's New England Patriots is being used by FIFA for seven matches, 30 miles away in Foxborough, Massachusetts.

President Trump said: ""If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni - the head of FIFA who's phenomenal - and I would say, 'Let's move into another location,' and they would do that.

""He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.""

President Trump and Mr Infantino first encountered each other during Mr Trump's first term in office, when the US was awarded the right to host next year's tournament.

They have popped up together at summits and meetings across the world since.

The FIFA president was even among those in attendance as Mr Trump and world leaders signed the recent Israel-Gaza peace deal.

Earlier this week, President Trump slammed Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu, and said the ""radical left"" was taking over Boston.

He made the comments while hosting Argentine president Javier Milei.

The Trump administration has already deployed National Guard troops to Washington, Los Angeles and Memphis in what he said was a bid to clean up crime.","{'href': 'https://news.sky.com', 'title': 'Sky News'}","soccer"

President Donald Trump takes questions live from the White House following a presser with FBI Director Kash Patel.

President Donald Trump addressed the topic of moving FIFA World Cup soccer games out of Boston for a second consecutive day on Wednesday, after Mayor Michelle Wu made a statement expressing confidence in the current schedule. 

Boston and its surrounding communities are currently set to host seven matches when the World Cup comes to North America next summer. The slate includes five group-stage games, one Round of 32 fixture and the first quarterfinal on July 9.

During an Oval Office news conference touting his administration's crackdown on crime nationwide, Trump was asked again about Boston and crime. 

""Somebody said, 'Would we think about taking the World Cup away from Boston if they don't straighten it out?' The answer is yes. We have the right to do that with FIFA,"" Trump said.

Trump said the same thinking applies to the 2028 Summer Olympics, which are currently set for Los Angeles.

""So if we think that LA is gonna be bad, that applies a little bit to the Olympics, too, but we'll talk about FIFA first. You know, FIFA is very hot,"" he said. ""If we think there's any reason that, whether it's Boston or anywhere else, that they're not doing their job, we're going to take those World Cup games and move them someplace else.""

On Tuesday, Trump initially said he would consider calling FIFA President Gianni Infantino to urge having the games moved away from the Boston area over safety concerns, after a violent incident in the city last week saw over 100 people take over a street, resulting in the fiery destruction of a police car. 

Wu responded to Trump's threat in a statement to Fox News Digital on Tuesday evening. 

""Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions,"" she said. 

Wu made the statement after Trump called her ""radical left,"" but also ""intelligent"" while making the initial threats. 

""We can take them away. I love the people of Boston. And I know the games are sold out, but the mayor is not good. There are worse than her. At least she's intelligent. You know, some are extremely low IQ. Those bother me more. She's intelligent, but she's radical left,"" Trump said.

""The answer is yes, if somebody's doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location,' and he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it, very easily he'd do it. And this is the right time to do it."" 

Fox News Digital has reached out to Wu's office for further comment. 

Trump has previously suggested he could declare cities ""not safe"" for the 104-game soccer tournament and alter a detailed hosting plan that FIFA confirmed in 2022. It includes games at NFL stadiums near New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

FIFA Vice President Victor Montagliani said earlier this month at a sports business conference in London that it's the organization's decision where games are played. 

""It's FIFA's tournament, FIFA's jurisdiction, FIFA makes those decisions,"" Montagliani said. 

Among the seven matches that will be played at Gillette Stadium in the Boston suburb of Foxborough, there will be five group stage matches, one match in the round of 32 and a quarterfinal match on July 9. The news of so many big games was a surprise to local organizers.

""The later in the tournament, the more eyeballs,"" said Mike Loynd, head of Boston's World Cup organizing committee, when the schedule was announced last year. ""For us, it's just a matter of excitement ... For us, it's a perfect schedule. I don't think FIFA could have done a better job.""

The tournament is expected to bring $1.1 billion in local economic impact, create over 5,000 jobs, and generate more than $60 million of tax revenue throughout the region, according to organizers. They also expect that more than two million visitors will come to New England throughout the tournament's 39-day span.

Meanwhile, Wu has previously accused the Trump administration of being a party that ""doesn't follow the law.""

""At a time when this federal administration is already causing so much fear and harm in our communities, these threats are serious and consequential,"" Wu said in August.

The remarks came after the Trump administration warned it could sue or cut federal funds if cities refused to cooperate on immigration enforcement.

Alejandro Bedoya believes the USMNT's 2-1 win over Australia was ""a good exercise"" for Mauricio Pochettino's squad. (2:14)

A little more than a month ago, the U.S. men's national team seemed to be in disarray. The results were poor, the individual performances offered little in the way of hope, and the push for competition within the team seemed based more on wishful thinking than reality.

Yet with the October window now concluded, it's clear that the recent gathering of USMNT players was a success, and there has been discernible progress made in terms of the team's preparations for next summer's FIFA World Cup. The team's momentum has never been higher this cycle. Granted, that's a low bar given where they've been, but they're evolving nonetheless.

The results have improved to the point that the U.S. is now unbeaten in its past three games, two of them wins, all against teams who have punched their ticket to the World Cup. More importantly, there is competition for places everywhere on the field.

At forward, Haji Wright has emerged to challenge Folarin Balogun, even as the latter still has an edge in terms of securing a starting spot.

The midfield seems jumbled, but in a good way. Before there didn't seem to be many candidates actually making a strong case for inclusion on a World Cup roster; now the likes of Tanner Tessmann, Aidan Morris and Cristian Roldan -- the ultimate late bloomer if there ever was one -- all look capable of making a contribution on the biggest stage.

The attackers sitting behind the central striker are making cases as well. Weston McKennie looks to have come in from the cold after being frozen out by manager Mauricio Pochettino in September. Against Australia, Diego Luna reminded everyone why he's a Pochettino favorite, with his high-energy and incisive play giving the USMNT a boost. Malik Tillman looked sharp against Ecuador.

The backline, with the help of a 3-4-3 system (at times) looks to be more stable than what was on display in the sobering 2-0 defeat to South Korea barely a month ago.

Yet for all the progress made, in some respects, the October window left one wanting more.

Christian Pulisic was a bit-part player, limited to a total of 45 minutes over two games due to an ankle injury and a hamstring ailment sustained against Australia. Tillman was limited as well, unable to take the field against Australia due to a tender hamstring of his own. Alejandro Zendejas, one of the heroes of September, was sidelined with a knee issue. Left back Antonee Robinson, whose return from offseason knee surgery had been hugely anticipated, never made it onto the field, with his recovery from the aforementioned procedure dragging on and on. This is on top of players like Tyler Adams, Ricardo Pepi and Johnny Cardoso also being absent, with the latter two ruled out with injury.

Getting all of the U.S. teams' best players on the field at the same time -- or even most of them -- remains an elusive goal, and there aren't many more opportunities to see what that looks like prior to the start of the World Cup.

The positive is that despite these absences, the U.S. was still able to not only get results, but for the most part look good doing it. The competitiveness within the squad has also reached a point where those who were absent -- besides Adams and perhaps Robinson -- have fallen down the depth chart, and are at risk of being left behind.

Harder to overlook is the USMNT's maddening habit of slow starts that have resulted in conceding the first goal -- something that has happened seven times in 16 matches in 2025 -- which was the case this window against both Ecuador and Australia. Even aside from the goal against the Socceroos, the USMNT seemed flummoxed by Australia's high defensive line. The U.S. recovered in both matches, even securing a comeback win against the Socceroos, the first come-from-behind win of the Pochettino era.

The U.S. manager alluded to the ""good and not-so-good"" of the team's comeback ability. When the World Cup starts for real in June, the Americans won't be able to afford to make the kind of defensive mistakes that led to them falling behind in these matches.

But the USMNT's resolve, oftentimes suspect this cycle, now seems to possess more solidity. Pochettino noted that ""it's no coincidence"" that the U.S. recorded a comeback win now that the team's culture is in a better place. ""Culture"" has long been one of those squishy, imprecise words that gets thrown around a lot to explain both successes and failures, but when Pochettino talks about it, the picture conjured up in the mind's eye is more like razor wire than a down pillow. There is steel behind his words and actions.

The U.S. manager's message appears to have been received loud and clear by the players, with McKennie among those who have taken it to heart the most. The Juventus midfielder was active in both matches, and against Ecuador seemed especially adept at finding Balogun in behind the defense. The question now is whether he fends off the likes of Tillman and Zendejas to keep his spot on the field as an attacking midfielder. McKennie at his peak would be hard to displace from the lineup.

That is the kind of battle that adds plenty of intrigue to the November window, which will include matches against Paraguay and Uruguay. The battle for the two double-pivot spots in midfield will be intense, too, as will the starting striker position.

Health will play a part in determining who rises and falls. No team enters a World Cup completely injury-free. There are always players who miss out. All the more reason why the sight of performers stepping up -- be it Roldan or Luna or Wright -- is encouraging.

Now the U.S. finds itself on an upward trajectory again. The looming World Cup, once looked at with a certain level of dread, is generating excitement again. There is a greater sense that this team can do the country proud.

Credit Pochettino for the turnaround, although he knows better than anyone there is still work to be done.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 741

UDINE, Italy — Israel lost hope of qualifying for next year's soccer World Cup on Tuesday, after defeat to Italy in a game that took place without major incidents amid boos, protests and a heavy police presence that included snipers on the stadium roof.

Italy won 3-0 in a game that had been placed in the highest risk category despite a breakthrough ceasefire deal that has halted two years of war in Gaza.

There were skirmishes between protesters and police on the streets of Udine at a pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel demonstration before the match, but no serious disruptions during the game itself. However, stewards had to act quickly to prevent a couple of fans from running onto the field carrying Palestinian flags.

“Today wasn't easy for us,” Italy coach Gennaro Gattuso said. “I want to thank the police who have done an incredible job in these days.”

The Israel team bus was escorted to the stadium by 13 police vehicles, including some from the special forces, and several motorbikes.

The sound of helicopters surveilling the city had filled the air since the morning, with drones spotted in the sky and snipers also seen on the roof of the Israel team's hotel.

In the city center, around 10,000 people attended an anti-Israel march, which stayed incident-free for nearly three hours before arriving at its final stop. Then about 50 people — with their faces covered — started clashing with police, who used water cannons and tear gas to try and disperse them.

The group was apparently trying to get past the police cordons to head toward the stadium, which is on the outskirts of the city. They threw metal barriers at riot police as well as flares and other objects and set fire to garbage cans.

Public broadcaster RAI said one of its journalists had to be taken to a hospital after being hit in the face by a rock.

Many shops and restaurants decided not to open on Tuesday and there were strict rules for those that did — including the removal of any outdoor furniture or other objects that could potentially be used as weapons.

Italy also played Israel a year ago in Udine, which was chosen because of the relative difficulty of reaching the city in north-east Italy, near the Slovenian border, and the ease of isolating the stadium, where roadblocks have been set up all around.

The area was declared a “red zone,” and supporters were strongly advised to arrive early because of rigorous checks, with everyone having to pass through metal detectors, too.

Less than 10,000 tickets were sold for the qualifier at the 25,000-seat Stadio Friuli and there appeared to be fewer people inside the stadium than at the demonstration.

The game had been in doubt last month when UEFA considered suspending Israel over the war and Udine Mayor Alberto Felice De Toni called for the game to be postponed.

“Honestly, it wasn't easy… for many days we were always there thinking that maybe there was the possibility of not playing the match,” Gattuso said. “We came, we prepared for it with an environment that we knew was not a festive environment and we felt that.”

There were boos from some fans when the Israeli anthem was played, but the rest of the stadium tried to drown that out with loud applause.

Israel created the better chances early on, with Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma forced into a fine save from winger Manor Solomon.

The Azzurri seldom threatened until Mateo Retegui put them ahead just before the break, after he was fouled and converted the resulting penalty with a right-foot shot into the top corner.

Israel came close to equalizing around the hour mark but Donnarumma saved a shot by Oscar Gloukh, before Retegui netted the second in the 74th by winning possession on the edge of the area, cutting inside and curling his effort into the top corner.

Defender Gianluca Mancini scored with a close-range header in second-half stoppage time to wrap up a comfortable win.

“We really played the game we needed to play. We had everything to lose today. We played very, very well,” Gattuso said after the game. “We all remember the match against Israel a month ago. They made us dance and took us for a ride,” he added, referring to the frantic 5-4 win against Ran Ben Shimon's side.

Italy secured itself at least a playoff spot as it attempts to avoid missing a third straight World Cup.

The Azzurri are second in their group, three points behind Norway and six ahead of Israel, which has played one game more than Italy, has only one game left and therefore has no chance of catching Italy.

Only the group winner advances directly to next year's tournament in North America. The second-place finisher progresses to a playoff — the stage where four-time champion Italy was eliminated during qualifying for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.

President Donald Trump says he has the authority to ""take away"" 2026 World Cup soccer matches scheduled in Boston if he feels the city is unsafe.

Suggesting that parts of Boston had been ""taken over"" by recent unrest, Trump criticized mayor Michelle Wu and said on Tuesday, Oct. 14, that Boston – which is set to stage seven matches at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough during next summer's tournament – could have its games relocated with a phone call to FIFA president Gianni Infantino.

""If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who's phenomenal – and I would say, ‘Let's move into another location,' and they would do that,"" Trump said. ""He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.""

Trump's remarks came during a White House appearance with Argentine President Javier Milei, days after Boston police reported multiple arrests tied to a late-night street gathering that turned violent. 

Boston was one of 11 U.S. cities, along with three in Mexico and two in Canada, selected three years ago to host matches for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Making changes to plans already in place just eight months before the tournament kicks off June 11 would create severe logistical hurdles.

""We could take them away,"" Trump said. ""I love the people of Boston, and I know the games are sold out. But your mayor is not good.""

Wu's office issued a statement that read: ""Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions.""

Trump also suggested that he would consider moving the 2028 Summer Olympics out of Los Angeles for similar reasons.

""If I thought L.A. was not going to be prepared properly, I would move it to another location if I had to.""

					Philadelphia local news: Neighborhoods, politics, food, and fun				

Philly's local host committee for the 2026 FIFA World Cup unveiled its volunteer center in the East Market's Fashion District mall on Wednesday. 

Located in a two-story, 18,000-square-foot space that was previously used for events like the Banksy immersive exhibition, it will serve as the city's administrative hub for the tournament. It will also be the headquarters and main waiting point for volunteers, before they're sent out to key locations during the tournament — in and around Lincoln Financial Field, for sure, but also at the Lemon Hill fanfest, Philadelphia International Airport and other popular transport locations for the games.

Aubrey Walton, FIFA's executive director of host cities, said that it was one of the first volunteer centers to be fully operational across all 16 host cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

“Philly continually sets the bar for other host cities because you understand something fundamental,” she said. “Volunteers aren't just helping run the tournament. They are the tournament.”

The space is where tournament volunteers likely will spend most of their time while working on the tournament, and it comes packed with ways to avoid boredom during their down time. The walls are covered with tournament factoids and vibrant colors. There are TV screens, and tables for foosball and Teqball — a soccer-table tennis hybrid game. Displays that highlight the soccer history of Philly and the nation, much of it provided by the FIFA Museum, are all over. 

“This is really the clubhouse for the volunteers — the mothership, if you will,” said Alison Grove, Philadelphia Soccer 2026's volunteer lead.

Philadelphia Soccer 2026 said that the city had received 26,000 applications from the over 1 million submitted to FIFA during the volunteer application period. It was among the top in volunteer applications, FIFA said. Over 50% of the volunteer applicants for Philly were from outside the country.

After an interview and vetting process, which begins tomorrow, Philly plans to select just over 3,000 volunteers to train for the tournament.

Philly was part of FIFA's dress rehearsal for the World Cup, hosting eight games this past summer in the FIFA Club World Cup. Many of the volunteers at that tournament applied for next year's event and joined the “starting lineup” that will help screen and train the new applicants.

Among them was West Philly resident Mosab Mohammadi, who helped with the center launch.

“It really was an amazing experience full of memories,” he recalled about the past summer. “Meeting a lot of people from different backgrounds. We had a lot of international people, even at the Club World Cup. And we're expecting even more people at the World Cup happening next year.”

The tournament plans to have more than 65,000 volunteers involved across all its venues, the most ever for any sporting event.

“That's what's going to make the World Cup so special,” said City of Philadelphia Director Michael Newmuis. “Not just the matches, but the thousands of volunteers who will greet visitors, answer questions, share directions and show the world what Philadelphia is all about.”

The World Cup begins in Mexico City on June 11 and ends on July 19 at New Jersey's Metlife Stadium. Philly's Linc will host six of the tournament's 104 games, including a round-of-16 match on July 4 that will coincide with the country's semiquincentennial celebrations. Overall, FIFA expects 6.5 million fans to travel across the globe for the festivities. The first lottery draw for tickets just concluded and the second takes place  Oct. 27-31, with the time slots for the randomly selected applicants held in mid-November. High ticket prices and FIFA's early implementation of dynamic pricing and a “right to buy” token system have already drawn criticism.

June 11, 2026, will also be the opening day of Philly's fanfest location at East Fairmount Park's Lemon Hill, where fans without game tickets can watch a live broadcast of the action, along with music, food and other entertainment. Construction to enhance Lemon Hill began in September.

Grove said the hosting team is focused on creating a legacy that lasts long after the tournament is over.

“The World Cup is huge, but it's a moment in time. It takes years of preparation to bring it here and then they move on,” she  said. “So, what do we have to show for it afterwards? We're going to have a spectacular new park at Lemon Hill where we're hosting the fan festival. We're going to have new places to play and people to teach kids how to play soccer across the city and across the region.”

FIFA also contributed to that legacy with a $1 million donation, something it did for all 11 host cities for the Club World Cup. FIFA President Gianni Infantino said the money should go to soccer facilities in areas of need and activities with local associations.

Part of that legacy also involves helping to revitalize the Market East corridor, a section of the city that has struggled to thrive for decades and was the center of a tumultuous, failed bid to build a new arena for the Philadelphia 76ers.

“Our hope was to really be a catalyst for that, to set an example, inspire activation for certainly next summer, but in years to come,” Grove said. “We really hope that this provides a lasting legacy here on East Market and creates that turn that we've all been looking for.”

Part of that effort will be a food voucher program for volunteers to eat at restaurants in the area, Grove said.

The Coventry City striker took charge when his national team needed him most, scoring once in each half to seal important win

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. - For the first half hour of Tuesday's friendly against Australia, it was doom and gloom for the U.S. men's national team. They'd conceded a goal, and a poor one at that. Christian Pulisic, the team's captain on the day, was forced off with an injury.

Despite dominating the play, the U.S. were down a goal and a star at the half-hour mark. Mauricio Pochettino's side needed a spark. It came from Haji Wright, who brought his scoring boots from England right on over to Colorado. Given the start ahead of the prolific Folarin Balogun, Wright made the difference for the USMNT, making one hell of a statement in his first USMNT appearance since his Gold Cup injury.

Behind Wright's brace, the USMNT went on to win 2-1 on Tuesday night. Following Jordan Bos' scrappy opener, Wright took over, netting one on either side of halftime, and continuing his torrid scoring streak - he now has 11 goals in his last 11 games for club and country.

The first came as he ran onto a line-splitting pass from Cristian Roldan. The second came as he ran onto a long ball from the very same man, and that Roldan-Wright combination effectively decided the game.

“I believe in myself and the players around here make it easy,"" Wright said. ""I've known these guys my whole life, almost my whole soccer career. So getting back on the field with these guys, it feels like home to me. And playing back in the U.S. feels great… I'm not just stuck in the nine as a typical striker. I'm allowed to move and be free-flowing and create chances and score chances.""

Earlier this international break, Pochettino explained what he wants from his strikers: the ball in the back of the net. The rest is all a bonus, he said, and the key unit of measurement in this striker race will always be goals. On Tuesday, Wright got two of them at a crucial time, helping the USMNT turn a poor start into a banner night of momentum building.

“We conceded a goal that we should not concede,"" Pochettino told TNT. ""I was happy the way finished the first half. We controlled the game after 20 minutes. After we conceded, we started to play more natural. It's a new team, the first time they've played together, and they were thinking too much, then started to play more natural.”

Now unbeaten in three games after an up-and-down summer, the U.S. continues to move in the right direction. On this occasion, Wright was the man who made it so.

The USMNT boss has a roster emerging that he can trust, with several playing their way into - or out of - World Cup contention


COMMERCE CITY, Colo. - Even as he raved about the performance of some of his U.S. men's national team stars, Mauricio Pochettino continued to offer caveats. Yes, some players shined in this camp. No, that wouldn't guarantee them anything in the future. 

""It's open,"" Pochettino said Tuesday night. ""It's open for every single USA player that is playing here or outside of this country. I think we need to feel that possibility.""

Pochettino does genuinely mean that. He is assessing all options, particularly now that the team is in a better place than it was earlier this year. The focus is no longer on which players are committed and passionate, but rather the players that fit into the system and the players that will, ultimately, make this team better on the road to and during the 2026 World Cup.

Several made their cases during this international break, which began with a 1-1 draw with Ecuador last weekend and concluded with a 2-1 win over Australia on Tuesday night. Both performances were, by and large, strong. Both were huge improvements on what we saw even last window. And both offer a glimpse into the style and substance the USMNT could play with next summer.

Pochettino is assembling his pieces. There seems to be a group emerging that he can trust, with several playing their way into - or perhaps out of - that group over the last few days. 

""Not only do you need good players, but you also need good teammates, good people, people that put the interest of the national team above their own interests,"" Pochettino said. ""That's is important to see: the behavior in situations when you're not playing well. We take notes and then, of course, we'll see when we decide the roster.""

The second seed opened his campaign at the indoor hard-court ATP 250 with a 7-6(2), 6-4 win against the big-hitting Marin Cilic. After falling behind 1-4 in the opening set, Ruud found his rhythm with commanding serves and trademark movement to improve his season record in opening rounds to 14-3.

“It was a good match, I'm very happy,” said Ruud, who improved to 4-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Cilic. “Marin is a great player, very aggressive. He got a better start than me, so I just tried to get my form and rhythm back into the match. I'm really happy with the win.”

Despite his early deficit, Ruud soon took control from the baseline, combining precise groundstrokes with dominant serving to turn the match around. He held serve to love in four straight games in the first set and won all 12 first-serve points in the second, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Ruud's one-hour, 50-minute triumph provided a boost to his bid to reach the Nitto ATP Finals for the fourth time. The 2022 runner-up at the season finale is 11th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. In the quarter-finals, he will face Sebastian Korda.

The 2019 Stockholm champion, Denis Shapovalov, averted a scare against wild card Leo Borg in front of a vibrant atmosphere inside the Royal Tennis Hall. The Canadian failed to serve out the match at 5-4 in the second set, but eventually regrouped for a 6-2, 5-7, 6-1 victory.

Borg, the son of ATP No. 1 Club member Bjorn Borg, was aiming to record his third ATP Tour win, but he was unable to draw on the crowd support and contain Shapovalov in the decider. The third-seeded Canadian is into his fourth Stockholm quarter-final in five appearances at the ATP 250 and awaits Jacob Fearnley or Swedish wild card Elias Ymer.

Korda earlier overcame Kamil Majchrzak 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 in a thrilling two-hour, 33-minute contest. The American dropped just four of 28 points on serve, according to Infosys ATP Stats, in the final set to earn his 100th hard-court win, becoming the fifth player born in the 2000s to do so.

In first-round action on Wednesday,  Lorenzo Sonego kickstarted his quest for a second indoor title by defeating British qualifier Arthur Fery 6-4, 6-2. Sonego set a second-round meeting with Aleksandar Kovecevic, who led eighth seed Camilo Ugo Carabelli 4-6, 7-5, 4-0 when the Argentine was forced to retire through injury.

Marton Fucsovics eased past Jesper de Jong 6-1, 6-2 to book a clash with top seed and 2022 Stockholm champion Holger Rune.

Roger Federer may have retired from the ATP Tour, but the Swiss maestro's smooth serve is still drawing admiration and a bit of playful critique. On Monday, Federer posted a video on Instagram showcasing his iconic service motion, looking as elegant as ever on the court. But one familiar rival wasn't about to let him off the hook so easily.

Enter Andy Murray.

Never one to miss a chance for some friendly banter, the Scot slid into the comments with a cheeky jab: “If you could have disguised your toss better you would have been some player.”

A post shared by Roger Federer (@rogerfederer)

The comment, dripping with classic Murray dry wit, instantly drew laughs and a flood of fan reactions. While the two legends faced off 25 times on Tour, with Federer leading the Scot 14-11 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, it's clear that even in retirement, the scoreboard of sarcasm might just be tilting in Murray's favour.

Federer has been here, there and everywhere in the past month. The former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings was in attendance as usual at the Laver Cup, which was co-founded by Federer and his management company. He then visited the Rolex Shanghai Masters, where he watched Valentin Vacherot win the title.

Naomi Osaka battled past defending champion Suzan Lamens in three sets to reach the Kinoshita Group Japan Open quarterfinals, but suffered an injury scare in the match's closing stages.

No. 1 seed Naomi Osaka came out on top of a 7-6(6), 3-6, 6-2 battle with defending champion Suzan Lamens to reach the Kinoshita Group Japan Open quarterfinals, but suffered an injury scare in the closing stages of the match that left her limping off court.

Osaka: Scores | Draws | Order of play

A high-quality contest had seen Osaka respond well to Lamens' challenge, raising her level to pull away from the surging Dutchwoman in the third set. But with Lamens serving down 5-0 but up 30-15, Osaka pulled up on her left leg. Lamens sprayed a backhand wide on that point, but won the next, and at 40-30 to Lamens, Osaka requested a medical time-out.

Returning to the court with her left thigh strapped and with her movement significantly hampered, a visibly distressed Osaka attempted to close the match out with first-strike tennis that bypassed extended rallies. She was unable to take two match points on her own serve at 5-1, double faulting on the first and netting a backhand on the second. However, she was able to get over the line on return, summoning up a backhand winner to convert her third match point.

""It was definitely really difficult -- I'm kind of sorry about my attitude,"" Osaka said in an on-court interview that had to be cut short due to her leg pain.

In press, Osaka was hopeful that she could continue in the tournament.

""I took Advils, so I think it feels better than what it is right now, but obviously it doesn't feel good,"" she said. ""I couldn't really move that well. It's not good, but I think I'm a fast healer so it should be OK for my next match.""

Prior to the injury, Osaka had managed to raise her level in key moments to take control of the contest. Both players took their time to fully settle -- Lamens lost the first eight points of the match, including consecutive double faults to open her first service game; Osaka then conceded nine straight points to go down a break. Lamens threw in an error-strewn game when attempting to serve the set out at 5-4, and at 5-5 in the ensuing tiebreak Osaka played her best point of the set to inch ahead.

Lamens swiftly put the disappointment behind her, finding her form with her lethal forehand to take the second set. At the start of the third, the 26-year-old seemed poised to pull away after winning the best point of the match, ending a 19-stroke lung-buster with a thumping forehand winner on the line. Osaka responded immediately. On the very next point, she came up with a hot shot of her own, ending a 12-stroke athletic exchange with a superb backhand angle.

""Emotionally, I was going through a lot in this match,"" Osaka said. ""And then in the third set I tried my best to have no regrets.""

Osaka is scheduled to face Jaqueline Cristian in the quarterfinals on Friday. The Romanian rebounded from a first-set whitewash to defeat No. 8 seed Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 0-6, 6-4, 6-2, avenging a first-round loss to the Spaniard in Beijing three weeks ago.

Hair journey update in Osaka ☺️

“This is a very weird video,” Osaka starts, laughing. “I've been really struggling with my hair for like the past two years. Like, during pregnancy and after pregnancy I lost my edges and stuff.“They're back now,” she adds proudly. “Well, kind of. Kind of! Don't look too closely. I also dyed my hair a lot, so I had to cut it off, blah, blah, blah. But I think it's back now.”According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, postpartum hair loss—known as telogen effluvium—is common after childbirth:“Postpartum hair thinning or hair loss… occurs when hormone levels drop back to their regular levels after childbirth… Postpartum hair loss usually ends about 6–12 months after giving birth. Most women see their hair returning to its normal thickness as their hormone levels stabilize.”Read More: Naomi Osaka opens up about body image struggles, pressure to “snap back” after giving birthOsaka welcomed her daughter Shai on July 7, 2023, after stepping away from tennis in late 2022.

“It literally changed everything for me,” Jessie Weinberg says of the day when a teaching pro in her area emailed to ask if she wanted to take a lesson with him.It was the late summer of 2020, four months into the pandemic. That spring, Weinberg had joined two mass migrations that were common all around the country at the time. First, she left Covid-ravaged New York City for Goshen, a town of 3,100 in northwest Connecticut. Then, searching for something safe to do there, she made her way to the tennis courts in her housing development. Weinberg, then in her 40s, had played the sport as a kid, but had rarely picked up a racquet since high school. She immediately fell under its spell again.Read More: After a pandemic-driven boost, how can tennis sustain new popularity?But it wasn't until her first lesson with the pro who had emailed her, Mitch Case, that Weinberg found a new home on the court.“I feel like Mitch helped me see myself as a tennis player, and not someone who just plays tennis,” Weinberg says.Weinberg, who teaches at a boarding school, immediately connected with Case's step-by-step coaching style.“He was breaking my game down into parts, and really being explicit about how you generate more power, or what your swing path looks like,” she says. “And then doing it over and over again.”“I started to see that this is something I could get better at.

Those words will be music to the ears of anyone in the U.S. tennis community, and especially to those at the USTA who are tasked with growing it. So far this decade, they've had a good run. In 2020 and 2021, the social distance the game offered helped draw millions of people like Weinberg to their local courts, and they've kept coming in the years since. Tennis has added six million regular players in the last five years, to reach an all-time high of 25.7 million people. That inspired a new goal, and a new initiative from the USTA: To have 35 million people playing by 2035.With growth, though, have come a few growing pains. More players means you need (a) more courts, and (b) more experts to help those players improve, and make them feel the way Weinberg does: that the game is an essential part of their lives.To keep on track for its 35 million goal, USTA has taken steps to begin addressing both of those issues this year. In the spring, it announced a $10 million investment in constructing new facilities ands refurbishing old ones. That was followed this summer by the creation of USTA Coaching, described as “a new entity established to elevate and support the coaching community nationwide.”

To that end, USTA Coaching is designed to be a one-size-fits-all Internet platform where anyone who is interested in learning to teach tennis can find an educational package to suit their needs. At the USTA Coaching site, visitors can choose between four programs that target four specific groups of people, in ascending order of expertise.“Baseline,” which is free, is for parents and school coaches.“Rally,” which is $49 per year, is aimed at “emerging coaches” and part-time professionals.“Pro,” at $149 a year, is for college coaches and full-time pros.“Pro Plus,” at $249 per year, is for “professional coaches who want liability insurance.”“We're going to have resources to support people who haven't had coaching, or been an elite player,” says Megan Rose, managing director, head of business development and operations for USTA Coaching.“For parents, it will have exercises to take them through games and drills they can do with their kids. In this time-crunch society we're living in, having someone serve me up information about my kid's sport is something parents need.”From there, the goal is to create a holistic program that will include content about everything from equipment to the business of tennis to “empowering girls” to a “robust certification process that coaches will go through” and that will include ways for them to get insurance.“We'll be working through facility owners to get their coaches certified,” Morris says. “You'll start to see the USTA Coaching brand, which will be quality assurance that the programs players are involved meet the standard of the national governing body.”

Talking to adult players who have picked up tennis since the onset of Covid, it's clear that tennis' appeal now goes well beyond learning to hit better forehands and backhands, or even winning matches. Social connection, which can be hard to come by in this screen-dominated era, is a big part of what keeps people coming back, and a big part of a teaching pro's job.Jill Esposito, who lives in the Orlando, Fla. area, says she “got a little too comfortable with the lockdown” at home, and “knew that I needed something that would take me out of my comfort zone.”“Something that put me in the middle of social expectations, athletic expectations,” she says. “It would be a shock to my system, which is what I needed.”She knew she was in the right place when she walked on to the courts for her first lessons at the USTA National Campus in Lake Nona.“There was a big emphasis on getting people just to interact with each other,” Esposito says. “We used to start class by asking, ‘What's a good thing that happened to you this week?'”Five years later, Lake Nona's courts have become a new comfort zone for her.“There are moments when I realize that the people make me keep coming back,” she says. “I really made nice connections.”

The same has been true for Esther Flores, another Florida resident who took up tennis during the early days of Covid so she could “get outside” again. She liked the mental and physical challenge that learning tennis offered, and has continued to take lessons and clinics each week, along with cardio-tennis sessions. Flores finds that she doesn't need to compete, or move up the ladder at her courts, to find herself wanting to play, and see her tennis friends, as often as she can.“We have a group that has played together for two or three years,” she says. “We have the same love for tennis. We have the same addiction.”So it makes sense that USTA Coaching's tools for teaching pros begin by emphasizing the personal, rather than the technical, side of the sport. The “High School Tennis” section focuses on three facets of good coaching—Empathy, Active Listening, and Building Trust—that don't have anything to do with how to hit a serve.Morris believes the organization's track record in recent years is reason to be bullish on the future of coaching. While the pandemic gave the game a boost, he believes the USTA's recent series of programs have also brought in new players, young and old.“We did a lot of work with getting tennis into schools, exposed a lot of kids to tennis, which we're really pleased about,” Morris says. “Our World's Healthiest Sport message is starting to stick. Cardio tennis, team tennis for kids. I think all of those pieces are variables.”Coaching is the next variable in the USTA's 10-year-drive to add 10 million new players.“We do have an aging population when it comes to coaches,” Morris says. “We're going to be really intentional next year when it comes to recruitment. We want to focus on that next generation that we want to bring into the industry.”“It's a significant investment. Coaches at all levels are our heroes.”

ALMATY—It's all in the details, some say.Daniil Medvedev is buying into that notion, as he continues settling into his new coaching team of Thomas Johansson and Rohan Goetzke.The 2021 US Open champion is coming off a semifinal showing at the Rolex Shanghai Masters, his first run to the last four of a 1000-level event in more than six months. As he describes the early goings of the collaboration, it's one that is honing in on touching up his existing brand of tennis.“I think my game is complete enough, but it needs a lot of small details to add here and there and that's what we're looking for,” he told press Wednesday in Almaty during the English portion of his pre-tournament press conference.“It's everything: forehand, backhand, volley, serve. It's already good enough because I was number one, but small details needs to be improved.”

Medvedev mutually ended an eight-year partnership with coach Gilles Cervara after his first-round loss to Benjamin Bonzi at the US Open. There wasn't much time to get acquainted with Johansson and Goetzke ahead of an encouraging Asian swing, where he also advanced to the Beijing semifinals after dismissing Alexander Zverev.“It's just a start. We made good results in China for sure. When you start playing better, you want to do more, and I know how to do more, but it's a step by step process for sure,” said Medvedev.“It's not also easy to judge because there are tournaments, so we had like a week in Monaco and then it's tournament after tournament. There is no time to really do something big, but so far it has been working well, so we'll see how it goes later.”

The Russian is seeded second this week in Almaty, behind Wednesday's practice partner and defending champion Karen Khachanov. He's well-acquainted with Kazakhstan, though this marks his first trip to the Apple City. Needless to say, Medvedev's liked what he's seen with the operation so far at Almaty Arena.“They do a great job, the federation and the tournament itself. For a 250, it's a really, really good one. Everyone who came here for the first time is telling this,” he shared.“I heard a lot of good things about Almaty. Getting in a bit late from Shanghai, I'm not gonna have much time to see the city. I went to the center once already.”

With a short break between Singapore and Austin, how have the drivers been spending their time away from racing? Take a sneak peek into the life of the drivers off-grid...

As the drivers touch down in Austin ahead of a vibrant and action-packed Sprint weekend at the Circuit of The Americas, the energy is already building. After the heat and intensity of Singapore, the grid took a brief moment to recover, reset, and refill their cups before diving back into the climax of the season.

Some turned tourists, others headed straight to the sim (...or Mario Kart!). There were touching tributes, track time, and a few adventures – all of which helped the drivers to reset before the long run to the season's end in seven weeks time.

Some drivers took advantage of the week off after the Singapore Grand Prix to make the most of their time in Asia. Mercedes duo Kimi Antonelli and George Russell hopped over to Malaysia to swap their racing helmets for hard hats during a visit to the Petronas headquarters, while Lance Stroll headed to India to stop by Cognizant HQ and meet the team behind the scenes at Aston Martin's partner.

Soon-to-be Cadillac driver, and current Mercedes reserve, Valtteri Bottas popped up in South Korea and left with a spot-on caricature to remember his trip by, while Alex Albon squeezed in a whirlwind 24 hours in Thailand, soaking up the home comforts before jetting off to Austin to go racing again.

The love has been pouring in for Lewis Hamilton following the passing of his beloved companion – and superstar in his own right – Roscoe.

During the break, Hamilton received a special gift: a LEGO portrait of Roscoe. It's a fitting tribute, especially for someone who's been looking to grow his art collection – though it's hard to imagine any piece meaning more to him than this one.

A week off from F1 doesn't necessarily mean a week off racing – just ask Fernando Alonso. He spent the weekend karting, going back to one of the things that first got him behind the wheel. Karting is often a staple in the drivers' lives, and is the perfect opportunity to race, test themselves, and just enjoy driving without the pressure of the F1 paddock watching.

It's a trend familiar across the paddock: whether it's sim sessions, GT races, or just a bit of friendly karting with mates, many drivers use even a short break to chase the thrill of racing and keep their skills sharp.

Pierre Gasly ensured his week off was the perfect mix of work and play. He spent time in the gym and on the sim, logging laps and shifting weights to stay sharp before Austin.

But when it came to switching off, unsurprisingly his competitive streak didn't go far – swapping his steering wheel for a smaller controller to take on F1 25, a few rounds of Wii Sports golf, and even some Mario Kart action. After all, it's all about finding those extra gains… even if they come with a Wii remote in hand!

During the break, Liam Lawson and Nico Hulkenberg gave fans a glimpse of what they've been up to – and it was a little bit of everything. Travel shots, training moments, random adventures, and the occasional offbeat snapshot made up their photo dumps, a peek at the lighter and more unpredictable side of life away from the track.

Austin's Circuit of The Americas is a fan favourite – fast, flowing, and full of action. Which drivers and teams are primed to master Texas and deliver for your F1 Fantasy lineup?

Formula 1 touches down in Austin for one of the most dynamic weekends on the calendar. The Circuit of The Americas offers a mix of everything – high-speed sweeps, tight technical sections, and a dramatic uphill run into Turn 1 that always delivers fireworks. So, who's set to ride high in F1 Fantasy at the United States Grand Prix?

COTA's flowing nature and wide layout create multiple overtaking opportunities, but tyre degradation and race management are often the deciding factors here. With a passionate crowd and plenty of on-track unpredictability, our F1 Fantasy Strategist returns to help you identify which drivers and teams can handle the heat in Texas.

It's never too late to join the free-to-play game and compete for the great prizes on offer every race week! New players will need to select five drivers and two constructors within the starting cost cap of $100 million.

Keep your eyes peeled for exciting mini leagues opening later in the F1 Fantasy season too, providing you with even more opportunities to play and win.

Ahead of every Grand Prix weekend, our F1 Fantasy Strategist evaluates seven in-game assets – five drivers and two teams – that can help you succeed in F1 Fantasy, whether that's eking out every point or maximising your budget.

Austin's undulating surface and circuit-specific challenges reward consistency and adaptability, while the long back straight provides the perfect stage for DRS battles and last-gasp overtakes. Race strategy and tyre life management will be crucial as teams navigate a circuit that punishes mistakes but rewards aggression.

Catch up on the Singapore Grand Prix highlights below and keep reading for more tips. Remember to lock in your teams before the Sprint starts on Saturday, October 18 at 1200 local time (1700 UTC).

Max Verstappen is a force to be reckoned with at Circuit of The Americas.

The flying Dutchman has won both Sprints hosted in Austin across 2023 and 2024. He has also finished on the podium in the last six Grands Prix in The Lone Star State.

Verstappen averages 29.9 fantasy points in his last seven race weekends, the most among all drivers, and also has three pole positions to his name – no other driver has more than one in that time.

The momentum for Red Bull's championship contender continues to build as he closes the gap to Oscar Piastri ($26.9m) and Lando Norris ($30.9m) in the Drivers' Championship – and there is no better place to do it than at a track he has an excellent record at.

It's hard to ignore the scintillating form that George Russell is in at the moment.

The Mercedes racer posted his second Grand Prix victory of the season in Singapore, on his way to a seventh fantasy weekend in 2025 of 30+ points, and his future with the Silver Arrows was also confirmed on Wednesday.

Russell has been a bang-for-your-buck asset since Silverstone – he averages 1.06 points per $1 million spent in this window, the best among all drivers currently priced above $15m.

The five-time race winner averages 28 fantasy points across the nine Sprint weekends in 2024 and 2025 to date, and is in a great position to surpass this mark in Austin.

Kimi Antonelli continues to generate buzz as a relatively affordable driver in a front-running car – as long as he can avoid DNFs.

The Italian's struggles throughout the European leg of the F1 calendar were well-documented – four retirements, only one Grand Prix finish of P8 or better, and the second-worst performing F1 Fantasy driver between Imola and Monza, averaging 0.6 fantasy points per race.

However, in all other races this season, the rookie averages 20.4 fantasy points – fourth-best among all drivers, behind his team mate Russell and the McLaren duo of Piastri and Norris.

Keep an eye out for Antonelli in Free Practice and Sprint Qualifying if Mercedes can carry their recent strong pace into the weekend.

It's been a long-time coming for Yuki Tsunoda to make his first appearance on the Strategist's watchlist in 2025.

The Japanese driver will be targeting strong results in an improved Red Bull car between COTA and Abu Dhabi, with his future at the team still up in the air.

The 25-year-old has finished in the top-10 in three of his last four visits to Austin and has an average race finishing position of 10.0 between the Dutch and Singapore Grands Prix, including a season-best P6 in Azerbaijan.

Tsunoda averages 16.8 fantasy points in US-based races across 2024 and 2025 and will be well-placed to score similarly with the Sprint offering an additional opportunity for fantasy points.

Carlos Sainz is very fond of the Circuit of The Americas and his record at this track speaks volumes.

The 227-race veteran has secured points in eight of his nine outings dating back to 2015, which also consists of back-to-back podiums in 2023 and 2024.

He is the third-highest scoring driver between Azerbaijan and Singapore, only surpassed by the two most recent race winners – Verstappen and Russell.

The Williams man only has to score greater than -18 points for a maximum $0.6m price rise and should have no difficulties achieving this with three sessions of F1 Fantasy scoring this weekend.

Other drivers to monitor: Lando Norris, Oscar Piastri

It's been an uncharacteristic last two race weekends from the team based in Woking.

Although a P3 and P4 in Marina Bay remains a strong result by most standards, McLaren have posted two of their lowest four fantasy scores in 2025 across Azerbaijan (6) and Singapore (64).

In contrast, however, the Andrea Stella-led outfit averages 104 fantasy points on Sprint weekends this season – a remarkable feat considering no other team exceeds more than 61 on these corresponding fixtures.

Avoid McLaren in F1 Fantasy at your own risk on Sprint weekends in 2025 – no other team comes close to them this season.

Mercedes' friendly price point relative to their front-running peers makes them an attractive asset to own on a weekend where many players will consider playing the 3X DRS Boost chip on two premium drivers.

The Silver Arrows have strung together one of their best two-race sequences this season, scoring 67 fantasy points apiece in Azerbaijan and Singapore.

Russell and Antonelli have qualified for Q3 in three consecutive race weekends, only matched by McLaren in this time.

The recent form of the Brackley-based outfit, while other top teams are blighted with inconsistencies, suggest they could deliver once more, this time in the Texas heat.

Other constructors to monitor: Red Bull, Williams

3X DRS Boost is an optimal chip to deploy on Sprint weekends. With the deadline at the start of the Sprint on these weekends, this provides an additional session of point-scoring opportunities for your team.

Utilising this chip on two consistent drivers in high-performing teams (i.e., Piastri, Norris, Verstappen, Russell) will ensure you can extract the most value out of it when activated.

As always, be sure to keep a close eye on the earlier sessions to help guide your decisions for drivers and teams in the lead up to the team lock deadline.

A new pre-race opening show will debut at the upcoming United States Grand Prix in Austin.

The excitement of Formula 1 will begin before lights out thanks to a brand-new pre-race show, F1 Grid Gigs presented by American Express, with the first to take place at this weekend's United States Grand Prix.

A unique blend of music and motorsport, the new feature was inspired by the celebrated F1 75 Live season opener at London's The O2 arena, watched by an incredible 7.5 million viewers across F1's social channels.

Partnering with world renowned and locally relevant artists around the globe, F1 Grid Gigs will elevate the pre-race entertainment spectacle for fans in the stands and at home during the countdown to the cars heading out on track.

At Austin, widely regarded as the live music capital of the world, the inaugural show will embrace Texas' rich music heritage by giving the stage to local country singer and actor Drake Milligan.

Known for his chart-topping album Dallas/Fort Worth and hit songs 'Sounds Like Something I'd Do', 'Honky Tonkin' About' with The Reklaws, and 'I Got a Problem', Drake's distinct traditional country sound blended with his own unique modern flare, makes him one of the rising stars of country music.

In Austin, Drake's performance will mark the start of the race preparations, taking to the grid to entertain fans in the stands and at home, just before the drivers leave their garages to head out onto track.

F1 Grid Gigs presented by American Express will return at the 2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix, with a world-class artist performance in the City of Lights before the racing begins at the iconic Las Vegas Strip Circuit.

“There's nothing like the energy of a Formula 1 grid as the world gets ready for the best drivers to go head-to-head,” said Emily Prazer, Chief Commercial Officer at F1.

“F1 Grid Gigs presented by American Express will elevate one of the most anticipated moments of a Grand Prix weekend.

“This new pre-race show has been designed to capture and celebrate the thrill of the grid and give fans in the stands and at home a taste of adrenaline and exhilaration before we go racing.”

Drake Milligan added: “I'm thrilled to be performing at the Grand Prix in Austin, TX! There's nothing like the energy of this city during race weekend and I'm looking forward to being a part of it.

“It's the perfect stage for live music with the roar of the engines and the passion of the fans! I can't wait to bring some country heat to the Circuit of The Americas!”

Heading to the 2025 United States Grand Prix in Austin? Here's your guide to all things off-track in the Live Music Capital of the World, plus what to see, eat and do while you experience Formula 1 in true Texas style.

Few events capture the American spirit quite like the United States Grand Prix, where horsepower meets hospitality and racing is on a Texas-sized scale. From October 17-19, 2025, Austin will be the place to be as the Circuit of The Americas comes alive with the roar of Formula 1. The grandstands fill, the engines echo across the hills, and the city's live music and laid-back vibe turn race weekend into something unforgettable.

The US Grand Prix isn't just a race – it's a full-blown Austin-style celebration. Between the captivating on-track drama, the abundance of food trucks, fan zones, and concerts, there's always something happening. One minute you're watching cars fly through Turn 1, the next you're catching a band downtown or watching fireworks light up the skyline. It's fast, loud, and full of that easy Texas charm that keeps people coming back year after year.

Here are some relaxed ways to kick off your race weekend before heading to COTA for an action-packed day:

Stroll or paddle at Lady Bird Lake: Enjoy a peaceful walk along the waterfront trails or rent a kayak or paddleboard for a gentle start to the day. The calm water and skyline views make for a refreshing and photogenic morning.

Explore south or east Austin: Wander tree-lined streets, take in colourful murals, and browse local markets. These neighbourhoods offer a taste of Austin's culture and quirky personality, all at a leisurely pace.

Morning in a park or green space: Visit Zilker Park, Barton Creek Greenbelt, or other nearby parks for a nature-filled morning. Stretch your legs, take in some greenery, and enjoy a calm outdoor start before the crowds arrive at the circuit.

If you've arrived a day or two early, there's plenty to see and do in Austin without diving straight into race weekend chaos:

Cultural stops: Austin has a wealth of museums, galleries, and theatres. Explore the city's art, history, and cultural institutions to get a sense of its rich heritage — from fine art to Texan history.

Embrace the quirky side of Austin: For something truly offbeat, wander through some of the city's more unusual attractions such as the Cathedral of Junk, where art and creativity take unexpected forms.

Sports & recreation: Sports fans can soak up American college football culture by visiting the University of Texas campus. Even if you don't catch a game, the atmosphere and massive stadium are worth experiencing.

Outdoor adventures: Austin's parks and green spaces are perfect for low-energy or active pursuits. You can walk, swim, or enjoy water sports at places like Lady Bird Lake, Zilker Park, or Barton Creek Greenbelt. These areas offer a refreshing way to enjoy the outdoors and recharge before the race weekend.

Located about 15 miles southeast of downtown Austin, COTA is best reached with some planning ahead. Traffic can be heavy on race days, so allow extra time for your journey.

Driving and rideshare: Parking is available but must be pre-booked. Expect delays when entering and leaving the venue. Rideshare services drop passengers at designated zones near the track, though you may need to walk a short distance.

Shuttles and public transport: Event shuttles usually run from downtown Austin and other key areas. They are a convenient option and help you avoid the traffic around COTA. Check your ticket information or the official USGP website for shuttle routes and times.

Walking and accessibility: The circuit grounds are large and hilly, so wear comfortable shoes and dress for the weather. Accessible parking and mobility services are available, but should be arranged in advance.

Leaving the circuit: Crowds leaving COTA can cause delays after the race. Stay behind for a concert or enjoy a final lap of the Fanzone to let the traffic clear before heading out.

COTA's dramatic layout, steep elevation and open Texas landscape make it one of the most photogenic tracks on the F1 calendar.

Must-see corners and views: Turn 1 is one of the most iconic sights in Formula 1, with a steep climb and sharp left-hand turn that sets the tone for the lap. The esses between Turns 3 and 6 deliver high-speed action, while Turns 16 to 18 show cars sweeping through a fast triple apex. The Observation Tower provides a panoramic view of the entire circuit and is a must-visit for fans and photographers.

Top photo spots

Fanzone: The Fanzone sits at the heart of the Grand Plaza, with team appearances, driver interviews, interactive simulators, merchandise stalls and local food vendors. It is a great place to explore between sessions and take in the festival vibe.

Top fan hack: Best lighting hits just after 6.30pm when the sun drops low over the Texas hills. Visit the tower or Turn 1 for glowing evening shots. For emptier stands and cleaner photos, go during Friday practice.

Once the racing stops, Austin comes alive. The city's nightlife and live music scene make it one of the most entertaining Grand Prix destinations.

Concerts and entertainment: Major international artists perform on the Germania Insurance Amphitheater stage inside COTA, with access included in your ticket. Around town, smaller venues on Sixth Street, South Congress and the Red River District keep the energy going well into the night.

Downtown Austin: Explore the city's creative side with its murals, record shops, rooftop bars and craft breweries. South Congress Avenue is perfect for shopping and street food, while Rainey Street offers converted bungalows turned into buzzing bars.

Party down 6th Street: A vibrant array of bars, restaurants and entertainment venues, 6th Street is a sure bet for a captivating dining experience! There are a number of walking food tours and bar crawls available here so you can really get a taste of Austin!

Food trucks and BBQ: When the race is over, follow the smell of barbecue into town. Austin's food trucks serve everything from smoked brisket and tacos to fusion bites and craft desserts. Locals will tell you no visit is complete without trying Texas barbecue at least once.

Austin's culinary scene is as bold as its racing weekend.

Brisket and barbecue: Tender, slow-cooked meat with a rich smoky flavour and spicy sauce. Whether it's sliced brisket, ribs or pulled pork, barbecue is a must-try part of the Austin experience.

Tacos and Tex-Mex: Breakfast tacos are an Austin essential. Try them with eggs, cheese and jalapenos to start your race day right.

Craft beer: Local breweries like Austin Beerworks and Live Oak Brewing offer refreshing options after a day at the track.

Frozen margaritas: The city's unofficial drink. Perfect for cooling down after hours in the Texas sun.

Sweet treats: Cool off with homemade ice cream or a classic slice of pecan pie.

Experience live music: Austin is famous for its vibrant live music scene, featuring world renowned artists and independent artists alike. If you're staying in the city for a little longer before the Grand Prix weekend, be sure to check out the Austin City Limits music festival and experience the Austin live music scene at its best!

Bring a reusable water bottle: Temperatures in Austin can get hot (yes, even in October) and it's important to keep hydrated. There are plenty of places to refill around the city.

Embrace the unofficial siesta: Although Austin doesn't have an official siesta hour like in some parts of South America, residents implement their own unofficial one to keep out of the midday sun's scorching heat. You can still make the most out of your days in Austin by waking up and starting your day earlier, meaning you can explore the city in more comfortable temperatures.

Outwit the traffic: Like most major cities, Austin has the occasional traffic jam... Satellite navigation devices don't always accurately predict the correct arrival time, so ensure you leave 15/30 minutes earlier than you think you'll need to. If you don't want to rely on driving, join Austin's large cycling community and hop on a bike!

Barbecue is king: Austin is synonymous with barbecue, and with countless BBQ joints in town you will be spoiled for choice. You can even take food tours focused on this cultural staple. The famous eateries La Barbecue and Franklin Barbecue are fan favourites for this, but make sure to get there early to avoid a long wait in line!

A step between tyre compounds will add another element to the mix for drivers and teams at the upcoming United States and Mexico City Grands Prix.

Pirelli Director of Motorsport Mario Isola has explained the thinking behind the manufacturer's split tyre compound choices for the next two rounds of the season in the United States and Mexico, with the move aimed at mixing up race strategies.

Austin is the second venue that Pirelli are bringing non-consecutive compounds to this season (the last being Spa-Francorchamps for the Belgian Grand Prix), and the available tyres will again be the C1 as the hard, the C3 as the medium and the C4 as the soft.

A week later in Mexico City, the Italian supplier will provide the C2 as the hard, the C4 as the medium and the C5 as the soft, given the different characteristics and demands of the Circuit of The Americas and the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.

It compares to the traditional method of Pirelli picking three consecutive compounds out of their slick-tyre range: in 2025, from hardest to softest, that being the C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 and C6.

Speaking after those choices were confirmed, Isola opened up on Pirelli's goals with the step approach and what was learned from the first test in Belgium – even if adverse weather conditions impacted the weekend.

“It's difficult to come to a conclusion for Spa where we had the weather that was not helping at all, but I believe the idea was good, and that's why we decided to have the same approach for Texas and Mexico where we skip a compound between hard and medium,” said Isola.

“Basically, the target is always the same: to have a variation in strategies and to have teams planning a one-stop or two-stop, so different approaches to the race.

“We made some simulations, and we believe that creating a bigger gap between the hard and the medium means that if one team wants to use the hard and target a one-stop race, they are penalised by a slower tyre. While if a team wants to be aggressive, and that means moving to a two-stop strategy, at that time you can use the medium and the soft that are faster.

“So, this is the approach, and for Mexico and Austin we believe we can try this solution again.”

Elaborating on that belief, and why Austin and Mexico City were chosen as the next two events with a jump in compounds, Isola continued: “Because of the simulation we were running with our modelling department that is telling us the two-stop strategy is slightly quicker than the one-stop.

""Usually, if you have a one-stop and two-stop that are very close in terms of total race time, the teams choose a one-stop. They don't want to take a risk of an additional pit stop, traffic or a mistake during the stop, so they move in a natural way towards a one-stop race.

“That means in Mexico and Texas we have a simulation telling us the two-stop is a few seconds quicker.”

First practice for the United States Grand Prix, which features the Sprint format, will get under way at 1230 local time on Friday.

With Mercedes confirming George Russell and Kimi Antonelli for 2026, Lawrence Barretto explains whether the squad's line-up is set for the long term.

On the eve of the United States Grand Prix weekend in Austin, Mercedes have confirmed what most had expected – George Russell and Kimi Antonelli will form their line-up for 2026. F1 Correspondent Lawrence Barretto explains more...

Fresh from one of the most convincing wins of his career last time out in Singapore, Russell can stroll into the Austin paddock tomorrow knowing that after months of negotiating, he's all sorted for a drive for next year.

Once Max Verstappen became unavailable, when he confirmed he'd be staying put at Red Bull for 2026, it was always a case of when, not if, Russell would sign on the dotted line to extend his stay at Mercedes that began in 2022.

Pirelli have confirmed the tyre compounds that will be in use across the United States Grand Prix weekend.

Formula 1 rolls on to Austin's Circuit of The Americas (COTA) for the United States Grand Prix this weekend, with tyre supplier Pirelli confirming the compounds that will be in play.

It is the second Grand Prix of the season where Pirelli are bringing three non-consecutive compounds (the last being Spa-Francorchamps), and the available tyres will again be the C1 as the hard, the C3 as the medium and the C4 as the soft.

With the Sprint format in play this weekend, drivers will be given 12 sets of tyres rather than the usual 13. Each will receive two sets of the hard, four sets of the medium and six sets of soft, as well as five sets of intermediates and two sets of wets.

“In Belgium, bad weather meant it was not possible to find out how this choice might have affected strategy and so the event in COTA could be the first real test of this choice, which sees the use of a harder hard than last year at the American track, while the medium and soft are the same,” reads Pirelli's event preview.

“The increased performance difference between the hardest compound and the middle one should, theoretically, give rise to two scenarios.

“If drivers prefer the C1, the slowest but also the most consistent of the three, then they could run a one-stop race combining it with the C3. On the other hand, using the latter along with the C4, with its improved resistance to degradation, would produce quicker lap times but would almost certainly require two stops.

“Another similarity with the Belgian round is that Austin is also running to the Sprint format, which means teams only have one hour to try the various options over long and short runs, which could add to the uncertainty as to how the weekend might pan out.”

	An AI entertainment studio backed by the likes of Google, Andreessen Horowitz, Peter Chernin's North Road Company and Michael Ovitz's Crossbeam wants to bring its generative AI expertise to traditional studios and production companies.


Promise, led by Fullscreen founder George Strompolos, former YouTube executive Jamie Byrne, who most recently led creator partnerships for YouTube; and AI filmmaker Dave Clark, is launching a new division called The Generation Company, which will work with outside studios and production companies to deliver visual effects and sequences created with its tech.

	The Generation Company will be led by filmmaker and generative AI artist Nem Perez, who previously founded the virtual production and AI workflow company Storyblocker, and also directed music videos for the likes of Mac Miller, Nipsey Hussle, and Chance the Rapper.


	“With The Generation Company, Promise is bringing our GenAI filmmaking expertise to partners as a true creative ally, helping them achieve their vision and push ideas beyond the limits of traditional resources, timelines, and budgets,” said Byrne, the co-founder, president and COO of Promise. “Nem is a pioneer in applying GenAI to filmmaking, building on a career leading creative teams across entertainment, advertising, and music. His work with some of the world's top GenAI artists makes him uniquely positioned to help storytellers navigate this new frontier with both artistry and precision.”


	“I believe GenAI exists to serve the artist, opening the door to cinematic moments that might otherwise be impossible,” adds Perez, head of The Generation Company. “For me, it's about honoring the craft I've devoted my career to while embracing new tools that expand what's possible on screen. With human expression driving everything we do, filmmakers and creative partners who work with The Generation Company can bring their full vision to life on their own terms.”

	











	In addition to VFX and sequences, the company will also provide a team of AI specialists meant to advise creative departments like art, costume, props, and storyboarding.


	Promise was founded last year with the goal of building out a slate of films and series using generative AI tech. Earlier this year it raised more money, with Google and Crossbeam joining its list of investors, while also making its first acquisition: The tech-centric film school Curious Refuge, which teaches filmmakers how ton utilize advanced technology in their workflows.


	The Generation Company expands Promise's business further into the services world, seeking a piece of the production puzzle that has been most disrupted by technology, as studios seek more realistic and elaborate VFX while also seeking to manage costs.

	For a moment, the 50-yard line at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, was the media capital of the world. As the San Francisco 49ers were warming up for a Sept. 21 game against the Arizona Cardinals, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell caught the eye of Neal Mohan. The YouTube CEO, flanked by a handful of his platform's top creators, marched onto the field and embraced Goodell.


	About an hour or so after their meeting on the field, the moguls addressed creators and guests in a suite. “We want to continue to double down on that partnership you saw,” the YouTube chief said, referring to the first exclusive NFL game that YouTube hosted live, the Sept. 5 contest between the Los Angeles Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs, which they played in Brazil.

	“More to come, right?” Goodell quipped in response.


	“Well, that's up for you to decide,” Mohan replied.


	When asked a few minutes later whether that means YouTube is in a strong position to carry exclusive NFL games going forward, Goodell was unequivocal. “Absolutely,” he said.


	But as big a deal as YouTube becoming a league broadcast partner would be (on top of its existing $2 billion deal for NFL Sunday Ticket), the platform's scale and cultural relevance were also on display in Santa Clara. Even with the 49ers on the field, a large group of kids on a rope line near the stands were screaming for one of the creators that had joined Mohan, sports influencer Jesse “Jesser” Riedel, as parents jockeyed to get them closer for a photo or autograph.

	











	“It's a blessing,” Jesser said modestly after heading back into a tunnel under the stands, away from the roar of the crowd. The kids were there for the 49ers, but a YouTuber stole the show.


	***


	During the past 20 years, the Google-owned YouTube has slowly — then rapidly — become a dominant force in media, the hub for a wide array of genres, from talk and comedy to food and unscripted fare. But the bigger prize for the video platform would be to take over the other hours people are spending on their TV sets, and there are signs that YouTube is close to a breakthrough there.


	Sports, led by the NFL, is in many ways the final frontier for YouTube to conquer. The platform is on the verge of subsuming the genres that have helped define the past 100 years of TV. In fact, the CEO noted in his annual letter to the YouTube community that the platform's viewership on TV sets has “surpassed mobile and is now the primary device for YouTube viewing in the U.S.”


	For someone running one of the most important entertainment companies in the world, Mohan, 52, is very much of the Silicon Valley mold, not a creature of Hollywood. He has an electrical engineering degree from Stanford and was an executive at the ad tech firm DoubleClick when Google acquired it in 2007, joining it in the deal. He went on to lead the tech giant's display business before becoming YouTube's chief product officer in 2015 and its CEO in 2023.


	He carries himself with an amiable and good-natured Midwestern attitude (he was born in Indiana, where his dad was a grad student at Purdue). It's a personality that meshes well with YouTube's stable of creators, many of whom are, befitting their on-camera personalities, over-the-top and engaging. Just as Hollywood executives are eager to give notes to creators and put their stamp on content, Mohan is happy to step back and let the creators on his platform lead the way.

	











	While the creators at the NFL game were filming a wacky sketch in the end zone, Mohan was watching from the sidelines, beaming at the access his platform gave them. It was a real-life metaphor: Mohan is happy to cheer from the sidelines while the creators are in the spotlight.


	But while he is a tech executive first and foremost, Mohan says that it is his “deeply personal” love of stories that keeps him engaged.


	“I am a technologist, but I also love media and storytelling. I've been that way since I can remember, I'm a fan myself, fundamentally,” he says. “Leading YouTube is a privilege where I can actually bring both those pieces together, that human storytelling and creativity and the best of technology, that's what motivates me every morning.”


	As Mohan is fond of saying, “There's only one YouTube,” and in a landscape littered with streaming services, it can still find ways to surprise. On Sept. 16, a few days before his summit with Goodell in Santa Clara, Mohan took to the stage in Google's office at Pier 57 in New York with news to share: Over the past four years, YouTube had paid out more than $100 billion to its creators, artists and media partners. After his presentation to creators ended, he stood on the stage in the Google office taking photos with attendees, chatting about their hopes and concerns.


	Walking through New York's Meatpacking District later that evening to a reception the platform was hosting, Mohan reflected on that moment onstage. “There are two really fundamental things that we do for creators,” he said. “One is help them build an audience and connect with their fans, regardless of where those fans are in the world; and the second thing we do is we help them build businesses. That's what that $100 billion represents for me.”

	











	It's also reflected in the company's bottom line: YouTube generated more than $36 billion in advertising revenue in 2024, and executives say annual revenue — including subscriptions like YouTube Premium and YouTube Music — tops $50 billion, with revenues shared with the more than 3 million creators in its Partner Program, which reflects channels monetizing their videos. Both numbers are rising fast, even as traditional entertainment companies find themselves stagnating.


	It's come a long way since the 19-second “me at the zoo” video was uploaded in April 2005. Now, per a KPMG report released Sept. 23, YouTube is second only to Comcast in terms of annual content spend, inclusive of payments to creators and media companies, paying out as much as Netflix and Paramount combined, $32 billion.


	Already, many of the genres that once defined cable TV have migrated to YouTube. Chefs explaining recipes in the kitchen, once the domain of Food Network, have moved there (even The New York Times‘ cooking section is going all in on YouTube videos), while creators like Dude Perfect and Mark Rober are creating shows that would once have been right at home on Discovery Channel or Nickelodeon.


	The only question is what genres it will take over next, and how quickly it will do so. From talk shows to scripted dramas to, yes, live sports, there are signs that the platform's ambitions will collide with the traditional TV business sooner rather than later.

	Everyone knows late night TV is in trouble. The Late Show With Stephen Colbert has been canceled at CBS, while Jimmy Kimmel's short-lived suspension at ABC brought fresh attention to the struggles of the format. YouTube has slowly, then all at once, become the de facto home for what had been late night, not only for the shows on linear TV, but for an emerging crop of new talent born on the platform.

	











	As it happens, late night itself transformed YouTube when the Saturday Night Live skit “Lazy Sunday” went viral 20 years ago on the platform, which had only been live for a few months.


	“One of the really big [shifts] was Saturday Night Live and clips getting consumed not on Saturday night but on Sunday morning, when people would open up YouTube,” Mohan says, adding that it was in his mind a “seminal moment” in the platform's history. “In that sense, they were a pioneer in getting their content out to so many viewers.”


	It was a seminal moment inside the big media companies, too.


	“As somebody who was at NBC at the time, part of the thinking was, ‘How do we build out the NBC universe of websites so that people know to come here to get the clips of these shows?' ” recalls Gavin Purcell, the former showrunner for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. “[YouTube] knew the value of having it all in one place.”


	As consumer preferences collide with a burgeoning ecosystem of video podcasts (YouTube now claims more than 1 billion podcast users monthly), the world of late night, and for that matter TV talk shows more generally, increasingly revolves around the platform.


	One current late night producer says that almost every A-list booking now includes some sort of sketch or bit that they think will play well on YouTube, but booking those guests in the first place has become less of a sure thing. A veteran Hollywood publicist says that for many of their clients, they are now recommending that YouTube podcasts or shows become the first stop, or at least a major stop, on press tours.

	











	Just look at Alex Cooper, whose recent guests on Call Her Daddy include Cardi B and Gwyneth Paltrow; Brittany Broski, who spoke to David Corenswet for her series Royal Court; or Travis and Jason Kelce's New Heights, which hosted Leonardo DiCaprio and Benicio Del Toro to talk about One Battle After Another, not to mention Taylor Swift, Travis' fiancée, to announce her new album. “I think Royal Court is an exciting example that was, by accident, what the new Hollywood is shaping up to be,” Broski says. “I'm not trying to get you. I'm not trying to get the tea. I want to hang out with you.”


	In fact, what had been late night is being splintered into pieces, where consumers can create their own show, complete with comedy sketches, political monologues and jokes, musical performances and interview segments all pulled from different channels.


	“It gets reconstituted in your feed, which is a personalized set of preferences in terms of what speaks to you around that particular format, whether it's the monologue, whether it's the sketch, whether it's what Brittany [Broski] does in terms of the conversation,” Mohan says.


	“All of us on YouTube come from a world where when you want to create something, you just go do it,” says Adam Waheed (he goes by “Adam W”), whose YouTube comedy sketches routinely draw millions of views on the platform. “You don't wait for somebody, you don't ask somebody. You just go make it. And you get feedback right away.”


	That freedom is particularly relevant in the moment, with Colbert on the way out next year and Kimmel surely weighing his options at ABC.

	











	“As you've no doubt observed, many people who came from that linear background have found lots of success on YouTube and been able to control their destiny and their creative ambitions,” Mohan says, perhaps tempting the fate of broadcast TV veterans.


	The result of the podcast explosion and the late night revolution is what Purcell calls a “flattening” of the format, where big stars can leverage their fame to become major YouTube creators and creators can leverage the platform to become big stars themselves.


	“The people that used to host podcasts were no-names in some form, and a lot of names have come into this space,” says Purcell, who also co-hosts a podcast himself on YouTube called AI For Humans. “I would argue that Amy Poehler's podcast [Good Hang] is not that different than what, say, Tom Snyder was doing at 12:30 back in the day, except she's funnier and she's more charming, and the guests that come in are bigger because of the distribution platform.” 


	Nielsen has been tracking the streaming platforms that consumers watch on their TV screens ever since it launched what it calls The Gauge in 2021. But over the past year, YouTube's domination of The Gauge has unnerved executives at some competitors. The most recent Gauge report showed that YouTube was by far the most watched video platform, holding 13.1 percent share. Netflix, in second place, was at 8.7 percent.

	











	Nielsen senior vp product strategy Brian Fuhrer says that today reminds him of the early days of cable TV. “As the cable networks got bigger and bigger, and they had a lot of penetration, their ratings naturally increased,” he says.


	It was a flywheel effect, a flywheel that now appears in motion for YouTube, at the same time that most of the rest of the streaming business (Netflix notably excluded) is stuck in stagnation.

	In an industrial park in the shadow of the Burbank airport, a suburban street is coming to life. There are shops and restaurants, a school and homes, both wealthy and more working class. Pumpkins appear on the doorsteps around Halloween, and Christmas lights around the holidays, but not everything is as it seems.


	The street is a facade. It's a full-scale set inside the 125,000-square foot-studio of Dhar Mann, the YouTube creator who is on a mission to turbocharge the creation of inspiring, uplifting scripted entertainment.


	Mann is perhaps the biggest creator in the scripted space on YouTube, with his studio turning out everything from shortform scenes to feature-length movies.


	In YouTube's quest to take over TV, scripted entertainment may be the ultimate challenge. The cultural relevance of shows like The White Lotus or Abbott Elementary simply hasn't been replicated yet on a user-generated platform, though Mann's operation is a sign of just how far things have come.

	











	“A lot of times when people think of YouTube content, it's mainly spectacle-based or gamified, or music or podcasting, reactionary content, but there's a whole ecosystem of scripted content that's really growing, and I think it's going to be one of the areas that really explodes,” Mann says.


	“I do think it is maybe the early phases of growth that we're seeing there,” affirms Mohan.


	Mann, like many other creators, does not produce content at the cadence that traditional studios do. He will have as many as eight productions going at once in his studio, spanning lengths and genres.


	“Traditional Hollywood is like, ‘I'll put out eight episodes or 10 episodes of something, and it took me a year to make it,' ” says Nic Paul, the president of Spotter, which provides capital, tools and resources to creators. “These creators are every week engaging with tens of millions of unique viewers and hundreds of millions of views in 30 days. They're putting out content either several times a week, every week or every other week. Audiences no longer have to wait.”


	But scripted content is also at the heart of one of the tensest parts of the relationship between YouTube, the platform, and the ecosystem of creators who populate it.


	Unlike with Netflix or HBO, YouTube creators are taking on the risk for their projects (though, granted, there's a great disparity in production budgets). If Netflix likes a concept, it picks it up, providing the budget and resources to help get it over the finish line. On YouTube, it is up to the creator to finance and produce their content, and while the platform regularly releases new tools to help them (including AI-enabled tech that suggests video ideas and can create short background videos for use in Shorts), scripted entertainment is a particularly tricky challenge, requiring writers, directors, sets, costumes, lighting, editing, special effects and other production requirements that may go beyond the typical creator-led show.

	











	“If you're working on scripted, you sometimes might need some of those resources,” Mohan says, arguing that the infrastructure is being built before our eyes. “The best sort of visual example in my head is, if you go down to Burbank, you'll see on one end of the town, a storied studio like Walt Disney, and then you'll see rows of these smaller studios.


	“It's just like what happens right here in Silicon Valley, which is that next to the big technology companies, you have this startup ecosystem,” he adds. “People like Kinigra Deon and Dhar Mann and Mythical Entertainment and Alan Chikin Chow, they're the startups of Hollywood.”


	And just like tech startups, that sometimes means looking for outside financing and support.


	Some of the biggest creators have turned to the major studios and streamers to help them do the projects they want to do (see MrBeast's nine-figure deal for Beast Games with Prime Video) or are seeking to raise money to bulk up (MrBeast and Mann have been in the market).


	Others have turned to private equity, with several PE-backed firms promising six- and seven-figure investments (in some cases eight figures) to subsidize the production of shows that will live on YouTube in exchange for partial ownership of the show in question.


	“There's a burgeoning ecosystem of investors and studios that are backing YouTube content to bridge that gap” between creativity and financing, one connected source says. “Obviously, there's a trade-off with that, because you end up giving upside in ownership.”

	











	But creator-driven scripted content may be rising at the perfect moment for Hollywood, which is in the midst of a historic pullback in the genre after years of explosive growth.


	“That competition for their IP is going to just get greater and greater,” says Frank Albarella, the U.S. sector leader for media and telecommunications at KPMG. “The evolution of what we're seeing in terms of viewer preferences is lining up with this transformation of the models from that traditional high-cost, high-investment, high-risk production model, to the user-generated content model.”


	Mann, for his part, says that when his studio creates a feature-length scripted film, it costs in the low six figures to produce from start to finish, a fraction of what even the nimblest of traditional production companies operate under.


	It's caught the eye of Hollywood veterans, too: Mann says that he has spoken to executives at traditional studios desperate to understand how he produces content at a fraction of the cost: “As you know, production budgets are constantly getting cut. Production in L.A. is down 45 percent last time I checked, so many studio lots are sitting vacant,” he says.


	A creator-led studio is not going to sit back and let its lots remain vacant for long.

	Across the country, Kinigra Deon is buying a school in Birmingham, Alabama. Known for her scripted content that touches on comedy, drama and even fantasy, this creator has been quietly building out a studio complex where she and her team can soon double their output, and the former Jefferson County school building will make for a critical piece of the puzzle, with so many of her shows and scenes set in schools. Scrolling through photos of the project on her phone, Deon shows off the construction that includes a creator lounge, a place where the actors she casts in her shows and videos can conceptualize and create their own content.

	











	“The goal is to cast more in Alabama, to make Alabama more of a hub for filming and entertainment,” Deon says. The state, in turn, has revamped its entertainment incentive program, which went into effect Oct. 1, upping its annual production cap to $22 million.


	Deon is a textbook example of how YouTube is shifting the center of gravity away from Los Angeles, spreading it across the country. Just as MrBeast has turned Greenville, North Carolina, into a veritable company town, Deon wants to turn Birmingham into a true production hub.


	Her next big bet is a feature-length movie, backed by Kevin Hart's HartBeat and the Amazon-funded Spotter. “What I'm hoping for when we release that movie is that it sends a widespread message that you don't have to wait to release something that you're passionate about. You just have to do it,” Deon says.


	Scott Purdy, the U.S. media industry leader at KPMG, says that more traditional studios and platforms will ultimately pursue deals with scripted creators, though it may take time for some to emerge. MrBeast, for example, isn't stopping with just Amazon. His company recently hired Corie Henson, the former head of unscripted at NBC, to lead his company's new studio, which includes animation and scripted content.


	In some cases, however, that jump is being made more out of necessity.


	“A lot of YouTubers feel as if they have a lot of control over their work and their time and their content, and that's true to an extent, but algorithm changes can have a significant impact on your success,” says one creator who has spoken to other streaming services about licensing content, explaining why they are exploring options.

	











	“We're proud of the fact that YouTube is this epicenter of culture, and it looks like other companies have noticed that as well,” Mohan says with a smile when asked about interest from other companies in creator-led content. “But I would also say that what creators always tell me is that their home is YouTube, so I love the fact that they use their success on YouTube to create these other opportunities for themselves.”


	Perhaps the most significant things that need to happen for scripted content to break out, multiple sources across the creator ecosystem say, is for ad dollars to migrate from prestige TV (or at least linear TV) toward scripted creators, and for the user experience to match.


	“Brands need to recognize the opportunity that's happening with YouTube — which they are — and that's going to cause CPMs to start to rise,” Mann says, explaining his thesis. “At a certain point, you get to an inflection point where the cost of creating content is cheaper than the amount of revenue that you can generate because CPMs are going up, costs are going down. And then ultimately, it's whoever can build the biggest community.”


	And YouTube is building out a TV experience that is better suited for that model, rolling out a redesign on TVs that is, frankly, more Netflix-like in appearance, allowing creators to structure their channels around shows and seasons in pursuit of a more traditional TV experience, albeit supplemented with YouTube traits like comments.


	“YouTube doesn't feel like a scripted environment quite yet,” one business-side source says, adding that ultimately, the “monetization plus user experience will get there.”

	











	There are signs that media buyers and marketers are trending in that direction.


	“I've brought chief investment officers and chief marketing officers to some of these studios, and they can start to see how big a business and how scaled the opportunity is for them,” says Sean Downey, the executive who oversees YouTube parent Google's sprawling ad sales business. “When you bring 10 clients to see MrBeast in North Carolina, you can start to see the creativity, how they can lift the business, how they integrate their brand into the consumer viewing; you start to see the light bulb go off.”


	It's another way of saying that the platform believes that its $36 billion-plus in annual advertising revenue is still at the early stages of a long runway.


	That is also reflected in YouTube's conquering of what was once a flagship event of the broadcast TV era: upfront week. The annual spectacle, with thousands of media buyers and advertisers crisscrossing Manhattan to be wooed and pitched by TV networks, has already transformed into something more corporate. Disney pitched every piece of its media empire, not just ABC; Paramount exited the week altogether; and Netflix and Amazon shoved their way in as they seek more ad dollars.


	But YouTube has settled in as the week's culminating event, taking over Lincoln Center with its Brandcast event and delivering a show with more assuredness and confidence than its competitors, analog or digital, multiple media buyers said. This year's show, presided over by Broski, saw MrBeast doing a stunt with former NFL stars Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman and Hot Ones host Sean Evans making an appearance. The platform, Mohan told the buyers in attendance, is the only place where viewership can be measured in billions, with a “B,” a scale unmatched by any competitor. The event concluded with a set from Lady Gaga, complete with costume changes and a full band. “Today, YouTube has become the epicenter of culture,” Mohan said. “And I don't mean short-lived fads or a one-off hit show. I mean culture with a capital ‘C.' The place where day after day, year after year, the events, conversations and voices that define the moment break through.”

	











	Of course, YouTube's immense scale is also the source of the most grumbling from its studio and streaming competitors. Many YouTube creators view the studio executives as gatekeepers, the old guard that once held sway over what got made and what didn't. Studio executives, meanwhile, dismiss YouTube and its growth as something less than the sum of its parts. Sure, there are big channels operated by traditional media companies, and some creators are doing good work, but in terms of raw numbers, most content uploaded to the platform is anything but premium.


	“There's still a perception, particularly in the traditional space around YouTube and YouTube culture, that's probably looked down upon,” one high-level source who plays in both worlds says. “I don't think the audience gives a shit, or at least a segment of the audience, but I do think there's a little bit of a hump to overcome there.”


	Yes, Mark Rober is shooting rockets into space, and Kinigra Deon is filming original fantasy shows, but videos about fixing your dishwasher and a three-hour feed of a hike through a wooded trail are there right next to them. There are clips from Last Week Tonight but also clips from classic David Letterman episodes, baseball games from the 1970s, gamers playing Fortnite and New Year's Eve ball drops from 1956.


	It's a hotbed of creativity “but it's also, frankly, just a reflection of humanity,” Mohan says.


	While a platform like HBO carefully curates its content, YouTube has something for everyone and bets that it can use its algorithm to deliver the right content to the right people at the right time.

	











	But the scale of the platform is also why many creators have sought to leverage their reach to move beyond it. “The value for [YouTube] is the platform over the individuals. No one individual, not even MrBeast, really moves the needle for them,” one source says.


	It's a big reason why creators are leaning into consumer products like snacks and skin care creams and why people like Mann and Ms. Rachel are also licensing their content to such platforms as Netflix and Samsung TV Plus. “I've always felt that it's easier to turn an audience into dollars than dollars into an audience, and so you might as well start where someone already has an audience if you want to run a successful business,” one creator says. For creators, it's about minimizing risk, though YouTube can (and does) frame it as a positive. “The beauty of the YouTube model is you control your own destiny,” Mohan says. “You own the content, you're not licensing the content. It's yours, you get to choose how you want to monetize it.”


	Sitting on a stool on the stage in the Google New York office after the creator event, Mohan was asked by Max Klymenko, who hosts a show called Career Ladder, whether the emergence of “creators” as a career has changed his approach personally as an executive. Mohan responds in the affirmative, noting the studios that people like Deon and Mann have built. “It's personally very important for me to not just continue to grow this creator ecosystem, but for it to actually be a viable, respectable and sustainable career path for lots of young people in this country and really, all over the world,” he says.

	











	The moment Mohan realized that the combination of YouTube's creators and the NFL's live games could work well together was at a league owners meeting, where the CEO had brought Mark Rober to explain what he does to the attendees.


	“All the NFL owners are there, Roger and his team are there, and all the young people there — the kids and the grandkids — they were obviously interested in the athletes, but they swarmed Mark rover as soon as he got off stage,” Mohan recalls. “For me, that was when it clicked, these YouTubers are a phenomenon into themselves … I knew at that moment that this bet between the NFL and YouTube was going to have this greater magic to it.”


	Viewers of the Brazil game got a taste of what's possible: “Watch With” parties saw creators provide their own live commentary, in something akin to ESPN's Manningcast. It doesn't take much to imagine a future where games have dozens, or even hundreds, of creator commentary options. The platform has also used its relationship to get creators access to the field, to locker rooms, to places that in the recent past would have been off-limits.


	“I feel like the ecosystem is really blending, the creators have built a new lane in terms of the content they're making, where each creator is their own production company and making their own sports content, and now they're merging more and more with traditional sports,” says Jesser.

	











	Many of YouTube's most popular creators release sports-adjacent content weekly, from Dude Perfect to Deestroying, Jesser to iShowSpeed. But in a move that has raised the eyebrows of Hollywood executives, YouTube has been getting into business with the leagues more directly.


	When YouTube cut a deal to pay the NFL about $2 billion annually for the NFL Sunday Ticket streaming service in 2022, it stunned the TV business, signaling that it was serious about sports – the last frontier of traditional TV domination. In addition to the NFL, sources say that YouTube has been in the mix for several major sports rights over the last year or so.


	Mohan acknowledges that he was “nervous” ahead of the Brazil game. “It was a really big moment for YouTube, it was a really big moment for our partners in the NFL,” he recalls. Luckily, the telecast went off without any technical hitches, drawing a solid 17.3 million viewers. “I joined my wife and some friends at a barbecue at a neighbor's house afterwards and just had this sense of relief in terms of how smooth and well things went.”


	“They've been terrific partners. They brought us a new audience,” Goodell says. “They bring incredible production value. These creators are really an element that has been very well received by our fans — and new fans — people who want to get involved in the game.”


	So why pay for exclusive rights and production costs, in contrast to almost all other content on the platform?

	











	“The nice thing about sports is, if you use that term creator in the broadest sense, the NFL is a creator of content, it's not something that we're scripting,” Mohan says. “I think in a fundamental sense, it's about the fact that we have hundreds of millions of sports fans on the platform, and it's a really important vertical of content, and we want to be super-serving our fans.”


	Indeed, the NFL may be the biggest programming on TV, but the league, like YouTube, wants more. More female fans, more international fans, and younger fans that can ensure that the league can thrive 50 years down the line.


	And the league increasingly views the creator ecosystem that YouTube has sustained as a bridge to that younger audience. “I think teams and leagues see the value in the reach that content creators have,” says sports creator Katie Feeney. “The goal is always to build a new audience, to reach new eyes. I'm a Gen Z creator, my target demo is in that 18 to 24 demographic, which is a sweet spot for sports, and especially when you're looking to build a new fan base, this is the new generation.”


	“It's very clear that the young fan in particular wants to consume the live game, is interested in the athletes, but oftentimes they want to consume the highlights, the postgame and pregame commentary during the week through their favorite YouTubers and creators,” says Mohan.


	It's a fact not lost on Goodell either. “The thing that always impresses me is how smart they are, how creative they are, and the detail they put into their production,” he says of the creators he has met with.

	











	NFL games garner tens of millions of viewers every week, and the Super Bowl is a veritable national holiday, topping 100 million viewers handily year after year. The NBA has become a focal point of American culture, while the brutalism of UFC is appealing to a larger audience year after year.


	All of those leagues (not to mention media partners like ESPN) have turned to YouTube as the home base for clips and highlights, but live games are the final frontier, the glue holding the traditional TV ecosystem together.


	If YouTube does supplant what we think of as “TV” today, there's a good chance that the Brazil game is a pivot point. And the platform's creators, many of whom have felt the sting of the traditional studio system, certainly have no qualms about embracing that future, one that blends professional production and creator-driven content in surprising ways. 


	“Prior to [YouTube], the only way to get a show made was to walk into a room of people wearing suits, hope that they like it enough to give it a pilot, hope that they like the pilot enough to give it a season, hope that they put marketing budget behind it so people know to watch it,” says Michelle Khare, whose series, Challenge Accepted, pushes the boundaries of what is possible on the platform in terms of the quality of its production. “Systematically, that is a system that has failed a lot of people and only allowed so many stories to be told. I'm excited to be part of a future where the only barrier to entry is the upload button.”

The cuts come ahead of Comcast's Versant spinoff, which will see MSNBC and CNBC cleaved off from the rest of the NBC News Group.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	Layoffs hit NBC News on Wednesday, with the network news division facing cuts ahead of Comcast's spinoff of Versant. About 150 jobs were eliminated, representing about 2 percent of the workforce of the NBC News Group.


	The cuts were across the News Group, without specific teams being targeted.




	The Versant spin will see MSNBC and CNBC separated from NBC News. NBC News, MSNBC and CNBC are currently all part of the NBC News Group, led by Cesar Conde.


	Per a source, the cuts were driven by the fact that NBC News will no longer be providing newsgathering capabilities for CNBC and MSNBC, as well as broader concerns around the overall economic environment for the media sector.

	That said, NBC News is shifting resources to other areas, including the forthcoming subscription offering, and new areas of coverage like sports. The division currently has about 140 open job postings, and impacted staff are being encouraged to apply for those roles.

	“Coming off the successful creation of our new daily podcast Here's the Scoop, we are preparing to launch our NBC News subscription service later this year that will feature the best of our coverage and include new premium offerings,” Conde wrote in a note to staff last week. “NBC News is expanding its new Sports Hub, in partnership with NBC Sports, with the NBA returning to NBC, as well as the Milan Olympics, the Super Bowl, and the World Cup on Telemundo. And to support the leading position of NBC News, we will be launching a marketing campaign soon that will reinforce our reputation for rigorous fact-based reporting that is indispensable and accessible across all platforms for all, the first such campaign in modern memory.”

	











	NBC News employees impacted by the cuts are being given 60 days' notice, as well as a severance package and outplacement services.

Tuesday night saw each celebrity perform a special tribute dance, with contestants choosing to honor their parents, siblings, former co-stars, romantic partners and children.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



[This story contains spoilers from episode five of Dancing With the Stars season 34.]


	It was an emotional night in the Dancing With the Stars ballroom for Dedication Night, and to make the night even sweeter, no one was eliminated from the competition at the end of the episode.




	Each celebrity performed a special tribute dance to honor of someone in their life, delivering 10 emotional routines in honor of the cast's parents, siblings, former co-stars, romantic partners and children. (Read who the professional dancers would dedicate their own number to here.)

	Former professional dancer Kym Herjavec also returned to the ballroom, serving as the first official guest judge of the season.


	Finishing out the fifth week of season 34, the cast is noticeably dwindling down. Hilaria Baldwin was eliminated at the end of last week's Disney Night, making her the fourth contestant to exit the competition. No one was eliminated at the end of Dedication Night, meaning the remaining cast composed of 10 couples all moved onto the sixth week of competition.


	The remaining celebrities include Secret Lives of Mormon Wives stars Jen Affleck and Whitney Leavitt, Olympian Jordan Chiles, social media star Alix Earle, The Traitors season three winner (and Zac Efron's brother) Dylan Efron, actresses Danielle Fishel and Elaine Hendrix, Pentatonix's Scott Hoying, conservationist (and son of Steve Irwin) Robert Irwin and comedian-actor Andy Richter.

	











	Richter kicked off the night with an adorable salsa alongside his daughter. One of the most highly anticipated numbers of Dedication Night was Irwin's contemporary to Phil Collins' “You'll Be in My Heart,” which he devoted to his mother, Terri Irwin. And it proved to be a memorable one, as he earned his first three nines of the season, ending with a total score of 35/40 (after sending the entire ballroom into tears).


	Fishel dedicated her jive set to the Boy Meets World theme song to her former co-star William Daniels, also known as Mr. Feeny on the series. The performance landed the actress her first eight of the competition.


	Leavitt emerged as an early frontrunner during the first half of the competition, placing as the top-scoring couple for four consecutive episodes. Disney Night was the first time she and Mark Ballas pulled ahead as the only couple to place at the top of the leaderboard, and they notably earned the season's first nine. 


	However, Efron ended her top-scoring streak on Dedication Night, becoming the first celebrity to earn four nines, one from each of the judges. The Traitors winner performed his dance in honor of his little sister set to the tune of his elder brother, Zac, and Zendaya's song “Rewrite the Stars.” Trailing close behind Efron were Irwin and Earle, who both respectively scored 35/40 points.


	At the end of (most) nights of the competition, the couple with the lowest combined total of judges' scores and viewer votes is eliminated. Live voting takes place during the East Coast airing of each show and ends shortly after the final dance is completed.

	











	See the full list of scores for week five of DWTS season 34 (aka Dedication Night) below. 


	Andy Richter and Emma Slater: 24/40Robert Irwin and Witney Carson: 35/40Elaine Hendrix and Alan Bersten: 30/40Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas: 33/40Jen Affleck and Jan Ravnik: 29/40Dylan Efron and Daniella Karagach: 36/40Jordan Chiles and Ezra Sosa: 32/40Scott Hoying and Rylee Arnold: 30/40Danielle Fishel and Pasha Pashkov: 29/40Alix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy: 35/40


	Season 34 of DWTS airs and streams simultaneously on ABC and Disney+ on Tuesdays, with new episodes available to stream on Wednesdays on Hulu.

The Latin star surprised the world in 2022 when he announced his retirement — but now he's back, with a renewed faith and a commitment to make ""music with a purpose.""


													By
												

	Leila Cobo


Chief Content Officer Latin/Español, Billboard


At some point during the past turbulent months, as he searched for purpose and faced the pressures of a very public divorce that engulfed both his personal and professional life, the music stopped for Raymond Ayala.


	“For the first time in my life, the muse shut down,” says the man long known as Daddy Yankee. “That had never happened to me before. Ever.”

	











	It wasn't supposed to be like this. In 2022, Daddy Yankee — that rare artist who has garnered both vast commercial success and respect from artists and the industry alike — surprised the world when he announced his retirement from music. He released what was supposed to be his last studio album, Legendaddy, and performed what was set to be his last tour, grossing $197.8 million and selling 1.9 million tickets, then the second-highest-grossing Latin tour in Billboard Boxscore history. But Ayala was spent.


	Then, on Dec. 3, 2023, at the tour's final date at Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot in San Juan, he made yet another shocking revelation: “Tonight, I recognize, and I'm not ashamed to tell the whole world, that Jesus lives in me and I live for him,” he told the 15,000 fans that packed his hometown venue. “A story ends and a new story begins.”


	Ayala immediately started spreading the word of the Lord, in music and in deed. He released songs brimming with positivity, traveled on missions to Africa, made impromptu appearances in churches in Puerto Rico and other Latin countries and saw firsthand the reaction to his new brand of “music with a purpose,” culminating with a Latin Grammy win for best urban song for “Bonita” (Pretty), a non-album single released in 2023.

	











	But in December 2024, Ayala's wife of nearly 30 years filed for divorce, and an initially amicable split turned sour amid a spate of legal disputes over his many businesses and assets, including his past catalog negotiations. Making music became even more difficult.


	“But it was part of the process to arrive at a total dependency on God,” Ayala now says. “He said, ‘Even if your muse is gone, remember, I am your muse. I am your inspiration.' Today, I'm making music and I'm building a new catalog.”


	I'm chatting with Ayala in a private dining room at a Brooklyn hotel — his first interview with the press since he announced his conversion to Christianity — over tea and fruit. He is 49 years old, but his trim physique (later, he'll go to the gym with pal J Balvin) and youthful, unlined face display none of the travails of an artist who grew up in Puerto Rico's housing projects and whose music career was jump-started by a gunshot to the leg that ended a promising baseball run.


	As Daddy Yankee, Ayala is widely recognized as the man who catapulted reggaetón from underground genre to global movement, in large part thanks to his 2004 smash, “Gasolina,” and the relentless string of global hits that followed. Today, he has 105 entries — including seven No. 1s — on the Hot Latin Songs chart, among them “Despacito” alongside Luis Fonsi and his most recent, “Sonríele” (Smile), which is currently charting. At the time of publication, Daddy Yankee was the No. 37 most listened-to artist on Spotify despite the fact that he has released only a few singles in the past two years.


	That is a testament to the power of the name and the man. “Without Daddy Yankee, there would be no J Balvin,” Balvin says. “He was, and continues to be, the source of inspiration that has so propelled me to elevate urban music to a global level.”

	











	Now Ayala has embarked on a dramatically different second act, with Jesus as a centerpiece and the goal of releasing music that's commercially successful but is “music with a purpose,” as he calls it, rather than religious music with evangelical lyrics.


	“Having a life of success is different from having a life of purpose,” Ayala replies when I ask what prompted his conversion and the ensuing shift in direction. “Before, my interest was transforming the industry [through music], and that purpose had to do more with business and money, influence, success. Now my purpose is to transform lives with that same instrument. They're very different purposes.”


	But the vehicle is still the same. On Oct. 23, Ayala will perform as Daddy Yankee at the Billboard Latin Music Awards, his first televised performance in three years. And he will release Lamento En Baile (Mourning Into Dancing), his first album since 2022 — and his first since publicly converting – on Oct. 16. The title comes from Psalm 30:11, which says, “You have turned my mourning into dancing,” and dovetails with its first focus track, “Sonríele,” a peppy merengue brimming with optimism.


	It's the first track Ayala has released under DY Publishing, as well as the first step in rebuilding his catalog. In October 2024, Concord purchased key elements of his music publishing and master-recording catalog, including chart-topping hits “Gasolina,” “Con Calma” and “Despacito.” According to Concord's website and Billboard reports, the agreement encompasses work from 2002 through 2019 and includes certain name, image and likeness rights. Prior to that acquisition, Billboard reported that parts of his catalog had been quietly acquired around 2021 by Cinq Music and a private fund that asked not to be named, which then sold those assets to Concord. (Concord, Cinq and Ayala himself decline to comment about specifics of the deals.)

	











	“Someone like [Daddy Yankee], someone who is as prolific as he is productive, we imagine it will happen fairly quickly,” says Jorge Mejía, president/CEO of Sony Music Publishing Latin America and U.S. Latin, which continues to administer all songs written by Ayala for the world. “This is not an unusual situation for us. Artists inevitably evolve throughout their careers — growth, change and reinvention are all part of the creative journey.”


	Ayala is releasing his new music on his own DY Records through a license deal with HYBE Latin America, which announced the signing in July in tandem with the release of “Sonríele” and is betting big on Daddy Yankee as its first major and established artist. “Obviously, partnering with [Daddy Yankee] is extremely important for us,” HYBE Latin America COO Juan Sebastián Arenas says. “We're partnering with a music icon, supporting a new project. Our goal is to tell the industry we're here to do something new. There's no one better than [him] to accomplish that.”


	Likewise, in HYBE, Ayala found a label partner that's young (HYBE Latin America launched in 2023), inquisitive and eager to break molds. This summer, Ayala, who has a big following in Asia, went to South Korea for the first time and shot the video to his upcoming single “El Toque,” incorporating elements of Korean dance.


	“I am my own manager now and I'm managing myself 100% alone, and I have good allies,” Ayala says. “HYBE is a good ally. They have a progressive mentality and they're in constant reinvention. That's very compatible with my new vision.”


If you listen closely, it's clear the seeds of Ayala's conversion were planted in his music long ago. On 2007's “Coraza Divina” (Divine Shield), for example, an autobiographic rap set over salsa tumbao that narrates his rise from the hood, he named a higher power: “Evil realized he was the chosen child and sought to destroy him/But you know what? I have a divine shield, the power to light my path,” he says in the chorus.


	“Many people don't know that I converted to the Lord for the first time at 19 years old,” Ayala says. “But I diverged from the path. My lyrics were clean, but I knew they belonged to the world, [not to God].”

	











	Still, in a genre rife with sexually graphic lyrics that often glorify drugs and violence, Ayala always stood out as a rapper with a conscience who delivered mostly G-rated material, but nevertheless oozed swagger and braggadocio. The strategy let him open the door for reggaetón to find success among mainstream Latin audiences and beyond: He was the first Latin urban artist to consistently place hit songs on radio when that medium was the key driver to success.


	But clearly, the content of Ayala's music went deeper than a commercial play. On 2004's Barrio Fino, the breakout album that includes “Gasolina,” there were tracks that referenced God and resilience. It's a theme that appears again and again in his work — through to 2016, when, unbeknown to the public, he privately converted. He didn't announce it, he says, “because I had many agreements I had signed and committed to” — label deals, recordings with other artists, brand deals, a major tour — “and I had to deliver.”


	Ayala is known for keeping his word. He's a man of habit and discipline: makes his bed every morning, works out, reads, eats healthy, goes to the studio, repeats. As the “Big Boss” of reggaetón and the urban movement itself, he couldn't conceive of not fulfilling his contractual obligations. So he kept his allegiance to Christ to himself, until that 2023 show where he told the world about his new path.


	“I wanted to get to where I am now and not owe anything to anyone,” he says. “I wanted to be in peace and complete liberty.”

	











	And he was, for a while.


Daddy Yankee's reentry into the world of music as an artist led by faith in Jesus initially appeared seamless. He returned with the single “Bonita,” an uptempo reggaetón fused with horns and merengue that was all about positivity and happiness.


	It was the first of a handful of tracks distributed through SoundOn, TikTok's distribution and marketing platform, prior to his HYBE deal, and it benefited from TikTok support and exposure. Users have created over 1.2 million videos with “Bonita,” which generated over 1.1 billion views, and Daddy Yankee-posted content got more than 48.5 million likes, 1.7 million comments and over 3.8 million shares.


	The fact was, Ayala had announced his retirement from music in 2022. “The perception was that Yankee had retired and [now] we wanted to say he hadn't,” says Gabriel Llano, head of artist services for U.S. Latin and Latin America at SoundOn at TikTok. “When he made this musical shift, we wanted users to take those songs of his with positive messages to tell their own stories.”


	After “Bonita,” Ayala released “Donante de Sangre,” a rap track where he addressed his conversion head-on for the first time. The song, which was also a metaphor for life, was used for a Red Cross blood donation campaign in Mexico, adding a dimension of social good to his new music.


	Other like-minded singles trickled out, even as, in October 2024, Concord announced its purchase of parts of Daddy Yankee's catalog. Then, on Dec. 2, 2024, Ayala made yet another surprise announcement.


	“After more than two decades of marriage and after many months of trying to save my marriage, which my wife and I share, today my lawyers respond to the divorce petition received [from] Mireddys,” he wrote in a letter shared to Instagram, referring to Mireddys González, his longtime wife and high school sweetheart. “I'm grateful for the time we shared, full of blessings and values, of love and with a beautiful family that will continue to be our priority.”


	González was not only Ayala's wife but also the president of his label, El Cartel Records, and a member of its board of directors. Within weeks of the divorce announcement, on Dec. 17, Ayala filed two legal motions seeking an injunction against González and her sister Ayeicha González-Castellanos (El Cartel's secretary/treasurer), alleging they withdrew tens of millions of dollars from his business bank accounts without authorization, according to court documents.

	











	It was the first of a series of back-and-forth complaints, some of which are still in litigation, that have been reported widely by the press and touch many aspects of Ayala's career and assets, including information surrounding the initial sale of catalog assets in 2021.


	Although the cases are public, Ayala has not spoken about them — save for perfunctory comments as he's gone in and out of court in Puerto Rico — and he declined to answer questions now. But he has definitely learned some things.


	“Be on top of everything, even if you have lawyers and accountants,” Ayala says. “Now I'm alone, so I have to be 100% [involved]. Things I used to delegate, I don't delegate anymore. It's my responsibility, and I feel good and I feel I've learned so much more. You think you know everything about the music business and the rules keep changing. The smallest things can make a great difference.”


	And, he cautions new artists, male and female: “Even if you're not famous or successful and your career is only beginning, get married with a prenup. Music is unpredictable.”


Whatever challenges Ayala has faced over the course of his lengthy career, they've been impossible to discern from the outside. Through the years he's been unflappable, even-keeled, scandal-free. He has never even been attacked on social media — a feat in this day and age. But the past year shook him up.

	











	“I've always taken good care of myself, [but now] I've learned to give myself more self-love,” he muses when I ask what he has taken from this experience. “It's very important to be clear on what self-love is and establish limits. All kinds of healthy limits. Learn how to say no. I learned that we sacrifice ourselves for many people, and you do it so much that you normalize it. And that's not the way it should be. You need to set limits. I've learned to be more assertive.”


	When I point out I always found him assertive, he nods. “I've always been assertive with those outside my close circle. But you also need to set limits on those close to you.”


	And eventually, Ayala learned how to make music again.


	“I never thought I'd be in this situation, but I found myself in it,” he says. “And the strength I found to record an album full of joy in the most unexpected moment of my life is what helped me regain my strength. When we're in the middle of a crisis, one of our biggest fortitudes lies in adoring and praising the Lord because it brings joy.”


	Despite the change in content and the change in purpose, Ayala intends to tackle the marketing and promotion of his “music with a purpose” with every tool at his disposal, something that has proved tricky in the Latin world for religious artists who previously made secular music. Many Latin acts, particularly from Puerto Rico, are devout Christians but don't share their beliefs in their music. And many others have publicly announced their conversions and released evangelical music with mixed results.


	“From a programming perspective … it will all depend on the lyrics,” iHeartLatino senior vp of programming Pedro Javier González says. “Yankee is being smart in how he's handling it. He knows he has global impact and is looking for the best way to take the message without alienating anyone. Up to now, it's been positive lyrics that don't sound religious. A lot of people are looking for this kind of content.”


	HYBE's Arenas agrees. “HYBE likes to send positive messages to the world, and I do see a trend coming with inspirational music, music that has undertones of faith,” he says. “We've seen it in the Anglo world, and we're starting to see it in Latin as well. I think there's an audience for these fans, but the right platform for the music hasn't existed before.”


	For Ayala, it's simply part of who he is now.

	











	“Everyone who's inside the faith has to go to the world and preach the gospel,” he says, an obligation that applies to all, not just pastors or evangelizers. “I can't simply convert and stay silent, you know? This isn't simply making Christian music; the challenge is to make the kingdom part of pop culture. My vision [in the past] was to transform the industry when they told me I couldn't. Now I'm in the same situation with a different purpose: revolutionize and reinvent.”

The album breaks the modern-era records for most albums sold and units earned in a single week.

	The first-week numbers for Taylor Swift's new album, The Life of a Showgirl, are, expectedly, massive. But even for an artist who has spent nearly two decades breaking her own records, these numbers are on another level entirely.


The Life of a Showgirl posts the biggest debut of the modern era (1991–present), shattering records for both single-week sales and equivalent album units (on the latest charts dated Oct. 18). Every single one of its 12 songs lands in the top 12 of the Billboard Hot 100 — a feat no artist has ever achieved before. And with this latest sweep, Swift has now occupied the entire top 10 of the Hot 100 three separate times. No other artist in history has done it even once.


	Those accomplishments alone would be enough to define most careers, but for Swift, they're just the beginning of another historic week. Across Billboard's album, song and genre charts, The Life of a Showgirl resets the record books — from streaming milestones to vinyl sales to chart longevity benchmarks.


	With the charts officially locked in, it's worth looking closer at just how many records this album breaks. She also makes historic starts at radio and sets a new mark for the most streamed song in a single week in the post-UGC era (2020-present).


	Below, we've rounded up every major Billboard chart record Swift breaks this week — and a few she extends even further — thanks to The Life of a Showgirl. Let's dive in.

The Life of a Showgirl earns Swift her 15th No. 1 album on the Billboard 200. She breaks out of a tie with Drake and Jay-Z for the most of all time among soloists. Among all artists, only the Beatles have more, with 19.


	Here's a look at the acts with the most No. 1 albums since the Billboard 200 began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in March 1956.


Showgirl earned 4.002 million equivalent album units in the United States in its opening week (Oct. 3-9), according to Billboard's data tracker Luminate, the largest weekly sum for an album since Billboard began ranking the week's most popular albums by that metric on the Billboard 200 in December 2014.


	Here's a recap of the top 10 biggest weeks, by units, since December 2014.


Rank, Artist, Title, Units, Chart Date


Showgirl sold 3,479,500 copies in pure album sales in its first week (purchases of digital downloads, CDs, vinyl LPs and cassette tapes). That is the single largest sales week for an album since 1991, when Luminate began electronically tracking music sales.


	Here's a recap of the top 10 biggest selling weeks by albums in the modern era (1991-present), ranked in order by sales volume.


Rank, Artist, Title, Sales, Chart Date


	Of Showgirl's 3,479,500 copies sold in its opening week, 1.334 million were sold on vinyl — the most sold in a single week in the modern era for an album on vinyl.


	Here's a look at the top 10 biggest selling weeks by albums on vinyl in the modern era (1991-present), ranked in order by sales volume.


Rank, Artist, Title, Sales, Chart Date


	“The Fate of Ophelia,” the lead single from The Life of a Showgirl, raked in 92.5 million official U.S. streams in its opening week, according to Luminate. That's the most single-week streams for a song since Billboard removed all user-generated-content streams from its streaming tabulation on Sept. 19, 2020. Before that, UGC streams factored into Billboard's streaming methodology, and therefore, the Hot 100.


	Here's a look at the top 10 songs with the most official streams in the U.S. in a single week in the post-UGC era:


Rank, Artist, Title, Streams, Chart Date


Showgirl earns Swift her 16th No. 1 on Top Album Sales, extending her record for the most since the chart launched in 1991. Here's an updated look at the artists with the most No. 1s:


Showgirl is Swift's 14th No. 1 on Vinyl Albums, extending her record for the most since the chart launched in 2011. Here's an updated look at the artists with the most No. 1s:


	Swift debuts all 12 tracks from Showgirl in the top 12 of the Hot 100, upping her career totals to the following:


	Swift holds the records for all seven of those categories among women. Among all artists, only Drake has more, with 25 top two hits, 32 top three hits, 43 top five hits, 69 top 10 hits, 140 top 20 hits, 218 top 40 hits and 361 overall entries.


	“The Fate of Ophelia” earns Swift her 13th career No. 1 song on the Hot 100, and eighth in the 2020s. She breaks out of a tie with Drake and Ariana Grande for the most leaders this decade so far. Here's an updated look at the artists with the most No. 1s in the 2020s:


	“The Fate of Ophelia” debuts at No. 8 on the Pop Airplay radio chart — the first top 10 arrival in the chart's 33-year history. It passes two hits that each started at a prior No. 12 best: Swift's own “Shake It Off” (Sept. 6, 2014) and Mariah Carey's “Dreamlover” (Aug. 14, 1993).


	“The Fate of Ophelia” debuts at No. 8 on the Adult Pop Airplay radio chart — the highest debut in the chart's nearly 30-year history. It also becomes Swift's record-extending 33rd top 10 at the format. She also debuts five other songs on the ranking this week, upping her career count to a record-extending 54 entries.


	All 12 Showgirl tracks occupy the top 10 spots of this week's Streaming Songs chart, upping Swift's counts to 17 top two hits, 24 top three hits, 36 top five hits, 68 top 10s and 191 entries. These are all the most among women and second-most overall, after Drake.


	Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia” becomes Swift's sixth No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200, lifting her past Ariana Grande for the most among women in the chart's five-year history. She also passes Drake for the most top five hits (23) and top 10s (42) and extends her record for the most overall entries with 188.


	Swift passes Bad Bunny for the most top five and top 10 hits on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart, upping her totals to 14 and 29, respectively. She also extends her record for the most overall entries to 167.

Through the development of new AI search tools, Musixmatch hopes to open up a new revenue stream for publishers and songwriters. 


													By
												

	Kristin Robinson


Senior Writer


	Musixmatch, a lyric and music data company, has inked a series of AI-based licensing deals with Sony Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group and Warner Chappell Music, the three major music publishers. Done on a trial basis, this will now allow Musixmatch access to the majors' catalogs to develop AI tools, and as part of the agreement, the publishers will receive remuneration.


	According to a source close to the deal, a few examples of what these AI tools could become include a large language model (LLM) for song lyrics and metadata, strictly gated and geared toward music business professionals who can use it to search through catalogs more easily.


	With this, a film/tv company looking for the perfect song to license could ask for romantic songs or songs about protest from a certain time period. Other use cases for this type of technology could be analysis of trends in culture, like, asking “Why are love songs in decline over the last few decades?” or “What consumer brands were most frequently referenced in song lyrics last year?”


	Musixmatch might also use these trial licenses to develop AI tools for financial analysis and reporting to track the performance of a catalog over time. Prompts could include something like, “Show me my earnings in the U.S. on all streaming services from the beginning of this year and compare that to all sales from the beginning of this year.”


	Lastly, the licenses could unlock Musixmatch's ability to create motion artwork based on songs in the dataset. 


	This new announcement signals the opening of a possible new revenue stream for music publishers and Musixmatch, which, to date, is best known for its role in providing accurate, authorized lyrics to streaming and social media services like Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, Google, Amazon Music, iHeart Radio and Instagram. To date, the Bologna, Italy-based company has partnered with over 225,000 publishers and nearly 3 million songwriters.


	“We're looking forward to this collaboration with our trusted partners to build and share entirely new revenue streams together,” says Musixmatch founder/ CEO Massimo Ciociola. “Put simply: without songwriters, there can be no music industry. These agreements will ensure the writers of today and tomorrow are compensated for their creative works, not only in today's marketplace, but also in the dynamic, AI-powered world that is rapidly emerging. Our long-standing partnerships with rights owners enable us to confidently build new services that will properly compensate songwriters while delivering value to music publishers and all who recognize the power of a song to move culture and provide meaning to our world.”

IAG founder Irving Azoff announced the news at a Bloomberg summit.

	Melinda Newman



	Iconic Artists Group (IAG) has acquired a portion of the Frank Sinatra estate.


	IAG founder Irving Azoff revealed the news about the legendary singer while speaking at Bloomberg's Screentime Conference, held Oct. 8-9 in Los Angeles. As first reported by Bloomberg on Sunday (Oct. 12), Azoff said Iconic “recently acquired a chunk of the Sinatra estate.”  


	Frank Sinatra Enterprises (FSE) confirmed the deal in a statement to Billboard: “Frank Sinatra Enterprises, Tina Sinatra, and Warner Music Group are delighted to welcome Irving Azoff and Iconic to the dedicated team serving the life's work and legacy of Frank Sinatra.” 


	In 2007, Sinatra's family and Warner Music Group (WMG) formed Frank Sinatra Enterprises, a global partnership to manage all aspects of Sinatra's career, as well as his name and likeness. The deal also included ownership of Sinatra's recordings from his Reprise era. Sinatra started Reprise, which is now owned by WMG, in 1960. FSE also represents Sinatra's rights to his Columbia and Capitol catalogs.


	It is unclear how much of the estate IAG acquired. Azoff declined to comment beyond his Screentime remarks, as did FSE beyond its statement. WMG also declined to comment.


	The deal comes nearly three years after Iconic made an agreement with the Dean Martin Family Trust to manage and expand the fellow Rat Packer's legacy. The deal included name, image and likeness, as well as the trust's share of Martin's Capitol and Reprise Records sound recordings, feature films, and Martin's variety shows and specials.


	During Azoff's Q&A at Bloomberg, moderator Lucas Shaw, Bloomberg's managing editor of media and entertainment, also asked Azoff what he considers the most valuable catalog in the world. “I normally would have said The Beatles, but I'm not sure that's true anymore,” Azoff said. “You maybe gotta say Taylor [Swift] at this point.”


	IAG works with a number of other artists and estates, including The Beach Boys, Linda Ronstadt, Cher, Rod Stewart and Nat King Cole, among others. Azoff told Bloomberg‘s Shaw that The Beach Boys' revenue has doubled since IAG got involved in their business.

The rapper paid loving tribute to the neo soul icon who died at 51 on Tuesday (Oc. 14) following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



Lauryn Hill and D'Angelo were like twin stars birthing a new R&B universe in the late 1990s. The pair released just one collaboration, 1998's sensual, seductive “Nothing Even Matters” from Hill's Grammy-winning debut solo album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, but the song, and their friendship, clearly made a huge impression on the former Fugees rapper/singer.

	











	In an emotional post paying homage to D'Angelo in the wake of the singer's death at 51 on Tuesday (Oct. 14) due to pancreatic cancer, Hill lavished praise on D'Angelo for being a beacon of light for music, and fellow Black men, while lamenting that she didn't have more precious moments with the enigmatic “Brown Sugar” star.


	“People need reflection. I regret not having more time with you. Your undeniable beauty and talent were not of this world, and a presence not of this world needs protection in a world that covets light and the anointing of God,” Hill wrote. “You sir, moved us, stirred us, inspired and even intimidated others to action with your genius.”


	She added, “Thank you for being a beacon of light to a generation and beyond who had no remembrance of the legacy that preceded us. Thank you for charting the course and for making space during a time when no similar space really existed.”


	Though D'Angelo only released three albums in his lifetime, his beloved 1995 debut, Brown Sugar, followed by 2000's Voodoo and 2014's Black Messiah, Hill wrote that the singer's aching vulnerability and incomparable passion moved, and inspired, the culture. “You imaged a unity of strength and sensitivity in Black manhood to a generation that only saw itself as having to be one or the other,” Hill wrote. 

	











	“It is my earnest prayer that you are in peace, far away from selfishness, fear and/or controlling interests,” she added. “Far from possessiveness, far from greed, far from manipulation, far from exploitation, far from intentionally designed chaos and that you Brother are in peace, in bliss and in eternal light and fulfillment with our Father in heaven. I Love you and I miss you. May God grant peace and shelter to your family, true friends and genuine appreciators, Brother, King.”


	The post included a series of pictures of D'Angelo in the studio, as well as a snap of the two musicians in which D is giving one of his classic pensive, knowing looks and Hill is smiling as the pair lean their heads together. In a 2008 interview with Rolling Stone, D'Angelo reflected on his studio time with Hill, calling her “warm and sweet” and revealing that the original plan was to show up on each other's projects.


	“Originally, we were going to swap tunes for each other's projects because I was working on Voodoo at the same time and my keyboardist James Poyser was also working with her,” he said at the time of the producer/songwriter who has been a member of the Roots since 2009 and who has produced and written songs for a constellation of neo soul giants including Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Common and others. “I went to her house in New Jersey, she played a lot of songs for me and gave me a rough copy to listen to. When Lauryn and I went into in the studio together, I laid down my vocals in the course of an hour.


	Hill joined an emotional chorus of friends, fans and fellow musicians who paid tribute to D'Angelo on Tuesday, a roster that included Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Tyler, the Creator, Missy Elliott, Doja Cat, DJ Premiere and many more.

	The Daniels' untitled movie is back on the Universal schedule, now set for Friday, Nov. 19, 2027. That's the Friday before Thanksgiving, which falls on Nov. 25 that year. 


	The next movie from the multi-Oscar winning Everything Everywhere All at Once duo is shrouded in secrecy. The movie's release will rep a little more than five years since Everything Everywhere All at Once hit theaters, that A24 title still anomaly at the specialty box office as theaters were fitting their footing roughly a year after their 2021 re-opening from Covid's closure. 


	The movie was originally scheduled for June 12, 2026 before being unset. The Daniels' movie takes the place of a reserved hold that Universal had on Nov. 19, 2027 for an untitled event movie. The pic is scheduled to open before Disney's Frozen 3 on Nov. 24, 2027. 

	











	Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert inked a five-year exclusive deal with Universal back in August 2022.

Everything Everywhere All at Once world premiered like a house on fire at SXSW in the spring of 2022 and went on to gross $77.1M domestic, $142.8M worldwide, becoming the highest grossing A24 theatrical release ever. 


Everything Everywhere All at Once won seven Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director for the Daniels, Best Actress for Michelle Yeoh, Supporting Actor for Ke Huy Quan and Supporting Actress for Jamie Lee Curtis.

	We've confirmed that Jim Carrey is in talks to star in Warner Bros.' live-action feature take of The Jetsons with Colin Trevorrow also eyeing to direct.

	One of Warners' more popular live-action takes of a Hanna-Barbera cartoon was Scooby-Doo which was released in 2002 and spawned a 2004 sequel, Scooby-Doo: Monsters Unleashed. Raja Gosnell directed both off a script by James Gunn (now Warner Bros' co-Head of DC). Freddie Prinze Jr starred as Fred, Sarah Michelle Gellar was Daphne, Matthew Lillard played Shaggy and Linda Cardellini broke out as Velma. Both movies grossed close to a half billion at the global box office. 


	Warners had no comment. Carrey, the No. 1 blockbuster star of original feature comedies in the 1990s and early aughts before those became extinct in the streaming era, has found success in franchises of late, specifically, Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog series playing villains Ivo Robotnik and, in the third installment, Gerald Robotnik. That trilogy had grossed north of $1.2 billion.

Wrong director!

KEVIN SPACELY OR BUST

Hear me out : RUPERT GRINT for George Jetson. Yes, he's only 37 but I feel like it could work really well. He fits the part (the hair! The vibe), has worked with WB on Harry Potter series…. He'd be an inspired choice. Cast Jim Carrey as the primary villain or as Spacely (and Danny Devito /Peter Dinklage as Spacey if not.) and boom. Maybe cast Samara Weaving or Isla Fisher as his wife??

WB should crack open the excellent Alexander and Karaszewski script that they wrote way-back-when for Turner Pictures – it's excellent.

He's a bit too old to play a father to a teenagers and little boy in my opinion . George is middle aged (in his 40s) in the show. But I'd watch Jim Carrey in any role so I won't complain. He'd be a better fit for Spacely.

Yeah, He would have been a great choice – 20 years ago. He's too old now for George I think. He may be too tall for Spaceley – maybe Cogswell?

	The eight-episode first season follows a mercenary (Sy) who embarks on a dangerous mission to rescue hostages in Libya. Trapped between warring factions and ruthless killers, he must navigate life-or-death choices while confronting deep emotional wounds. 


	The 2020 action thriller Extraction, directed by Sam Hargrave, was based on the graphic novel Ciudad by Ande Parks, with art by Fernando León González, and co-written by Joe and Anthony Russo. Hemsworth stars as an Australian black ops mercenary who takes on a mission to save an Indian drug lord's kidnapped son in Dhaka, Bangladesh, but the mission goes awry when he is double-crossed.

	











	A sequel, Extraction 2, was released in 2023, with the main cast reprising their roles. The movie brings back Hemsworth's Rake, who is tasked with a new mission — rescuing the battered family of a ruthless Georgian gangster from the prison where they are being held. AGBO produced both films.


	In addition to the Russo Brothers and Mazzara, executive producers include Angela Russo-Otstot, Scott Nemes, and Chris Castaldi for AGBO, Sam Hargrave, Eric Gitter, and Peter Schwerin, Netflix & AGBO: A Proven Partnership. Ari Costa produces for AGBO.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


UPDATED: NBC News went through a round of layoffs on Wednesday, impacting about 150 staffers, as the network cuts costs as it prepares for the split of most of Comcast's cable networks into Versant.


	The job reductions are scattered throughout NBC News. They represent about 2% of the NBCU News Group workforce and a single-digit percentage of NBC News, according to a source familiar with the plans. Status newsletter, the first to report on the pending cuts, put the figure at 7% of the network's workforce.


	The cuts were across the board, and included those to teams devoted to issues of diversity, but those online verticals, such as NBC Out and NBC Blk, will continue, a source said.

	Staffers are being told that the layoffs are taking place because NBC News no longer will be providing newsgathering for two networks, not just MSNBC but CNBC. The two networks will be part of the collection of cable channels under the Versant umbrella. Also cited is the economic climate, as linear networks have been trimming staffs amid advertising shifts to other platforms.

	The impacted employees, who are being informed of the elimination of their roles on Wednesday, will receive severance and outplacement services, and 60 days notification and benefits support, per the source. They will be able to apply for 140 openings across the newsgroup. About a dozen of the eliminated positions are being repurposed into new roles, and those laid off also can apply for those jobs.


	The NBC Digital News Guild, which represents staffers including reporters, editors and video journalists, has not received any official notice from management, a spokesperson said. In a statement, Susan DeCarava, president of The NewsGuild of New York, said, “What's clear: NBC management is prioritizing corporate profits at the expense of our hard-working members, without whom there would be no NBC News.”

	











	Comcast announced last year that it would spin off most of its cable networks, including MSNBC and CNBC, into a new company, later branded as Versant. The spinoff is expected to be completed by the end of the year, with MSNBC building up its own newsroom given that it no longer will have NBC News as a sister network.


	On Oct. 6, MSNBC no longer relied on NBC News correspondents and crews in their coverage, with the exception of Washington, D.C. operations. Those ties are expected to be severed next week, on Oct. 20. MSNBC also will be taking on a new name, MS NOW, or My Source, News-Opinion-World.


	In a memo to employees last week, Cesar Conde, chairman of the NBCU News Group, said that a planned NBC News subscription service will launch later this year, while NBC News will expand its sports hub as events like the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics and World Cup approach. He also said that NBC News would be launching a new marketing campaign. 


More to come.

If the layoffs were due to no longer needing to provide services for CNBC and MSNBC, then shouldnt there be growth jobs available at CNBC and MSNBC to manage those same functions?

Because CNBC and MSNBC are being phased out. Versant wasn't spun off to save legacy media, it was to manage the decline so Comcast could focus resources on new media acquisitions like CBS is doing with Bari Weiss.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Cult Of Criterion: Altered States","https://www.avclub.com/cult-of-criterion-altered-states","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

In Cult Of Criterion, The A.V. Club highlights a new release from The Criterion Collection each month, examining the films entering an increasingly accessible film canon.

When I started this column a year ago, I wanted to follow in the footsteps of some of my A.V. Club predecessors who helped highlight smaller, odder films that deserve to be remembered by those dipping their toes into cinephilia. At the same time, the series is an acknowledgement of The Criterion Collection (and its streaming service The Criterion Channel) as a modern establishment, one with the same kind of inviting, taken-with-a-grain-of-salt curation as some of the form's long-standing guide texts—the Sight & Sound polls or 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die or Roger Ebert's Great Movies or A Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies—and the same kind of surprising strangeness you might once have found browsing a video store's shelves, steered solely by vibes. Those films that split the difference between the canonized and the cuckoo are special. One of them, Masahiro Shinoda's Demon Pond, kicked off Cult Of Criterion last October. Now another, Ken Russell's Altered States, rings in its anniversary.

At first blush, the British oddball's first Hollywood film offers a wealth of respectable bonafides. William Hurt plays the lead in his debut role, fresh from the post-Juilliard stage. Paddy Chayefsky, one of the few screenwriters some people actually know by name, adapted his own novel for the script (before taking his name off the project). John Corigliano, who had just won a Guggenheim fellowship, was nominated for an Oscar for his first film score. Warner Bros. put the film out into theaters on Christmas. And yet, thanks to Russell—whose baroque work includes The Devils and The Lair Of The White Worm—it's all in service of a complete head trip, a seriously unserious turn-of-the-'80s reckoning with the countercultural self-experimentation of psychonauts like John C. Lilly. 

This contradiction is echoed in the text of the film: A tenured Harvard psychopathologist's woo-woo tendencies are brushed off by those who can't help but acknowledge his brilliance. For every blistering diatribe about truth and God, sometimes in the middle of a sex scene, there is a ridiculously brash image that pierces its academic veneer, like a seven-eyed goat Christ or a trippy tea-time. As the professor finds himself drawn again and again towards hallucinating in a sensory deprivation tank, his mind—and, eventually, body—unravels away from his colleagues and loved ones.

The subsequent sci-fi body horror, courtesy of makeup wizard Dick Smith and Chayefsky's earnest script, is a bit like Russell doing David Cronenberg. Released just one month before Scanners, Altered States is similarly devoted to dry, institutional dweebs justifying their doomed, id-driven experiments with endless jargon until the façade bursts and wet, goopy truth breaks free.

But even removed from the era-specific observations around trendy, intellectualized drug use, Altered States contains unflattering universal truths. One doesn't have to be well-versed in the history of psilocybin—appropriated in America after a couple enthusiasts convinced an Indigenous Mexican shaman to let them participate in a traditional religious ceremony, then blew up her spot in Life magazine—to appreciate the plot points and arcs typical to white guys with no real problems ruining their lives. 

The passions of Eddie Jessup (Hurt) are balanced by two excellent colleagues—Bob Balaban as his moony tripsitter and Charles Haid as his frustrated Southern naysayer—and his hyper-rational anthropologist wife (Blair Brown), all sticking by his side despite his diminishing grasp on reality. Decades later, the film evokes the contemporary, myopic, smug self-assurance of alternative medicine types, of supplement grifters, of ayahuasca ceremonies turned into tourist traps. In Altered States‘ Eddie, one sees a familiar kind of man: A man fleeing the world in front of him, and, to save his ego, reframing this retreat as a pursuit, one of a greater wisdom that exists outside of convention. This is Aaron Rodgers if he took so many drugs that he monkeyfied himself.

Yes, Eddie's physical reversion into a more primate-like form is just one ridiculous element of a film that takes what initially seems like a one-sided, Prince Of Darkness-like battle between science and religion, and turns it into a silly-sweet episode of The X-Files where a goofy creature runs amok and love saves the day. It's also not the only nutty prosthetic Smith crafts for Altered States. In any given frame, Eddie could look totally normal, like a Geico caveman, or like the worm-headed Bib Fortuna from Star Wars (you know, the guy who's coworkers with Salacious Crumb).

These are just the most physical ways that Russell manifests the hopes and fears of a generation of mind-expanders. In garish montages, Russell sticks his protagonist in a Peter Gabriel music video, obliterates his body like one of Pompeii's ash-frozen corpses, and torments him with silent-movie visions of epic religious horrors. More abstract are the colorful explosions that resemble both stars and cells, vibrating with the fervor of French documentarian Jean Painlevé.

This description may lead one to believe that Altered States is a movie that naturally welcomes a high viewing experience. But I cannot emphasize enough how little this movie made me want to do drugs. Russell's film is a series of bad trips burned from the brain onto celluloid—it is a panicky, out-of-control, irrational subconscious attacking the thinking brain in every frame. These are the just deserts earned by Eddie's ravenous, avoidant appetite for discovery. 

What really matters for Eddie, in the end, is what he's been running from all along: His family, his friends, and simple human love. It's completely cheesy, or at least it would be if not for the vital, personal danger injected into this lesson by Russell and Chayefsky. This collision between two opposing auteurs (who, by all accounts, despised each other) still boasted a shared villain, normalcy, that it fought with a shared weapon, professional obsession. Altered States‘ conclusion, sincere and relatable compared to the heightened mania leading up to it, is one of acceptance. As bizarre as the film gets, and as outré as its filmmaker and main character like to think of themselves as, the undeniable revelation sought by its fringe-dweller is the same as the one found in hackneyed romances—sometimes you just need to turn yourself into the universe's throbbing fetus before you realize that we find our answers in each other.

The lasting effects of Stephen King's horror novel It can be felt almost 40 years after the book was published, thanks to its traumatizing villain. And now Pennywise's origin story makes its way to the small screen in HBO's Welcome To Derry, which premieres October 26. The prequel series brings It‘s Bill Skarsgård back into the fold as the maniacal clown who gleefully terrorizes and attacks children. But the show also delves deep into the eerie lore of  its titular small Maine town, with stories inspired by the interludes in King's novel. Series co-creator Andy Muschietti, who helmed 2017's It and Chapter Two, tells The A.V. Club that he's been itching to get back to this franchise since the latter film was released in 2019. 

Set in 1962—a whole 27 years before the Losers initially encountered Pennywise in the recent films—Welcome To Derry introduces a new group of kids who become the creature's targets. Muschietti dubs them the “new Losers,” who investigate the disappearance of a friend in the sewers while confronting some of their darkest fears. Meanwhile, the adults (played by the likes of Jovan Adepo, Taylour Paige, Chris Chalk, and James Remar) embark on their own secret missions that unwittingly put them on the same dangerous path as the kids. All roads, of course, lead to Pennywise. 

The A.V. Club spoke to Muschietti about establishing Welcome To Derry‘s “intense” tone and aesthetic, bringing in a major King character, crafting a new narrative that ties into the Native American community, and how much we'll get to see of Skarsgård in that darn clown costume. 

The A.V. Club: What was it about the interludes in Stephen King's books that felt like compelling entry points for an It spin-off? 

Andy Muschietti: So there are two things here. One was we all shared a desire to go into the origins of Pennywise or the monster who became the clown. And part of that equation was the conversations I had with Bill Skarsgård while filming It Chapter Two. Both of us were excited about the prospect. We thought it would be a movie at first. But then life happened, and we went into different projects. But this idea kept coming back to me and took shape into something deeper and more extended. It was my curiosity that made me dig into the other parts of Stephen King's book, particularly the research and investigation done by Losers Club member Mike Hanlon that form the interludes that are shrouded in mystery. Mike just gets bits and pieces of information, and he tries to build this puzzle, but never gets to put all the pieces together. In a way, I desired to put those pieces together and create an expanded story about everything that happened in Derry before the events of the movies, and hopefully create a compelling, emotional story. 

AVC: The show takes place in 1962. How does this specific time period affect the arc and aesthetics of the show? 

AM: 1962 is the Pennywise cycle previous to the story in the movie, but in the book, the main story happens in 1958 with the kids. So that was exciting to us right away because even if it's not the same characters, we're going into a similar cultural era covered in the book. We wanted to capitalize on the fear of being in the Cold War and the panic of possibly being bombed by Russia. There's also another range of fears from this era I wanted to tap into from the kids' perspective, which is things like radioactive mutations. Using both those angles to help with the creation of this world, aesthetically speaking, was appealing. I treated this season as if it were a movie, in the sense that we got Chapter Two‘s production designer [Paul D. Austerberry] and costume designer [Luis Sequeira] because I wanted to preserve that cinematic feel. Everybody was very excited to jump into the early '60s and embrace not only the aesthetic parts but the deeper idiosyncrasies of what an American small town at that time was like.

AVC: Does the show match the film's tone in terms of creepiness, or did you get to change things since you have eight hourlong episodes? 

AM: I wanted to maintain the same tone of the movie because I wanted the movies themselves to maintain the tone of the book, which is terribly scary and graphically violent. There are heightened emotions, but there's also a lot of humor. The mandate for me was always being faithful to all that, but I will say the show does get more intense. We had the opportunity to make it creepier because it's a bigger canvas with more characters and more of their fears to explore. The intention is to take things to the edge and give audiences more than what they've experienced in the movies before. 

AVC: You directed the opening scene of the premiere, which is quite gnarly and further helps establish that creepy tone. 

AM: Yeah, I wanted to establish a sense of how no one is really safe in this world, which is a little bit of the same idea that we expressed in the first movie's opening with Georgie's death, which is pretty gruesome, and also with Adrian Mellon's death at the beginning of Chapter Two. In general, as an opening for the show, I wanted to create an augmented feeling that nothing is sacred or safe in Derry. The challenge was how to do it and make it more spectacular, especially for people who have seen the movies and understand how effective a graphic incident like the show's opening scene is. It all comes from what I mentioned before about my desire to make a creature that stems from what a kid's fear in the early '60s was, which is a mutant of some sort. 

AVC: Did you always sign up to direct four installments, or did that choice come about naturally while working on the scripts? 

AM: That part evolved a bit. I knew I wanted to develop and create the show with other writers, but I knew I couldn't direct all eight because that's a big task. I also wanted time to make other movies. But over the course of the first few months, as the drafts were happening, I realized that I wanted to do more, so I thought I'd direct episodes one and two for the specific reason of establishing certain new characters. I was committed to that. And then I said, “Well, of course I'll do the finale, too.” But the lead-up to our finale is so great that I didn't want to not be part of the penultimate episode. So then I committed to doing those four, and I love and respect the other directors who came aboard.



AVC: A huge source of tension in It is the disconnect between the kids experiencing Pennywise's terrors and the adults not necessarily believing them. How does that aspect factor into Welcome To Derry? 

AM: Yeah, that's the fog in Derry, when adults don't seem to see or pay attention to what's going on. It's mostly about the kids suffering. Kids are gifted with the ability to imagine things that don't exist, for good and for bad. Our monster is a creature made of belief and will obviously target and use that as bait, which is more effective on younger people. That's one of the reasons we wanted to go back to his origins, to understand more the how and why of It becoming a clown. This fog is based on what Stephen King perceives as a sort of real-life behavior and a larger reflection about childhood versus adulthood. There are moments when you become an adult where your imagination fades away, unless you carry the child that you were within you. We absolutely use it in our show as a love letter to memory and the child inside who keeps the imagination alive. The fog is the end of childhood. Adults don't pay attention to everything in the world of children; that's impossible to do when you're occupied with life stuff. When we don't listen to kids to the full extent that we should, things can get forgotten or overlooked, or brushed under the carpet. 

AVC: Another important arc seems to be about the Native American rituals and beliefs about the monster and how they tie into what the adults are doing.

AM: The intervention of Native characters in the book is very important, and we wanted to grab it and extend it. In the interludes, it unlocks the investigations of the Losers and makes them face reality differently. I was always very attentive to that in the book. Natives were the first people on this land and so the first people who encountered It. In many ways, their story is as or more important than the story that our Losers go through. But it's a big question mark in the book about how this happened. So we basically go into that in the show and open the drawer to create a story that might be unfamiliar to readers as well. It's a new narrative that connects to the Indigenous community. 

AVC: One of the main characters is Dick Hallorann, played by Chris Chalk, who fans of The Shining will be familiar with. What was the idea behind bringing him into Welcome To Derry in such a big way? 

AM: Dick has a very predominant role in this story. In the book, he's part of the Black Spot tragedy when it burned down, but that story is told in fragmented pieces. We don't know the full extent of Dick's participation, and that's what we wanted to find out here. We realized he plays a much larger role. Chris Chalk is exceptional in this. I hadn't known him before in person before casting him, and when I saw his tape, it blew my mind. He brought a great deal of mysticism, but he's also grounded. His character goes on a weird journey as someone who has “the shine” and is in conflict with that throughout.

AVC: We can't end without a tease of just how much we'll see of Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise.

AM: I cannot say when and how Pennywise appears because it would be a spoiler. Of course, we're going to see him incarnated in different ways, but eventually, we will see the clown that we all love to hate. There was an attempt to keep Bill not in the proximity of the new young actors to preserve that aura that he has when he's in costume and in character, at least just to preserve the first scene when they all see each other. But then, after that, everyone quickly became friends with Bill. He's very careful about the effect he has on people when he's in costume, but all the actors were very excited about Pennywise showing up on set.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Meta removes anti-ICE Facebook group","https://www.avclub.com/meta-removes-anti-ice-facebook-group","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 16:01:00 GMT","

In yet another installment of “How are tech billionaires carrying water for Donald Trump today?” Meta has removed a Facebook group that tracked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in Chicago. The move was made at the urging of Attorney General Pam Bondi, and supposedly in keeping with company policy. Specifically, “This Group was removed for violating our policies against coordinated harm,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement (via NBC News). 

This is the same company that had policies allowing for chatbots to have “sensual” conversations with kids, but discussing local law enforcement among neighbors is a bridge too far, huh? Of course, Bondi characterized the page as “being used to dox and target” ICE agents in Chicago. “The wave of violence against ICE has been driven by online apps and social media campaigns designed to put ICE officers at risk just for doing their jobs,” she wrote on Twitter/X. “The Department of Justice will continue engaging tech companies to eliminate platforms where radicals can incite imminent violence against federal law enforcement.”

The biggest names in the tech sector have all aligned themselves with Trump and his agenda. Elon Musk was once an active member of the administration; Oracle's Larry Ellison is a Trump advisor (who now has a major stake in Paramount, which has done Trump some favors lately). Tim Cook from Apple—which similarly pulled down an ICE tracking app earlier this month—gave the president a plaque with a 24-karat gold base, for some reason. And Meta's Mark Zuckerberg is no less of an ass kisser, recently caught on a hot mic saying he “wasn't sure what number” Trump wanted him to announce for U.S. investment into artificial intelligence. 

It sure seems like these guys are cozying up to Trump in order to continue building their tech empires unfettered by government regulation, but these latest concessions are done under the guise that the safety of ICE agents is being put at “risk.” On the other side of the argument, Joshua Aaron (who created the ICEBlock app removed by Apple) told CNBC, “This is about our fundamental constitutional rights in this country being stripped away by this administration, and the powers that be who are capitulating to their requests.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","NBC News to lay off up to 150 staffers, will reportedly encourage them to reapply","https://www.avclub.com/nbc-news-layoffs-versant","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 19:12:00 GMT","

NBC News is clearing out its newsroom ahead of parent company NBCUniversal's impending split. The organization plans to lay off 100 to 150 staffers as the larger company undergoes its divorce proceedings, Variety reports. It apparently couldn't let those employees go without playing a little mind game, however. The trade reports that “many” of the departing staffers will be encouraged to reapply for one of 140 open roles that remain active—despite the layoffs—across the company's news operations. Additionally, about a dozen of the eliminated roles are being “repurposed” as new roles, meaning those staffers will have the unique pleasure of applying for what will probably look at least a bit like the job they already had. (Representatives from NBC News did not immediately reply to The A.V. Club‘s request for comment on this story.)

The cuts represent between seven and eight percent of the news operations' staff, per Variety. At least they aren't coming totally out of the blue. Employees have reportedly anticipated this for weeks, as NBC News Group, the umbrella division that represents NBC News as well as CNBC and MSNBC, which will both be housed under new spin-off company Versant, is being split in two along with the parent company. Revenue from the latter two networks that previously supported the entire news operation will soon be funneled to Versant. Still, there may be some hope for laid off employees who want to stay with the company but don't want to just reapply for the same old jobs. Last week, NBC News Group Chairman Cesar Conde discussed plans to launch a new subscription product for mobile audiences and grow the company's focus on sports, Variety reports.

Unfortunately, NBC News employees aren't the only newsroom staffers bracing for cuts. Paramount Skydance is expected to slash up to 10 percent of CBS News' staff as new editor-in-chief Bari Weiss settles into her role. (A memo she sent to staff last week asking “how you spend your working hours” certainly didn't help morale.) CNN also laid off around 6 percent of its workforce earlier this year.

It feels like we've lived a thousand lives since Red, White & Royal Blue first introduced viewers to the star-crossed love story of first son Alex Claremont-Diaz (Taylor Zakhar Perez) and Prince Henry of England (Nicholas Galitzine) in 2023. Galitzine has completely transformed his body to play He-Man in the upcoming Masters Of The Universe movie, for example. We also, uh, have a new president in the White House. If that latter update has you craving a sweet serving of political escapism, the team behind the original film is cooking up a sequel with a new director at the helm. But I'm A Cheerleader‘s Jamie Babbit will take the reins for the follow-up, officially titled Red, White & Royal Wedding, Variety reports. Looks like the palace may have to order a brand new giant cake; hopefully this one won't end up on the floor.

“After directing But I'm A Cheerleader in my 20s, I'm thrilled to be back in the queer love universe of Red, White & Royal Wedding,'” Babbit said in a statement. “We all need this kind of optimism, fantasy, and gay joy. I'm thrilled to work with this brilliant team.” The Red, White & Royal Wedding script was written by Gemma Burgess, original Red, White & Royal Blue director Matthew López, and Casey McQuiston, who wrote the novel the movie was based on in 2019. In their own statement, McQuiston thanked López for “all his hard work on the first movie and in co-creating this new story with me” and lauded Babbit for having “the vision, wit, and tenderness to take great care of Alex and Henry from here.” 

If you're looking for hints about where the story could go, don't look at Zakhar Perez. “I said, ‘Don't tell me anything,'” he recently shared when Variety asked him if there was anything he could tease. “Because if I'm asked about it, it's going to be tough to not Tom Holland it and talk a little Spider-Man.” Strays toward Holland's loose lips aside, Zakhar Perez did expound on why the first film felt so important when the sequel was announced in 2024. Red, White & Royal Blue was number one on Amazon “in countries where it's quite literally illegal to be queer,” he said. “I think it's just as important for those a part of the community and those that are not part of the community to watch this project and just learn something, enjoy it, laugh.” Prime Video has not shared a release timeline for Red, White & Royal Wedding as of this writing, but expect to receive that save the date in the mail soon.

It was a heartwarming and unforgettable night on “Dancing With the Stars“. Pentatonix singer Scott Hoying moved viewers to tears with a deeply personal performance, and a joyful announcement that left the ballroom cheering.

During Week 5's “Dedication Night,” the 32-year-old artist dedicated his foxtrot to his husband, Mark, dancing alongside pro partner Rylee Arnold to his own original song, “Parallel.” The emotional track was inspired by the night he and Mark first fell in love, staying up talking until sunrise.

“I am so in love with him, and I have been hoping we would make it to this week,” Hoying shared in rehearsal. “I've always been a workaholic. We toured every single year. I felt like I was always dating mean guys. When I met Mark, it felt like I could exhale. I could be myself.”

A post shared by Scott Hoying (@scotthoying)

The Grammy-winning artist opened up about how his husband helped him heal and grow. “What happens is your self-esteem starts to heal, and that starts to trickle into all areas of your life,” Hoying said. “He's so special.”

Their heartfelt foxtrot beautifully reflected their love story, with Hoying's vocals and emotional movement creating one of the night's standout moments.

A post shared by Scott Hoying (@scotthoying)

In a tender backstage moment that aired during the show, Scott and Mark shared exciting personal news with Rylee, and with millions of viewers watching at home.

“We're gonna be dads,” the couple announced, smiling through tears. “Our surrogate is pregnant!”

Mark added, “We've dreamed of this our whole lives. Scott's gonna be the best dad in the whole world.” He also shared how meaningful Scott's dedication was to him, saying, “For him to dedicate this performance, to a song he wrote about our love, I will treasure this for the rest of my life.”

Scott and Mark's love story began in 2017 and reached a new chapter in 2023 when they exchanged vows in a romantic ceremony officiated by singer Christina Perri. Their wedding, filled with music, laughter, and heartfelt emotion, reflected the same warmth and connection that now defines their journey into parenthood.

Their joyful baby announcement on Dancing With the Stars became one of the most talked-about moments of the evening, as fans flooded social media with love, congratulations, and tears of happiness.

It was a night to remember, a beautiful celebration of love, artistry, and new beginnings, as Scott Hoying filled the ballroom with both heart and harmony.

The dancing is fantastic this year.
The best program now to watch!

“The Bold and the Beautiful” star Jacqueline MacInnes Wood is officially a mother of five boys. The actress returned to social media this week after months of silence and shared the happy news with her followers.

In an Instagram post, Wood gave fans a glimpse of her “little slice of paradise.” The soap star shared photos documenting the birth of her fifth child with Elan Ruspoli. They named him Talon.

A post shared by J A C Q U E L I N E   W O O D (@jacquelinemwood_1)

Wood welcomed her newest bundle of joy at home. Judging by the photos, it appears the actress chose a water birth.

In one of the photos, “The Bold and the Beautiful” star can be seen sitting in a bathtub, seemingly in labor. Another shows Wood in a birthing pool, cradling baby Talon in her arms as she shares a sweet kiss with her husband, Elan. She wrote:

“Welcomed a beautiful, healthy baby boy at home. This season has been all about being still, soaking in every precious moment, and embracing the quiet magic of new beginnings. Social media took a little back seat, but I'm so happy to be back and say hello again.”

The idea of Wood having a water birth at home isn't surprising at all. During her previous pregnancies, she shared photos of herself holding her newborn while sitting in the bathtub.

Even her character, Steffy Forrester, had a water birth at home on “The Bold and the Beautiful.” Not to mention, Wood has always been into all things zen, including ice baths.

A post shared by The Bold and The Beautiful (@boldandbeautifulcbs)

In the same post, Wood expresses her joy in motherhood. The “Bold and the Beautiful” star embraces life as a mom and cherishes the family she's built with her husband, Elan.

“One day you're young, hip and fun,” Wood wrote. “And the next thing you know you're going to bed at 9pm, have a coop full of chickens, sourdough starter on the counter and you never want to leave your house.”

Previously, Wood admitted that she and Elan have always wanted a big family. Speaking with PEOPLE in 2021, she revealed, “Elan and I dreamed of having a large family as we are both only children and are over the moon that our dreams are coming true.”

In addition to baby Talon, Wood and Elan are proud parents of four adorable boys: Rise Harlen, Lenix, Brando Elion, and Valor James.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Joe Gorga Opens Up About Reuniting with Teresa Giudice","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/joe-gorga-reuniting-with-teresa-giudice/","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 12:10:16 GMT","

“The Real Housewives of New Jersey” has been on an extended hiatus since 2024. Recently, Teresa Giudice has been open about her desire to reconcile with her brother, Joe Gorga, and her sister-in-law, Melissa Gorga. Now, Gorga is confirming that his sister has been in touch with him. 

Gorga recently appeared on an episode of “The Eds” podcast. He first confirmed that Giudice had texted him and that she'd like to meet and discuss their relationship. The “Real Housewives of New Jersey” star said he's willing to meet with his sister.

However, he does have parameters. Gorga said, “I've never wanted to argue with her ever. It was not my intention. If I sit down with her and I hear her out, it has to be very humble. It has to be real. It has to be, you know, ‘I've made mistakes,' and we can move forward.”

There is no concrete news about season 15 of “The Real Housewives of New Jersey.” However, there have been reports of test filming, and Giudice has been left out while the Gorgas were included. Eddie Judge, host of “The Eds” podcast, asked Gorga if he felt Giudice's desire to patch things up was calculated. 

He responded, “I don't know, man. We're men, right? We have been men our whole lives, and a man is, you know, I support my wife. I support my children. I've supported my parents. I support my siblings. I support everybody.”

Gorga also said that he isn't a person who would turn his back on “anyone.” He continued, “We have to be examples for people because look at this society, like look at this war that's going on in life. If no one made up, there'd be no ceasefire ever. You have to make up. You have to move on.”

Gorga then stated that if he were to receive an apology, he'd be willing to accept it. 

For quite some time, it seemed there was no chance Giudice could reconcile with the Gorgas. However, she appeared on SiriusXM's Jeff Lewis Live in September and seemed to change her tune. During the episode, Jeff asked if she could reach a point where she could film with them. 

She replied, “I mean, never say never.” Giudice continued, “I guess we would have to see. That's the thing, you can't talk about the past. You have to just move forward.” Since the interview, she's said on multiple occasions that she wants to sit down with them. 

I think it's tragic what Theresa did to her brother and his wife. Let's not forget that Joes children had to hear their mother being called a whore many times by their Aunt. She never had her only niece part of her wedding. The total hate and disrespect towards the Gorgas was horrible. Theresa is going to play her brother again just to be back on the show. I don't like or trust her. She's fake in every way. Do not bring her back!. She's old news anyway. I like the Gorgas better. Joe is so funny. Melissa is the real deal. Theresa taught her children to hate their uncle. That's way too low. We don't need to see a remake of her fake crap and hate again.

Totally agree with you 💯. She's just grasping at straws she's a financial failure and needs income so she's willing but that's her only motivation. She's a fake and I can't stomach her where I used to love her in the beginning. No more. Never again

Bravo fans love to see their favorite reality TV stars celebrating huge life moments, including seeing how they spend their fun-filled bachelorette getaways before tying the knot.

Former “Southern Charm” star Olivia Flowers recently shared photos and videos on Instagram of her Bachelorette party, or, more like, an extravaganza in Miami, Florida. Sharing the special occasion with her closest friends, Flowers appeared to have the best time before she weds her fiancé, Alex Williams.

A post shared by Olivia Flowers (@oliviabflowers)

Olivia Flowers, who appeared on seasons 8 and 9 of Bravo's “Southern Charm,” recently celebrated her bachelorette party in Miami. She shared several photos and videos from the getaway, including the house where she and her friends stayed, having a lively pool party, and a night out on the town where the women danced the night away. 

A post shared by Olivia Flowers (@oliviabflowers)

To kick off her bachelorette, Flowers' friends set up a beautiful display of white and gold balloons with one that read “Bride” above her bed. Flowers' bachelorette weekend getaway consisted of her and her friends taking a pilates class outside their rented home, and a pool party, catered by the sauce company, Saucy Gourment. Flowers' abs were on full display as she wore a white bikini and a long lace cover-up.

During another night, Flowers and her gal pals headed to KiKi on the River, a waterfront Mediterranean restaurant in Miami, where they dined and danced. Flowers was given a bridal crown and a heart-shaped cake that unveiled a photo of her and her fiancé, Alex Williams, when lit.

A post shared by Caroline Grace McDonald (@caro1grace)

In an Oct. 1 post, the reality star shared how thankful she was to have her closest friends celebrate with her. “Some of you I met in elementary school, others we survived high school awkward phases and questionable first loves, then there are my college sweethearts who I can't imagine life without… You've been with me through every chapter. Yall are my favorite blessing. Cheers to many more milestones together.”

Fans didn't see any of Flowers' “Southern Charm” co-stars at her bachelorette party, but it didn't mean that she wasn't going to invite a few of them to her upcoming wedding. 

Speaking with Page Six's “Virtual Reali-Tea,” Flowers revealed that Venita Aspen, Leva Bonaparte, and her husband, Lamar Bonaparte, scored invites. 

“Leva and Lamar, they're close family friends, and I would love to have them there,” she told the outlet. “I think we just want to keep it to the close-knit people…[and] Venita. That would be it.”

As fans may remember, Flowers had a major falling out with former friend Taylor Ann Green after Green revealed she had kissed Flowers' ex, Austen Kroll. Flowers wasn't asked to return to the show after season 9, which she said left her completely “blindsided” during an appearance on an episode of “Scheananigans with Scheana Shay.”

Flowers got engaged to Williams in New York City in September 2024. According to Page Six, the couple will be getting married in Texas this November.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Lacey Chabert Debuts Her Hallmark Christmas Product Line: SEE IT","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/lacey-chabert-christmas-hallmark-wrapping-decor/","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 19:47:07 GMT","

Having just wrapped filming on her 44th Hallmark movie, including starring in more Hallmark Christmas movies than anyone on planet earth, Lacey Chabert is delivering an extra dose of holiday cheer in 2025. 

As part of a “over-arching” deal with Hallmark that was announced in February, the rom-com queen and star of Hallmark's heartwarming unscripted series “Celebrations with Lacey Chabert” partnered with Hallmark designers and cardmakers to develop her first-ever line of Christmas decor and wrapping. 

A post shared by Hallmark Gold Crown Stores (@hallmarkstores)

Chabert has provided glimpses of her new product line, illustrated with a vintage-inspired holiday vibe, during the second season of “Celebrations,” airing Monday nights on Hallmark Channel. 

In scenes shared by Hallmark Gold Crown Stores' social media account, as seen above, she's seen wrapping a gift in one of her 10 colorful rolls of wrapping paper, which all have a retro feel. Several are reversible, with festive designs on both sides of the paper. 

In another scene from a recent episode of “Celebrations,” in which Chabert and her event planning team throw surprise parties for people who've made a difference in their communities, they serve cookies on her gold serving tray with handles (available for $45.99), featuring illustrated pink and red poinsettias and a mint-colored bow on a forest green background. 

Other items in Chabert's collection include a set of four coordinating dessert plates for $25.99, six assorted round, glass ornaments for $45.99, a darling box with 24 blank holiday cards inside for $15.99, a trio of ceramic bowls in red, white, and green for $28.99, and a set of two low-ball glasses with her signature ribbon decorations for $33.99. 

Hallmark Channel fans' favorite item, though, might be Chabert's set of four festive popcorn bowls with messages like “More Snacks, More Merry, More Hallmark Channel” for $33.99. 

Meanwhile, for the most die-hard fans of Hallmark's queen of Christmas, there's also a porcelain Lacey Chabert ornament, with her dressed in a sleeveless red gown, for $26.99. 

After the holidays, the Lacey Chabert Collection will expand in 2026, according to the original announcement, which said the actress will continue to help design “everyday products that help people create joyful memories year-round.”

A post shared by Hallmark (@hallmark)

Chabert is among the many Hallmark stars descending on Nashville this week to kick off Countdown to Christmas 2025 with appearances and a party at the Grand Ole Opry. On October 14, Nikki DeLoach shared a photo in her Instagram Stories of herself on a plane with Chabert, Sharon Lawrence, and Eliza Hayes Maher before they took off for Music City. 

On October 15, Chabert will be at the Little Green Apple gift store (also known as Amy's Hallmark) from 10 a.m. to noon local time in nearby Franklin, along with fellow Hallmark stars Ashley Williams, Benjamin Ayres, B.J. Britt, and Brooke D'Orsay. Fans will have the chance to purchase signed items from Chabert's new collection, per the store. 

Other stars will be at Katy's Hallmark in Nashville at the same time — fans can meet up with Andrew Walker, Kimberley Sustad, Paul Campbell, Rachel Boston, and Tyler Hynes.

Few contemporary films about unresolved childhood abuse — which is always unresolved, in the end, anyway — cut as narrowly close to the bone as Elliot Tuttle's two-hander masked as provocation, “Blue Film.” 

Rejected by mainstream film festivals before it premiered in Edinburgh this summer and NewFest in New York in October, this taboo-busting study of a masculine camboy confronted by the pedophile teacher who many years ago desired him holds back little and offers even less that's palatable to swallow. Its limitations as a stagelike piece aside, the movie wrings emotional complexity from a fraught, ever-shifting dialogue between a convicted child abuser and the student, now a late twenties sex worker, he spared.

 








Related Stories How Two Friends Turned Endless Film Festival Ovations Into a Viral Short Tim Blake Nelson Is a Multi-Tasking Brainiac 

“Blue Film,” which takes place entirely in a rented Hancock Park Airbnb in Los Angeles with only two actors, dares to go places I have not seen an American movie travel to in a while. There was an Israeli movie called “Princess” at Sundance in 2014, directed by Tali Shalom Ezer, which freaked a lot of people out. It was about a 12-year-old girl's “close relationship” with her mother's boyfriend. There was the 2011 Austrian movie “Michael,” directed by Michael Haneke protégé Markus Schleinzer, about an insurance salesman sexually abusing the 10-year-old boy locked up in his basement. These were shocking. Neither were American.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Tuttle, an American filmmaker himself who received support on the project from Mark Duplass of all possible collaborators, is willing to take you to those same dark places, ones that remind you of European directors who want to shake you with their frank psychosexual provocations. It's impressive where Tuttle, this second-time feature filmmaker, goes with his surprisingly humanistic and empathetic approach to material about abuse. One where a pedophile teacher's sexual fantasy about his former student's talent show performance emerges as oddly wistful.

“Blue Film” stars rising actor Kieron Moore as dom camboy Aaron Eagle (whose real name is Alex McConnell) opposite Reed Birney as his estranged middle school teacher, who reconnect over one night filled with conversations about desire, shame, and guilt. I'm not surprised festivals, allegedly such as Sundance and SXSW, looked away from it. Mainstream audiences will be alienated by this unapologetic exploration of quote-unquote aberrant sexuality, but those looking for a challenge in the vein of ‘90s films from Todd Solondz or Gregg Araki will feel seen in Tuttle's exploration of how abuse warps memory, and memory warps accounts of abuse.

In asking you to feel sorry for a pedophile while making a gay man his scene partner, “Blue Film” dances on the tricky line from early abuse to later-in-life sexual behavior. When the movie begins, we see Aaron (Moore), sweaty and hairy in white briefs and tattooed top-to-toe, putting on a live stream for his submissive followers. One of his anonymous fans offers $50,000 for an in-person meet-and-greet. Financially desperate, he agrees to spend the night with the client, who greets him sheathed in a balaclava with the promise of even more money and perhaps pizza if Aaron is willing to open up about himself.

 










That client, it turns out, is Mr. Grant, aka Hank, Aaron's long-ago teacher, and one who took a special interest in Aaron as a child. Some time while Aaron was in school, Hank was intercepted sexually assaulting a child on campus, was fired from his job, and received a prison sentence. With the mask off and Aaron stripped down yet again, their walls start to come down. Hank, he reveals, has now turned to religion as an atonement for his own torment, but his search for meaning has not been without other attempts at or contemplations of assaulting kids, as he tells Aaron.

Tuttle's script and camera pass no judgment on the characters, like when Aaron shares a bone-chilling story of childhood abuse while naked in a bathtub that may or may not be true, or when Hank also offers a sickening recounting of molestation he endured at the hands of a relative. The actors are as game as any you could imagine, working from a script that you can imagine a lot of people said “hell no” to.

Birney, 71, and best known for work in television and theater (“The Humans”), invites you to feel all his hurt, even as his world is a morally disturbed one we are made to live inside for the movie's running time. As Aaron, Moore, meanwhile, conceals deep wounds of his own, while also high on the power imbalance this situation has tipped his way, where Hank wants to know if he “still loves” Aaron. Another wrinkle is that the camera certainly wants us to also desire Moore, who is often next to naked, placing us at least adjacent to Hank's gaze.

 










Hank is also curious about whether he can still be attracted to adult whom he once desired as a child. He shaves Aaron head to toe to make him look more physically childlike in one of the film's queasier implications. What these two actors take on is undeniably brave, even as the movie tilts toward becoming suffocating, which is intentional. “Blue Film” is confined to a single environment, after all.

Cinematographer Ryan Jackson-Healy also shot the equally controversy-starting, Birney-led film “Mass,” about the ramifications of a school shooting for the parents affected. The DP knows his way around a tight room with just a few people, and the visual beauty of this movie (indeed, often cloaked in literal blues as night turns to dawn) helps alleviate the agonies on display.

Tuttle wisely avoids flashbacks or out-of-this-room context. We are stuck with these two people and our discomfort with them, even though we might also feel tenderness toward them. “Blue Film” nudges at a lot of tricky issues, like the question of whether being gay in the present day is somehow the result of inflictions of the past. And the parallel to that question is whether abuse can also beget more abuse, i.e. make you into a pedophile or sex offender. Hank says he knew who he was once his sexual fantasies in middle school, about his fellow same-age classmates, remained the same into adulthood. What Tuttle wants to attack here is this terrible fork-in-the-road notion that pedophilia and homosexuality stem from the same root.

 










Still, “Blue Film” does the rare work of listening with compassion to a pedophile such as Hank, and as an audience, you can either be curious about that or just let it make you uncomfortable. Hank is tormented by who he is, as is Aaron, but they are not the same person, and they did not come from the same place. “Blue Film” leaves you feeling a little bit ill, and very uneasy about how you're supposed to feel. But when most films either wouldn't dare go here at all, or would tell you how to feel about the material, that's rare and welcome.

“Blue Film” premiered at the Edinburgh Film Festival and NewFest. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

If you're wondering what members of the French 75 chat about when they're not breaking immigrants out of detainment centers or robbing banks, the answer is astrology. Or at least that's what the cast of Paul Thomas Anderson's “One Battle After Another” discussed in between firing prop machine guns and driving getaway cars in the vigilante thriller.

“We were all of us just there, chatting up in between takes, talking about astrology, talking about full moons,” Shayna McHayle, who plays French 75 member Junglepussy, told IndieWire. “Teyana [Taylor] was saying something about Scorpios, and I'm like, ‘I'm a Scorpio,' and Leo[nardo DiCaprio]'s like, ‘Yeah, I'm a Scorpio.' It was this whole thing.”

For McHayle, spending time on the set of a blockbuster action film with A-list talent was quite surreal, and not something she sought out, but the experience was “written in the stars.” While she's previously appeared in two films, 2018's “Support the Girls” and 2023's “The Perfect Find,” she's predominantly a musician who raps under the stage name Junglepussy. After Anderson saw her on tour with Tame Impala in 2022, however, he was so inspired that he created a character, also named Junglepussy, just for McHayle.

“My agent reached out to me like, ‘Paul Thomas Anderson wants your number. Can I give it to him?' He wants to talk to you directly,” McHayle said. “I was like, ‘Who? OK, yeah, give him my number.'”

The pair then met several times in New York City over the next few years, with Anderson telling McHayle he was crafting a far-left vigilante based on her stage persona. 

“I didn't know that it was like Junglepussy for real until it really got close to locking in,” McHayle said. “He gave me a hard copy of the script, and when I read it, I was like, ‘What the…? What is this?' When I saw my name in there, and I saw my lyrics in there, and I just saw all these pussy references, I was gagged.”

Even before shooting, however, astrology was a key topic of conversation. “Teyana's a Sag. Regina [Hall]'s a Sag. Alana [Haim]'s a Sag,” McHayle said. “One day, me and Paul were texting before we started filming, and he thought I was a Sag too. He's like, ‘Yeah, you know I got all these badass Sagittarius women in the French 75,' and I was like, ‘Yeah, I'm a Scorpio.' He was like, ‘OK, you're fired.'”

After reading the “One Battle After Another” script, however, McHayle asked Anderson to make some changes to her character. “He's writing and directing, so he wants to control everything,” she said, “But I was just like, ‘Paul, I am Junglepussy. This is me. I have to be Junglepussy after this movie. I was Junglepussy before this movie, and while I love the collaboration here that you're cooking up, I still have some non-negotiables.' There were things that I was like, ‘OK, hard no on this. Junglepussy would never, like ever.'”

 










Crafting a character that was a mix of her real-life persona and a fictional French 75 radical required some nuance from McHayle as an actor. “Because he reached out to me directly, and was so inspired by my music, even ‘This pussy don't pop for you,' having it like as a sign in the movie, which is how I've been performing it for the past decade, I knew there were a lot of things that he was drawn to, and I wanted to keep that part of me alive in the role,” she said. “But I also wanted to do some things that I wouldn't usually do, like shooting a machine gun out of a moving vehicle, like robbing a bank.”

McHayle channeled her stage persona while filming, especially during her instantly iconic bank robbery monologue. Walking across the tellers' counter amid the chaos of a stick-up, McHayle delivers a speech that serves both as a mission statement for the French 75 as well as a nod to Junglepussy's work. It's here that she tells the world, “This pussy don't pop for you.” But filming in front of the entire cast and crew was daunting. 

“That day, I just had to channel the same energy I bring to the stage whenever I do a big show,” she said. “I just had to channel that energy and do my thing.”

McHayle is “still gagged” at the magnitude of the film, and the stunts in particular. “The stunts were scary,” she said, laughing, “Like the car chase scene, we were in the vehicles, like we were in it. When the minivan takes that hard left, we were in it…I'm not even, like, a rollercoaster kind of girl. I prefer a ride over a rollercoaster, but this was like a rollercoaster ride from hell.” 

 










“I know Warner Brothers didn't want to get in trouble with me,” she added about the movie's safety protocols. “I just had to let go and trust they knew what they were doing, because they know they have to keep us safe.”

While “One Battle After Another” may only be McHayle's third movie, it's her second working with Regina Hall, whom she acted alongside in “Support the Girls,” where they both played employees of a Hooters-esque establishment called Double Whammies. McHayle described the reunion as “a dream.” 

“She is such a calming force,” McHayle gushes, “The role she plays as Deandra [in ‘One Battle After Another'] is just like steady, grounded. That's the literal energy she gives me when we work together on set. I just feel super calm around her. She's an OG, like that's my girl, just big sis vibes, like just super nurturing. I'm just like, ‘Girl, I can't believe this is my second movie with you.' Love her for life.”

McHayle is now manifesting a third Regina Hall collab and one “with more screentime for both of us.” She's also rooting for Hall to earn an Oscar for her performance. “She is truly such a force,” McHayle said. “I need her getting that Oscar. No pressure, but I want her to have it.” 

After filming wrapped in early 2024, McHayle had to wait patiently for over a year before she finally got to watch “One Battle After Another.” She was invited to a private screening at the IMAX theater at New York's Lincoln Square AMC for a morning viewing. “It was like me and some of the Christmas Adventurers, Tony Goldwyn and them,” she said. “We're in this big-ass theater, and everybody's in their own row and taking it all in.” 

 










McHayle brought a coffee and a croissant and, during her first watch, was mostly just assessing how much of her work made the final cut. “I was there ticking my boxes,” she said. “Like I know what I did, and I know what I didn't do. Now let's see what's in here. When I saw all the pieces just remained, I was like, ‘Oh, Paul is a real one. He was serious,' because you never know for real until it's done.”

Since her first screening, where she admitted to being “over-caffeinated” and “overstimulated,” she's seen the movie five more times, including in VistaVision. She's still “gagged” by the whole process, and knows there will be more to come. 

“For some reason, whenever I do me, do my music, make my art, I'm attracting these opportunities,” she said. “I'm just staying super open to expanding my acting career, because it's obviously something I can't run from, hide from, like it just keeps popping up. I am going to surrender to the process and to the full spectrum of my gifts, my artistry, and just keep being me.” 

Hopefully, that means Shayna McHayle x Regina Hall 3.0 in the near future. 

“One Battle After Another” is now in theaters from Warner Bros. Pictures.

Karl Marx himself may have written that “history repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.” Still, not even the most dedicated members of Japan's Red Army Faction — a militant, “Communist Manifesto”-carrying group most famous for hijacking a JAL flight in the spring of 1970 — could have imagined their signature action would eventually be restaged as a slick and sprawling Netflix comedy combining the smirking political satire of “Burn After Reading” with the cold-blooded visual dynamism of a Park Chan-wook film. 

 










Sure, the Yodogo Hijacking Incident wasn't quite a tragedy, and “Good News” is just a bit too grounded to feel like a true farce, but the disconnect between the severity of what happened and the blitheness with which Korean director Byun Sung-hyun (“The Merciless”) has re-imagined it is striking enough to affirm Marx's point. I have to imagine that the hijackers would've been happy about that; bumbling and inept as they appear in Byun's movie, their conviction smacks of courage when compared to the spinelessness of the bureaucrats tasked with solving the crisis, all of whom care more about their own egos and careers than they do the 130 passengers whose lives are at stake.

Just droll, twisty, and stylish enough to forgive this 136-minute film for using a lot more runway than it needs to be airborne, “Good News” is a veritable caricature of middle-management — an epic parody of passing the buck. That so few of the actual facts have been changed, despite an impishly self-conflicting disclaimer that insists it was “inspired by real events” but also that “all of the characters and events portrayed are fictional,” only serves to strengthen Byun's damning portrayal of political cowardice.

For all of the lip service that Byun and Lee Jin-seong's knotted script pays to the relative nature of truth, however, “Good News” initially makes it easy to separate fact from fiction. Did heavily armed hijackers commandeer a Boeing 727 as part of their plan to further a worldwide revolution against the United States and its allies? Indeed, and an opening flurry of newsreel footage helps to confirm that we aren't completely outside of history. Did the Communists obsessively quote the boxing manga “Ashita no Joe” as a source of inspiration? Was their leader as handsome as “Tokyo Vice” star Show Kasamatsu, or their youngest member barely old enough to fly without parental supervision? Probably not. 

 










Did the crisis highlight the Kafkaesque absurdity of Cold War politics by sparking an international circle-jerk between various representatives from South Korea, North Korea, Japan, America, and the Soviet Union? You bet. Did the South Koreans rely on the help of a rumpled and mysterious fixer called “Nobody” (a Lupin the III-esque Sul Kyung-gu, his character wise enough to treat the whole situation like a cosmic joke) to goad everyone into action? I highly doubt it, but history tends to forget the people who refuse to accept credit for it. Ditto those who manage to avoid taking the blame.

“Good News” has plenty of fun exaggerating the personas of the different parties involved in the situation, from the violent JAL chairman who only cares about his brand, to the veteran airplane pilot who can't stop complaining about his hemorrhoids, and the Korean Central Intelligence Agency Director (Ryoo Seung-bum) who tries to wash his hands of this entire shitshow like a used car salesman desperate to move an old lemon off the lot. But the movie only really takes flight after the line between “tragedy” and “farce” begins to blur, like when a proactive air force “double parks” a jet in front of the 727 as it stops to refuel. (The visual of the two planes facing each other on the tarmac as the pilot scampers away from his vehicle is a real laugh-out-loud moment in a movie that tends to fall back on knowing smiles.) 

 










Funny as it is, that sequence pales in comparison to what happens later, when a young Korean Air Force lieutenant named Seo (Hong Kyung) has the bright idea of executing a double hijack. The Red Army Faction believes they're flying into Pyongyang, but Seo — in a standoff that's shot like a Sergio Leone spaghetti western, complete with ultra-wide framing, skintight leather chaps, and a few errant tumbleweeds for good measure — wrests control of the radio frequency from his North Korean counterparts and fools the hijackers into landing in Seoul's Gimpo International Airport instead. 

Remarkably, this part of the story is rooted in truth. Gimpo really was hastily outfitted to resemble Pyongyang in the hopes that the hijackers would believe they'd succeeded. Byun simply “yes ands” the record by imagining that an overweight local movie director was recruited to complete the illusion with a fleet of costumed extras waiting for the Red Army Faction on the “North Korean” runway. Like everyone else in this movie, however, the director wants to frame this story on his own terms (“If I can't capture this historical moment on film, I at least want to participate in it!”), and his eagerness to control the action risks creating new conflict. 

 










Not only does this display of egomaniacal buffoonery make for “Good News”' most effective setpiece, the sheer absurdity of the situation embellished by Byun's arch framing and previously unknown flair for dry comedy, it also epitomizes the core ethos of a film in which shaping the narrative is always more important than saving the hostages. Even the relatively noble and clear-headed Seo is motivated by the legacy of his father's sacrifice, which complicates his feelings about the value of heroism even as it pushes him to make the most of his moment in the limelight. 

“Good News” has no compunctions about depicting its characters — even and especially the South Korean ones — as narcissistic dolts. But these larger-than-life figures are as broad as their context is hyper-specific. That functional mismatch saps away at the comedy of a film clearly made to be enjoyed by a global audience. (Netflix is releasing it around the world at the same time, and the multi-language audio track will unhelpfully default to English for anyone who tries to stream the movie from America.) Pointed gestures toward the lingering tension between Japan and Korea — and between those two countries and the rest of the planet — are drowned out by tiresome bickering and exaggerated gags, like a meaningful conversation swallowed into the sound of an airplane engine screaming overhead.

 










Byun's visual playfulness is likewise compelling enough to compensate for the shortcuts in his storytelling — active camerawork and inventive CGI combine with Jo Hyoung-rae's heightened cinematography to imbue the film's airplane cabins and flight control towers with a vivid sense of theatricality. Yet the director is so eager to make a spectacle out of this scenario that “Good News” begins to feel as self-insistent as its characters. 

Perhaps that's by design, and Byun is bending his own form towards a damning commentary on universal self-interest — even in the face of a crisis. But the movie's soft-hearted underbelly fails to support that reading, and by the time the story finally arrives at its final moments, the unsparing cynicism that supplied its initial lift has been dragged back down to Earth by the weight of bland truisms. In a rich but increasingly disappointing film where everyone is trying so hard to pass the buck, it's only fitting that viewers end up holding the bag.

“Good News” will be available to stream on Netflix starting Friday, October 17.

Tim Blake Nelson is a busy man. Suddenly, the 61-year-old actor most folks recognize from Coen brothers movies like “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” and “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs” is hitting screen, stage, and book outlets with a spate of projects within a few months. 

Before we sat down in late September for a Zoom conversation (we last spoke about his 2001 holocaust drama “The Grey Zone”), I watched Vincent Grashaw's well-reviewed boxing indie “Bang Bang“, FX's scruffy hit series “The Lowdown,” read large chunks of the dead-on accurate Hollywood depiction “Superhero: A Novel” (November 4, The Unnamed Press), and after we spoke, I checked out the La Mama production of his chilling and prescient dystopian play “And Then We Were No More,” starring the commanding Elizabeth Marvel.

Anne Thompson: Why are you suddenly so productive?

Tim Blake Nelson: Oh, it's an oversubscribed year. I hadn't planned it like this. I also directed a new movie this year that I wrote that I'm finishing right now.  

 










The romantic prison drama “The Life and Deaths of Wilson Shedd,” starring Amanda Seyfried?

Yes. The performances by Amanda Seyfried and Scoot McNairy are extraordinary. It's an ambitious movie. It's not finished. We've locked picture, but we have a lot of work to do: sound and score and VFX. We'll try to sell it next year.

“Superhero” is your second book, after “City of Blows.” What did you want to accomplish with this one that's different from the first one?

I started writing “Superhero” in 2022. I like the way my wife describes it, because I think she's right: “City of Blows” was in large part about the venality of the movie industry, whereas so much of “Superhero” is about what I love. It celebrates at the same time, even in its most ridiculously true moments that expose how myopic and selfish we can be [while] doing what we do and making movies. It's also always loving that process. There's more of a tenderness to “Superhero.”

The book felt accurate, like you're trying to give us a sense of what's going on. You focus on a movie star who accepts a superhero role that changes his life. 

There is little in “Superhero” that I haven't observed personally or heard from reliable sources who experienced it personally.

 Was it easy for you to write that book, or hard? You got to do some firsthand research!
 










“Superhero” was easier to write than “City of Blows,” partly because “Superhero” is my second go at it, so I have more experience. “Superhero” is more of a celebration of moviemaking, and that made it more fun to write. I also knew earlier on where “Superhero” was headed, and so there was less anxiety in the writing of it as to whether or not it was going to amount to a full-fledged cohesive narrative. Also, while writing “Superhero,” I got cast in “Captain America” [“Brave New World”] as the villain [The Leader]. It became two months of paid research, being on that set and spending time with producers on that movie who were eager to share a lot of process stuff, of which, as an actor, I might otherwise have been unaware.

Your comic-book empire Sparta is run by Max Kleiner. Is he a version of Marvel CEO Kevin Feige? 

It's loosely based on my experiences. I don't know Kevin well enough to have based a character on him. So he's my own version of somebody running a comic book studio based on what I know of the comic book studios, and I've worked for several of them, so it's not meant to be Marvel, but having worked with Marvel, and having worked on movies at Warner Bros. and all the studios and knowing studio heads, and hearing them talk about their work and studio executives, it's all a stew.

 










You've written how many plays? 

It's my fifth. It's directed by Mark Wing-Davey. In the near future, an algorithm has taken over the justice system, in addition to much of life in an unnamed country. The algorithm has determined that anyone who is deemed beyond rehabilitation should be dispatched [via] a machine that executes people in a manner that's called “without pain.” You walk into this machine, and you're gone. In the play, Beth Marvel plays a lawyer who's been summoned to an incarceration facility to represent a young female inmate [debuting Juilliard grad Elizabeth Yeoman] who has elected to change the manner of her execution from “without pain” to “with pain.” The institution doesn't want to. It was inspired by, not based on, Kafka's “In the Penal Colony,” which I was reading with one of my sons. I set out to do my own version suited to our moment.

I first met your “Bang Bang” director Vincent Grashaw when he produced “Bellflower.” How did you two connect? He had some fighting background, but you did not?

Oh, I didn't. I extensively trained, which was great. That's part of what I love about acting. He had wanted me to [play the title role] in “What Josiah Saw,” and I couldn't do it. But we had a good back and forth, and they asked a bunch of people to play “Bang Bang,” and actors kept saying no.

 










You take an irresponsible, drug-loving, down-on-his-luck once-great boxer, and make us care about him anyway.

Eventually, they got around to me. It's exactly the role I want to be playing: challenging, unfamiliar, arduous process in prep, arduous process making it. Why live life if you're not going to take that kind of thing on? It's truly what I wake up in the morning and want to do in whatever I'm pursuing, whether it's writing a book or a play or directing a movie or getting to act in a role. And I said, “Absolutely, so long as the producers are going to support Vince's vision.” And then the second one was, “I want six months to prepare.” And so they scheduled for that, and I went to work boxing, training five times a week, for several hours a day.

You were 59? It's harder at that age, right?

Yeah, obviously. And also, I'm a scrawny Jew. I'm not a natural boxer, and I'm not a physically aggressive person. My default position isn't: How do I take somebody apart? I needed the time to let the character seep in. And there was the Michigan accent and the fact that the guy doesn't shut up. So it was a lot of lines to learn. When I go do a movie, I learn the whole part before I get on set. It's something I learned from Daniel Day-Lewis, just a new level of prep that has been much better for me with these movies, especially as I've been getting to play larger roles, and the responsibility has increased. When the movies are severely under-resourced, you have to be ready to go in and get it in a couple of takes. I've learned that confidence. Vince is a great guy. He's smart. He directs with no self-importance, no frills. He tells stories in the most beautifully basic way.

 










The movie felt gritty and authentic. It's the kind of independent movie I admire. It's hard to get them made. 

The platform for seeing movies of that sort is now more and more the home television screen. So movies are made, you could even say, to a degree responsibly, not with a 14-foot-high screen in mind, but a small screen in mind. That makes for less interesting photography, sound, casting choices. Because the bar for recoupment becomes lower, and so there's less money spent, but also the aesthetic bar becomes lower. You get fewer wide shots. You get less attention to text or sound design, because it's all going to be compressed anyway, and it has slowly but surely chipped away at the artistic nature of so many of these films. 

Well, “The Lowdown” is a fun example of something that you can get away with on television, right? 

I'm delighted to be in “The Lowdown” and happy to work with Ethan [Hawke] and Sterlin Harjo, who is an incredible storyteller, not to mention that he's loyal to my home city of Tulsa.

Next Up: Rookie filmmaker Ari Selinger's Montauk true romance “On the End,” which is playing the Hamptons, Woodstock, Newport Beach circuit in search of distribution. 

P.S. Like the rest of us, Nelson is rooting for the Coens to get back together. (Joel is currently shooting “Jack of Spades” in Europe with Lesley Manville, Damian Lewis, Frances McDormand, and Josh O'Connor.) The brothers have many unproduced scripts in their trunk. Let them direct one!

Let this be a manifesto. Well, let it be a sort of manifesto. Let it be an essay, anyway. Let's write the thing and see how it goes. The right way to describe the project and our reasons behind it will reveal itself through process. Let's slow down. Let's open the windows. In the afternoon, the air from the windows is so soft and gentle. The crows are back, talking to the dog again, and the other birds are singing in the trees. They are all a part of this. The best way to write this would be to follow the principles of the thing itself. So let's start there with the windows open, in peace, in nature, and let's experiment.

We are Joële Walinga and Daniel Warth. We are a married couple. We are filmmakers. And we are the co-founders of a new residency called CASA PIP.

CASA PIP is a free residency that we've designed for filmmakers and filmworkers. Out in the mountains of Central Portugal, CASA PIP is a place where we hope people can come and work on their projects, or think through their ideas, play with something, experiment with something, read a damn book, look at the sky, swim in the river, write a script, experiment with light or color or sound, with motion, with time, draw something, rehearse something, lie down and rest, make lunch. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






In one full month at the residency, there are many opportunities to make lunch, and it just happens to be true that great ideas can be born while making lunch, just as they can while doing any of the above, or any other thing on the infinite list of human activities. We designed this place to let filmmakers be the artists and the individual humans that they are and work on whatever it is they need to work on in whatever way they think they need to work on it. We want to remove all the rules and the mentorships and the critiques and the guides and the script doctors and offer just a peaceful, free space for artists and their projects to blossom in their own particular, unique way.

CASA PIP was inspired in part by the generosity of our dear friend, Bruno Caetano, the impossibly humble animation filmmaker who, among his many impressive credits, produced the Academy Award-nominated short film “Ice Merchants.” Bruno offered us the use of his family cottage in a tranquil Portuguese village for us to spend some time working on our screenplays. In his lovely cottage we sat, thinking, writing, lunching, amid the sound of goats chatting and the musical clanking of their bells, amid the sound of the breeze in the eucalyptus trees, amid the overwhelming aroma of those same trees, the humidity floating softly in the October air. There, in his house in the mountains eating chips, we wrote our scripts with confidence and inspiration, with a gushing-forth of ideas and an absence of external criticism that was unlike any other experience we'd had in the film industry.

 










Both of us have had our share of experience doing labs and residencies in various parts of the world, but we noticed a discrepancy between film residencies and the residencies offered to artists working in other forms. This form that we know and love, that we're so passionate about, just didn't seem to be treated very much like an art form. Film labs and residencies don't really encourage you to trust yourself as an artist. Rather, you are given guidance on what to change, how to shape your project to address external feedback or make it more market-standard.

We dreamed of a space where film is treated properly like an art form, where its makers are encouraged to play and think and experiment, a place where they could fail with pleasure, because so often we can find something amazing in our failure, something special, something that would otherwise never have been discovered. We wanted to offer a space that doesn't guide artists towards any particular outcome, but instead encourages them to trust their gut. And we wanted it to be free-of-charge, to invite artists across the economic spectrum, not just the ones with the independent means to afford a month's stay in Europe.

It is with this in mind that we launch CASA PIP, a free residency, open to anyone who works in any field of the film industry: writers, directors, actors, production designers, script supervisors, all are welcome. While we both know first-hand how much a writer and director can benefit from time and space to work in peace, without anyone looking over their shoulder, we believe that's also true about every other discipline in film. If we think of film as an art form, then all of the people who make films are artists. And we believe that every film would be incalculably richer if every single one of the people working on them had an opportunity to give just their part of it this kind of undivided attention and unsupervised experimentation.

 










So after years of holding this dream, at last, we have lovingly designed and furnished a small house in a remote and friendly village in the mountains of Central Portugal. Each selected resident will have the house to themselves, for free, for a period of up to one month. We have done our best to make this a space that is conducive to peace, inspiration, and experimentation. 

To select these residents, we have assembled an international jury. Jesse Cumming is the associate curator of the Wavelengths program at TIFF, as well as having programmed for Hot Docs, MoMA, Anthology Film Archives, and ICA London. Ana David is the official program advisor to Berlinale, and programs for Oslo/Fusion, BFI London Film Festival, and Queer Lisboa. Winnie Wang is the winner of both the International Documentary Association's 2022 Getting Real Fellowship and the Toronto Film Critics' Association's 2024 Emerging Critic Award, and is an industry programmer at TIFF. These three will review all applications and make their decisions by the end of January 2026.

We are excited to be opening our doors to the public and launching our call for submissions in October, almost exactly two years after our stay at our friend Bruno's cottage. In fact, we are in the residency house now, writing this essay in between putting the last touches on the decoration and the design. We can confirm that the crows have now left. A rooster just … howled? It's time for lunch.

 










CASA PIP opens for applications on Wednesday, October 15. Residencies begin in 2026. For more information and to apply, please visit: www.casapip.com

Over the past few years, California-based singer and multi-instrumentalist Madison Cunningham has become an industry darling for her virtuosic guitar playing. She's quietly ubiquitous: opening for Hozier and Harry Styles, appearing on albums by Lucius and Mumford & Sons, performing with Sara Bareilles and Chris Thile, and recording a Buckingham Nicks covers album with Andrew Bird. Her résumé may be highly NPR-friendly, but her work is often genuinely challenging. Her 2022 song “In From Japan” is a solid example of Cunningham's capabilities as a songwriter and guitarist: a lightly psychedelic, heavily syncopated 7/4 ballad that's delightfully inside-baseball about the commodification of music. “Watermark/They're trying to own the image nature carved/Well, metadata won't support your cause,” she sings. She fully came into her own on her second studio album, the Grammy-winning album Revealer, made in 2022 with a team of industry veterans like Matt Chamberlain, Dan Wilson, and Mike Elizondo.

Shortly after Revealer's success, Cunningham met Prince's former guitarist, Wendy Melvoin.  “You have something to say, and you aren't saying it yet,” Melvoin told her, and played her Martha Wainwright's confrontational classic “Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole.” Months later, Cunningham divorced her husband of five years (she'd known him since they were teens in church) and ditched her guitar for a piano-based album indebted to Joni Mitchell's Blue (she'd previously recorded a cover of “California”). As with Cunningham's other music, the lush presentation of Ace disguises unexpected chord changes and unconventional time signatures. Here, it's a perfect strategy for a record about the disintegration of a seemingly perfect relationship. The orchestral arrangements, by Cunningham, yMusic's Rob Moose, Philip Krohnengold, and Mercury Rev's Jesse Chandler, often approach Joanna Newsom territory, something Cunningham hasn't tried before. While Ace is quieter and less accessible than her past work, it's just as musically sophisticated, with newfound chamber-pop grandeur.

Cunningham is a classic “musician's musician,” her songs dense with time signature hops and jazzy voicings. Even the earthy acoustic song “Wake” comes with an uneasy melody, with Fleet Foxes' Robin Pecknold's offering dissonant harmonies that sound like a worn-out Simon & Garfunkel vinyl wavering in pitch. And there's a lot of grief and animosity simmering underneath even Ace's quieter songs.On “Skeletree,” Cunningham teases, “Something's got to give” over a dense groove, until she finally shouts, “I don't trust what you say/But I've come to lose my faith in everyone” as the trembling strings and electric guitars finally break through.

The album's central theme is one of untangling yourself from someone else, particularly after anger and betrayal. Cunningham doesn't go into specifics, but her lyrics are loaded anyway. On “My Full Name,” she sings, “Your brother only shares your family shame/But he doesn't really know you”; on “Mummy,” she sings, “I'm the oldest of five/The first to be torn/In your mother's eyes/You were the firstborn”—a line with enough baggage to outfit an entirely different song. “Mummy” sounds like a whimsical lullaby, or one of Regina Spektor's artsier moments, but it contains some of Cunningham's most incisive lyrics. First she blames herself—“I never could explain myself, the hurt that I feel, the hurt that I cause”—then she turns the same words against an ex. The truth of what actually happened feels deliberately out of reach, much like a partner can “know every mole and skin tag” (“Take Two”) and still not actually understand their lover.

Ace is the work of a mature, controlled songwriter. The album largely avoids the clichés of the divorce postmortem, earning its more plainspoken lines like, “Some days I hate you so much/I want you back.” Even when the music is more conventional, Cunningham fits in a cutting line—as on the very '70s soft-rock “Beyond that Moon,” where she sings, “I'd stay under your skin if I were convinced that there were room.” Only lead single “My Full Name”  keeps things a little too simple, lacking the complex sentiments and intricate arrangements that make this album special. Ace rewards close listening; from a stately chamber-folk album, something quietly unrelenting emerges.

Some say that, when King Arthur pulled Excalibur from the stone, it marked him as the sovereign ruler of Britain. It's hard not to feel the same way about PinkPantheress when she samples Underworld's “Dark & Long” or “Romeo” by Basement Jaxx, or lets out a “Wow, wow, wow!” at the end of her surprise summer hit “Illegal” like she's the second coming of Cassie from Skins. Pink, along with Oasis and Olivia Dean, has made British identity chic again this year, maybe for the first time since Alexa Chung released her iconic It book more than a decade ago. If you need proof, listen to Bladee's verse on his new remix of Pink's “Stateside,” in which the Swedish musician shouts out regions of the UK like he's DJ Pharris dropping Chicago references on “Cold:” Midlands, Highlands, Sussex, Yorkshire, Croydon, Knightsbridge…

Such is Pink's power: Since releasing her second mixtape, Fancy That, in May, the 24-year-old has proven she has a preternatural ability to make the most outré-normie references feel like they're on the bleeding edge of cool. Her Glastonbury set was introduced by Louis Theroux and possessed what my friend described as a “Britain's Got Talent aesthetic,” and it was one of the festival's best. Fans affectionately read Pink's style, but none of them have a bag collaboration with Diane V and Dover Street Market, do they? Fancy Some More?, Pink's new Fancy That remix project, doesn't have the ultraconceptual bent of Charli XCX's Brat remix project from last year, but it moves with the same swagger: Like, who else would have the cheek, ingenuity, and clout to gather all these people under one roof?

Fancy Some More?'s remixes are split into two discs, one featuring vocalists and the other producers. (The release also includes a third disc, featuring the original tape.) Scanning the guest list is, I imagine, what it's like to flick through Pink's iPod. On the vocalist side, you have K-pop stars (SEVENTEEN and Yves from LOONA) alt-pop it girls (Oklou, Rachel Chinouriri, Ravyn Lenae, Bladee), and centrist stars with underground clout (Zara Larsson, JADE, Kylie Minogue, JT, Sugababes). The producer disc mostly features artists who bore clear influence on Fancy That (Basement Jaxx, Groove Armada, Joe Goddard) alongside upstart locals (Nia Archives, Leod, Kilimanjaro) and also Kaytranada, seemingly kept on retainer by the major labels for any remixing needs. The project is rounded out by a coterie of Brazilians—Anitta, DJ Caio Prince, Adame DJ, and Mochakk—which, with any luck, signals the sound of future PinkPantheress music.

The vast majority of these remixes totally bang, and many of them serve the function of wish fulfillment. Have you (like me) ever wanted “Illegal” to feel even faster and more disorienting? Nia Archives, London's premiere young junglist, makes the whole song feel like a 90-degree drop on a rollercoaster. Have you been scouring SoundCloud for a mashup of “Stateside” with its spiritual forebear, Kylie Minogue's “Slow”? Here's la grand dame herself whispering “Are you ready for me?” and eliciting goosebumps when she sings “Never met an Aussie girl, you say.” The sky seems to crack wide open when the Sugababes drop into “Nice to Know You” and provide a hi-fi rendition of the hook Pink sampled on the original version of the track.

The most effective remixes flip the original songs on their head: Basement Jaxx turn “Tonight,” one of the least dance-forward tracks on Fancy That, into a throbbing, shimmery big-room banger, its five-minute runtime practically begging for a 12” version. Meanwhile, Caio Prince and Adame traverse baile funk, Miami bass, and fight-ready big beat on their flip of the previously lightweight “Stars.” Oklou drags the Basement Jaxx sample on “Girl Like Me” as far out of its original context as she can take it, making the liberated refrain of “Let it all go” sound less like dancefloor hedonism and more like a desperate attempt to get over a lingering heartbreak.

With the exception of Kaytranada's “Girl Like Me”—which sounds roughly the same as every other Kaytranada remix in recent memory—it feels like all these tracks were made with a level of care uncommon for a major label remix album, which so often feel easy cash grabs or attempts to prolong an album cycle that's running out of steam. Fancy Some More? feels like a rowdy, well-earned celebration and reaffirms the main ideas PinkPantheress has gestured toward for much of the year: Heavy reference doesn't inherently go hand-in-hand with a lack of ingenuity. Successive generations of dance producers don't have to be at war with each other. Pop music, done right, can feel like the key to a world that's smarter, more free, and way more fun.

In January of 2000, a snowstorm blanketed the Washington, D.C., area—up to 17 inches, unexpectedly. But I didn't care about any of that: D'Angelo's Voodoo was set to come out that week, and I needed the roads to be clear enough to drive my mom's silver Dodge Dynasty up the street to buy the CD. Come hell, high water, or black ice, and with enough cash for the album and nothing else, I needed to hear “Untitled (How Does It Feel)” on blast. The radio rip on cassette had run its course.

This was the era when album releases were kinetic, when you had to physically show up at the record store, put the money down, and tear the plastic off the case. And it didn't get more dynamic than D'Angelo, the singer, multi-instrumentalist, and producer born Michael Eugene Archer, who died earlier this week at 51.

Reluctantly, D'Angelo had become a star. He had already helped pioneer the neo-soul genre as a blend of classic R&B and hip-hop. The anticipation for his next work only heightened when “Untitled”—with its sultry and audacious video, featuring only a warm light on a naked D'Angelo—made him a sex symbol. But he wasn't just that: Co-produced with Raphael Saadiq, “Untitled” was an extraordinary song, a seven-minute implosion of desire and transcendence, on which the divine and the erotic co-mingled until they were indistinguishable. Voodoo was rife with moments like these: A planet unto itself, with its own gravity and humidity—staggering, murky, and gorgeous.

Five years prior, D'Angelo had already altered the music landscape with his debut album Brown Sugar, which sounded like a nod to the past and a declaration of the future. Because Voodoo dominates much of the conversation around D'Angelo, it's easy to forget how radical Brown Sugar was upon its release in 1995. Radio R&B sounded slick with drum machines tuned to perfection. The singers themselves were adorned in silk suits or white linen, singing on beaches or in mansions somewhere. Then here comes D'Angelo with his straight-back cornrows and baggy jeans, singing about the pleasures of weed through a honeyed voice, his timbre somewhat rough as if this 21-year-old kid had lived a lifetime.

All smoke and sweat, full of gospel phrasing and hip-hop undertones, Brown Sugar introduced D'Angelo as an emotive, smooth-talking vocalist, a thinking, feeling performer in the likeness of Marvin Gaye, Donny Hathaway, and Curtis Mayfield without borrowing too heavily from any of them. It was clear that he had lived and breathed those luminaries and exhaled something new. D'Angelo had cracked the door to a different kind of masculinity: laid-back yet attentive, stoic yet loving, a confessional tone conveying lust, romance, heartbreak, and devotion.

By the time Voodoo arrived, D'Angelo had gone inward, reeling from the attention he received after Brown Sugar, burrowing into the very DNA of Black soul and rock music. “I sort of went through this tunnel, through gospel, blues, and a lot of old soul, old James Brown, early, early Sly and the Family Stone, and a lot of Jimi Hendrix,” he told Interview Magazine in 1999. “It's been a journey doing this album. I learned a lot about music, myself, and where I want to go musically.”

Recorded at Electric Lady Studios—a space built by Jimi Hendrix—Voodoo was the product of the Soulquarians movement: Questlove on drums, Pino Palladino on bass, Saadiq dropping in, Roy Hargrove tracing trumpet lines through the ether. They weren't chasing a sound so much as conjuring it. Voodoo wasn't just a great album; it was seismic and revolutionary, a study in sonic texture as world-building. It was the way the music seemed to lag just a touch, the bass wobbling, the intent behind it.

Analog by design, the album's imperfections became the groove; listening to it felt like eavesdropping on a jam session between the musical ancestors D'Angelo coveted so much. In 2001, Voodoo won Best R&B Album at the 43rd annual Grammy Awards, then a decade of silence followed. Weary from the public fixation on his body, which threatened to overshadow the music itself, D'Angelo disappeared into years of grief and addiction, popping up for the occasional feature, though remaining very much in the bunker. In that silence, the aura of D'Angelo only grew wider. Indirectly, he taught his peers that groove could be elastic, that blemishes are fine.

I still remember that random night in December 2014 when D'Angelo's third album, Black Messiah, dropped without warning during another period of national unrest. Michael Brown and Eric Garner had been killed by law enforcement that summer, and the streets were thick with protest. Once again, America was showing how it's always felt about Black people, and here came D'Angelo with a work that sounded like a dispatch from both the front lines and the spirit realm. “1000 Deaths,” with all its distortion and chaos, leapt quickly into motion, supplanting D'Angelo's voice beneath the weight of its dense mix. “The Charade” was all reflection, opening with the flicker of a guitar, a Prince-inspired rhythm, and lyrics that cut straight to it. “All we wanted was a chance to talk,” D'Angelo sang, his falsetto hovering above the funk, “instead we only got outlined in chalk.”

This was a new guitar-wielding D'Angelo, in a bandana or a top hat, more Sly and George Clinton than seductive soul crooner. That he titled the album Black Messiah was no small thing: eschewing the slow-burn sensuality of Voodoo and the gospel-soul of Brown Sugar, D'Angelo aimed for something sentimental and prayerful, a resurrection of sorts. He came back weathered and scarred. I could hear the years in his voice, the gravel and the tenderness. But I could also hear resilience. I could see the armor of a man who'd wrestled with demons and the industry and lived to testify.

“I don't know if I'm comfortable being quote-unquote a leader,” he told the Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale in 2015. “But I do realize and understand that my role as a musician, and in the medium that I am, that people are listening to me. Kids are listening to me. We have power to influence minds and influence lives. So I respect that power. I really do. I'm not putting myself on a pedestal or anything like that. I think that's dangerous. When you start playing with that, and you're not careful, you can get yourself into trouble.”

Still, D'Angelo's declaration mattered. His survival mattered. Because so much about being Black in America is about endurance, the daily negotiation between visibility and erasure, between power and stillness. D'Angelo traced that journey on his own terms, from youthful bravado to hard-earned grace, temptation to ultimate salvation.

Occasionally over the years, I would think about that drive in my mom's old car—the transmission slipping in and out, the heat on high—and I would consider the communion I had with D'Angelo's music. Then and always, it's a conversation about art and endurance, how we love and lose and rebuild ourselves. D'Angelo's impact on soul music can't be measured by charts or sales. It's in the way his songs linger, how he inverted the genre and expanded its vocabulary. That, to me, is the heart of his genius: his ability to draw upon decades of genealogy, giving us the permission to feel everything—on its own time.

Amber Mark has mastered the art of honoring tradition without getting hamstrung by it. Like Brittany Howard and Nourished by Time, she's comfortable in the present as well as the past, and she can bend both to her needs. The New York-based singer and producer has covered Eddie Kendricks and Sade, and she leans toward arrangements inspired by the layered vocals and instrumentation of '80s soul and funk. Like the FCC-friendly stars of old, she even cusses sparingly and tends to pine for touch rather than sex. “Hate sleeping by myself these nights/The empty space fills up my mind,” Mark sang achingly on her first record. It's easy to lose track of the year when listening to her music.

Three Dimensions Deep, Mark's space-themed debut, charted a new age journey of self-discovery through R&B and pop. She continued the adventure on last year's breezy EP Loosies, effortlessly sliding from swinging synth-funk to thumping house and druggy sing-rap. Mark manages the sweep of Janelle Monáe or Bruno Mars with half the sweat and none of the wardrobe changes. She treats R&B's many eras as heritage, language, rather than costume, a fluency that guides her latest record, Pretty Idea. The album is a compact but expansive survey of the genre built on slick grooves, stacked melodies, and deep heartache.

Mark knows she's not reinventing the wheel. When asked what inspired her latest album, she deadpanned, “Boys.” She went on to explain the record came on the heels of a return to dating after the end of a long-term relationship, but the one-word answer fits. Pretty Idea is a tight 37 minutes of disco, funk, and R&B, laser-focused on the big questions. What is love? Is it supposed to make you feel insane? Is it necessary to be happy? The familiarity of these concerns, and the sounds through which Mark explores them, is the point. Tradition is less an altar she worships at and more the point of departure for her voyage to the land beyond heartbreak.

The album is loosely structured as a wayward path to self-acceptance. Mark begins with poise, vowing on “By the End of the Night” to rebound on the dancefloor. She's quickly swooning, swathing a new paramour in her perfume on the buoyant “ooo” and going “weak in the knees” on the sprung “Sweet Serotonin.” “Too Much” features a nifty interpolation of Usher's “My Boo” as she second-guesses her enthusiasm. “Is it too much if I'm thinking about you daily?” she sings coyly, more to herself than her crush. By the album's end, she's removed enough from the doomed relationship to consider her own role in its demise. “Your touch when I'm coming home/It's a pretty idea, a pretty idea,” she croons on the title track. “Who's the one that did you wrong?/Maybe I did, maybe I did.”

Mark doesn't really tell stories in her songs; she lives the turmoil, her lithe vocals tracing the flutters of the heart. Survival anthem “Problems” showcases her range, her voice variously a coo, a wail, and a feathery prayer as she tries to will away stress. Folk ballad “Cherry Reds” clings to a warm memory like an heirloom: “Smoking Cherry Reds/In the trees,” Mark trills in her smooth upper register, stretching the last word into four wounded syllables. She's just as pained on “Let Me Love You,” where her background vocals become increasingly distressed. The sticky hook—“Why won't you let me love you?”—is an exclamation by the song's end.

The open spaces and pained harmonies of quiet storm are the go-to style for R&B singers working through such dark nights of the soul, but that's one tradition Pretty Idea breaks from. The core producers—Mark, One Direction songwriters Julian Bunetta and John Ryan, and duo Two Fresh—supply a dense, full-band sound. The arrangements are shimmery and lush, every little crevice filled with (at minimum) keys, synths, rhythm guitar, and background vocals. It's as if they've spackled all the negative space that defined Three Dimensions Deep. When the drums drop out on “Sweet Serotonin"" and “Too Much,” finger snaps reminiscent of the days when T-Pain and The-Dream ran urban radio subtly keep the meter. And on duet “Different Places,” which channels the warped funk of For All We Know, guitar melodies swell and recede as Mark and John Ryan trade woes. “You and I/Have we fallen out of love yet?/Doing all these circles/Round around the subject,” Mark sings. These songs are retro, but they're not stagnant.

That's a hard balance to strike. The past goes for cheap, in spirit if not actual cost (chill, JNCO). What if all the best things have already happened? What if all the sweet serotonin your brain struggles to produce because you're too pumped full of dread and cortisol could be solved by Alien:Earth or Supreme Clientele 2 or Toy Story 5? Pretty Idea is an album about boys, of course. But I admire its regular relationship to the past. Mark presents R&B's archives not as sacred texts or exotic loot but as context, precedent, pearls from grandma's attic that can look nice if you style them just so. This customization is what pushes her music past pastiche. Mark's boys are all hers.

							By 

	Nikki McCann Ramirez



	A bombshell report detailing virulently racist and antisemitic text messages shared among members of Young Republicans groups from across the nation has pulled back the veil on how the next generation of GOP leaders talk when they think no one is watching. 


	“Can we fix the showers? Gas chambers don't fit the Hitler aesthetic.” 


	“I'd go to the zoo if I wanted to watch monkey play ball.”


	“You're giving nationals [too] much credit and expecting the Jew to be honest.”


	“I love Hitler.” 


Politico's investigation, published Tuesday, found hundreds of text messages disparaging minorities, women, and religious groups. The report counted 251 uses of slurs like the n-word, and f****t. The report was met by widespread revulsion — by most.


	The chat's members were distributed across Young Republicans chapters from New York, Kansas, and Vermont. Many have already established footholds in the politics of their state and beyond. These include 27-year-old Vermont state Senator Samuel Douglass, Trump administration employee Michael Bartels, and Bobby Walker, who once worked for New York state Senate Minority Leader Rob Ortt. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Unsurprisingly — given the generally caustic tone taken by the Republican party towards minorities and migrants — some prominent conservative lawmakers and commentators jumped to defend the participants. 


	Perhaps most notable among the white knights was Vice President J.D. Vance, who downplayed the texts by comparing them to a leaked message from Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for Virginia attorney general. Jones has come under fire this month after 2022 text messages in which he expressed a desire to shoot the former Virginia House speaker were made public. 

	











	“This is far worse than anything said in a college group chat, and the guy who said it could become the AG of Virginia. I refuse to join the pearl clutching when powerful people call for political violence,” Vance wrote Tuesday on social media. Jones has, in fact, been condemned by members of his own party. Jones is also one man, making condemnable statements, not a large group of politically minded individuals producing, sharing, and celebrating the very hate they claim to revile.

	Vance addressed the texts on The Charlie Kirk Show later on Wednesday. “Focus on the real issues,” he said. “Don't focus on what kids say in group chats.” He then suggested that whoever leaked the racist messages is a “scumbag.”


	“Kids do stupid things,” he continued. “Especially young boys. They tell edgy, offensive jokes. That's what kids do.”


	It also bears noting that while “Young Republicans” may sound like a group composed of baby-fresh, underdeveloped prefrontal cortexes, the national organization accepts members of the Republican Party between the ages of 18 and 40. Some of those in the chat were not only well past their collegiate career, but held leadership positions within Young Republicans and had  cultivated relationships with members of the Trump administration. Regardless, Vance and others are pretending that those implicated should be given the benefit of childhood naivete for fantasizing about putting their opponents in gas chambers. 


	“I literally do not care what a bunch of magger college kids said in a group chat,” right-wing streamer and commentator Tim Pool wrote on  X.

	Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich took a similar tact, writing that “Young Republicans blowing off steam in immature group texts isn't in the same universe as a powerful Democrat fantasizing about killing kids. Couldn't give a crap less about that nonsense.” 


	The Daily Wire's Matt Walsh also seized on Jones' texts to excuse the chat's participants. “The Virginia AG candidate fantasized about murdering children and no Democrat at any level called for him to resign or denounced him in any serious way. Meanwhile a few college kids make edgy jokes in a group chat and conservatives are tripping over themselves to denounce and disavow and call for firings and resignations,” he wrote. 


	Several members of the chat have already been forced out of their jobs in Republican politics amid the fallout. Peter Giunta, former Chair of the New York State Young Republicans, has left his position in New York Assemblymember Mike Reilly's office.  Joseph Maligno, former General Counsel for the New York Young Republicans, has left his position in the New York State Unified Court System, per Politico. 












	In a statement issued on social media, Young Republicans wrote that they “are appalled by the vile and inexcusable language” used by their members. “Such behavior is disgraceful, unbecoming of any Republican, and stands in direct opposition to the values our movement represents. Those involved must immediately resign from all positions within their state and local Young Republican organizations. We must hold ourselves to the highest standards of integrity, respect, and professionalism,” they wrote. 


	Really, though, the racist messages and the corresponding minimization by Republicans speak to a conservative culture that clings to bigotry as a unifying force of identity — a pattern that has only been reinforced in the Trump era. 


	On Wednesday, the official Facebook and Instagram accounts of the U.S. Border Patrol posted  — and later deleted — videos using the original version and lyrics of Michael Jackson's “They Don't Care About Us.” The song, which was rerecorded in 1995, originally included the lyrics “Jew me, sue me.”


	On Tuesday, the official X account for the Department of Homeland Security posted “Remigrate” on X. Remigration is a fascist concept developed in the mid-20th Century by European white nationalists advocating for the mass expulsion of minorities and immigrants to their nations of origin.

	And of course there is the bullhorn of anti-minority, xenophobic rhetoric emanating from the resident himself, who just over the course of the last year has described migrants as pet-eating terrorists who are poisoning the blood of the nation. 


	It's no wonder the up-and-coming ranks of politically active youngish Republicans feel emboldened to speak in the way that they did to each other in the leaked messages. They have a mirror in the White House, and defenders all around them.

	The government shutdown has been dragging on for two weeks. It's been a dystopian stretch for America's military and veteran community. The stoppage, led by President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress, has frozen military pay, leaving active-duty military families wondering how they will pay their mortgages, feed their kids, and afford life-saving medicine.


	House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) recently went on C-SPAN, where he fielded a question from an American whose husband serves, and who suffers from PTSD from two tours in Afghanistan. She was not happy, noting that if they miss a paycheck their children won't be able to get the medication they need to survive. “As a Republican, I'm very disappointed in my party, and I'm very disappointed in you, because you have the power to call the House back,” the caller said. “You refuse to do that just for a show.”


	Johnson responded by saying he was sorry and blaming Democrats.

	Trump also blamed Democrats in a Truth Social post a few days later, writing that the administration has “identified funds” to pay the troops. Congress has appropriated those funds elsewhere, though, and it's unclear if the president can redirect them. Regardless, the uncertainty has military families literally worried for their lives as Republicans continue to keep the government closed over their insistence on gutting Medicaid, the health care program serving low-income and disabled Americans.

	











Veterans are also being squeezed. The Trump administration has announced mass layoffs across the federal work source, which employs one third of veterans, many of which are disabled. Several Department of Veterans Affairs programs have ceased operating during the shutdown, as well. The fact that the layoffs will disproportionately affect the men and women who have served doesn't seem to be of any concern to the president. 

	











	The Office of Management and Budget — headed by Project 2025 mastermind Russell Vought — confirmed Friday that “substantial” reductions in force, or RIFs, have begun across multiple federal agencies, including the Departments of Education, Treasury, and Health and Human Services. These are not abstract bureaucratic cuts; they are the livelihoods of men and women who have already served their country. Nearly one-third of the federal workforce is composed of veterans, many of them disabled. Now, they face unemployment not because of performance but because of politics.

	Meanwhile, almost unbelievably, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that the U.S. military will be outsourcing at least part of Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho to the Qatari government. Even some of Trump's most fervent allies in right-wing media have been aghast at the decision, citing Qatar's connections to terrorism, including the 9/11 attacks. Many veterans feel betrayed, just as they have been since Trump took office and started gutting their jobs and services earlier this year.


	At a time when America's military families are already under immense strain, the actions the administration has taken since the shutdown began represent something far more dangerous than neglect. They signal a quiet dismantling of the institutions that sustain our all-volunteer force and the post-service opportunities veterans have earned. The mass layoffs of federal employees, the decision to allow a foreign government to operate on U.S. soil, and a shutdown that threatens to withhold pay from active-duty troops all point to one chilling truth: America's service members and veterans are under assault.


	This progression is deeply suggestive of Vladimir Putin's path to autocratic consolidation in Russia. What took Putin decades to construct — the hollowing out of independent institutions and empowerment of intelligence services, the marginalization or elimination of rivals, the suppression of meaningful civic and economic pluralism, the deployment of private or semiprivate security forces — and what Trump seems to be laying the foundation for amount to rewriting the rules to stay in power indefinitely.

	For Putin, this was a calculated strategy to preserve Russia's global influence even as its economy contracted to roughly the size of Texas. Over the years, the country's wealth shifted from the hands of ordinary citizens to a small circle of oligarchs — and ultimately, to Putin himself. Sound familiar?

	Trump and Republicans in Congress could end this shutdown in a second. They won't because this chaos is by design. We're watching the very class of public servants who protect our democracy — the only ones capable of stopping a coup against the U.S. Constitution — being dismantled and replaced right before our eyes.

	Last month, Nicki Minaj revealed the release date for her sixth studio album. The follow-up to 2023's Pink Friday 2 would arrive on March 27, 2026, the rapper announced on social media. A few weeks have passed since the date was set, but Minaj has hit pause on her countdown.


	“Ok I'm not going to put out the album anymore,” she wrote today on social platform X. “No more music.” At the end of the post, Minaj added, “Hope you're happy now” and tagged Jay-Z's account. Bidding her fans farewell, she wrote, “Bye, Barbz. Love you for life.”


	To its credit, her fan base has been calling her bluff in response. The replies to the post express full disregard for the statement with fans stating that they simply don't believe her.


	Reps for Minaj did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.

	In the posts that preceded the apparent album cancellation, Minaj spoke about dissenters who “don't want me to put out music.” Without explicitly naming any parties, she continued, “Me winning makes them feel like they lost. They're right. However, it didn't have to be this way. Lots of ppl part ways in business. They know how successful my next album is going to be.”

	











	In other posts, Minaj criticized Roc Nation CEO Desiree Perez, nodding to discontent between her and the label. She specifically referenced a legal battle in which she and husband Kenneth Petty were ordered to pay $500,000 to a security guard over an alleged backstage altercation that left the man with a broken jaw. The ruling was issued from a Los Angeles judge in March 2024.

	











	Minaj commented on a TikTok post from Page Six that claimed she has “refused” to pay the court ordered amount. “Desiree Perez you mad. Ahhhhahahaaaaaaa,” she wrote. “CONSPIRACY. FALSE IMPROSONMENT. CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS!!!! ROC NATION CEO. ААНААААНННААААА.”

Nothing you say will stop what's to come. Cry harder 👁️ I THINK UR GOING TO JAIL DESIREE!!!  casiNOPE pic.twitter.com/q48iGrEB2W


	In her X post about the parties allegedly pushing back on her album, Minaj said, “Tried to sign Wayne, Drake, me. So they keep wanting to take or stop my money simply b/c narcissists believe what you work hard for belongs to them. Fuming b/c they can't siphon anymore energy, money, blessings, love, grace, joy, PEACE… the culture. No successful tours. Just vibes & payola.”


	Fans will have to wait until March to see whether Minaj was truly bluffing, though they've been looking forward to a new project from the rapper since September 2024. At the time, she announced plans to release an entirely new album rather than an extensive deluxe version of Pink Friday 2. “The new music is just too good to be thrown away on a deluxe album,” she said. “Last night, the songs I recorded were just way too iconic.”

T
he Palace Theater in Los Angeles was an odd place for a punk show. Its stage once featured worldwide stars like Harry Houdini. For many years it was an ornate movie theater. On this night in 2023, however,  the cavernous five-story building was filled with bearded, flannel-wearing, middle-aged former punks, most of whom came to see Nineties punk titans Unwound play a reunion for the 20th birthday of the archival record label Numero Group. One of these middle-aged punks (sans the beard and flannel) was a youth swimming coach named Chris Sheppard. As Sheppard wandered the venue he overheard a group of men about his age talking about one of the bands playing that night: “Who the hell is this band? How did they end up on this bill?” 


	The band was Everyone Asked About You — and Sheppard is a guitarist and one of the singers. The question cut deep, since Sheppard was already nervous about performing in front of the 3,000-plus in attendance (the largest show his band had ever played by several orders of magnitude). But it was also a question he and his bandmates had been asking themselves for months. How did they end up here? 

	











	Guitarist Collins Kilgore and keyboardist John Beachboard had asked their wives to stand by the front of the stage so there'd at least be someone there for them to play to. “When we started playing the first note,” Beachboard says, “they were thrown out of the way by kids immediately moshing and dancing.”

	“As soon as we walked out onstage, it was a bum rush of hundreds of teenagers and young 20-year-olds just running to the front of the stage,” Sheppard says. “Security didn't know what to do.” 

	











	“I think they were just as stunned as we were,” says Beachboard of their wives. “Because I think they were like, ‘Let's go up there and support our idiot husbands up there playing their little guitars and their little keyboards.'”  


	“We had a stage diver at that show,” Sheppard says. “We never played a stage tall enough to dive off of before.”

	Sheppard started Everyone Asked About You with his friends back in Little Rock, Arkansas, in the late 1990s when they were all teenagers. At the time, Little Rock punched well above its weight within the niche emo and hardcore scenes, anchored by bands like Chino Horde (whose guitarist, Jason White, went on to play for Green Day) and Soophie Nun Squad. After a few years, like most high school groups, Everyone Asked About You broke up and went their separate ways, never to think about the band again. In Sheppard's case, he stopped playing music altogether. “I sold all of my musical equipment in 2000 to move to Boston,” he says. “I hadn't played the guitar in 22 years.” 


	That was supposed to be the end of Everyone Asked About You. Then one day in 2015, Sheppard saw a YouTube video that would blow his mind. It was a recording of a band in Japan onstage playing the songs he'd written with his friends two decades ago. He says, “That was the first time I had any inclination that people outside of the, like, 65 people that ever saw us back in the Nineties knew who we were.”


	CHRIS SHEPPARD MET DRUMMER LEE BUFORD at Little Rock Central High School, and the two of them formed a band called the Low End Theory, playing Unwound-inspired noise rock. Eventually they started listening to bands like Rainer Maria and Braid, bands that came to define the “Midwest emo” sound of the 1990s, a softer and more melodic style of hardcore. The two began experimenting with their sound. Kilgore, who was a couple of years behind them at Central High, joined them for practice sessions. “What we were playing was lots of major chords. It had that pretty vibe, but the songs were fundamentally sad,” Kilgore says. They decided they needed a vocalist, preferably a female, to round out the group. Buford had noticed Hannah Vogan hanging around the benches on Kavanaugh Boulevard, a popular spot for Little Rock punk kids to congregate. He found out she went to the private school Pulaski Academy. He also found out she was taking opera lessons. Buford introduced himself, and invited her to join their band.

	The name Everyone Asked About You came from a children's book Buford found at Books-a-Million. Their songs had names like “Paper Airplanes, Paper Hearts” and “Sometimes Memory Fails Me Sometimes.” They played their first show with the local heroes Soophie Nun Squad, a chaotic band with anywhere from seven to 12 members, depending on the night, that played a fun and wild form of punk music that wasn't anything like Everyone Asked About You's sound. The bands they regularly played with were often aggressive, dramatic, and heavy. Their sound was more sweet and melancholy. “At the time, I wanted to be edgy and post-hardcore, post-punk kind of sound,” Kilgore says. “And then we were making this sort of twee stuff.” 


	The Little Rock punks were generally supportive of the band. “When we first started, a lot of that original Little Rock old guard had moved on and gone off to college, and it was just the high school kids left there carrying it on,” Sheppard says. “And Hannah and I were writing lyrics and singing from a perspective of kids in high school going through high school stuff.” They played in public parks and living rooms to an eclectic mix of hardcore punks, metalheads, and indie-rockers, and generally young people they knew from school and around their local scene. Their shows were always upbeat, with plenty of dancing and singing along. When they went on a short tour to play living rooms in other states, they found a less-positive reception. “I was a closeted gay kid and she was a Southern girl, and those are two perspectives that are, I think, unique within the scene that we were a part of,” Sheppard says. “And I think that's one of the reasons why I don't feel like we had any sort of traction or launch back then.” Ironically, they found that cities where there was an established “Midwest emo” scene were the toughest crowds of all. “It went over like the plague,” Kilgore jokes.  


	They put out a few singles and one full-length, all on vinyl, probably a few hundred copies of each, selling them through the mail or by hand at shows. Heartattack, a widely read hardcore zine, panned their record as “cutesy” and “queasy.” There was a feeling they were too late to their particular style of emo, and the scene had already moved on from twee teenage angst to a more technical, harder sound.


	“It had fallen a little out of vogue at that point,” says bassist Matt Bradley. 

	











	In the end, the band didn't break up out of acrimony. They simply grew up — graduating high school and moving on to jobs and college. Sheppard became a swimming coach. Vogan became a nurse. Buford became the drummer for the experimental metal band the Body (who developed a devoted cult audience with their intense and unusual sound). Bradley became a production designer for the Santa Fe, New Mexico-based art collective Meow Wolf. Beachboard opened a brewery in Little Rock. Kilgore became a lawyer in California. They mostly fell out of touch with one another. 


	IN 2015, A STUDENT AT KEIO UNIVERSITY in Tokyo was looking for some music that he and his classmates could play at an upcoming school festival. “There was a strong emo trend in our university music club,” says Akira Sasagawa, now a 33-year-old systems consultant in Japan. Sasagawa searched YouTube for old and obscure emo bands, and came across a 2012 upload of Everyone Asked About You's vinyl album. “Out of all the bands we listened to, EAAY stood out,” Sasagawa says. “We were also drawn to the low-fi, unpolished production — it gave their music a kind of authenticity that felt more real than anything overly polished ever could. It wasn't just music; it felt like someone was truly opening up to us.” 


	Unbeknownst to the members of EAAY, that YouTube video Sasagawa found already had more than 100,000 views, and interest in their band was growing. “When I first listened to that EP and the second song kicked in, I had just got into my first relationship, and something resonated with me,” says Onat Önol, who lives in Glasgow, but was a teenager living in Istanbul in 2015. That song was called “Me vs. You,” and it opens with Vogan singing the unapologetically cloying lines “Just between me and you, I think I'm in love with you/All of my waking time you're on my mind/I don't know why” over a driving drumbeat and guitar feedback. “I was just replaying it over and over, completely obsessed.” 


	“This is the definitive sound of being young, emotional, and insecure about your feelings and thoughts,” Önol says. “Which is really impossible to get right in music, for me at least. There are very few bands that I feel really get me, and that I get to a similar degree.” 


	By 2019, the YouTube video caught the attention of Ken Shipley, co-founder of the Chicago-based archival record label Numero Group. “I just thought it was cool, and it was a group from my era that I'd never heard of,” Shipley tells me. He knew Buford was a drummer in the Body, and he reached out to him through a mutual friend. Buford was skeptical, dismissive, and maybe even a little embarrassed. The Body played experimental noise and metal that is often described as “scary,” a far cry from the melodic, singsongy emo of Everyone Asked About You. “I don't think he rated the music that highly, but also, the idea that anyone would seem interested in this was pretty ludicrous,” Shipley says.

	











	Buford shared Shipley's email with his old bandmates, but they, too, wrote it off. “Lee and I laughed about it and then just kind of let it be,” Sheppard says.


	But Shipley didn't give up. He emailed Buford regularly, maybe once every six months or so, all while monitoring the growth in the band's video views and comments. “And then it wasn't until 2021 that I reached out to them and just was like, ‘Hey, I think that y'all are missing something here, and that this is having a moment,'” he says. “And how I knew that is just looking at the number of plays. The Rate Your Music reviews were super through-the-roof for it. And the YouTube comments, anytime you're seeing a song getting 400, 500, 600 comments — I mean, just affecting somebody enough to type 15 characters into a field, it's meaningful.” Eventually Shipley asked the band if they'd like to reunite and play the label's 20th-birthday party show with Unwound. At that point, Buford decided to get the band together on Zoom. 


	“I was 100 percent prepared to say, ‘Absolutely not,'” Sheppard says.


	“I definitely was like, ‘Who the fuck wants this?'” says Bradley. “Yeah, there's some YouTube video watches or whatever, but we were not a popular band in the Nineties.” 


	In the end, Beachboard convinced the rest of the band to do it. “If we were to tell this story at a bar to our friends and be like, ‘We got asked to play this big show with a bunch of our musical heroes, and we said no' — that would be a really shitty end to the story,” he says. 


	So, begrudgingly, they went to work. On Christmas 2022, they met up in Little Rock, the first time they'd all been in a room together in more than two decades. They helped one another relearn to play guitar, to sing, to be a band, and to try to reconnect with some distant, younger version of themselves. “When we first got together to play these songs that none of us had even really thought about or listened to in that 25 years, it took me straight back there to what it was like to play them and feel those things the first time,” Kilgore says. “Even our group dynamic kind of reverted back to the way that we talked to each other back then. It was fun. It was crazy. It was weird. It was a very strange experience, because I hadn't experienced anything like that in my life.” 


	“I was really good friends with Lee. I went to his wedding,” Beachboard says. “But I'm not sure we had talked in 10 years before this.” 

	











	They spent four days together rehearsing, reconnecting, and trying to find whatever it was in their music that was so captivating to the youth of today. And in February 2023, they took the stage in Los Angeles in front of the bearded, flanneled men who wondered who the hell they were, as well as the hundreds of kids who knew exactly who they were, and sang every word to every song.  


	After the show ended, they were shocked to finally come face to face with their new fans. Buford's band's booking agent told them he could get them on the bill at the San Francisco Noise Pop Festival the very next day. They've kept booking and playing more shows since then, meeting young fans — some of whom fly in from other countries just to see them. “It just keeps snowballing,” Sheppard says. “And each time I feel like it's more and more fun.”


	AS EVERYONE ASKED ABOUT YOU TOOK THE STAGE at Le Poisson Rouge in New York's West Village this spring, the packed club roared with delight. As the band played, their fans' dancing eventually turned into a mosh pit. Sheppard gently admonished the crowd: “Be careful of the people around you. Everybody enjoys music differently and you should enjoy it how you want to, but make sure you're not infringing on other people's spaces.” A cheer from the crowd, and the mosh pit turned into synchronized bouncing — pure kinetic energy — and singing loudly enough to be heard over the amplification.


	“Their fan base is so interesting. It was the coolest crowds we'd ever played for,” says Mabel Canty, the singer for the opening band that night, Birthday Girl DC. “They're probably in the same boat as us, where they've been fans for a while and never thought they'd be able to see them.” 


	Birthday Girl DC are a rising punk trio from Washington, D.C. Their members are all teenagers. In fact, on this particular night, it is Canty's 18th birthday. Canty's father and bassist Isabella Mackaye's uncle are members of the legendary D.C. punk band Fugazi. In a very real way, the tour where Birthday Girl DC opened for Everyone Asked About You personified the bridge between the Nineties punk scene and today. 


	Birthday Girl DC and Everyone Asked About You met thanks to Chris Wilson, who plays drums for the long-running punk acts Ted Leo and the Pharmacists and Titus Andronicus. When he plays with the Pharmacists, he says, “Our crowd is largely our age.” The first time he saw videos of the Everyone Asked About You show at the now-shut venue St. Vitus in Brooklyn, he was shocked at how young and energetic the audience was. When he met Birthday Girl DC during a show in Washington, he asked them if they had ever heard of Everyone Asked About You. “They literally screamed,” he says. He suggested he could introduce them, and the bands ended up touring together.

	











	Wilson went to watch the two bands play together in the basement of a Unitarian church in Philadelphia, a venue that has been hosting punk shows since 1993, where many of Everyone Asked About You's contemporaries played. Thirty years on, they played there to a crowd of teenagers who weren't even born when Everyone Asked About You first formed. Wilson, who lives in Philadelphia and attends shows at the church often, had never seen anything like it. “Seeing the younger people,” he says, “it was insane. It was like being at a show in 1995. It was incredible.” 


	“I was fully prepared for them to be dickheads,” Birthday Girl DC drummer Tess Kontarinis says, recalling her first meeting with the members of Everyone Asked About You. “But then I was like, ‘Oh, my God, these are my parents. They're my friends.' And it's an insane dynamic to have that and to make us feel so present and at home with them.” 


	“We listen to a lot of bands that are not together,” Kontarinis says. 


	“And then this band out of nowhere just reformed,” Mackaye says. 


	“With the exact same energy that they had,” finishes Canty. “I think a big reason why they still work and are so cool is because they all went on and lived really normal lives.” 


	Following its reunion in 2022, the band wrote and recorded a new album, Never Leave, for Numero Group in 2024. The music is a bit more polished, the lyrics a bit more middle-aged. Sheppard and Vogan sound different than their teenage selves, both in their voices and their lyrics, trading lines about things like cancer, death, losing your hair, giving pets anti-anxiety medication — grown-up stuff. The song “A Vigil,” written in response to the attack and death of nonbinary 16-year-old Nex Benedict in Oklahoma last year, features Sheppard earnestly crying out “Two-sided lies to save who from what? A fence post? A bathroom? A knife in the gut?” On the song “We're All Losing It,” they lament the sounds of their voices, reflect about their childhood, and in unison sing, “Wish I was an easier kid/When I was younger.” 


	Over the past couple of years, the band has continued to attract new fans, particularly through social media. “I think a lot of people discovered them through Numero, but also just on TikTok,” says Kali Flanagan, the 20-year-old bassist for the emo band Holidays in the United States. “People just using their songs in little videos.” 

	











	Everyone Asked About You songs show up in TikToks ranging from the standard fare of people getting ready for school or dancing alone in their bedrooms to clips of Ultimate Fighting Championship matches or NBA games. And when someone is curious about more than the six seconds of a song they hear on TikTok, they go looking for more. What they discover is an entire underground scene — one not too distant in the past, yet far enough to feel completely different from contemporary culture.


	“Everyone Asked About You was the first emo band that I got into,” Flanagan says. “And it was even before I knew what emo music really was.” 


	The lore and the sound of their early recordings all add to the mystery of the band for new fans. The fact that their original recordings were rough around the edges lends them some authenticity.


	“The recordings, they're fairly rough compared with a Fugazi record or something,” says Önol, the fan from Glasgow, “but they're going for it.”“Their production is they just plug in and play and then that's it,” Canty says. 


	It's a paradox, this idea that a band of people in their forties and fifties are seen by so many teenage punk kids as the most authentic representation of youth, especially when so many of the members of the band have a hard time relating to this generation. “These guys are so much less jaded and so much less uptight about music than we were,” Beachboard says. “I don't think I learned how to be that open with music until my early forties.” 


	“As open and as community-minded as we were, we were pretentious as fuck,” Bradley says. “These kids just don't have that energy.” 


	Ultimately, what could be fueling the excitement around Everyone Asked About You is the relative obscurity and unlikeliness of it all. While Bradley doesn't see teenagers as pretentious, there is a certain amount of hip “in-the-know” attitude to this band's fandom. 


	“There's a little bit of ‘I want to find something that nobody knows about,'” Sheppard says. “A lot of kids are looking for something more authentic and real.” 


	“It's just archival culture,” Flanagan says. “Finding something by itself or on its own that doesn't sound like it's from today.” 


	Shipley has built his label's success on this archival culture, and sees firsthand how young people today are mining the digital record crates for lost gems. “The Nineties are the Sixties — think about it from when you were a kid,” Shipley says. “All you heard was about peace and love and all that bullshit. And so that's just the same thing that they're hearing about the Nineties. It's like, ‘Oh, it's the last time before the internet.' They're nostalgic for a thing that they didn't get to experience.”


	“A lot of the young people are feeling some form of despair and want to be part of a community,” says Sheppard. “They're trying to figure out how to feel real connection with other people.”

	











	Today, Everyone Asked About You are preparing to go back out on tour this month, including a stop in their hometown of Little Rock. For now, this is the plan. Nobody has quit their day job. They play shows whenever they can negotiate the time off from work and their families. Meanwhile, their records continue to sell all over the world. 


	“It's worldwide. Is it massive worldwide? No, but they have an opportunity to go play in Japan, and I know that we've sold a bunch of their records in Europe, and it will grow as their notoriety grows,” Shipley says. “The more time we put into it, the bigger the thing's going to grow. And I have an enormous amount of patience for records and artists to bloom. I didn't get into this for one year, two years, or three years. This might take a decade. I'll be here.”


	The Nineties — the “last time before the internet” — represent a time when young people may have felt more connected to one another, when small things still felt really big and important, when something as superficial as a music scene still tied young people together and played a major role in forming their values, their personalities, and their friendships in ways that would last the rest of their lives. Whether that's true or not, it's something the band's fans seem to long for — and they seem to believe the band's mere existence proves it's possible.

	If a dystopic voice asking you “to fulfill your mission” of rounding up undocumented immigrants has snuck its way onto your streaming airwaves, you're far from the only one.


	In the last month, online users have reported seeing and hearing an increased amount of recruitment advertising from the Department of Homeland Security on streaming services such as Pandora, Spotify, and Max — and even during September's MTV VMAs.


	The new advertising push, which has faced intense online backlash, has followed the Trump administration's investment of $30 billion to hire at least 10,000 more deportation officers by the end of the year, according to The Associated Press. “You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city, safe,” the narrator says in some advertisements targeting local police officers. “But in sanctuary cities, you're ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.”


	In the last week, specifically, music listeners on Spotify's ad-supported free plan have reported hearing similar advertising on the platform, with some choosing to end their membership due to the ads. When reached for comment, a rep for Spotify told Rolling Stone that the DHS commercials were part of a “broad campaign” from the government agency and that it did not violate any advertising policies on the platform. “Users can mark any ad with a thumbs up or thumbs down to help manage their ads preferences,” the rep said.

	But the recruitment ads have been running on more than one music or streaming platform, with fans flagging concerns with the ads on Hulu, Max, YouTube, and Pandora, over the past six months.

	











	In a public Pandora community thread started in May 2025, a user who said they have been a Pandora user for more than 15 years shared that they were canceling their subscription due to an “overwhelming number” of DHS ads. The thread has received repeated comments from more users sharing their frustration with receiving similar advertisements.

	“This is not a random glitch. It is the result of ad targeting that equates music preference with immigration status,” read the user's note. “Your platform appears to be allowing (or enabling) ads that racially and culturally profile users based on the language of the music they enjoy.”


	In August, DHS confirmed to The Independent that it would be running advertisements on YouTube, Max, Amazon Prime Video, X, LinkedIn, and other internet platforms. Several Reddit threads discussed folks opting for VPNs to stream without receiving the ads, while others opted to cancel their subscriptions completely. “It isn't just the fact that they're advertising, it is how AWFUL the ads actually are,” wrote one user. “Forget the hateful bullshit, just the sheer stupidity of running that ad in Denver is fucking WILD,” added another.


	Similarly, Spanish-language channels such as Univision and Telemundo have also run ads featuring Kristi Noem urging “illegal aliens” not to come into the country. “Join the mission to protect America with bonuses up to $50,000 and generous benefits. Apply now join.ice.gov and fulfill your mission,” says one ad.


	When reached for comment, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Rolling Stone that there was “nothing offensive or partisan” with removing what it called criminals from the United States. “The ICE recruitment campaign is a resounding success with more than 150,000 applications rolling in from patriotic Americans answering the call to defend the Homeland by helping arrest and remove the worst of the worst from our country,” McLaughlin said.


	Earlier this month, the AP reported that ad-spends by DHS had topped $6.5 million, and that spots had been run in several major cities, including Seattle, Chicago, Washington, D.C, and Miami, aimed at recruiting local officers frustrated with their cities' immigration enforcement policies.

Justin Timberlake has paid tribute to D'Angelo, whose three solo albums — his debut, Brown Sugar, 2000's Voodoo, and 2014's Black Messiah — reshaped the landscape of soul music and helped ignite a new era. Following D'Angelo's passing on Oct. 14 at 51, Timberlake shared how the visionary's work impacted his own musical journey and how he had the opportunity to meet him backstage at Radio City Music Hall.


	“I'll never forget hearing Brown Sugar for the first time. It changed me. You changed me,” wrote Timberlake in his letter posted to Instagram Stories, calling the record the “most pivotal moment in establishing confidence in my own voice.” 


	“For the first time, I heard a sound that reflected the sounds I grew up with — early R&B but now it was intertwined with a modern edge,” he continued. “The chords and arrangement carried a mixture of church/jazz/funk, the harmonies delicately dancing with one another. It sat in my spirit and always will.”

	Timberlake went on to praise Voodoo as his “favorite mixed album of all time.” He added, “The legendary players and collaborators. The sounds, the way it made colors dance around my head. It grabbed me. It shook me. I was changed once again.” 

	











	The “Selfish” singer also said that the Voodoo tour stop at Radio City was “one of the best concerts” of his life. “You. Quest. Pino. Poyser. And everyone on that stage had just ripped the faces off that crowd,” Timberlake reminisced. “And then I was lucky enough to grab a sacred moment with you backstage. And tell you how in awe of you I was.” The singer said that his previously posted photo of him and D'Angelo was taken at that exact moment and when they met, he was “kind, under-spoken.” Timberlake added, “I will never forget that.”

	











	While Timberlake said he could go on about D'Angelo's breadth of work including his “favorite Lauryn collab,” to “put it the way I know best in this moment: you took R&B and put it in all capitals.”

	“Your contribution will always be remembered. Sending love and prayers to your family. You will be missed deeply. 1 of 1. Rip trailblazer,” wrote Timberlake before signing off, “With love. One of your biggest fans.”


	Timberlake joins a flood of artists across genres that have honored D'Angelo in tributes including Lauryn Hill, Beyoncé, Nile Rodgers, Missy Elliott, and more.

The ""MLB on FOX' crew preview the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the NLCS. 

Los Angeles Dodgers star Teoscar Hernandez revealed that he and his wife will be switching their living quarters while in Milwaukee to face the Brewers in the National League Championship Series. 

It isn't because their hotel isn't good enough, but rather, Hernandez's wife, Jennifer, is not fond of the rumors of paranormal activity connected to it.

The Pfister Hotel is historic in Milwaukee, and that's where the Dodgers have been staying for the start of this series. However, Hernandez said before Game 2 on Wednesday night that he and his wife are moving due to rumors that the Pfister Hotel is haunted.

This isn't uncommon, as Mookie Betts continues to book Airbnbs during the series in Milwaukee because of the haunting stories about the hotel. 

Hernandez said his wife heard some stories about alleged issues while staying at the Pfister from other Dodgers' significant others. The player himself doesn't care for the stories, though.

""I don't believe in ghosts,"" he said, via The New York Post. ""I have stayed in there before. I've never seen anything or heard anything.

""But my wife is on this trip, and she said she doesn't want to stay there. So we have to find another hotel. But I've been hearing from other players and other wives that it's something happening in these couple of nights.""

As for what Hernandez has heard from teammates, he said ""some of the rooms, the lights goes off and on. And the doors, there are noises, footsteps, things like that, I don't know.""

No matter the stories, Hernandez is focused on helping his team repeat as World Series champions, and he helped the cause early in Wednesday's game. Hernandez belted a home run as part of a two-run top of the second inning that gave the Dodgers the lead after the Brewers jumped ahead with a Jackson Chourio solo homer in their first trip to the plate. 

The Dodgers were able to stave off the Brewers' ninth-inning rally in Game 1 on Monday night, as Blake Treinen got Brice Turang to strike out to end the game with bases loaded for Milwaukee. 

If the Dodgers are unable to come away with a two-game lead in the best-of-seven series, there is a chance Hernandez and his wife won't have to return to Milwaukee.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — On Oct. 29 and Oct. 30, visitors to the Amway Grand Plaza hotel can attend Ghosts of the Grand, guided ghost tours of the building's restricted areas that are rumored to be haunted.

“Hear the ghost stories inside the rooms where they happen,” Candice Smith, founder of Tours Around Michigan, said. “It's a very rare occurrence.”

 Scary season: Performers at Michigan haunted house learn tricks of the terrifying trade 

The event is organized by Tours Around Michigan, a Grand Rapids group that frequently hosts haunted tours and “ghost hunting” experiences.

“On ninety-five percent of the tours I run, somebody has a (paranormal) experience,” Smith said. “Sometimes, it's the whole entire group.”

In the hallways and hotel rooms of the historic Amway Grand Plaza, Smith promises an entertaining experience for adults that's just in time for Halloween.

“It sold out very quickly last year,” Smith said.

Prior to a tour, registered participants can arrive half an hour early for a chance to order specialty cocktails and meet Rick Waid, a local paranormal author.

Some specially-designed “ghost hunting” equipment may be available to participants during the tour, too.

“It's just a way to hyperfocus on certain locations,” Smith said. “To get more of a real-time experience for people.”

Tickets begin at $55, and tours last from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. each night.

Science is supposed to be about finding and assessing facts. But when the topic turns to extraterrestrial life, much public discussion seems aimed simply to keep up hope that They're Out There. There's nothing wrong with that in principle, as long as we acknowledge the nature of the situation. Otherwise, we are building empires of the imagination.

A few stories that hit the fan this year seem to fit that description:

But the idea of discovering technosignatures within our own solar system, on Mars, the Moon or even on Earth, is far harder to accept. One reason is that science simply isn't prepared for it. Theoretical discussions are limited, and serious search efforts remain rare. In mainstream scientific circles, the topic is still considered fringe — which only reinforces the lack of rigorous enquiry into solar system technosignatures.

The deeper issue, though, may be psychological and political. A close encounter with alien technology could spark geopolitical instability. Unlike some abstract suggestion of a distant exoplanet signal, a discovery near Earth would carry the weight of perceived threat. World governments might scramble to respond, not out of curiosity, but fear. To consider such a possibility would demand new strategies, new science and a level of intellectual risk we've so far resisted. And if the discovery does ever come, it could provoke fear, confusion or overreaction. 

This is basically a science fiction premise with a flourish of sociology. We have found no hard evidence of any kind of alien technology that would justify a search for it. The search is really for emotional gratification.

That idea is gaining traction thanks to a pair of missions — NASA's OSIRIS-REx and Japan's Hayabusa2 — that, in the past few years, have returned rocks from asteroids back to Earth.

Analysis of those samples suggests that some of the building blocks of life are present in the asteroids, raising the prospect that those same building blocks, and perhaps even life itself, could have been delivered to Earth.

It's “absolutely” plausible, says Dr Jason Dworkin, project scientist on the OSIRIS-REx mission at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. 

The word “plausible” is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. A thesis can be plausible without any evidence whatever. It need only remain within the rules of reasonable speculation.

Finding extraterrestrial siblings would inspire us to reach out beyond the limited experiences we had so far on our home planet. There are richer opportunities in our cosmic street than available at home…

Rolf [Dobelli] asked: “And why should we expect aliens to be kind to us and not have the gangster mentality?” I explained that gangsters often have a short life because they engage in conflicts and play Russian roulette under risky circumstances. Any interstellar visitors to our back yard must have survived under duress for billions of years. They might abide by the principle of “survival of the kindest.” 

There is a novel lurking in there but not a taxpayer-funded research program.

The very fact that the universe is so silent and ET is not obvious may support an argument for pessimism. Perhaps benign alien civilizations are in the majority, but they know something that newbies such as ourselves do not, namely, that the universe is a very dangerous place, and there are some really bad actors out there. They therefore intentionally keep quiet and low profiles, lest they provoke the bad actors. 

Perhaps. We usually speculate about behavior when guessing the intentions of entities of whose existence we are already certain. Here we are asked to speculate about the psychology of intelligent aliens without finding so much as a single extraterrestrial bacterium.

But wait. That's very like the Privileged Planet hypothesis. Such reflections are more commonly associated with belief in a Creator than with belief in countless ET civilizations. And the only thing Privileged Planet's ideas have going for them is a much closer relationship to facts.

The question looms: How much can science avoid facts while retaining the character of science?

The Big Bang and the age of the universe have plenty of evidence behind them, from the temperature of the cosmic microwave background to the measured expansion of the universe. Through a lot of work over the last century, we now believe the universe to be around 13.8 billion years old.

But it would not take much to refute this idea. If we were to find a star that is definitively older than this, it would show that the universe was around before 13.8 billion years ago. Enter star HD 140283, looking suspiciously non-metallic.

HD 140283, better known as the Methuselah star, is around 200 light-years from Earth, in the constellation of Libra. It is known to be a high-velocity, sub-giant star, and one of the closest metal-poor stars to our Solar System. 

""The high rate of motion is evidence that the star is simply a visitor to our stellar neighborhood,"" NASA's Hubble Mission team explains of the star. ""Its orbit carries it down through the plane of our galaxy from the ancient halo of stars that encircle the Milky Way, and will eventually slingshot back to the galactic halo.""

In the 1950s, astronomers found HD 140283 to be very metal-poor compared to other stars in the neighborhood, suggesting that the star was formed earlier in the universe, before it had become ""polluted"" by heavier elements fused in the center of other stars. In the early 2000s, astronomers attempted to age it, and came up with an even more surprising result. According to their observations and analysis using stellar evolution models, the Methuselah star's age was possibly around 16 billion years old.

The age of stars is pretty difficult to pin down, relying on measurements of their absolute brightness as well as their chemical abundances, and this was far from the final word on the topic. 

""Maybe the cosmology is wrong, stellar physics is wrong, or the star's distance is wrong,"" Howard Bond of Pennsylvania State University in University Park and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore said in a 2013 statement, after new measurements by the Hubble Space Telescope. ""So we set out to refine the distance.""

That team refined distance measurements to the star, an important step in figuring out a star's intrinsic brightness, which is fundamental in determining its age. Think of it like not knowing if you are seeing a torch held by an approaching stranger, or a very distant lighthouse. Placing the star's distance at a refined 190.1 light-years, and finding that it had a higher-than-predicted oxygen to iron ratio, the team aged the star to be a much less universe model-breaking star.

""Put all of those ingredients together and you get an age of 14.5 billion years, with a residual uncertainty that makes the star's age compatible with the age of the universe,"" Bond said, adding, ""This is the best star in the sky to do precision age calculations by virtue of its closeness and brightness.""

With uncertainty of around 0.8 billion years, at the lower end of the age estimate, it is at least not older than the universe is believed to be. Further studies have placed the star's age between 13.7 billion and 12.2 billion years, with another suggesting between 11.5 billion years and 12.5 billion years. 

The Methuselah star, named for the Biblical Noah's grandfather, described as dying at the age of 969, is likely not older than the universe, nor evidence that we have the age of the universe horribly wrong. But it remains the oldest star we have found in the universe so far. There are other candidates, such as J22132050-5137385, which is thought to be around 13.6 billion years old, give or take 2.6 billion years. Further measurements of this and others could knock the Methuselah star off the top spot, or else refine the age estimate downwards.

NASA astronaut Don Pettit tests the Mould Effect in space.

NASA astronaut Don Pettit has helped YouTuber Steve Mould with the final step in his ""weird chain theory"": testing the idea in space.

In 2013, YouTuber and science communicator Steve Mould brought the ""chain fountain"", an unsolved problem in physics, to the attention of the wider public. The effect, sometimes referred to as the ""Mould effect"" for his work on it, is strange to see. Simply put, place a long chain in a container, pull one end out, and let it fall to the floor. Now watch as the whole chain seems to jump up out of the glass, before falling towards the floor.

     

The effect, though independently found by Mould, was known about before, even if it was unexplained. Since the effect was popularized by Mould, he, Mehdi Sadaghdar of YouTube channel ElectroBOOM, and several academic studies have attempted to explain it. Mould has also set the record for the biggest chain fountain.

    

What is really puzzling about the effect is how the chain appears to rise out of the glass before starting its downward journey.

""Motivated by the fact that the chain has a maximum local curvature, and the fact that the phenomenon does not happen with a chain that does not have this maximum bending curvature, the chain was modelled as a sequence of freely joined rods,"" a 2016 paper on the topic explains.

""When a rod is pulled from one end, the end attached to the part of the chain that is already moving, the rod tends to rotate around its center of mass; consequently, the other end will go down, towards the surface of beads, kicking the pile of beads. Finally, there is a reaction force to this kick that pushes the beads upwards.""

Mould's explanation (see above for the full explanation, and an awesome chain fountain) is generally thought to be correct, after a long (and friendly) argument and experiments against ElectroBOOM (and further analysis by others). 

""In short, the chain rises above the pot in a fountain because of an extra upward force coming from the pot,"" Mould explains in his latest video, partly shot in space. ""How strong does that force need to be, though? Well, it needs to be able to overcome the weight of this arc of chain that would obviously fall under gravity. And that's it. That's all you need.""

Unfortunately, in order to test his idea, Mould needed gravity to disappear. This is where NASA astronaut Don Pettit came in. Pettit, who had been intrigued by Mould's videos, offered to test the behavior of chains on the International Space Station (ISS).

 

""According to the maths, that yanking of the chain has no influence on the ark at all. If gravity wasn't a factor, the ark would be fixed there in space even though it was being yanked downwards at one end. Or at least that's the theory,"" Mould explained. ""That's what we want to test. We want to test the theory that a chain moving at constant speed will flow through its own shape so long as it isn't acted on by an external force like gravity.""

In a phone call with Mould, Pettit attempted to tug on the chain and test whether the chain truly did flow through its own shape, supporting Mould's idea, or whether it did something else. Unfortunately, it's pretty difficult to get a chain to remain stationary in microgravity, with Pettit describing them as moving around like molecules. 

Mould suggested that instead they put a chain into a loop, and stretch it out to make a rectangular shape. Then Pettit could grab the longer sides of the rectangle-ish chain and set them in motion, pushing the top one right and the bottom left, for example. If he was correct, the chain should flow through that rectangle shape, rather than spread out into a circle as you might expect.

The setup was not ideal, and the two were limited by the ISS passing out of reach of communication satellites. However, before the informal experiment ended, they did appear to set chains in motion that followed their own shape, seemingly adding evidence to Mould's explanation for the effect.

""It was a great demonstration seeing it pass through the same path through the loop and your explanation about why it would eventually turn into a full circle due to friction was pretty adequate,"" Sadaghdar said, adding that he wouldn't have to embarrass himself by making another debunk video.

""Although you didn't quite demonstrate if the path will remain the same if the chain wasn't in a loop. Another simulation might be nice, but what would be better is to take 100m of chain into space and drag it behind you in a spacewalk. Do it.""

Something shifted for Mamoru Hosoda after he made Belle. That simple, small-scale Hosoda you loved for Mirai is gone. Now he's in his maximalism era and his latest, Scarlet, proves he might be there for a while. 2021's Belle saw the Japanese filmmaker exploring the virtues of grief through a modernist Beauty and the Beast retelling in a VR environment. Scarlet revisits the exploration of the virtues of grief and modernism, but this time with a gender-swapped, supernatural adaptation of Hamlet. To me, Hosoda is like the Guillermo del Toro of Japanese animators, as his ambitions exceed his grasp, but damn it, he cultivates a striking animated spectacle nonetheless.

MPA Rating: PG-13 (for strong violence/bloody images.)

Runtime: 1 Hour and 51 Minutes

Language: Japanese

Production Companies: Studio Chizu, Nippon Television Network Corporation, Sony Pictures Entertainment (Japan) Inc., Kadokawa Corporation, Toho Co. Ltd.

Distributor: Sony Pictures Classics

Director: Mamoru Hosoda

Writer: Mamoru Hosoda

Cast: Mana Ashida, Masaki Okada, Kôji Yakusho

U.S Release Date: December, 12 2025 (Limited) | February 6, 2026 (Nationwide)

Princess Scarlet (Mana Ashida) watches her uncle Claudius (Kôji Yakusho) carry out a coup and murder her father, the king, in medieval Denmark. She is banished and spends a large portion of her childhood in secret sword-fighting training. When Scarlet finally returns home, on a mission to exact her revenge, she is poisoned and falls into a coma. 

She finds herself in the ""Otherworld,"" a paranormal purgatory where individuals from all backgrounds and eras — past and present — live side by side. She encounters Hijiri (Masaki Okada), a pacifist nurse. After discovering that Claudius is also there, Scarlet and Hijiri set out to find him on a perilous journey through the different badlands knowing that if they are killed in the Otherworld, they will vanish into thin air. However, during their journey, Hijiari makes every effort to persuade Scarlet that there is more to life than vengeance.

For better or worse, if you know Hosada's game, a lot of Scarlet will seem like the director revisiting his greatest hits. If you aren't, might I suggest taking a look at Belle and Mirai? Perhaps make it a double feature since Scarlet combines elements of both films: character-driven narrative and 3D-2D hybrid animation techniques. It might be overwhelming to take in at once if this is your first Hosoda. 

The beautiful animation quality from Studio Chizu is an improvement over their previous work, Belle included. Scarlet's initial set-up is just ""girl Hamlet"" drawn in 2D with gothic colors. Yet, once the titular rage-fueled princess enters the Otherworld, she gets hit with that colorful cel-shaded 3D beam, and so do her surroundings — once again taking cues from Belle. Contrary to Belle's VR world ""U,"" which was overwhelming and only featured in segments of the narrative, Scarlet's supernatural Otherworld, where the majority of the story takes place, is grounded, sprawling, and fully realized. 

In this 3D landscape, Hosoda adeptly executes an epic scope for his protagonist and the action on her quest. The action sequences are intense and violent, making great use of the backdrop in 3D composition and movement, illustrating an insane level of combat as Scarlet's bright blue eyes see red — as bright as her hair — when she encounters Claudius' goons in the Otherworld. The film's swashbuckling Hamlet-echo-fighter heroine is still afforded the opportunity to get her hands dirty in numerous set pieces. 

In terms of aesthetics, Scarlet is more visually and narratively accessible than Belle. Its fantastical supernatural realm is reminiscent of George Miller's Furiosa, but with a medieval wardrobe, and if it were rendered in the same cel-shaded graphics program as The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. The backgrounds consist of deserted sandy wastelands, volcanic terrains reminiscent of Pompeii, with numerous dusty oases and storms. Besides that, there is a storm dragon with swords in its face that horrifically kills homicidal sinners with a single thunderstrike.

This is Hosoda, after all, and the man delivers on three separate themes simultaneously while exploring the Otherworld's setting and experimenting with time, all while flying by the seat of his pants. Scarlet is most successful when its subversive anti-war character arc is shaped by Scarlet's healing process, influenced by her developing relationship with Hijiri. His pacifism challenges Scarlet's worldview, offering reflection on her purpose outside seeking retribution. The two characters have a potent budding chemistry and a positive influence on each other's moralistic values. I love how during the action sequences, Scarlet, heeding Hijiri suggestions to not kill her foes, goes full Daredevil, kicking ass with brutality but still showing mercy. 

That said, the movie spends most of its time on our two heroes reflecting on the lives they used to live. There isn't much of a sense of urgency, which makes the already unnecessary two-hour runtime feel even longer. The lines between our reality and Hamlet do blur, particularly with regards to Claudius, the selfish dictator of an impoverished land, full of false promises of an “infinite land” that he had not been to himself, weaponizing his followers' desperation for his gain. And then there's the sloppily executed yet well-intentioned no-borders theme. Hosoda likes to show the Otherworld's melting pot in slow, rambling beats, like when Hijiri learns to hula dance with a Hawaiian woman. Yet the meandering lets some themes, primarily its no-borders/false-kings narrative feel underdeveloped. As the two reach Claudius' Castlevania-like castle, the tone intensifies in a snap, leaping into war-filled chaos, missing a bridging scene or two to add cohesiveness.

As it enters its second half, Scarlet fully symmetrizes as a maximalized adaptation of Hamlet and as an introspective journey of self-discovery through potent psychological and supernatural cues. I couldn't help but get excited when Rosencrantz and Guildenstern joined the battle to see how they would contribute to Hosoda's passionate vision. Even if it falters in its other themes when it gets too big for its britches, Hosoda compensates with unwavering sincerity throughout. At a certain point, it explained why it was programmed at NYFF, as they usually don't program animated features to the festival.

Even though I miss Hosoda's simple work, Scarlet is another stunning effort a visionary whose stories are frustratingly overambitious but still captivating.

Ever checked into an old hotel and felt… off? According to celebrity psychic JusstineK, that feeling might not be your imagination. “We're all intuitive,” she says. “If you feel something that doesn't seem normal to you, trust it—there's a reason your body is sounding an alarm.” With 35 years of experience helping clients (including A-listers like the cast of Friends and Eva Longoria), Jusstine has investigated some of Hollywood's most haunted hotels—including the infamous Sunset Marquis and Chateau Marmont. “They're beautiful,” she admits, “but they're full of energy. At night, those places just eat me up.” So how can you tell if your hotel is haunted—and what should you do if it is? Jusstine shares her psychic guide to reading the room.

According to Jusstine, every object and space holds the energy of those who've passed through it. “All objects absorb energy,” she explains. “Think about how many people have stayed in one hotel room. Their thoughts, emotions and experiences linger in that space.”That doesn't necessarily mean ghosts are stuck there—but the energy can still affect you. “If you're feeling anxious, sad or just unsettled for no reason, you might be picking up on the emotions left behind by others,” she says. “Energy is real. Our thoughts are things.”Her first rule of thumb? Don't dismiss what you feel. “People will say, ‘It's just my imagination.' But how do you know that? If you feel it, it's real.”

While not every flickering light is a spirit trying to say hello, Jusstine says intuition is a powerful guide. “If something doesn't feel like rainbows and butterflies, pay attention,” she says. “That's your body warning you that the energy isn't good.” Classic signs may include:

Lights that flicker or electronics turning on and off

Sudden temperature drops or heaviness in the air

Unexplained feelings of sadness or unease

Dreams that feel too vivid to ignore

Still, she emphasizes that awareness—not fear—is the goal. “This isn't about doom or gloom,” she says. “It's about recognizing energy so you can protect yourself and move through it.”

Jusstine swears by a few unconventional rituals to clear a space. “Forget sage,” she says. “It just pisses spirits off. The true smell that clears energy is cinnamon.” Here's her psychic-approved hotel cleanse:

Visualize light: “Imagine a million suns filling the room, melting away anything that doesn't belong.”

Burn or spray cinnamon: “A candle or spray with real cinnamon helps shift the energy.”

Take a shower: “If you feel off, imagine all the energy washing down the drain.”

Avoid drinking too much: “When you're drunk or overtired, you open yourself up to outside energy.”

“Energy hygiene is as important as physical hygiene,” she adds. “You wouldn't sleep in a dirty bed—so why sleep in dirty energy?”

Superhero Globalist Conspiracy Theories over DC's K.O. in Titans #28, as well as Justice League Red #3 and Wonder Woman #26 (Spoilers)

Bleeding Cool mentioned that this might be coming… previously, I wrote, ""DC's K.O. is coming. The big knockdown fight event, to take on Darkseid. But before any of this can happen, something is going to have to happen to the Earth. Everyone is going to have to be evacuated. The entire planet. The fight is coming, it is coming to Earth, and there can be no harm done to the bystanders. Darkseid plans to build a new Apokolips on Earth."" Indeed, today's Justice League Red #3 by Saladin Ahmed and Clayton Henry sees Red Tornado prophesying such a future, and underlining the need to save Red Arrow, to stop it. 

Save the marksman, save the world.

But also it is a bit…

I mean, right? But while all that is going on, the Titans are dealing with the here and now. The DC K.O. battle is to find a champion imbued with Omega Energy to inherit the power of the Omega King rather than Darkseid. As I previously wrote, ""it's down to the Titans, minus those in the competition, to evacuate a planet of eight billion people. Ships, teleportation, city shrinking, whatever comes to hand. Oh, and they only have a week."" And in today's  Titans #28 by John Layman and Pete Woods are both published by DC Comics today, it comes to pass.

Rocketing populations into space in buildings that double as spaceships… and shrinking people to fit.

And it's not just the people who are being saved but also the supervillains.

Of course, as we saw in DC's K.O. #1, it seems that maybe that didn't work out as intended.

While on Earth, not everyone wants to go. As I previously wrote, …there are some who don't want to be evacuated. Who don't believe the superheroes. Who don't want to leave their homes, their possessions or their lives….""

…""And who have got placards to protest, presumably left over from COVID, or Absolute Power, dubbed ""evacuation truthers"". Amanda Waller taught humanity to mistrust the superheroes, and plenty, it seems, still think she was right…""

As we have seen from Moray Island in today's Wonder Woman #26 by Tom King and Daniel Sampere, they are not alone there either…

Mouse Man knows. Justice League Red #3 by Saladin Ahmed, Clayton Henry, Titans #28 by John Layman and Pete Woods and Wonder Woman #26 by Tom King and Daniel Sampere, are all published by DC Comics today.

""The speed of innovation is far exceeding the speed of customer adoption,"" said Benioff to Cramer. ""These customers have to go back and modify massive architectures they have and systems they're running.""

The comments on AI adoption come as Salesforce shares are down more than 28% compared to the same time last year and around 34% compared to their peak in December 2024. The company said in August that it cut its support staff from 9,000 to 5,000 employees, thanks to the adoption of AI agents.

When asked about the stock decline, Benioff said that the Agentforce platform has rapidly grown since the company first introduced it a little over a year ago, but there is little understanding of how the company is using autonomous bots to drive efficiency.

""People don't understand that Agentforce is part and parcel of Salesforce,"" said Benioff. ""It is the core of every product we make now, it is the platform.""

The Dreamforce conference is set to bring tens of thousands of guests to San Francisco this week as Benoiff attempts to sell software like Tableau and Slack, powered by AI. Tickets typically run from $999 to $2,299. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Dario Amodei, CEO of AI lab Anthropic, are both scheduled to have chat sessions with Benoiff throughout the week, topped off with music performances from Metallica and Benson Boone.

General Motors' announcement on Tuesday that its upcoming quarterly results will include a $1.6 billion charge from its electric vehicle investments is the latest in a string of troubling EV-related disclosures from big automakers.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said late last month that he expects demand for fully electric vehicles to be slashed in half following the end of a federal tax credit program. His prediction came after Stellantis, the parent company of auto brands including Chrysler and Jeep, said it was scrapping its target of producing nothing but electric vehicles in Europe by 2030, and backed off ambitious targets for the U.S., notably for Chrysler.

The industry, which was already facing hurdles imposed by the Trump administration, faces a hefty dose of uncertainty now that consumers can no longer take advantage of $7,500 tax credits for purchasing EVs. The incentives expired at the end of September as part of President Trump's signature spending bill.

As automakers reset investor expectations, one name has been notably absent from the conversation: Tesla.

Elon Musk's company is by far the largest seller of EVs in the U.S., though its market share has been sliding as competition has increased and its brand value has declined. Tesla's share of the all-electric market in the U.S. was estimated at 43.1% at the end of September, down from 49% at the end of last year, according to data provided to CNBC from Motor Intelligence

Tesla is slated to report third-quarter results next week, and Wall Street will be eager to hear what kind of demand the company expects with the credits no longer available. Tesla recently unveiled stripped-down, lower-cost variants of its popular Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedans, offsetting some of the effective price increases that come with the loss of incentives.

Steve Greenfield, general partner at investment firm Automotive Ventures, said the retreat of legacy automakers from the segment could be good news for Tesla as its market share may start to rebound. He said in an email that the company has ""very strong brand loyalty.""

""Chances are, most Tesla buyers will continue to stay in the brand, as they buy their next new car,"" Greenfield said.

However, significant challenges loom. Interest in battery electric vehicles ""is very likely to shrink dramatically"" in the fourth quarter, he said, due to the ""pull-ahead of demand,"" as consumers rushed to buy EVs before the credit expired. As the year ends, Tesla will likely face a ""double whammy,"" Greenfield said, from reduced BEV sales and lower margins on the cars they do sell.

Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.

Investors have become more bullish. Following a 36% slump in the first quarter, the stock has rallied and is now up more than 7% for the year, aided by Musk's purchase of about $1 billion worth of Tesla stock in September.

The brutal start to the year was linked to a consumer backlash in the U.S. and Europe in response to Musk's incendiary political rhetoric, his work for President Trump slashing the federal workforce, and his endorsements of far-right groups including Germany's AfD party.

In the company's third-quarter earnings scheduled for next Wednesday, analysts are expecting to see revenue growth of 3.5% from a year earlier to $26.1 billion, according to LSEG. Analysts are projecting a revenue drop in the fourth quarter and a 3.5% slide for all of 2025, which would mark the first full-year decline on record.

Earlier this month, Tesla reported a 7% year-over-year increase in quarterly vehicle deliveries for the third quarter. That marked a turnaround after two consecutive quarterly declines to start the year.

""It's not just a retreat of everybody else, and Tesla gets to run away with the market,"" said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at Alix Partners, in an interview.

Consumer demand for fully electric vehicles had ""already kind of flatlined a bit"" even before the Republican spending bill, Wakefield added. Car buyers have been looking for a ""breakthrough moment"" where EVs would become cost competitive with hybrid or gas-powered models.

Wakefield added that ""this market needs a sense of newness,"" and that the new, lower-priced Model Y and Model 3 options are not exactly ""earth shattering.""

The Trump administration isn't making life easy.

Robbie Orvis, a senior director at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate policy think tank, told CNBC the automakers' writedowns were expected and stem entirely from policy changes beyond just the tax credits.

The Trump White House has also ""revoked California's waiver to set its own vehicle standards, revoked billions in funding for EV chargers and for auto plants to retool to build EVs, and is in the process of undoing vehicle tailpipe standards that would encourage the adoption of EVs,"" Orvis said.

Those policies, along with tariffs, have already caused billions of dollars in losses for U.S. automakers, which means they aren't in a position to invest in new market segments, Orvis said.

Tesla is experiencing its share of that pain, and it's showing up most acutely in international markets.

""Chinese automakers are rapidly displacing U.S. automakers in foreign markets as they are able to offer cheaper, higher-quality new cars, particularly EVs, in markets where there is large and growing demand for these cars,"" Orvis said.

Musk, meanwhile, continues to try and focus investor attention elsewhere.

He insists the future of the company hinges on robotaxis and humanoid robotics, two markets that Tesla has yet to meaningfully crack. Tesla is testing its Robotaxi-branded service in limited capacity in some cities, but is way behind Alphabet's Waymo, which is rapidly expanding commercial operations.

Musk said in March that Tesla aimed to make 5,000 of its Optimus robots this year, but key departures from the group have thrown that plan into question.

In September, Musk wrote on X that ""~80% of Tesla's value will be Optimus."" Last year, he predicted that Optimus robots would someday turn Tesla into a $25 trillion company, which was equal to more than half of the entire value of the S&P 500 at the time of his comment.

It's a story that's compelling enough for some longtime Tesla bulls and Musk fanboys. But at the moment, the company still relies on sales of EVs to drive its business. And in the U.S., while Tesla's market share may be poised to rise, the overall pie — at least in the near term — appears to be shrinking.

Move by US marks sharp escalation in efforts to pressure Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro's regime

Donald Trump confirmed reports on Wednesday that he authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, marking a sharp escalation in US efforts to pressure President Nicolás Maduro's regime.

The New York Times first reported the classified directive, citing US officials familiar with the decision.

The US president said he authorized the action for two main reasons.

First, he claimed Venezuela had been releasing large numbers of prisoners, including individuals from mental health facilities, into the United States, often crossing the border due to what he described as an open border policy. Trump did not specify which border they were crossing.

The second reason, he said, was the large amount of drugs entering the US from Venezuela, much of it trafficked by sea.

Nine companies registered in Taiwan, as well as three Taiwanese, on Tuesday were named by the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) as Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs) as a result of a US federal court indictment.

The indictment unsealed at the federal court in Brooklyn, New York, said that Chen Zhi (陳志), a dual Cambodian-British national, is being indicted for fraud conspiracy, money laundering and overseeing Prince Holding Group's forced-labor scam camps in Cambodia.

At its peak, the company allegedly made US$30 million per day, court documents showed.

The US government has seized Chen's noncustodial wallet, which contains the private keys to 127,271 bitcoins, valued at about US$150 billion, the indictment said, adding that Chen is not in custody.

If the indictments stand, he would face 40 years in prison, it said.

Prince Group has been declared a Transnational Criminal Organization by the treasury department.

“As alleged, the defendant was the mastermind behind a ... criminal enterprise built on human suffering,” US Assistant Attorney-General for National Security John Eisenberg said. “Trafficked workers were confined in prison-like compounds and forced to carry out online scams on an industrial scale, preying on thousands worldwide, including many here in the US.”

“As alleged, the defendant directed one of the largest investment fraud operations in history, fueling an illicit industry that is reaching epidemic proportions,” US Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr said. “This historic indictment and forfeiture complaint send a strong message to fraudsters everywhere that we will pursue you no matter where you are, no matter who you are, and no matter your insidious methods, and we will never stop fighting for victims.”

The SDN lists include three Taiwanese: Huang Chieh, Shih Ting-yu and Michelle Reishane Wang, the treasury department said.

The nine Taiwanese companies listed are Alphaconnect Investments Co Ltd (聯凡), Alphaconnect Investments II Co Ltd (聯凡貳), Greenbay Properties (澄碩), Huntsman Investments Co Ltd (邁羽), Majesty Properties Co Ltd (鳴灣), Drew Properties Co Ltd (博居), Drew Properties II Co Ltd (博居貳), Binary Properties Co Ltd (睿督) and Taiwan Prince Real Estate Investment Co Ltd (太子不動產投資), the OFAC list showed.

The head of eight of the nine companies was the same person, surnamed Lin (林), with the companies' address all listed in a luxury apartment in Taipei's Daan District (大安), Chinese-language media reported yesterday.

An 18-month joint investigation by the US and the UK showed that Chen and his accomplices transferred criminal proceeds overseas and used them to purchase luxury homes, yachts, private jets and paintings, local media reported.

The requirement was set out in a draft amendment to the Enforcement Rules of the Public Officials Election and Recall Act (公職人員選舉罷免法 ) released by the ministry on Thursday.
Under the proposal, candidates would need to make the declaration when submitting their registration forms, which would be published in the official election bulletin.

The Taiwan Taiko Association opened the celebrations with a 100-drummer performance, including young percussionists.

As per tradition, an air force Mirage 2000 fighter jet flew over the Presidential Office as a part of the performance.

LONDON — Sumo wrestlers participating in the Grand Sumo Tournament in London toured the city center on Tuesday, visiting famous landmarks.

The tournament will be held from Wednesday through Sunday.

The two yokozuna, Onosato and Hoshoryu, along with the other wrestlers, left their hotel by coach and got off in front of the London Eye ferris wheel. As they crossed Westminster Bridge over the River Thames, many of the wrestlers took commemorative photos with Elizabeth Tower, often called Big Ben, in the background.

Wherever they went, the wrestlers were greeted by tourists shouting, “Sumo wrestlers!” and they happily posed for photos. Surrounded by crowds, Onosato smiled and remarked, “This is quite something, isn't it?”

Hoshoryu bought a hot dog from a street stall, took a bite and declared with satisfaction, “It's delicious!”

They later visited Buckingham Palace and other sites, recharging their batteries through their London stroll ahead of the opening performance the following day.

CAPSAT military unit commander Col. Michael Randrianirina says 'we will be sworn in soon,' during a press briefing.Brian Inganga/The Associated Press

Madagascar's new military ruler, Michael Randrianirina, said on Wednesday he would soon be sworn in as the country's president as the African Union suspended the island nation after a coup to oust President Andry Rajoelina. Rajoelina, who was impeached by lawmakers after fleeing abroad during the weekend, has condemned the takeover and refused to step down despite Gen Z demonstrations demanding his resignation and widespread defections in the security forces.

Randrianirina said earlier that the military had taken power and dissolved all institutions except the lower house of parliament, or National Assembly.

“We will be sworn in soon,” the army colonel told a press briefing on Wednesday, a day after the High Constitutional Court invited him to serve as president of the former French colony.

“We took responsibility yesterday.”

Two sources close to him earlier told Reuters he would be sworn in as president in the next day or two.

A spokesperson for the African Union told Reuters on Wednesday that the bloc had suspended Madagascar with immediate effect following the coup, without sharing further details. Suspension by the 55-member bloc carries political weight and could isolate the country's new leadership.

At a bloc meeting earlier on Wednesday, African Union Commission Chairperson Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said: “The rule of law must prevail over the rule of force. Our approach is grounded in law and dialogue.”

Randrianirina said on Tuesday that a committee led by the military would rule for up to two years alongside a transitional government before organizing new elections.

Randrianirina was a commander in the elite CAPSAT army unit that played a key role in the 2009 coup that brought Rajoelina to power but broke ranks with him last week, urging soldiers not to fire on protesters.

Rajoelina fled Madagascar on Sunday aboard a French military plane, security sources told Reuters. He has said his life was at risk and is now believed to be in Dubai, according to three diplomatic and opposition sources.

The 51-year-old former DJ rose to power in a coup in 2009 on the back of youth protests, becoming the world's youngest head of state at 34. But promises to improve living standards and eradicate corruption were never fulfilled.

Madagascar, where the average age is less than 20, has a population of about 30 million, three-quarters of whom live in poverty. Between its independence in 1960 and 2020, GDP per capita plunged 45%, according to the World Bank.

As well as the CAPSAT unit, the paramilitary gendarmerie and the police have also broken ranks with Rajoelina.

US advisers say they are working to set up “safe zones” behind Israeli lines where Gazans can seek refuge from Hamas violence.

Violent clashes erupted between Hamas and rival groups after the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) pulled back to a “yellow line” as part of a ceasefire and prisoner swap deal secured by Donald Trump.

In an update on progress, senior US advisers said work continued on the peace plan and on returning the bodies of dead Israeli hostages.

“Obviously there have been a lot of reports in Gaza of Hamas killing and going after Palestinian civilians,” said one adviser during briefing call with reporters on Wednesday evening.

“That's something that we've been working with mediators to send a message to say we'd really like to see that stop, as well as the US working with Israel to try and create some space in safe zones behind the yellow line for people who feel under threat to be able to go to.”

Hamas and Israel agreed last week to a ceasefire, the return of hostages from Gaza, and the withdrawal of the IDF from much of Gaza.

However, excitement has given way to concern among some Israeli families that Hamas has not honoured its part of the deal by failing to return bodies and to horror at video of gunmen apparently executing rivals.

Mr Trump said he would allow Israeli forces to resume the fight if Hamas failed to uphold its end of the deal.

“Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word,” he told CNN, in an effort to keep up pressure on the terrorist group.

His advisers said they believed Hamas was doing what it could to return bodies, but was hampered by the intense destruction of the territory.

The advisers said they had received offers from international rescue teams to help find victims and that they may even consider offering rewards to locals who could assist with information about where remains might be found.

“On top of all that debris is a lot of unexploded ordnance, and presumably, under that unexploded ordnance and that debris, there are many bodies,” said a second senior US adviser, who recently visited Gaza.

At the same time, as many as two dozen American troops from Central Command are now “on the ground” in oversight, logistical and supervisory roles.

Planning has begun for an international force to go into the enclave to stabilise Gaza.

“The international stabilisation force is starting to be constructed,” said the first adviser.

Several countries have offered help, including Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Qatar and Azerbaijan.

Overall, the peace plan was holding up despite pressure, said the adviser.

“I think it's going exactly as intended,” he said.

“Again, a lot of people didn't think the deal would be made. The deal was made. A lot of people thought both sides would screw it up or not keep their word.

“And we got through phase one very, very well, and now we're all working hard to create the conditions for a successful implementation of phase two.”

The priorities he added were to return the remaining bodies, the demilitarisation of Gaza, and getting aid into the strip.

			The president's overreach on deploying the National Guard is turning opinion against his legitimate efforts to deport illegal migrants

Donald Trump's federalisation and deployment of state National Guard units predictably has provoked claims that he is trashing the US Constitution to establish a dictatorship. In reality, Trump is on solid legal ground when it comes to one of his stated purposes: preventing protesters and rioters from impeding the enforcement of federal immigration laws against illegal migrants by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.

But the case for sending troops to deal with ordinary crime in American cities is much weaker. And public opinion among many Republicans as well as Democrats is turning against Trump's National Guard deployments and his immigration policy in general.

Claims that Trump is using National Guard units to create a dictatorship are absurd. The administration so far has obeyed adverse judicial rulings and fought them in the courts. And despite threats to use it, Trump has abstained from invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807, which allows the president to use the regular military in addition to state National Guard units, to “execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions”.

The Insurrection Act and its legal predecessors have been used more than two dozen times in American history – by Presidents Washington and Adams against rebels, by President Lincoln against secessionist states, and by President Grant against the Ku Klux Klan. The Act was used in the late 19th century in federal interventions in labour disputes, and by presidents from Eisenhower to Johnson to enforce civil rights law in the segregated South. It was last used in 1992 by President George Herbert Walker Bush, who sent in the National Guard during the Los Angeles riots of that year.

Equally groundless is the claim that Trump is targeting “Democratic cities”. The phrase “Democratic cities” is misleading, because most large cities in the US with large illegal immigrant populations are run by Democratic mayors and city councils. As of this month, the mayors of the 100 largest American cities include 66 Democrats and only 23 Republicans, with the rest divided between non-partisan mayors and libertarians. A full 78 per cent of the population of the 100 biggest cities lives under a Democratic mayor and only 16 per cent under a mayor who is a Republican.

Until now the president has deployed National Guard troops in Washington, DC, Chicago, Illinois, Los Angeles, California, and Memphis, Tennessee, while a federal judge has blocked deployments to Portland, Oregon.

The only city in which municipal crime was the major rationale for deployments was Washington, DC, which had experienced a rise in car-jackings, in addition to its long-term, chronic crime rate. The federal government ultimately controls the nation's capital and can override home rule, so putting the National Guard on the streets of Washington raised no serious constitutional issues.

But fighting crime in general is a weak rationale for troop deployments elsewhere. While crime spiked during the Covid pandemic, crime rates since then have been declining. According to statistics from Trump's own FBI about national crime made public in August of this year, murder and manslaughter declined by 14.9pc in 2024, robbery decreased by 8.9pc, aggravated assault fell by 3pc, while rape rose by 5.2pc nationwide.

In the other cities, the stated purpose of the deployments has been to prevent protesters, both violent and non-violent, from impeding the work of ICE in carrying out raids to arrest and deport illegal immigrants. Here Trump is on stronger ground, because the federal government is allowed to take any steps necessary to implement federal laws anywhere in the US.

Unlike previous presidents, Trump takes the enforcement of federal immigration laws seriously. Other than Trump, neither Democratic presidents, hoping to import future Democratic voters and a cheap urban labour force, nor Republican president George W Bush, who supplied his business backers with cheap illegal workers for farms and factories, enforced America's immigration laws strictly. But there is no doubt that Trump has the power to do so.

During decades of lax enforcement, many American cities with effective one-party Democratic rule declared themselves “sanctuary cities”, refusing to allow local police forces to cooperate with ICE agents in immigration law enforcement. In addition to Democrat-controlled Washington, DC, 19 states, most of them run by quasi-permanent Democratic majorities (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington) allow illegal immigrants to obtain drivers licenses.

One of them was Harjinder Singh, an illegal immigrant from India who is alleged to have entered the US from Mexico, who got a work permit from the Biden administration, and obtained commercial driver's licenses from both California and the state of Washington, even though he failed road sign reading tests and English tests following a collision between his truck and a car whose three passengers were killed.

Democratic New York State gave a commercial drivers license to an illegal immigrant from India released by the Biden administration and identified on his New York license as “No Name Given Anmol”. He was arrested by ICE agents while driving an 18-wheeler truck in Oklahoma.

Sacrificing the safety of citizens to the perverse goal of making it impossible for government to identify foreign nationals who are present illegally in the US, California's governor Gavin Newsom has just signed a law that not only bans Californian cities that license street vendors from asking applicants about their immigration status, but also bans cities from asking applicants for vendor licenses to provide their names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and driver's licenses unless the city has a judicial subpoena!

As a result, in California, cities may know nothing about many of the vendors who are licensed to sell food to people on the street.

To succeed, however, Trump's policies must be viewed by most Americans as legitimate, not merely legal. Warning signs are beginning to flash. Half of Republicans and 70pc of Democrats, adding up to 58pc of Americans as a whole, disapprove of the president sending armed troops unless there is an external threat.

In this case, as in others, Trump's belligerent rhetoric undermines his more moderate policies. When he called for the arrest of Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Pritzker mocked him: “Come and get me.”

According to polls, majorities now disapprove of Trump on most policy issues. A majority supports Trump's enforcement policies at the US border by 57-43pc. But when it comes to Trump's handling of immigration in general, most disapprove of the president, 52-47pc.

Even if Trump wins the legal battle over his National Guard deployments, he may lose the war for public opinion, harming the Republican Party that he leads.

If we don't organize and take action in the streets, says Mark Bray, “we're going to end up somewhere really bad.”

We speak with Rutgers University professor Mark Bray, who fled from the U.S. to Spain with his family after receiving death threats over his scholarship. He is the author of the 2017 book Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, which explores the history and tactics of anti-fascist movements in Europe, the United States and beyond. Turning Point USA, the conservative campus group founded by Charlie Kirk, had called for Bray's firing and branded him “Dr. Antifa.” This comes as the Trump administration has dramatically escalated its war on dissent following Kirk's assassination, using his death as pretext to launch an assault on activists, organizations and speech it disagrees with.

“What we're seeing today in the U.S. is increasingly fascist. MAGA, I believe — and I study fascism, I don't say this lightly — is a fascist movement,” says Bray, referring to Trump's political movement.

President Trump signed an executive order designating antifa as a terrorist organization, but Bray stresses there is no such organization; anti-fascism is a loose political movement or ideology akin to feminism, but Trump is using the label to “demonize resistance” to his policies.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: We begin today's show with the war on antifa that the Trump administration has ratcheted up in the aftermath of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk being assassinated last month. Yesterday, President Trump posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Charlie Kirk at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden.

Trump recently signed an executive order purporting to designate antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, even though it's not really an organization. Antifa is actually a shortening of the term “anti-fascist” and is a term that arose in Europe for the movement against the Nazis, both before and after World War II. The decentralized movement in the U.S. today draws on this history.

Several high-level Republicans have accused this Saturday's “No Kings Day” protests of being organized by antifa. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said last week the administration will take the, quote, “same approach” to antifa as it has to drug cartels it's bombed in the Caribbean. This is Bondi on Fox News last night.

ATTORNEY GENERAL PAM BONDI: That's one of the things about antifa. You've heard President Trump say multiple times they are organized, they are a criminal organization. And they're very organized. You're seeing people out there with thousands of signs that all match, pre-bought, pre-put together. They're organized, and someone is funding it.

AMY GOODMAN: This comes as Los Angeles County officials voted Tuesday to declare a state of emergency over ongoing federal immigration raids they say have, quote, “caused widespread fear,” unquote.

Violent attacks by federal agents at protests against immigrant raids have also been documented in Chicago and Portland. On Tuesday, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson [was asked] if he would call for more oversight of federal agents. He responded by complaining about a naked bike ride protest against ICE in Portland, Oregon, which Trump has called a war zone.

SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON: To demand oversight on federal law enforcement? I've not seen them cross the line yet, and that we have committees of jurisdiction who have that responsibility, but it's not risen to that level. What I've seen is the abuse of law enforcement by radical leftist activists. You know, most recently, the most threatening thing I've seen yet was the naked bicyclers in Portland who were protesting ICE down there. I mean, it's getting really ugly.

AMY GOODMAN: Experts are increasingly raising concerns the Trump administration's attacks on antifa are ungrounded in fact and law, and violate free speech rights.

For more, we're joined by someone who knows a lot about all of this. Mark Bray is a Rutgers University history professor, author of the 2017 book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook. Last week, he was forced to leave his home in New Jersey and move to Spain with his family after receiving death threats following Trump's push to categorize the anti-fascist movement as a domestic terrorist organization. Charlie Kirk's group, Turning Point USA, had also circulated a petition labeling him “Dr. Antifa” and calling for him to be fired.

In a remarkable development, Bray was at first blocked from flying out of the United States last week. He wrote on Bluesky, “Someone canceled my family's flight out of the country at the last second. We got our boarding passes. We checked our bags. Went through security. Then at our gate our reservation ‘disappeared.'” They later took another flight, and professor Mark Bray joins us now from Spain.

Thanks so much for being with us. I'm sorry you've gone through all this, Professor Bray. If you can start off by talking about why you left the country and what happened, as we try to follow what was happening to you at the airport?

MARK BRAY: Right. So, I published this book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, in 2017. I'm actually researching different historical topics now. But after Trump's executive order, a series of far-right trolls, online influencers started attacking me. I received a number of death threats. Someone published my home address on X. So I started to fear for the safety of my family staying in our home. More and more death threats came in, and I knew I needed to get away. Getting to another country, getting across the ocean would make us feel much more comfortable.

As you said, our first flight was mysteriously canceled at the last moment. My two small children were sobbing. We had to regroup. The next day, as you said — 

AMY GOODMAN: I want to ask: When you — 

MARK BRAY: — I told — yeah.

AMY GOODMAN: I just want to ask: When say your flight was canceled, you went to — what was it? Newark Airport? Or Kennedy?

MARK BRAY: Yes, Newark.

AMY GOODMAN: And you got — and you got your boarding passes, and you went through security. So you were all set. And you got —

MARK BRAY: Yes.

AMY GOODMAN: — to the gate. And what did they tell you?

MARK BRAY: Right. Well, there was an error. They had us step to the side to talk to the United worker at the desk. There were a series of phone calls and mumbling. And they basically said, at the last moment, someone had canceled our reservation — not the whole flight, just for the four of us, for me, my wife and our two small children. And this is around the same time that Andy Ngo and Jack Posobiec, two of the far-right provocateurs who had been harassing me online, were meeting in the White House with President Trump to discuss antifa. I just can't believe it's a coincidence.

AMY GOODMAN: And yet, you were able to rebook the next day, and you made it through security, and you actually made it onto the flight?

MARK BRAY: Well, this time, I was stopped, searched and interrogated by federal agents for an hour. And at one point, they took me into a side room, and my two kids saw what looked like very bad men taking me in another room, and they started sobbing. So, it was quite an ordeal even the next day. But I made it out. And frankly, I'm very fearful about the potential of returning, but hopefully, by next year, things will improve.

AMY GOODMAN: I mean, this is astounding. You weren't trying to come into the United States. You were trying to leave. And you are an American citizen — not that that should have mattered.

MARK BRAY: And I'm not being charged with any crimes. If anything, I'm the victim of crimes. I wrote a book eight years ago. I consider myself politically an anti-fascist — I detest fascism — but I'm not a member of any antifa group. I'm a professor. I'm a dad. I'm just trying to live my life here. But, of course, because the far right is trying to create a bogeyman term in “antifa” to equate protests with terrorism, I got caught up in the middle of this.

AMY GOODMAN: So, you are the author, Professor Bray, of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook. If you can explain what antifa is and what it means for President Trump to have issued this executive order calling it a terrorist — domestic terrorist organization? Is it even an organization? Talk about antifa now and through history.

MARK BRAY: Right. So, as you said, it's a term that is short for “anti-fascist” or “anti-fascism.” It's originally German from the era of opposition to Hitler. After World War II, anti-fascism continued throughout the world, and the specific European tradition of what they called antifa spread to other countries around the world. For example, in the U.S., you had Anti-Racist Action in the '80s and '90s, which was a network of decentralized groups across the continent organizing against the far right.

The term “antifa” really kind of made its appearance in the U.S. in the late 2000s, but it's not an organization. It's more of a politics or a movement. I liken it to feminism. Sometimes there are feminist groups, but feminism itself is not a group. There are antifa groups, but antifa itself is not a group. It's just sort of like more of a verb. It's a thing you do to organize against the far right in decentralized groups.

Trump, of course, doesn't care about any of that. It's a useful bogeyman term to demonize protest, demonize resistance, equate it with terrorism. And it's really, you know, an obvious page out of the textbooks about fascist and authoritarian leaders. It's so — it's such an obvious imitation of, you know, the kind of the Red Scare talk about communism, but applied to today.

AMY GOODMAN: It's very interesting you've moved to Spain. I mean, for years we've covered the Abraham Lincoln Brigadistas, Brigade, those Americans who went to Spain, where you are now, to fight against the fascist Franco. Many of them died. Many of them came back. And this was just before World War II. They were the most experienced, presumably, in fighting. But when a number of them signed up to fight in World War II, to fight Hitler, they were labeled “premature anti-fascists.” Can you talk about that? And they were not allowed to fight in World War II.

MARK BRAY: Right. So, there were a lot of activists and leftists in the U.S. and around the world who realized the threat of Hitler well before mainstream society. And a number of them journeyed over to Spain to fight in the international brigades. A significant number of them lost their lives. Some of them returned. They were blacklisted in the U.S.

And it is also worth pointing out that a number of Spanish Civil War veterans from other countries who ended up going to France after the Spanish Civil War played important roles in the French underground. And there was a tank battalion of Spanish anarchists that were among the first to liberate Paris in 1945. It's a fascinating history. It's the one that I — I teach a course on the Spanish Civil War.

So, it is strange to sort of have these things twisted around. And I ended up going to Spain because I'm a historian of Spain. But I've received a lot of solidarity and support from the social movements here. And actually, there's a general strike today in Spain for Palestine, as well — just to throw into your news report.

AMY GOODMAN: We had you on last in 2017 to discuss your book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, when it first came out. In the introduction, you wrote you hoped your work would promote organizing against fascism and white supremacy. Can you elaborate?

MARK BRAY: Right. So, anti-fascism has a broad history. In the U.S., certainly, there's the European-inspired antifa tradition. There's also a really good book called The Black Antifascist Tradition that talks about the role of anti-fascism in Black liberation struggles, Black Panthers and so forth, which I suggest people check out. So, it takes many different forms.

What it has in common is actually this impulse towards unity and putting aside the differences that often divide the left, in the interest of promoting the common struggle against fascism, against white supremacy. And what we're seeing today in the U.S. is increasingly fascist. MAGA, I believe — and I study fascism, I don't say this lightly — is a fascist movement. And if we don't organize, if we don't take action in the streets, we're going to end up somewhere really bad.

And for me personally, I felt like my situation was such that I had to get my family out of harm's way. But this story about me is about me, but it's not really about me. It's about attacks on academic freedom, free speech, the right to protest. We're in a really dangerous situation. And so, everyone, in their own way, needs to take action to try and organize against this.

AMY GOODMAN: I mean, it's interesting. You remind me of Timothy Snyder, as well as Jason Stanley, the two Yale professors, who also left the country. They've gone to Canada to teach, both having written books against fascism and tyranny. I wanted to ask you about U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi's comments, saying the administration will take the, quote, “same approach” to antifa as it has to drug cartels it's bombed in the Caribbean. The latest bombing, I think, took place yesterday, killing a number of people. Even Republican politicians, behind closed doors, are saying, “Where is the evidence?” for who these people are, who have been killed by the U.S. bombs. Mark Bray, your response to Pam Bondi?

MARK BRAY: Right. Well, the paradox of fascism is that while it's trying to gain power, it talks about the need for law and order, and to the degree that it gains power, it tramples all over the law. It does not care about the law or legality, due process, civil liberties. And so, this kind of call to murder people in this country, without, of course, even having gone through any due process — not that I'm in favor of capital punishment anyway, but that's another story — it is this kind of example of calling for the strongman, in Trump, to use deadly force, without any evidence, against people accused of made-up crimes that are being equated with — you know, at times, some of the Trump administration people have compared it to — ISIS to antifa, right? So, to me, it's really this kind of fascist attack on civil liberties.

And if they're equating protesters with antifa, and they're saying that they're going to use the methods used for the people in the boats in the Caribbean on antifa, the implication is they are ready to kill American protesters. And, you know, we know the history of Kent State — right? — where students were gunned down in the '60s. It could happen again if we're not careful. So we really need to be very vigilant about this.

AMY GOODMAN: Do you think progressive groups, groups that care about democracy, free speech, across the political spectrum, are pushing back enough around the attack on anti-fascists?

MARK BRAY: Well, you know, I think there's always room for more action. And I think that my main takeaway for viewers today is that whether or not you consider yourself an anti-fascist, anyone who has any critiques of Trump is potentially in the crosshairs here, because there's a concerted project from the top to equate protest with terrorism and to say anyone who's not a Trump supporter is basically the equivalent of ISIS. You can't make this stuff up. It's absolutely ridiculous. They don't care at all about grounding in fact or information. It's something that plays to their base and justifies attempts to step beyond due process to use, apparently, lethal force against dissidents. This is terrifying. And so, everyone really needs to do what they can to sound the alarm.

AMY GOODMAN: Finally, I wanted to ask you about the Rutgers students calling for the university to support you, wanting Rutgers President William Tate to issue a statement, a, quote, “Resolution in Support of Professor Mark Bray's Academic Freedom and Free Expression.” This apparently is slated for consideration and vote Friday by the Rutgers University Senate. Your response, Professor Bray?

MARK BRAY: Well, I've received a tremendous amount of support from the Rutgers faculty, from the student body and from the administration. I support that call. I hope it passes. I would very much appreciate a statement of direct support from President Tate. But, you know, to his credit, he did issue a statement in support of the free speech and academic freedom of all Rutgers faculty, which did not mention me directly, but I think, implicitly, supported my right to do my scholarship in accord with my job. But, you know, again, the Rutgers community has been fantastic, and especially given attacks on higher education across the country, the way that some subjects have been, basically, straight-up banned in states like Florida, I'm happy to be a professor at Rutgers.

AMY GOODMAN: Mark Bray, Rutgers University history professor, author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook. He's just moved his family to Spain after receiving death threats following President Trump's push to categorize the anti-fascist movement as a domestic terrorist organization.

Coming up, we speak with a professor at Stanford University, professor emeritus, about what — the deal that was made in Sharm el-Sheikh, and also about his own niece, who had been held hostage by Hamas in Gaza for 54 days, her husband killed. This is Democracy Now! Back in 30 seconds.

            President Donald Trump is involved in planning for a major new monument in Washington, DC: a triumphal arch to commemorate the country's 250th anniversary, marking his latest effort to impose his style and tastes on the nation's capital.
    


            The Trump administration, said sources familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to describe ongoing deliberations, is considering building a permanent arch as part of broader America250 celebrations honoring the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence next July.
    


            A senior White House official told CNN the arch was Trump's idea.
    


            “He came up with the design and has been part of the process every step of the way,” the official said.
    


From flag poles to a $200 million ballroom: Inside Trump's ‘legacy project' at the White House



            Trump remains deeply attuned to his background as a real estate developer and has taken major steps since returning to office to apply his aesthetic vision to Washington, DC: paving over the White House Rose Garden and decorating it to mirror his Mar-a-Lago patio; adorning the Oval Office, Cabinet Room, and West Colonnade with gilded features; and launching a major ballroom expansion.
    


            Last week, AFP photographer Jim Watson captured images of a pair of three-dimensional models of the proposed arch atop Trump's desk in the Oval Office as the president met with his Finnish counterpart, President Alexander Stubb. Canadian Minister of Energy Tim Hodgson also posted a photo of Trump showcasing one of the models to a group of Canadian officials. The models were on the president's desk again on Wednesday as he hosted an event on crime statistics.
    


            The models match a design and watercolor rendering from the firm Harrison Design. Trump recently posted the watercolor on social media, offering an implicit endorsement of the plans.
    


            The White House, Harrison Design and America250 did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            The watercolor of the proposed stone arch features columns, eagles, wreaths, and a gilded, winged figure. It is similar to France's Arc de Triomphe. Trump memorably visited Paris in 2017, where he delightedly observed a Bastille Day parade from a viewing stand near the iconic arch – and soon called on his aides to deliver his own military parade, which came to fruition eight years later.
    


            The design is in progress and timing for construction of the arch is to be determined, the senior White House official said.
    


            The proposed monument would be situated near the Virginia side of the Arlington Memorial Bridge – atop a grassy traffic circle directly between Arlington National Cemetery and the Lincoln Memorial, according to architect Nicolas Leo Charbonneau, a partner at Harrison Design.
    


            “A proposal for a triumphal arch in DC for #America250, in the traffic circle in front of Arlington National Cemetery. America needs a triumphal arch!” Charbonneau posted on social media alongside a watercolor rendering of the arch by artist Christopher Draper.
    


            It was not immediately clear how the arch would be paid for.
    


            “Washington, DC, is the only major Western capital that lacks an arch. It's a time-honored tradition for celebrating events and people and ideas – and also for acting as gateways to cities,” a source familiar with the matter said.
    


            Catesby Leigh, a co-founder of the National Civil Art Society, has made multiple appeals for a triumphal arch to commemorate the country's anniversary. He suggested in a December 2024 piece for urban policy magazine City Journal that any initial structure should be temporary – but could be eventually made permanent.
    


            “There isn't enough time to build a permanent arch for the 250th. But temporary arches have a long history in this country. And there's also a noteworthy precedent for a temporary arch being rebuilt in permanent form after winning public acclaim: the Washington Arch in Manhattan, which celebrated the centennial of George Washington's first inauguration,” Leigh wrote.
    


            The plans come months after the president signed an executive order mandating that all federal buildings embrace classical architecture, noting that any designs that depart from the “preferred style,” including Brutalist-style buildings, must be run directly by the president.
    


            While the new arch won't be subject to those restrictions, the source familiar with the matter said that the design “follows the spirit of the executive order.”
    


            On Wednesday, as reporters departed an Oval Office event, Trump was asked about the model on his desk.
    


            “It's an Arc, take a look,” he said, according to pool reports.
    


            Asked who the arch was for, the president pointed at himself: “Me.”
    


Correction:
This headline and story have been updated to correct the proposed location for the triumphal arch inside Washington, DC.

Here's a simple way to switch up your walking routine, according to experts: try going backward.

Taking a brisk walk is an exercise rich in simplicity, and it can have impressive mental and physical benefits: stronger bones and muscles, cardiovascular fitness and stress relief, to name a few. But like any workout, hoofing it for your health may feel repetitive and even boring after a while.

Backward walking, also known as retro walking or reverse walking, could add variety and value to an exercise routine, when done safely. Turning around not only provides a change of view, but also puts different demands on your body.

Janet Dufek, a biomechanist and faculty member at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, has researched the mechanics of both walking and landing from jumps to identify ways of preventing injuries and improving physical performance. And as a former college basketball player and a regular exerciser, she's also done her fair share of backward walking. 

In humans, reverse locomotion can increase hamstring flexibility, strengthen underused muscles and challenges the mind as the body adjusts to a new movement and posture. 

“I see a lot of people in my neighborhood and they walk, and that's good,” she said. “But they are still stressing the same elements of their structure over and over again. Walking backward introduces an element of cross-training, a subtly different activity.”




Kevin Patterson, a personal trainer in Nashville, Tennessee, recommends the treadmill as the safest place to retro walk. You can adjust it to a slow speed. However, Patterson likes to turn off the treadmill — termed the “dead mill” — and have clients propel the belt on their own. 

“It can take a while to get the treadmill going, but from there we have them be the horsepower for the treadmill,” he said. 

Patterson said he uses backward walking with all his clients as an “accessory exercise” — a weight-training term for add-on movements designed to work a specific muscle group — or during warm-ups. The activity typically makes up a small part of the workouts, he said. 

“The treadmill is great for older clients because you have the handles on the side and you reduce that risk of falling,” he said.

Dufek suggests working a one-minute segment of backward walking into a 10-minute walk and adding time and distance as you get comfortable.

You can also do it with a partner; face each other, perhaps clasp hands. One person walks backward, and the other strolls forward and watches for problems. Then switch positions. 

“At first, you start really, really slowly because there's a balance accommodation and there is brain retraining. You are learning a new skill,” Dufek said. “You're using muscles in different ways.”

If you work your way up to running and get really good at it, you can try running a marathon backward — 26.2 miles or 42.2 kilometers. Yes, people have done that.

Dufek classifies backward walking as a form of cross-training, or incorporating a mix of moves into a fitness program. Doing a range of exercises can help prevent overuse injuries, which can occur after repeatedly using the same muscle groups.

For many people, cross-training involves different activities and types of exercise: for example, running one day, swimming the next, and strength training on a third day. But the modifications required to walk backward work in the same way, but on a micro level. 

Do small tweaks make much of a difference? Once an avid runner, Dufek said she had several pairs of running shoes and did not wear the same pair two days in a row. 

“The shoes had a different level of wear, a different design,” she said. “Just by changing that one element, in this case footwear, it would provide a slightly different stress to the system.”

Physical therapists instruct some of their clients to reverse walk, which can be useful after knee injuries or for people in rehabilitation or recovering from surgery. 

“Backward walking is very different than forward walking from a force perspective, from a movement pattern perspective,” Dufek explained. Instead of landing heel first, “you strike the forefoot first, often quite gently, and often the heel does not contact the ground.” 

“This reduces of the range of motion in the knee joint, which allows for activity without stressing the (knee) joint,” Dufek said. 

Backward walking also stretches the hamstring muscles, the group of muscles at the back of the thigh. Dufek is interested in finding out if it improves balance and reduces fall risks in older adults by activating more senses of the body. 

There is nothing unnatural about backward walking. In fact, backward running is a key skill for top athletes.

Basketball players do it. So do soccer players. American football players — particularly the defensive backs — do it continually.

“I played basketball and I probably spent 40% of my time playing defense and running backwards,” Dufek said.

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australia's highest court on Wednesday rejected U.S. conservative commentator Candace Owens ' bid to overturn an Australian government decision barring her from visiting the country.

Three High Court judges unanimously rejected Owens' challenge to Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke's decision in 2024 to refuse her a visa on character grounds.

Owens had planned to begin a speaking tour in Australia last November and also visit neighboring New Zealand.

Burke used his powers under the Migration Act last October to refuse her a visa because she failed the so-called “character test,” court documents said.

Burke found there was a risk Owens would “incite discord in the Australian community” and that refusing her a visa was in the national interest. As a political commentator, author and activist, Owens was “known for her controversial and conspiratorial views.”

She had made “extremist and inflammatory comments toward Muslim, Black, Jewish and LGBTQIA+ communities which generate controversy and hatred,” Burke said in court documents. 

Owens' lawyers had argued the Migrant Act was unconstitutional because it infringed upon Australia's implied freedom of political communications. 

Australia doesn't have an equivalent of the U.S. First Amendment that states a right to free speech. But because Australia is a democracy, the High Court has decided that the constitution implies free speech limited to governmental and political matters.




Owens' lawyers had argued that if the Migration Act was constitutional, then Burke had misconstrued his powers under that law in refusing her a visa.

The judges rejected both arguments and ordered Owens to pay the government's court costs. 

Burke described the ruling as a “win for social cohesion.”

“Inciting discord might be the way some people make money, but it's not welcome in Australia,” Burke said in statement.

Owens' spokesman told The Associated Press in an email on Thursday Owens would comment on the court decision on social media later this week.

Burke had told the court that while Owens already had an ability to incite discord through her 18 million followers across social media platforms, her presence in Australia would amplify that potential.

He noted that when Australia's terrorism threat level was elevated from “possible” to “probable” last year, the national domestic spy agency reported an “increase in extremism.” 

Australia has long used a wide discretion under the character test to refuse foreigners temporary visas.

Burke stripped Ye, the U.S. rapper formerly known as Kanye West, of an Australian visa after he released his single “Heil Hitler” in May this year. Ye had been traveling for years to Australia, where his wife of three years, Bianca Censori, was born. 

Burke's decision to ban Owens prompted neighboring New Zealand to refuse her a visa in November on the grounds that she had been rejected by Australia. But a New Zealand immigration official overturned that refusal in December, citing “the importance of free speech.”

Owens' spokesman said on Thursday she would not tour New Zealand.

Jon Fetherston, a former Massachusetts migrant shelter director, revealed that he was grabbed and attacked by an immigrant after Fetherston and a state official confronted him about raping and impregnating his own daughter.

A former Massachusetts shelter director-turned-whistleblower is calling the sentencing of yet another illegal alien for raping a child at a taxpayer-funded shelter further evidence of a ""total government failure"" in the sanctuary state.

Haitian illegal alien Cory Alvarez, 27, was found guilty of aggravated rape of a child at a migrant shelter in Rockland, Massachusetts, and sentenced to 10 to 12 years in prison, according to NBC 10 Boston.

Alvarez was arrested by Rockland police in 2024 on suspicion of sexual assault on a 15-year-old female victim. Both Alvarez and the victim were living at a state-run shelter at a Comfort Inn.

Alvarez was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in August. According to the agency, he entered the country lawfully in 2023 but violated the terms of his admittance, meaning he was present in the country illegally.

MIGRANT CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN PILE UP IN BOSTON AREA AS MAYOR SLAMS BONDI OVER ‘SANCTUARY' WARNING

In response, Fetherston, who ran a similar migrant shelter in Marlborough, Massachusetts, from 2023 to 2024, said Alvarez's sentencing ""exposes a much bigger problem.""

""Call it what you will, but this is total government failure,"" he said. ""You have documented cases now of these girls being assaulted in shelters run with taxpayer dollars. No one at the top, including Governor Maura Healey, is taking any of the responsibility.""

Fetherston has previously blown the whistle on ""rampant"" sexual abuse of children taking place in the Massachusetts-run shelter system.

Speaking with Fox News Digital in February, he detailed the case of another Haitian illegal alien, Ronald Joseph, who raped and impregnated his own 14-year-old daughter at the Marlborough shelter. Fetherston said that when he and the authorities confronted Joseph about the rape, he became agitated and threatened him. Despite the gravity of the crime, Fetherston said he was instructed to order Joseph a ride to another state-run shelter.

Joseph was not arrested until months later. He has since been sentenced to 12 to 15 years in prison for aggravated rape of a child.

Fetherston said that these two cases are not isolated but rather part of a larger disturbing pattern of child sexual abuse that has largely gone unpunished.

""The state didn't protect these children, and when you don't protect children, you have no moral authority to run these programs,"" he said, adding, ""If you're not going to protect children, you shouldn't be in office.""

Earlier this year, a Healey spokesperson told the Boston Herald that the governor ""inherited a disaster of a shelter system"" and that Healey ""is the one who took action to implement a length of stay limit, mandate criminal background checks, require residents to prove Massachusetts residency and lawful immigration status, and get families out of hotels."" 

Fetherston said that despite claims that shelter residents had all been vetted through criminal background checks, ""not a single one of these people was vetted"" and ""nobody knows who they are.""

""The governor opened up the doors wide open and didn't vet anybody, and that is on her,"" he said.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CHARGED WITH REPEATED SEXUAL ASSAULT OF 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL: FLORIDA SHERIFF

He also noted that ""98 percent of the people that I was dealing with were really good people and they were just here to make a better life for themselves. But the 2% that weren't were some of the worst people I have ever seen.""

He emphasized that ""all of these shelters are paid for with taxpayer dollars.""

""The taxpayers need to realize that essentially, and horribly, you're funding these rapes and assaults of little girls,"" he said, adding, ""Nobody wants that.""

In August, Healey ordered the closure of the state's shelter system and made some of the residents eligible to receive at least $30,000 in state housing assistance over a two-year period.

Since then, Fetherston said that local police have told him there has been an uptick in auto accidents. He also said that school districts, especially in small-town communities, have been overwhelmed by the influx of foreign students.

""Where do you pull the money from? Do you pull money from police? Do you pull the money from fire? Do you not fix the roads that year? Because you do have to educate these children. So, I mean it has devastating effects on small communities.""

Fox News Digital previously reported that Alvarez arrived in June under the parole process for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans (CHNV) instituted by the Biden administration. The policy was first announced for Venezuelans in October 2022, which allowed a limited number to fly directly into the U.S. as long as they had not entered illegally, had a sponsor in the U.S. already and passed certain checks.

Fox News Digital reached out to Healey's office for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani discusses President Donald Trump's peace deal in the Middle East and addresses his prior claims about having the Israeli prime minister arrested on 'The Story.'

New York City Democratic Socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani said the city should honor the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant issued for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he were to visit the city.

""I've said that this is a city that believes international law, and this is a city that wants to uplift and uphold those beliefs,"" Mamdani told Fox News' Martha MacCallum on ""The Story"" on Wednesday.

MacCallum then challenged Mamdani, saying, ""The United States doesn't stand by the International Criminal Court.""

Mamdani acknowledged that the U.S. has not signed the treaty for the International Criminal Court.MAMDANI STANDS BY PROMISE TO ARREST NETANYAHU IF HE COMES TO NEW YORK CITY

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani speaks during a Wednesday interview on Fox News' ""The Story with Martha MacCallum,"" where he discussed the Gaza ceasefire and said he would uphold an International Criminal Court warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (Fox News)

""The Criminal Court, however, has issued a warrant for the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu, as it has for Vladimir Putin,"" he continued. ""I've said that I believe that we should uphold arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court and that we would… do so only in abiding with all of the laws in front of us.""

Mamdani said he would not make a new law to ensure Netanyahu could be arrested.

MacCallum then asked Mamdani if he thinks NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch would allow him to arrest Netanyahu in the city.

Mamdani refused to answer the question, and when asked again, said: ""I can tell you that I'm going to exhaust every legal option in front of me, not to make new laws to do so.""

Netanyahu faces an ICC warrant tied to alleged war crimes in Gaza. The United States does not recognize the ICC.The mayoral hopeful also notably refused to give President Donald Trump any credit during the interview concerning the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas secured last week.""To any extent, credit or not, I think it's too early to do so, too early to say,"" said Mamdani. ""But if it but if it proves to be something that is lasting, something that is durable, then I think that that's where you give credit.""ACTIVISTS SOUND ALARM ON 'DEEPLY TROUBLING' POLL SHOWING SUPPORT FOR MAMDANI'S ANTI-ISRAEL MESSAGING

'Fox & Friends' co-hosts discuss a new report that an anti-Israeli protester on Columbia University's campus was in a group chat with a Hamas spokesperson.

Students for Justice in Palestine, the anti-Israel group with chapters across American college campuses, is calling for ""death to all collaborators"" in Gaza.

In a Sunday Instagram post, the group cited the death of journalist Saleh Al-Jafarawi, who was killed the same day during fighting between Hamas and the Doghmush clan, a Palestinian opposition group.

""Three days after the ceasefire deal announcement, journalist Saleh Al-Jafarawi was martyred by the Zionist-proxy Doghmush clan,"" SJP wrote in a tribute online. ""Saleh's martyrdom is a testament to the fact that the fight against Zionism in all its manifestations — from the IOF to its collaborators — must continue,"" it wrote, using the acronym for ""Israeli Occupation Forces.""

""Death to the occupation. Death to Zionism. Death to all collaborators,"" the post concluded.

'Dancing with the Stars' contestants Brooks Nader and Gleb Savchenko tell Fox News Digital that they got ‘secret' matching tattoos together.

Brooks Nader stepped out in another head-turning look this week.

The 28-year-old model was photographed in New York City wearing a sheer black turtleneck top, tucked into a black mini skirt and worn with a black blazer over it, barely covering the adhesive silicone covers on her chest.

She accessorized the look with chunky gold earrings, a gold bracelet and sheer black tights. She opted for a more dramatic makeup look, with glossy red lipstick, a subtle smoky eye and bold lashes.

Nader was photographed alongside her sisters Sarah Jane and Grace Ann as they exited the ""Sherri"" talk show. Sarah Jane wore a black dress with a plunging neckline and a fuzzy burgundy coat, while Grace Ann paired gray dress pants with a black crop top.

The trio appeared on the talk show to promote their reality show, ""Love Thy Nader,"" which follows their journey as sisters as they leave their home in Louisiana to pursue a career in fashion and media in New York.

Brooks' daring fashion choices have led to several wardrobe malfunctions, the most recent one taking place earlier this month during the Marquee Las Vegas grand reveal weekend at Marquee Nightclub.

While in the process of taking a video of herself dancing inside the event, Nader's low-cut dress slipped lower, briefly exposing her chest. She was at the event with her three sisters, this time including the third sister, Mary Holland.

In a recent interview with Maxim magazine, Nader discussed her upbringing in Baton Rouge, explaining she was raised in an ""extremely Christian and extremely conservative"" household, but said she always had dreams of moving to a big city.

""For the majority of our childhood, my dad was working for a non-profit, and my mom was at home with the babies,"" Nader said. ""We didn't have a lot of money. We really just had each other and had to be self-entertaining. I wouldn't trade that upbringing for the world.""

""I always wanted to express myself and I wanted to look sexy,"" she added. ""I fantasized about living in LA or New York, but it seemed worlds away. I also had to toe the line because of where I'm from.""

She said her parents were ""totally against"" her decision to drop out of school and move to New York City to pursue modeling, telling her, ""This is the dumbest thing you could ever do."" Despite that, Nader found an agent and launched her career.

After her agents refused to help her land a spot within the pages of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, Nader took things into her own hands and attended an open casting call. Out of 10,000 girls, Nader became one of six women chosen to be included in the magazine, and was later voted Rookie of the Year.

""You can't wait for other people. It's all up to you,"" she said. ""You have to put in the work, go do it and see the vision for yourself.""

Trump Organization Executive Vice President Eric Trump joins ‘The Story' to discuss the growing fentanyl threat, rising dangers for ICE agents and how President Donald Trump plans to combat drug cartels.

President Donald Trump is next looking ""at land"" in Latin America, after the U.S. military has conducted at least five fatal strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean since September. 

""We are certainly looking at land now because we've got the sea very well under control,"" Trump told reporters Wednesday. ""We've had a couple of days where there isn't a boat to be found, and I view that as a good thing, not a bad thing."" 

Trump said he wasn't interested in having the Coast Guard simply stop the alleged drugs boats because ""we've been doing that for 30 years, and it has been totally ineffective."" 

TRUMP TOUTS US STRIKE AS MADURO SLAMS MILITARY ‘THREAT' OFF VENEZUELA

""They have faster boats. Some of these boats are seriously, I mean, they're world class speedboats,"" Trump said. ""But they're not faster than missiles. But we've been trying to do that for years."" 

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital for more details on the nature of the land operations Trump is considering. 

Additionally, Trump confirmed that he authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, after the New York Times reported Wednesday he had approved the order. According to Trump, he did so because Venezuela has released prisoners into the U.S., and that drugs were coming into the U.S. from Venezuela via maritime channels. 

Trump declined to answer though when asked if the CIA had the authority to ""take out"" Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The Trump administration has said it does not recognize Maduro as a legitimate head of state, but a leader of a drug cartel.

""I don't want to answer a question like that,"" Trump said. ""That's a ridiculous question for me to be given. Not really a ridiculous question, but wouldn't it be a ridiculous question for me to answer? But I think Venezuela is feeling heat."" 

The Trump administration has adopted a hard-line approach to address the flow of drugs into the U.S., and designated drug cartel groups like Tren de Aragua, Sinaloa and others as foreign terrorist organizations in February.

Additionally, the White House sent lawmakers a memo Sept. 30 informing them that the U.S. is now participating in a ""non-international armed conflict"" with drug smugglers. 

However, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have voiced concerns over the legality of the strikes, and Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., filed a war powers resolution in September to bar U.S. forces from engaging in ""hostilities"" against certain non-state organizations.

Although the resolution failed in the Senate by a 51–48 margin Oct. 8, Republicans Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted alongside their Democratic counterparts for the resolution.

When asked about lawmakers' concerns about the legality of the strikes, Trump dismissed them and said that lawmakers were informed the vessels carried drugs. 

""But they are given information that they were loaded up with drugs,"" Trump said. ""And that's the thing that matters. When they're loaded up with drugs, they're fair game. And every one of those ships were, and they're not ships, they're boats.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","‘Roofman': A Heartwarming True-Crime Movie","https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/10/roofman-channing-tatum-movie-review/684561/","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Roofman stays grounded by highlighting life's mundane thrills.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Delinquent protagonists in true-crime stories tend to have a memorable MO: Young lovebirds might find the thrill of theft romantic, while a teenager might relish roping her friends into targeting their favorite celebrities' homes. But Jeffrey Manchester, the robber known as “Roofman,” made headlines for being unusually polite when he executed his misdeeds. After he surprised McDonald's employees by dropping in through the roof—hence his nickname—and holding them at gunpoint, he gently reminded one of them to breathe while they collected cash. Before he locked them in the walk-in refrigerator, he made sure that they had coats to wear so they'd be comfortable in the cold.

Roofman, a movie dramatizing Manchester's life, is similarly eager to please. Starring Channing Tatum as the titular crook, the film transforms the absurd tale of a criminal on the run into an intimate character study. It begins in 2004, with Jeffrey landing in prison—only to escape shortly afterward and find shelter inside a Toys “R” Us. The ensuing series of events incorporate elements of romance and melodrama with farce and action. Anxious to reunite with his estranged family, he ventures outdoors under a false identity; he ends up falling in love with a single mom, Leigh (played by Kirsten Dunst), who works at the store Jeffrey has turned into his hideout. Roofman deftly blends genres to create a low-key crowd-pleaser—one that avoids merely reveling in what made Manchester notorious in the first place.

Movies based on the lives of real people can easily turn into hagiographies, hyperbolizing their circumstances or papering over their scandals. Even an uplifting sports drama such as Rudy or a period piece such as Argo exaggerates scenes for added tension, treating its heroes like unassailable underdogs. But the writer-director Derek Cianfrance, who's best known for making Blue Valentine and other complex tragedies, doesn't excuse Jeffrey for his lawlessness. Cianfrance depicts the character evenly, as someone who can be as clever as he is careless. Jeffrey is resourceful enough to build a security system for his refuge by stringing up baby monitors throughout the store—but he also eats so much candy that he gives himself a toothache. The opportunities for big set pieces are similarly subdued. The closest thing to a car chase comes when Jeffrey drives a used sedan he purchased for Leigh's elder daughter, pushing it beyond the speed limit to impress her. Tatum, too, infuses Jeffrey with a disarming naivete that makes him compelling to watch.

The actor is especially charming in his scenes with Dunst; the two share a down-to-earth chemistry as a pair of single parents who are surprised to find themselves in a budding romance in their 40s. Their relationship fuels the plot, making Jeffrey delay his getaway and revealing what the story is actually about: the emotional toll of starting over. If Leigh likes his cover identity—he calls himself “John Zorn” and gives her an invented backstory—Jeffrey reasons that maybe he doesn't need to keep looking for a way back to his old life of heists. Would acceptance into a new family, even under false pretenses, be enough for him to abandon his past? Is quiet domesticity worth the risk?

Cianfrance uses these questions to explore the humor and suspense in mundanity—how everyday drama can become all-consuming. For Jeffrey, accessing the Toys “R” Us security cameras has become quotidian, but decorating Leigh's apartment for Christmas provides a genuine thrill. Cianfrance captures Jeffrey's misadventures inside the store as if his protagonist is trapped in a cage, underlining how tiny his fugitive life is compared with the immensity of his relationship with Leigh. Even Jeffrey's initial escape from prison is small in scale, his movements practiced, his expressions stoic. He seems much more engaged when he's studying the store employees on the baby monitors as if they're the cast of a reality show. These moments help the film feel lived-in, its sentimentality earned rather than maudlin.

Roofman isn't entirely devoid of more conventional big-screen beats. Tatum mines plenty of laughter from the sillier parts of Jeffrey's story—he almost gets caught while naked one night—and a third-act heist leads to an explosion. But what's most pleasing to watch is Jeffrey's search for companionship: The real Jeffrey Manchester will perhaps always be remembered for his odd behavior as a burglar, but Roofman is more interested in why he couldn't resist connecting with a stranger. In the film, he had the money and the means to flee much earlier. Yet, as Jeffrey puts it in an early scene while attempting to fill a sorry-looking kiddie pool for his daughter's birthday, “it's the trying that counts.”

The president seems undisturbed by the terrorist group's murderous campaign against dissidents. In fact, he seems to admire it.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Until recently, open support for Hamas in the United States was confined to the far left. The national chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, which circulated talking points supporting the October 7 attacks, has lately declared on Instagram “DEATH TO COLLABORATORS.” But the notorious terrorist organization has found a new defender: President Donald Trump.

On Sunday evening, a reporter asked the president about reports that Hamas is reestablishing its authority in the Gaza Strip by executing its rivals. Trump said that the group is merely cracking down on crime, for which it has American approval.

“They do want to stop the problems, and they've been open about it, and we gave them approval for a period of time,” he said. “We are having 'em watch that there's not going to be big crime or some of the problems that you have when you have areas like this that have been literally demolished.”

Yesterday, talking with reporters in the White House, Trump added more detail to his defense of Hamas. “They did take out a couple of gangs that were very bad—very, very bad gangs,” he said. “And they did take 'em out. And they killed a number of gang members. And that didn't bother me much, to be honest with you. That's okay. A couple of very bad gangs.”

Why is Trump praising one of the world's most violent and fanatical terrorist organizations as crime-fighting guardians of public order? Two motives spring to mind.

First, Trump is invested in his cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas. The terms of the pact are shaky, though. Hamas has agreed to release the bodies of its remaining Israeli hostages, but the group is reluctant to heed demands that it give up power. Its frantic campaign of murder and intimidation against alleged gangsters and gangs—who are mostly anti-Hamas armed groups and dissidents, some with ties to Israel—seems designed to foreclose the political transformation the deal calls for. Admitting that this violence poses a dire threat to the prospect of peace in the region would challenge Trump's claim to have brought about a historic truce. And so he is reflexively brushing off any news that seems to undermine his own achievement.

A second, more disturbing explanation is that Trump genuinely does not distinguish between crime-fighting and authoritarian crackdowns. He has praised authoritarian governments elsewhere for using force to suppress protests. In 1990, he told Playboy that China had mistakenly allowed some protests before wisely reversing course: “When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it. Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength. Our country is right now perceived as weak.”

Trump has long praised autocrats who suppress dissent, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. At a press event on Monday, he praised the dictatorship of Egypt's Abdel Fattah el-Sisi for its supposed tough-on-crime stance: “It's about leadership, and it's really nice when you say, ‘How is your crime situation?,' and they don't even know what you're talking about. ‘What do you mean crime? We don't have crime.' Because if he has crime, he puts it out very quickly.” Rather than recoil at the sight of masked goons carrying out street justice without due process, Trump seems similarly inclined to praise Hamas for being tough on crime.

Graeme Wood: One era ends in Gaza, and another begins

The suggestion that Trump sees Hamas's tactics as admirable may sound uncharitable, but Trump himself likened Hamas's approach to his own. Elaborating on his defense of Hamas yesterday, Trump said, “You know, it's no different than other countries. Like, Venezuela sent their gangs into us, and we took care of those gangs. We have Washington, D.C.—it's one of the safest cities in the country. It was one of the worst cities in the country if you go back just a little while ago.”

To be clear, it is different: American cities such as Washington, D.C., may be occupied by the National Guard, but U.S. soldiers are not summarily executing people on the streets. Likewise, the spreading abuses associated with ICE's crackdown fall short of Hamas-level brutality.

Yet Trump's cavalier acceptance of these horrors, and his instinct to equate them with his own domestic crackdown, is revealing. It shows how easily he sees crime-fighting as a valid pretext for the naked murder of political rivals. It also shows that he observes no distinction between the level of force he ought to be able to apply and the unaccountable cruelty exercised by one of the world's most ruthless regimes.

Welcome to The Logoff: The Trump administration is going to extraordinary — and likely illegal — measures to pay members of the US military as a federal government shutdown stretches on.

What's happening? Today is payday for the military, and under ordinary circumstances, they would miss a paycheck for the first time ever because of the government shutdown, now in its third week. Instead, the Trump administration says it is repurposing already-appropriated Defense Department funds to pay soldiers.

What's the context? Military pay is just one way the Trump administration is circumventing some consequences of a shutdown; the administration is also using tariff revenue to fund a key nutrition program for low-income parents and children.

For millions of other federal workers, however, the continuing shutdown means no paychecks and potential financial peril.

Why does this matter? In previous shutdowns, military pay has become a pain point that can force lawmakers to come to the table and reopen the government — or at least pass a standalone bill to pay servicemembers. That may still happen if the shutdown continues, because it's unclear how much extra money DOD can find to keep issuing paychecks. But at least for now, it lets lawmakers punt on the issue.

President Donald Trump's maneuver also underscores the difficulty Democrats have with voting to fund the government. The actual issue — paychecks for troops — has clear bipartisan support, but the method — moving around congressionally appropriated dollars at will — is unlikely to boost Democratic confidence that the administration will stick to the terms of any new funding deal.

The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life.

What's the big picture? This is not just about the shutdown. By finding a way to pay the troops without involving Congress, Trump is encroaching on the constitutional power of the purse that is explicitly reserved for Congress alone. At the same time, Trump is also holding up congressionally appropriated funding when he wants. It's an end-run around Congress from both directions, and an unprecedented concentration of power for a US president.

The Seattle Mariners, two wins away from a first-ever American League pennant, are playing at home tonight. It's already been a sensational postseason for the team, with big performances in the clutch — including from Humpy, the team's hard-luck salmon mascot.

As Yahoo Sports's Jake Mintz chronicles, Humpy — so named for the humpback salmon, along with his comrades King Salmon, Sockeye Salmon, and Silver Salmon — was winless in the team's home-game mascot races until last week. Then, on Friday night, 15 innings deep, he finally won, and the ballpark went crazy. You can read the full piece here. Go Humpy, go M's, and have a great evening!

In this article

Manufacturing is seeing renewed attention from corporate America, with Walmart among the major companies publicly reaffirming its commitment to domestic production. 

At CNBC's inaugural Invest in America Forum, Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said the company is increasing its investments in U.S.-made products and suppliers, describing it as part of a long-standing, strategic priority. 

""Investing in U.S. manufacturing and U.S. operations, sure, it's great for business, but it's also great for employment. It's great for jobs. It's great for the country, and it helps us with our supply chain being flexible and dynamic,"" Furner said. 

Nearly two-thirds of the products Walmart sells are made, grown or assembled in the United States, according to Furner. Walmart is expanding on that front, including a new beef processing facility in Olathe, Kansas, which he said is expected to create over 600 jobs. 

""It's a big investment, and having quality products that are sourced in a more sustainable way that can deliver to customers is really important,"" Furner said. 

Furner also pointed to specific categories where domestic production is being revived, citing a recent partnership with USAntibiotics aimed at ""bringing back products like amoxicillin so that they're made here in the United States.""

Still, global sourcing remains essential for Walmart's operations. 

""We source from all around the world,"" Furner said. ""There are things that are grown around the world that tend to do better in other climates, you know, coffee might be an example … I think there are a lot of possibilities.""

The heightened public focus on U.S. manufacturing comes amid trade policy uncertainty, with tariffs and interest rates remaining central to retailers' equation of how much inventory to stock and what to set prices at. For his part, Furner was uncertain about the future for the levies. 

""As policies change, they'll change. Environments will change. That happens. Commodities change,"" he said. ""We've landed in a place where we have more rollbacks going into the fall than we had at the beginning of the year, and that's something we're proud of.""

Despite uncertain economic headwinds, Furner said Walmart is pushing to lower prices for consumers. 

""We want to try to keep prices as low as we can, as long as we can,"" he said. ""We see a resilient customer that makes really smart choices for what's right for them and their families at the time of shopping.""

In this article

Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla sounded the alarm Wednesday over the potential for the the U.S. to lose its competitive edge to China, but said artificial intelligence could help America maintain its lead.

Speaking at CNBC's inaugural Invest in America Forum in Washington, D.C., the two executives said that while the U.S. still leads in many sectors, inconsistent policy and underinvestment is ceding ground to China. AI, they said, poses both risks and benefits for the U.S. economy.

Scharf said AI will likely reduce the size of workforces — but will boost productivity.

""We will likely have less people, absolutely,"" Scharf said. ""When we look at the tools that we've implemented just for people that are coding, you see 20%, 30%, 40% improvement in coders. We haven't reduced our head count by 20%, 30% or 40%. We're actually doing more than we otherwise would have been able to do.""

Wells Fargo big bank peers like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are already hiring fewer people because of AI advancements.

Scharf also said the financial sector is poised for major regulatory changes despite an ongoing political stalemate in Washington.

""We ultimately do expect significant changes in capital requirements, liquidity requirements,"" he said. ""We do expect to see changes which will allow people in the industry, not just big banks and medium-sized banks, but smaller banks as well, to do more in these [local] communities.""

Bourla, meanwhile, expressed concern about China's growing strength in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, pointing to a surge in research and development spending, regulatory reforms and a national strategy focused on life sciences.

""They [China] filed more patents this year than the U.S.,"" Bourla said. ""That's never happened in history. Five years ago, the split was 90%-10%. ... The gap is closing, but they probably will become [better than us] unless we get our act together.""

Bourla urged the U.S. to shift focus from trying to slow China's progress toward improving its own productivity and innovation.

""We spend more time trying to think about how to slow down China rather than think how we can become better than them,"" Bourla said. ""We need to have regulatory changes here. We need to have stability. Tariffs and pricing was not helping.""

Pfizer recently agreed to a drug pricing deal with the Trump administration as part of a broader effort to remove long-standing uncertainties around pricing, Medicaid reimbursements and distribution. As part of the agreement, Pfizer secured a three-year exemption from pharmaceutical-specific tariffs, contingent on additional investments in U.S. manufacturing. 

""Tariffs and the uncertainty of drastic correction of U.S. pricing — with this deal, we are removing both uncertainties,"" Bourla said Wednesday.

He also called artificial intelligence the next frontier for medicine, predicting that AI will revolutionize drug discovery by dramatically accelerating timelines for finding treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer.

""We tried for years to find cures ... AI will make it happen,"" Bourla said.

Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell on Wednesday asked the U.S. Office of Special Counsel to investigate Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for ""likely"" violating the Hatch Act by making a video to be shown in airports blaming Democrats for the government shutdown.

The Hatch Act bars federal employees, including Cabinet secretaries, from engaging in political activity while acting in their official role.

Multiple major airports have refused to show Noem's video near passenger screening lines, including Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in Cantwell's home state of Washington, as well as airports in Chicago and New York.

A number of airports specifically mentioned the video's potential violation of the Hatch Act in their decision. The Office of Special Counsel is responsible for investigating potential Hatch Act violations.

In a letter to acting Special Counsel Jamieson Greer, Cantwell called out Noem for ""airing a partisan video message — on televisions in public airports across the country — in which she erroneously blames 'Democrats in Congress' for the current government shutdown's impact on airport 'operations' and for Transportation Security Administration ... employees 'working without pay.'""

""This message is not just false; it appears to violate the prohibitions contained in the Hatch Act,"" wrote Cantwell, who is a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.

Cantwell said recent reports indicate that DHS is using taxpayer dollars and federal assets to produce and air the video, in which Noem appears in her official capacity.

The letter notes that Noem, in the video, stands in front of an American flag alongside the official insignia of Homeland Security.

""When viewed in its totality, Secretary Noem's video can only be reasonably interpreted as a partisan message intended to misleadingly malign the Trump Administration's political opponents, convince Americans to blame 'Democrats in Congress' for the ongoing government shutdown, and influence their future votes — all while omitting the fact that Republicans currently control the White House, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives,"" Cantwell wrote.

""As the independent agency responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, I urge you to investigate this matter immediately,"" she wrote Greer.

DHS didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Cantwell's letter.

A spokesperson for Port of Seattle, which operates the Seattle-Tacoma airport, said Noem's video was not being played ""due to the political nature of the content.""

A spokesperson for Portland International Airport in Oregon told CNBC that the airport ""did not consent to playing the video in its current form, as we believe the Hatch Act clearly prohibits use of public assets for political purposes and messaging.""

Oops, something went wrong

The UK government has proposed a compensation scheme for victims of a Chinese investment fraud while seeking to retain the majority of a £5 billion ($7.2 billion) Bitcoin fortune seized from the perpetrators.

The announcement came during a High Court hearing in London on Wednesday, where the Director of Public Prosecutions informed victims' lawyers about the possibility of establishing such a scheme, though specific details remain undisclosed.

At the center of the dispute are 61,000 Bitcoin, worth $6.7 billion, seized by police in 2018 from devices found at a mansion in Hampstead, north London, now representing one of the largest cryptocurrency seizures in UK history.

The case has pitted British authorities against approximately 130,000 Chinese investors who lost money in the fraud and contend the UK state should not benefit from their losses.

Zhimin Qian, left, and Seng Hok Ling, right | Source: FT

Zhimin Qian, 47, also known as Yadi Zhang, masterminded an investment fraud in China between 2014 and 2017 that defrauded victims of 43 billion yuan ($6 billion).

She fled China after converting much of the investors' cash into Bitcoin and settled in the UK under a false identity.

Qian and her Malaysian associate Seng Hok Ling, 47, pleaded guilty to money laundering charges last month at Southwark Crown Court in London. Both are scheduled for sentencing in November.

Bitcoin's value has surged dramatically since the 2018 seizure, climbing from approximately $1.8 billion at the time to its current valuation of roughly $7.2 billion.

UK authorities recently obtained access to additional cryptocurrency assets worth about £67 million after Qian disclosed access codes and passwords for a ledger and two cryptocurrency wallets.

“The ledger had been found in a purpose-made concealed pocket within a pair of jogging bottoms which was wearing at the time of her arrest,” according to written submissions by Martin Evans KC, counsel for the Crown Prosecution Service.

Evans told the court that the proposed compensation scheme would provide “adequate protection” for victims.

The CPS stated it had maintained throughout legal proceedings that it intended to seek a civil recovery order to compensate victims for their lost investment, insofar as they have not otherwise been compensated.

The agency said it would consider how all victims could be compensated, not just those participating in the UK legal proceedings.

William Glover, director at law firm Fieldfisher representing a group of victims, said in a statement following the hearing that “the DPP has effectively accepted responsibility to create a form of compensation scheme for those who may be unable to seek redress through the existing statutory provisions.”

However, lawyers for the victims face serious challenges in proving direct links between their clients' investments and the confiscated coins.

Jack Ding, assistant managing partner at Duan & Duan, which represents around 10,000 victims, noted that “some materials lack sufficient information to establish a clear connection.”

Legal experts warn that victims are unlikely to recover Bitcoin's appreciated value, as courts typically focus on returning principal amounts and reasonable interest rather than speculative gains.

The Bitcoin spoils have drawn attention from UK Treasury officials, with some privately questioning whether the assets could help Chancellor Rachel Reeves address the country's fiscal gap estimated at up to £30 billion by 2029.

However, other government officials have cautioned that the haul is likely subject to protracted legal battles extending potentially into 2027.

The Treasury has been advised it cannot include the seized assets in its fiscal calculations, as the Office for Budget Responsibility does not account for asset seizures in its forecasts.

Meanwhile, authorities face the practical challenge of liquidating such a large Bitcoin position without triggering major market disruption.

The case has sparked debate about cryptocurrency regulation and enforcement in cross-border fraud cases, with implications for how governments handle seized digital assets.

A civil recovery case filed in September 2024 will determine the final distribution of assets, with proceedings scheduled to continue through January 2026.

The outcome is expected to establish precedents for international cooperation in cryptocurrency-related financial crime cases and may influence how other jurisdictions approach similar seizures.

The coordination difficulties are compounded by the fact that many victims have limited experience with digital finance, making documentation and claim verification particularly challenging.

Two MIT-educated brothers went on trial Tuesday in Manhattan federal court for allegedly stealing $25 million in crypto in just 12 seconds. However, their defense claims it wasn't illegal for them to have outmaneuvered ""predatory"" trading bots.

Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno are alleged to have committed conspiracy, wire fraud, and money laundering. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years.

Federal prosecutors call their April 2023 maximal extractable value (MEV) exploit on the Ethereum blockchain a ""first-of-its-kind"" fraud scheme, while defense attorneys insist it was simply a smart strategy in an unregulated marketplace.

The trial may run into the first week of November as the brothers have rejected the plea deal.

Prosecutors allege the brothers ""meticulously planned"" the heist over at least three months, even Googling ""how to wash crypto"" and ""top crypto lawyers.""

The brothers have sought to exclude their Google search history, arguing the searches occurred during privileged attorney consultations after being ""threatened by anonymous sandwich attackers.""

The duo allegedly exploited a software flaw during the 12-second gap before trades were finalized, turning the victims' $25 million into “effectively worthless, illiquid junk crypto,” prosecutors said.

But defense attorney Patrick Looby, who represents the elder brother James, argues there's ""no central authority"" governing Ethereum and ""no government regulations.""

""Instead, economic incentives guide parties' behavior,"" Looby told U.S. District Court Judge Jessica G.L. Clarke during oral arguments in June.

For fraud charges to stick, ""there needs to be a promise to the victim,"" he said. ""Here, there is no alleged communication at all between the Peraire-Buenos and the traders.""

The alleged victims lost their crypto ""through pre-programmed trades without ever interacting with the Peraire-Buenos, directly or indirectly,"" defense attorneys argued in a failed motion to dismiss the indictment.

""I think that deception is legally possible through code alone,"" Slava Demchuk, CEO of compliance firm AMLBot, told Decrypt. ""Plainly speaking, fraud does not require a direct victim contact or false statements, if the code is written or designed to mislead.""

""It is rather a gray area and it will be for the jury to assess,"" Demchuk added, acknowledging the unregulated crypto space complicates matters.

Niko Demchuk, head of legal at AMLBot, told Decrypt the search terms ""how to wash crypto"" and ""top crypto lawyers"" are ""circumstantial evidence of mens rea, suggesting the brothers knew their actions were illegal and planned to conceal proceeds.""

“The defense argues that the unregulated crypto context and lack of direct victim interaction undermine mens rea. Hence, the ball is in the jury's court,” he added.

In an embarrassing error, PayPal blockchain partner Paxos accidentally minted 300 trillion of the PYUSD token today. PayPal's stablecoin, which it debuted in 2023, is supposed to be redeemable at a 1:1 rate for US dollars. $300 trillion is more than double the entire world's current GDP of $117 trillion. In short, that's a really bad mistake from Paxos.

At least the action did appear to be a mistake. Paxos acknowledged the issue in a post on X, assuring clients that their funds are secure and stating that it burned the excess reserves of stablecoins. The company claimed that ""this was an internal technical error.” Maybe so, but internal technical errors can still wreak havoc pretty quickly when it comes to finance, especially in the fantasy worlds of blockchain and crypto.

BDC and Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC join forces to expand access to financing and advice, unlocking growth where it's often overlooked

PRINCE GEORGE, British Columbia and QUEBEC CITY and MONTREAL, Oct. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC and the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) today announced a $100M initiative to reach more business owners living in rural and remote areas. Leaders in their communities, rural entrepreneurs are an exceptionally active demographic, with an entrepreneurship rate standing at 17% in 2024, compared to 12% in urban areas. The financing envelope created by this new initiative is expected to generate up to $250 million in GDP over five years.

With their respective business centres and offices throughout the country, Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC and BDC have a complimentary footprint. A federal program administered by regional development agencies and Canada Economic Development, Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC operates 267 non-profit offices across Canada delivering small business loans, tools, training and events. BDC supports entrepreneurs with financing, advisory services and capital from 109 business centres across Canada and online at bdc.ca.

""This initiative aims to increase the support provided to the 520,000 entrepreneurs living in rural and remote areas who grow our economy”, said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions. ""It leverages the complementary strengths of both organizations-BDC's financing and advisory expertise and Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC's deep local presence across the country.”

""At BDC, we believe that every entrepreneur, no matter where they live, deserves a fair chance to grow their business. Rural and remote communities are full of bold, resilient business owners who often face more barriers and fewer resources”, said Isabelle Hudon, President and Chief Executive Officer of BDC. ""This initiative with Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC allows us to do what a development bank should: go where others don't, and build bridges where gaps exist. We're unlocking potential that's been overlooked for too long. We believe that's what our economy needs right now.”

""Joining forces with BDC to supercharge the opportunities and resources available to rural and remote entrepreneurs from coast-to-coast-to-coast is a powerful combination that will result in significant impact throughout the country for decades to come,"" said Troy Dungate, President of Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC. ""BDC is committing to investing $100M to bolster businesses that often face strong headwinds simply due to geography and the vast nature of our country. This commitment, combined with our boots-on-the-ground, grassroots knowledge is an intelligent way to ensure that this capital infusion is dispersed through loans to new and existing entrepreneurs that are ready to bring their business to the next level. Additionally, we know that many entrepreneurs in rural Canada are attracted to the work because of the desirable lifestyle it creates for their families. Working together, we expect this to make positive, meaningful change in the lives of individual Canadians and our country as a whole.”

This initiative with Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC builds on BDC's broader commitment to develop entrepreneurial potential in all its forms and to help grow the Canadian economy. Since launching our Community Banking initiative in November 2024, BDC teamed up with financial institutions and community lending partners that support underserved groups. By joining this network of trusted partners, Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC should help us reach even more business owners in rural and remote areas. It's about meeting entrepreneurs where they are and helping them grow.

This announcement comes just before Small Business Week, a national celebration of Canadian entrepreneurship that BDC has organized for more than 45 years. This year's theme is The economic revolution is here - get your business ready.

BDC and Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC are stepping up to help entrepreneurs in rural and remote communities-who are vital contributors to Canada's economy-have the resources they need to thrive.

The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has granted conditional national bank status to Erebor Bank, a new tech-oriented bank seeking to rise into the gap left by the collapse of several such lenders in 2023, including Silicon Valley Bank.OCC chief Jonathan Gould said the Wednesday approval — the first new-bank charter in his tenure at the regulator — offers ""proof that the OCC under my leadership does not impose blanket barriers to banks that want to engage in digital asset activities.""Permissible digital asset activities, like any other legally permissible banking activity, have a place in the federal banking system if conducted in a safe and sound manner,"" Gould said in a statement.The firm, leaning into the tech world's love for names associated with the fiction of J.R.R. Tolkien, described itself in its charter application as a national bank that will ""operate as a banking organization providing traditional banking products, as well as virtual currency-related products and services."" The banking regulator's ""preliminary conditional approval"" is dependent on the new institution meeting ongoing requirements in a kind of probationary period. The agency's approval letter noted that Erebor will ""target its products and services to technology companies and ultra-high-net-worth individuals that utilize virtual currencies.""This year, as regulators appointed by crypto-boosting President Donald Trump reversed earlier government resistance to crypto-tied businesses, the U.S. banking agencies, which also includes the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., have sought to issue friendlier policy guidance for the industry. In 2021, Anchorage Digital had opened the movement of crypto-oriented banks into OCC chartering, and it stood alone in that category for years, but a number of digital assets firms have recently moved to seek federal banking charters in the U.S. The OCC is the only regulator who grants such charters at the national level.

175-year-old French banking giant ODDO BHF, which manages over €150 billion ($173 billion) in assets, is entering the crypto space with the launch of a euro-backed stablecoin dubbed EUROD.

The token is set to be listed on Madrid-based crypto platform Bit2Me, one of the largest exchanges in the Spanish-speaking world that's backed by telecom giant Telefonica and other major institutions including banking giants Unicaja and BBVA.

EUROD, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk, is designed to be a compliant, low-volatility digital version of the euro. The firms said it meets requirements under the EU's new MiCA regulation and is aimed at both retail and institutional users.

Bit2Me, which saw Tether lead a €30 million ($35 million) investment round in it earlier this year, is positioning the listing as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto.

“The listing of ODDO BHF's euro stablecoin is another important step in Bit2Me's mission to offer trusted, regulated digital assets,” said Leif Ferreira, Bit2Me's CEO.

By pairing a euro-pegged digital asset with a regulated banking institution, ODDO BHF is betting on a growing demand for payment solutions that combine the stability of fiat with the convenience of blockchain rails.

While the stablecoin market is heavily dominated by U.S. dollar-backed tokens, major institutions have been venturing into EUR-backed stablecoins. Société Générale-FORGE (SG-FORGE) is one of those institutions, having issued a euro-backed stablecoin called EURCV$1.1626.

Last month, nine European banks including ING, Banca Sella, Dankse Bank, DekaBank, and CaixaBank joined forces to issue a MiCA-Compliant euro-backed stablecoin.

Water is essential for almost every aspect of life on our planet and, unsurprisingly, its properties have been studied in great detail1. However, disproportionately little remains known about the electrical properties of interfacial and strongly confined water2,3, in which the structure deviates from that of bulk water, becoming distinctly layered4,5. The structural change is expected to affect the conductivity of water and particularly its polarizability, which in turn modifies intermolecular forces that play a crucial role in many physical and chemical processes6,7,8,9. Here we use scanning dielectric microscopy (SDM)10 to probe the in-plane electrical properties of water confined between atomically flat surfaces separated by distances down to 1 nm. For confinement exceeding several nanometres, water exhibits an in-plane dielectric constant close to that of bulk water and its proton conductivity is notably enhanced, gradually increasing with decreasing water thickness. This trend abruptly changes when the confined water becomes only a few molecules thick. Its in-plane dielectric constant reaches large, ferroelectric-like values of about 1,000, whereas the conductivity peaks at several S m−1, close to values characteristic of superionic liquids. We attribute the enhancement to strongly disordered hydrogen bonding induced by the few-layer confinement, which facilitates both easier in-plane polarization of molecular dipoles and faster proton exchange. This insight into the electrical properties of nanoconfined water is important for understanding many phenomena that occur at aqueous interfaces and in nanoscale pores.

In the bulk and at room temperature (RT), water exhibits exceptionally high dielectric constant (εbulk ≈ 80) and high (for a wide-bandgap insulator) electrical conductivity (σbulk ≈ 10−5 S m−1)1. Both characteristics are inherently connected with the ability of water molecules to form hydrogen bonds11,12,13 and are key to the main properties of water. Among them is its remarkable ability to dissolve more substances than any other liquid7,8, which originates from the high εbulk of water that efficiently suppresses Coulomb interactions between solutes. The strong dielectric screening is also critical in biochemical processes responsible for life7 (for example, proteins folding and assembly, their interaction with nucleic acids and ion transport across cell membranes). Notably, several phenomena involving water (including solvation) occurs at solid interfaces, at which liquid water exhibits a distinct layered structure4,5. Within these layers, the hydrogen-bond network is greatly altered compared with that of bulk water, no longer following the ice rules14. Accordingly, the electrical properties of water near surfaces and inside nanoscale cavities are expected to be different from those of bulk water2,3. These differences have been the subject of intense research. In particular, proton conductivity of near-surface water has been reported to become much larger than σbulk, although the magnitude of this enhancement and the underlying mechanism remain debated15,16,17,18,19. Meanwhile, it has proved difficult to assess the dielectric properties of interfacial and nanoconfined water20,21. Only recently22 has it been shown that, in the direction perpendicular to surfaces, water within several near-surface layers becomes non-polarizable, exhibiting the dielectric constant ε⊥ ≈ 2, in agreement with many theoretical predictions23,24,25,26. However, the in-plane dielectric constant ε// of interfacial water remains essentially unknown, because ε// is even more challenging to measure than ε⊥ owing to the lack of suitable experimental techniques. The in-plane polarizability of near-surface water is also poorly understood theoretically and, depending on assumptions and confinement strength, ε// was predicted to attain values from giant to bulk-like to exceptionally small27,28,29,30.

To examine the in-plane response of nanoconfined water, we have used SDM10. Our set-up is shown schematically in Fig. 1a and detailed in Methods. Briefly, nanoscale channels of various heights h and width of about 200 nm were fabricated by van der Waals assembly of atomically flat monocrystals of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and graphite (for fabrication details, see Methods). An AC voltage was applied to an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip and its mechanical response to the electrostatic force translated into local electrical impedance. By scanning the tip across the channels, the dielectric response of water inside the nanochannels was measured and compared with that of nearby insulating spacers made of hBN with known dielectric constant (εhBN ≈ 4). This approach is conceptually similar to that used to study ε⊥ of nanoconfined water22 but the previous set-up was insensitive to ε// because the electric field E was applied perpendicular to the channels. To measure ε//, we have introduced two main changes. First, the ground electrode (graphite crystal in Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1) has been moved away from the investigated water layer by adding a relatively thick hBN crystal to the assembly, which creates an in-plane field component E// inside the water (Fig. 1a). Second, we have expanded the measurement bandwidth by about five orders of magnitude from the standard kHz frequencies into the GHz regime, which is challenging but essential for measuring ε// in the presence of unexpectedly high σ// found for few-layer (quasi-2D) water (see below).

a, Schematic of the experimental set-up and our devices. The hBN top, bottom and spacer layers are shown in light blue and the graphite ground electrode is shown in black. The water is filled from a back-side inlet (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Oscillating voltage (f from 0.1 kHz to 1.1 GHz) is applied to the AFM tip and the measured local impedance is converted into dielectric spectra such as that shown schematically in the inset. Relatively thick bottom hBN (H ≈ 50–200 nm) is used to create in-plane field E// inside water channels. b, AFM micrograph of a device with h ≈ 30 nm, with the inset showing a trace over the exposed spacers. c,d, Dielectric images at characteristic f of 2 kHz, 2 MHz and 1.1 GHz for the same three channels before and after filling them with water, respectively. The images were taken at 295 ± 1 K from the area outlined in b by the dashed rectangle. The top panels in c and d sketch the cross-section of the channels (not to scale). The slight sagging of the top hBN into empty channels disappears after filling them with water. The sagging was monitored by AFM to ensure that the channels were fully filled22. e, Dielectric profiles (averaged over ten lines) from c and d, colour-coded. |dC/dz| is defined in Methods. Scale bars: 1 μm (b); 500 nm (c,d).

Source data

Representative SDM images from our relatively large (reference) channels with h ≈ 30 nm (Fig. 1b) are shown in Fig. 1c,d before and after filling them with deionized water, respectively (see also Extended Data Fig. 2). The dielectric contrast between empty channels (ε = 1) and hBN spacers is negative as expected, reflecting the relatively larger dielectric constant of hBN. After the channels were filled, the contrast changed and became strongly positive, confirming the presence of water inside the channels and its strong dielectric response. With increasing measurement frequency, f, the contrast for empty channels did not change, again as expected (Fig. 1c). For water-filled channels, it remained positive with increasing f from kHz to MHz and GHz but weakened (Fig. 1d). For each f, we then plotted the average contrast of water with respect to hBN (Fig. 1e) and, by repeating the imaging at many different f (see detailed measurement and calibration procedures in Methods; Extended Data Fig. 3), we obtained dielectric dispersion curves such as those shown in Fig. 2a (see the blue symbols for h ≈ 30 nm).

Although the experimental curve resembles the Debye dispersion, the orientational relaxation of water dipoles responsible for the Debye behaviour of bulk water plays little role at f < 10 GHz and the dispersion found at our relatively low f is caused by conductive losses (Methods). Indeed, at high f, the dielectric response is determined by the ε// of water and is independent of σ//, which yields the high-f plateau with its strength increasing with increasing ε// and h. The σ// of water starts contributing at frequencies below the conductivity relaxation frequency fr = σ///2πε0ε//, leading to a stronger dielectric contrast. The conductivity contribution is cut off at fc = ασ///2πε0 by capacitive coupling between the water and the bottom graphite as well as the AFM tip, which results in the low-f plateau. The cut-off frequency fc is independent of ε// and increases proportionally to σ// through the geometric factor α that depends on h and the measurement geometry. The inset of Fig. 1a summarizes the tendencies expected for the dielectric response with changing h, ε// and σ//. Further details about SDM measurements are provided in Methods (Extended Data Figs. 4–10).

As well as the reference spectrum from the 30-nm channels, Fig. 2a shows the spectra obtained for ultrathin water in channels with other representative heights h ≈ 5 and 1.5 nm (cyan and red, respectively) and Fig. 2b provides examples of their SDM imaging (see also Extended Data Fig. 4). We can see two clear trends in how the dielectric response of water evolves with decreasing h. First, the transition between low-f and high-f plateaus shifts to higher frequencies, from kHz to MHz. This is also apparent from the images in Fig. 2b, in which changes in the contrast occur at higher f for the thinner channel. The behaviour unambiguously shows that water becomes more conductive under strong confinement. This is expected because water is known to interact with hBN walls, which results in near-surface dissociation of water molecules and higher proton conductivity17,31. The strongly enhanced σ is also consistent with previous results for water inside hBN nanochannels and nanoporous media32,33. Second, the high-f dielectric response does not gradually diminish with decreasing h as expected if ε of nanoconfined water were to remain the same as that of bulk water (compare with the inset of Fig. 1a). Instead, the high-f plateaus for h ≈ 1.5 and 5 nm in Fig. 2 remain of similar height. This observation qualitatively implies that the ε of water notably increases under strong confinement. This conclusion follows from the observed strength of the high-f signal and does not rely on any modelling. The positive contrast at high f for h ≈ 1.5 nm is particularly notable if compared with the behaviour found by SDM without a parallel component of E. In this case22, the dielectric contrast reversed from positive to negative at h ≈ 3 nm because of diminishing ε⊥. This does not happen for the in-plane measurement geometry even for our smallest h ≈ 1 nm and again implies large ε// for water inside atomic-scale channels.

The measured spectra are essentially determined by the two characteristic frequencies fr and fc that in turn reflect ε// and σ// of nanoconfined water, respectively. Accordingly, changes in the frequencies with varying h can be translated into relative changes of the corresponding electrical characteristics. With reference to the inset of Fig. 1a, the experimental spectra in Fig. 2a allow us to conclude immediately that both ε// and σ// increase with decreasing water thickness. However, to find the scale of these changes and the absolute values of ε// and σ// requires knowledge of the factor α that depends on h and other geometric parameters. To this end, we used full-3D numerical simulations and calculated the detailed electric-field distribution across our nanochannels. From this analysis, we obtained anticipated dielectric dispersions for different h (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6). Then we determined σ// and ε// by fitting fc and the amplitude of the high-f plateau (all other parameters were found experimentally; Extended Data Fig. 10). These simulations also took into account that the dielectric response of nanoconfined water is anisotropic, using the ε⊥(h) dependence reported previously22. Examples of this analysis are presented in Fig. 2a by the solid curves. For comparison, the dashed curves in the same figure represent the behaviour expected if the confined water retained the electrical properties of bulk water. We also analysed the experimental spectra using two analytical approximations in which: (1) the AFM tip was simulated as a point charge and the nanochannel as a laterally infinite multilayer stack (Extended Data Fig. 8) and (2) the measurement geometry was simulated using an equivalent electrical circuit (Extended Data Fig. 9). This provided an approximation for α as a function of the main parameters, α ≅ (hw/l*)(1/(2πR) + H/(εhBNwl*)), in which R is the AFM tip radius and l* is the effective channel length (Methods). Although less accurate, these two models were found to yield close values for both ε// and σ//. Furthermore, we verified that the extracted values depended little on ε⊥ (because ε// is much larger; see Methods and Extended Data Figs. 6f and 7b,c,e) and were independent of σ⊥ (the measurement geometry used is insensitive to the latter; see Extended Data Fig. 6e). The use of several approaches have shown that our results are robust with respect to modelling and, also, corroborated our qualitative conclusions drawn from the spectral shifts, as discussed above.

We have studied many nanochannel devices with h ranging from about 1 to 60 nm and, using f from several hundred Hz to GHz, obtained their dielectric spectra similar to those shown in Fig. 2a. Then applying the full numerical analysis for each device, the ε// and σ// of water were extracted as a function of h. The results are summarized in Fig. 3.

Inside our channels with h > 4 nm, water was found to exhibit ε// ≈ 74 ± 17, that is, little difference with respect to bulk water (Fig. 3a). The dielectric constant suddenly changed for quasi-2D water (h ≈ 1–2 nm), which showed a sharp increase in ε// by an order of magnitude, reaching 1,030 ± 350. Such large dielectric constants are typical of ferroelectrics. This behaviour is in strong contrast to that of ε⊥ for the same range of thicknesses22. The latter constant exhibits a decrease by a factor of about 40, such that quasi-2D water becomes essentially non-polarizable in the perpendicular direction22. Although the large ε// for water under atomic-scale confinement may seem surprising, the result agrees (at least qualitatively) with most simulations that have predicted enhanced ε// and strong dielectric anisotropy for water in the vicinity of solid interfaces23,24,27,28,29,30. The phenomenon can be understood by noting that, whereas the interaction with solid surfaces hinders the ability of water dipoles to align along E applied in the perpendicular direction, the dipoles are relatively free to rotate and align in the in-plane direction.

For large channels, it is reasonable to consider confined water as consisting of an inner layer of bulk water molecules unaffected by the confinement and two near-surface layers with a different interfacial dielectric constant ε//int, as sketched in the inset of Fig. 3a. This simple model (three capacitors in series) has previously proved successful in describing the observed ε⊥(h) dependence qualitatively well and suggested the presence of an ‘electrically dead' near-surface layer22. Its thickness hint was estimated as roughly 7 Å, in agreement with the thickness of layered water at solid interfaces34. However, if the same model is applied to explain the in-plane response (three capacitors in parallel, yielding the effective ε//(h) = εbulk + 2(ε//int − εbulk)hint/h), the observed ε//(h) dependence cannot be described even qualitatively (light red dashed curve in Fig. 3a). The sharp increase at h ≈ 2–3 nm clearly indicates a transition in the dielectric properties of water if the two confining surfaces become sufficiently close such that the near-surface layers merge and water develops a more distinctly layered structure4,35. The large increase in ε// in this case is consistent with theory28,29, although the transition was predicted for h ⪝ 1 nm. Let us also mention the slight tendency seen in Fig. 3a at h > 4 nm for ε//(h) to increase with decreasing h. This increase would be consistent with many predictions27,28,29,30 and, within the three-layer model and our experimental accuracy, suggests values of ε//int up to approximately 150 for interfacial water. Measurements at higher accuracy are required to corroborate the latter observation.

The extracted conductivities for nanoconfined water are plotted in Fig. 3b. We can see that, for moderate confinement, σ//(h) evolves approximately as 1/h, increasing from 10−3–10−4 S m−1 for our largest channels up to about 0.1 S m−1 at h ≈ 3 nm. This gradual increase is well described by the discussed three-layer model (inset of Fig. 3a) assuming unaffected conductivity for the inner layer and the presence of two near-surface layers with interfacial conductivity σ//int, which yields σ//(h) = σbulk + 2(σ//int − σbulk)hint/h. Using the same hint for interfacial water as for the dielectric constant, we estimate σ//int to be approximately 0.1 S m−1, three orders of magnitude higher than σbulk (σbulk was measured independently using our bulk water with pH ≈ 5.7 caused by CO2 absorption). Such an enhancement in the conductivity of confined water agrees well with previous reports for water inside nanochannels and is attributed to the surface charge15,16,19,32,33.

For quasi-2D water, in which the water becomes layered across its entire thickness (h ⪝ 2 nm), we observe a pronounced extra peak in conductivity. The behaviour clearly diverges from the surface charge (three-layer) model but correlates well with the anomalous increase in ε// (compare with Fig. 3a,b). At its peak, σ// reaches about 3 S m−1, which occurs at h ≈ 1.5 nm and corresponds to 4–5 molecular layers35. This value is one of the highest conductivities reported at RT, comparable with that of Nafion and approaching the superionic levels reached for molten salts (about 10 S m−1)36. Note that our smallest channels (h ≈ 1.0 nm) exhibited a marked (more than ten times) decrease in σ// with respect to the peak value. To corroborate the presence of the peak for quasi-2D water, Fig. 3b incorporates a data point available in the literature (grey symbol), which was obtained for water inside 0.7-nm hBN channels using DC measurements32. This also shows consistency between different types of experiment.

Our experiment shows that water under confinement exhibits two distinct regimes. Under moderate confinement (h down to about 2–3 nm), water can be described as effectively containing inner bulk water and interfacial water. The latter is characterized by enhanced conductivity (by at least three orders of magnitude for the case of hBN surfaces) and a highly anisotropic dielectric constant with ε⊥ ≈ 2 and ε// comparable with εbulk or slightly larger. For the extreme, atomic-scale confinement that allows only several molecular layers inside, the quasi-2D water clearly switches to another state. It is different from either bulk or interfacial water and exhibits ferroelectric-like polarizability and superionic-like conductivity (presumably provided by proton transport).

The electrical behaviour observed under moderate confinement (≥ 3 nm) generally agrees with the previous reports and theoretical expectations15,19,27,28,29,30. As for the atomic-scale confinement, both measurements4 and molecular dynamics simulations35 have previously shown that water has a distinctive layered structure exhibiting more profound density oscillations than those found for near-surface water. The observed anomalies in the electrical properties of few-layer water align with predictions of giant, ferroelectric-like values of ε// (refs. 28,29) and superionic conductivity for monolayer water at high temperatures37. Experiments on water flow and ionic transport also reported the emergence of strong anomalies in the same few-layer regime32,38.

In the absence of a theory, we note that atomic-scale confinement induces strong hydrogen-bond disorder because of constraints on the possible orientations of water molecules and also a loss in hydrogen bonding imposed by the confining surfaces. Qualitatively, this suggests changes in the electrical properties analogous to those found for disordered hydrogen-bonded crystals39 and in particular in disordered ice. The latter is known to exhibit higher ε than liquid water (and ordered ice) owing to easier reorientation of water molecules14. Similarly, we speculate that the disruption of the hydrogen-bond network in quasi-2D water enables correlated reorientations of molecular dipoles, allowing their collective polarization40 and consequently higher, ferroelectric-like ε// (refs. 12,28). Because the reorientation of water dipoles is essential in the Grotthuss mechanism, such changes in quasi-2D water should also facilitate faster proton transport, resulting in higher σ//, as well as the increased near-surface proton concentration caused by surface charges.

As water becomes structured near all solid interfaces, we expect the qualitative behaviour observed here to be general across various systems and not limited to hBN channels. However, because the molecular arrangements and dipole orientation of water are highly sensitive to surface charge density and polarity, quantitative values of ε// and σ// probably depend on surface chemistry. For example, recent predictions27 suggest that the ε// of water can range from bulk-like to giant values near surfaces depending on their polarity. We also note our experimental uncertainty of approximately 30%, arising from the technical challenges inherent to these measurements. This limitation, however, does not affect our central finding: both the in-plane dielectric constant and the conductivity of interfacial water are large and become enhanced under strong confinement, in strong contrast to the suppression observed in the perpendicular direction22.

We have measured the in-plane electrical properties of 2D nanoconfined water and found that they substantially change as the layered structure of water becomes more pronounced under extreme, molecular-scale confinement. Our results provide unique experimental insights into previously inaccessible properties of interfacial and strongly confined water and are fundamental to interpreting numerous physical and biochemical processes occurring at the molecular scale. In particular, they advance our understanding of the electric double layer under strong confinement, which is essential for developing energy storage and generation technologies. The reported approach to measure conductivities and dielectric constants can be refined further and also applied to substances other than water, while having the notable advantage that it examines local properties without averaging over a distribution of different confinement strengths, as inevitable in macroscale measurements.

We fabricated our devices using procedures similar to those described in ref. 22. A free-standing silicon nitride (SiN) membrane was used as a substrate for our van der Waals assembly that involved four atomically flat crystals (Extended Data Fig. 1). We started with etching a rectangular aperture of approximately 3 × 20 μm2 in the SiN membrane. This aperture was required to later serve as a water inlet from a reservoir placed at the back of the wafer. Using the dry transfer method, we transferred a graphite crystal (thickness approximately 10 nm) to seal the aperture. The graphite later served as the bottom electrode. It was etched through from the back side using reactive ion etching, which projected the aperture into graphite. Then a relatively thick hBN crystal (H ≈ 50–200 nm, to serve as the bottom layer) was transferred on top of the graphite and again dry-etched through from the back. Next we selected a second hBN crystal (thickness h ≈ 1–60 nm), referred to as spacer, and patterned it into parallel stripes (spaced by about 200 nm) using electron-beam lithography and reactive ion etching. We transferred the spacer layer on top of the bottom hBN using wet transfer procedures and aligning the stripes perpendicular to the rectangular aperture. Finally, the third hBN crystal was transferred on top of the spacer layer using the dry transfer method. This sealed the nanochannels as well as the aperture. The thickness of the top hBN (Htop ≈ 20–80 nm) was carefully chosen to bring the AFM tip as close as possible to the water but also to ensure that the top layer exhibits some sagging into empty channels without blocking them completely22 (Extended Data Fig. 2a,d). After each transfer, we annealed the assembly in Ar/H2 at 300 °C for 3 h and then at 400 °C for 5 h to remove polymer residues and other contamination. As the final step, we made an electrical contact with the graphite using photolithography or, alternatively, using silver paint to minimize the number of cleanroom processes. Because the top layer became flattened (no longer sagged)22 after liquid water filled the channels (see Extended Data Fig. 2d–g), this allowed us to ensure that, irrespective of the dielectric response of water, the investigated nanochannels were fully filled with water (by comparing AFM topography images before and after filling; Extended Data Fig. 2e,f). Note that, given the large in-plane conductivity of water found in this work for all thicknesses of channel, we could also verify the water filling by taking atomic force microscopy (AFM) images in the intermittent-contact attractive mode using low-f applied voltages (several kHz down to DC). In this case, the acquired contrast over the channels reversed from negative to positive on filling the water (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c) owing to the onset of strong electrostatic forces associated with the conductivity of water, as the AFM feedback adjusted the z-scanner to compensate for these forces during the scan. We emphasize that the contrast appearing in Extended Data Fig. 2c (showing roughness of several nanometres) reflects differences in the electrical properties of water and hBN (hence the red/blue colour scale) and not the actual topography, which is shown separately in grey in Extended Data Fig. 2a. When water filled the channels, the sagging disappeared and the surface became atomically flat with residual roughness of less than 3 Å independently of the channel thickness, as described previously22. This flattening is demonstrated here using true topography images in Extended Data Fig. 2e,f and their profiles (Extended Data Fig. 2g).

As another improvement with respect to our previous studies, before filling with water, we normally exposed the bottom side of the devices to low-power Ar/O2 plasma (8 W, 16 sccm Ar and 8 sccm O2 flow) for 1 s. This made SiN more hydrophilic and also cleared the entrances of channels from possible contamination. This procedure has proved beneficial for getting water inside. We also found that our devices tended to delaminate if contamination remained trapped between van der Waals layers. To prevent this from happening, great care was taken to check for cleanliness of the devices at each fabrication step (using optical and AFM imaging). For example, if dark-field optical images showed bubbles trapped between layers, such devices were discarded. Representative optical images of the studied devices with clean interfaces are provided in Extended Data Fig. 1a–c.

All SDM10,41 measurements were carried out using a commercial atomic force microscope (Nanotec Electronica with WSxM software42) operated at RT in dry atmosphere. SDM was implemented in the amplitude-modulated electrostatic-force detection mode43,44, adapting the approach described in ref. 10. Briefly, we applied an AC voltage between the AFM tip and the bottom electrode. By detecting mechanical oscillations of the cantilever, we measured the electrostatic force and, therefore, the first derivative of the tip–sample capacitance, dC/dz. Its value depends on both dielectric and conductive properties of investigated samples. SDM has previously been used for local measurements of both surface and sub-surface dielectric properties of various materials in different frequency regimes, from quasi-static to GHz (refs. 45,46,47,48). The same approach has also been widely used to study near-surface electron transport in solid samples49,50,51,52, showing the sensitivity of the technique to local conductivity. The force-sensing approach was preferable in our case to the other current-sensing and microwave-sensing AFM techniques that can also examine local impedance53,54 because the latter are generally less sensitive and more complex to implement.

To carry out dielectric spectroscopy over the required very wide bandwidth (100 Hz to 1 GHz), we combined two previously reported force-sensing detection methods. Both were implemented here using conductive diamond-coated AFM probes (CDT-CONTR or CDT-FMR from Nanosensors) with spring constant k of several Nm−1 and resonance frequency in the range 20–60 kHz. At low f up to the cantilever resonance frequency, we used the 2ω-detection approach, as described in ref. 22 for measurements of the ε⊥ of water, in which ω = 2πf is the angular frequency. Briefly, we applied an AC voltage with amplitude vAC = 4 V and measured the amplitude D2ω(z) of the resulting mechanical oscillations of the cantilever at double the applied frequency, using an external lock-in amplifier (Zurich Instruments HF2LI). The AFM tip–sample capacitance gradient was calculated as |dC/dz| = D2ω(z)4k/vAC2. Despite the relatively large AC excitation, the response remained within the linear regime, as verified by systematic amplitude-dependence measurements on reference samples and validated using relatively thick channels that exhibited the expected bulk water properties. For f higher than the cantilever resonance frequency, we used the heterodyne detection technique demonstrated in ref. 55. To this end, we applied a high-f (carrier) signal modulated by low frequency (fmod = 1 kHz, amplitude vAC = 0.5 V) using an external RF/GHz signal generator (Rohde & Schwarz SMA100B). We detected the cantilever mechanical oscillations at fmod using our external lock-in amplifier and, from those measurements, obtained the capacitance gradient at the carrier f as |dC/dz| = Dmod(z)8k/(gvAC2), in which g is the f-dependent gain of the external circuit and Dmod(z) is the amplitude of the cantilever mechanical oscillations at fmod. This approach allowed retrieval of |dC/dz| variations at f higher than the cantilever resonance frequency and up to GHz frequencies51. Note that such measurements yield only the amplitude of dC/dz and not its phase, so the obtained spectra reflect the modulus of the complex dielectric constant (see the ‘Analysis of local dielectric spectra' section).

To minimize systematic errors, we carefully calibrated the electrical gain g for each device and atomic force microscopy tip at each measurement frequency. This is essential at high frequencies (> 1 MHz), at which both applied and measured signals show strong f-dependent variations because the cable impedance is not matched to the local sample impedance and the long-range impedance between the AFM tip and the sample. We used a calibration procedure similar to that in ref. 47, which relies on acquiring |dC/dz| curves as a function of the tip–surface distance z over a device region with f-independent impedance. We determined g by comparing |dC/dz|(z) curves at each frequency against a low-f reference curve (2 kHz), for which no gain or loss is expected. To avoid potential changes in g in different regions of the device, these curves were taken over the hBN spacer near the water-filled channel (Extended Data Fig. 3a). We then scaled them to match the 2-kHz curve using g and the offset as the two fitting parameters (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Note that, irrespective of f, the offset is always present in dC/dz curves and is typically subtracted before analysis, because it is independent of local electrical properties (see, for example, refs. 10,56). We found that, at high f (10 MHz to 1 GHz), the offsets changed substantially but were identical above water channels and hBN spacers. This confirmed that, for all of the frequencies, the offsets originated from long-range impedance contributions. Notably, although g is critical for accurately evaluating the electrical properties of water from the measured signals, offsets play little role in this study because we analysed the relative changes in |dC/dz| along the device surface–water channels versus hBN spacers (see the ‘Dielectric images and dielectric spectra acquisition' and ‘Numerical modelling and data analysis' sections). We validated the calibration using reference samples (hBN on doped Si), obtaining the expected f-independent dielectric spectra up to GHz frequencies (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f). Furthermore, large channels filled with water effectively served as another reference, yielding the expected spectral behaviour (flat response at high f) and the dielectric constant of bulk water. To prevent electrostatic crosstalk in calibration curves taken above hBN spacers from water inside the channels, we used channels separated by about 800 nm, a spacing chosen to be sufficiently large. Numerical simulations confirmed that, within our experimental accuracy (roughly 1 zF nm−1), the calibration curves were unaffected by electrostatics from water in the channels (Extended Data Figs. 5b and 7f). We emphasize that, if the separation were too small, such crosstalk could lead to underestimation of the dielectric constant of water.

The dielectric images in Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 4 were taken at constant height zscan (typically about 15–25 nm) from the top layer, as in ref. 22, using the constant-height dual-pass mode SDM developed earlier10,41. In this mode, the first pass records the topography without applied voltage and the second pass acquires the dielectric image with the AFM feedback loop disabled and the z-scanner fixed (the scanner was carefully aligned parallel to the sample plane so that zscan remained constant along the horizontal direction). To avoid piezo creep effects, we allowed sufficient settling time at the beginning of each line for the scanner to reach the target height. This approach ensures maximum control of zscan, as this is measured with sub-nanometre accuracy by acquiring DC and AC deflection approach curves at scan line edges (here over the hBN spacer regions)10. The DC deflection curve allows measuring the tip–surface distance z with sub-nanometre accuracy, whereas the AC deflection curve provides |dC/dz| as a function of z, allowing further validation of zscan and correction of z-scanner drifts by matching with the |dC/dz| scan line (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). Because the second-pass scan maintains the z-scanner fixed, potential artefacts from the z-scanner motion that would arise in the standard dual-pass ‘lift' mode are avoided. Small variations in zscan owing to the DC electrostatic force are also measured and taken into account by recording the DC deflection during the second pass. The images as a function of f reported in Fig. 2b were taken at both constant zscan and constant y position (y-axis is along the nanochannels length). We typically recorded 25 lines at each f. Standard AFM image processing consisting of flattening and Gaussian filtering was applied.

The dielectric spectra in Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 10 were obtained for constant zscan (about 15–20 nm) and constant y but after acquiring the entire 3D dataset |dC/dz|(x,z,f), such as that shown in Extended Data Fig. 3d. This set is composed of many |dC/dz|(x,z) images (Extended Data Fig. 3a), which were obtained at different f by scanning the AFM tip across the channels (along the x-axis) at constant y and approaching the surface in steps. This refined procedure was necessary here to minimize errors in zscan owing to z-scanner drifts during long measurements across the whole frequency sweep. Although the spectral behaviour does not change with scan height, the amplitude of |dC/dz| does (Extended Data Fig. 6g,h), making it essential to maintain the same zscan at each f for high accuracy in our spectral analysis. When taking |dC/dz|(x,z) images, the AFM tip was approached from larger distances towards the surface down to the minimum distance of typically about 15 nm, beyond which tip collapse occurred owing to long-range attractive electrostatic forces, as expected under our measurement conditions (applied voltage, RT, soft cantilevers and large AFM tip radii). At each step, we acquired dozens of lines, which were then averaged to obtain the corresponding profile (Extended Data Fig. 3b). This notably improved the signal-to-noise ratio. By taking small steps towards the surface, we could then reconstruct the dielectric spectra (Extended Data Fig. 10) by using the value measured in the middle of nanochannels at the same zscan (±1 nm) for each f. This 1-nm uncertainty has negligible impact on the extracted electrical properties shown in Fig. 3, as demonstrated in Extended Data Fig. 7g,h (see also the ‘Numerical modelling and data analysis' section). We note that all of the spectra were obtained at the nearest possible distances achievable before tip collapse to ensure maximum signal strength and measurement stability. Larger zscan were avoided, as the |dC/dz| signal decays rapidly with z, compromising measurement accuracy, particularly for small channels (Extended Data Fig. 6g,h).

As well as the scanning height zscan, the spectral values depended on geometry/size of our devices and the AFM tip parameters (Extended Data Fig. 10). All of the necessary geometric parameters of the studied devices were measured by taking their topography images, whereas the AFM tip parameters (its radius R and half-angle θ) were determined by fitting |dC/dz|(z) curves taken directly above the graphite bottom layer, as in ref. 22, following the procedures described in refs. 56,57. For example, the tip radii were found to be in the range 50–200 nm, in good agreement with the values specified for commercial diamond-coated tips. This enabled quantitative analysis of the ‘absolute-value' spectra (shown in Extended Data Fig. 10) as opposed to just relative variations with f, through full-3D numerical simulations that account for the detailed geometry of the system (see the ‘Numerical modelling and data analysis' section). We emphasize that the values of |dC/dz| in the spectra that we analysed to extract the electrical parameters of water are the peak values over the centre of the water channel relative to the values measured over the centre of the hBN spacers at the same scan height, as in ref. 22. This differential approach makes our analysis robust against uncertainties in geometric parameters and eliminates the influence of the long-range geometry of the system, as described below.

To facilitate direct comparison of the electrical response of water across different devices and experiments and enhance clarity of presentation, we normalized our representative spectra for various water thicknesses in Fig. 2a. This normalization used the low-f plateau as a reference point, dividing each spectrum by this value. In this low-f regime, the measured signal becomes effectively independent of both the electrical properties of water and its thickness (see Extended Data Figs. 6b and 8b and the ‘Analysis of local dielectric spectra' section). As the signal in this regime is primarily determined by the AFM tip radius and its distance from the channel, normalizing with respect to the low-f value effectively eliminates the geometric contributions, allowing for more direct comparison between different experiments. We emphasize that alternative normalization using high-f values would not be beneficial, as the signal in this regime strongly depends on both the channel thickness and its dielectric properties.

The observed dielectric spectra were fitted to full-3D finite-element numerical calculations implemented using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.4a (AC/DC electrostatic module), not other simplified models presented in the manuscript. These 3D calculations were based on the electrostatic model previously used in ref. 22, adapted here to simulate the frequency-dependent force acting on the tip as a function of ε and σ of water when an AC electric field was applied. They compute absolute |dC/dz| values while fully accounting for the actual geometry and dimensions of the system, including the tip and device, as well as the conductive and dielectric properties of water and their anisotropy, thereby eliminating potential geometric and electrostatic artefacts that could arise in the data analysis using simplified models.

A schematic of the model is shown in Extended Data Fig. 5a. Following ref. 22, the AFM tip was modelled as a truncated cone with the half-angle θ terminated with a tangent hemispherical apex of radius R. The values of θ and R used in our simulations were measured for each AFM tip, as discussed above. The AFM cone height Hcone was limited to 6 μm and the cantilever was omitted to reduce the computational time (unless stated otherwise). We checked that these approximations had no impact on the simulated results. The simulated nanochannel consisted of two insulating slabs of hBN separated by a lossy water slab of height h and width w (measured from topography for each device). We modelled each slab explicitly with its own respective dielectric constant and conductivity according to the general definition of anisotropic, complex dielectric constant

in which ω is the angular frequency, ε0 is the dielectric permittivity of vacuum, ε⊥ and ε// are the dielectric constants perpendicular and parallel to the channel, respectively, and σ⊥ and σ// are the corresponding conductivities, respectively. Note that, for the water slab, the imaginary term in equation (1), represented by σ⊥,//, accounts for all possible losses, including those from charge transport and dipolar relaxation, whereas ε⊥,// may contain ionic contributions owing to ion–water and ion–ion correlations, as well as the purely dielectric response of water58,59. Both ε⊥,// and σ⊥,// of water were treated here as frequency-independent, as this approximation adequately reproduces the observed dispersion, as explained below and also in the ‘Analysis of local dielectric spectra' section. For hBN, σ⊥,// is zero, so its \({\varepsilon }_{\perp ,//}^{* }\) reduces to its known real part, ε⊥hBN = 3.5 and ε//hBN = 5.5, which are constant within our experimental bandwidth. To model possible contributions from nearby nanochannels, the device was modelled as three parallel water nanochannels of length l = 3 μm and measured spacing ws within the surrounding hBN dielectric matrix, with dimensions matching the measured top, bottom and spacer hBN layers (length l = 3 μm, width W = 3 μm and height Htop + h + H).

We numerically solved the Poisson's equation in the frequency domain for each device, calculated the force acting on the AFM probe and, from that, obtained |dC/dz| by integrating the built-in Maxwell stress tensor on the surface of the probe. The simulations used the same box size and boundary conditions as in ref. 22. Examples of calculated dielectric spectra for representative geometrical parameters of our devices and ε and σ of water are shown in Extended Data Fig. 6. These simulations closely match the experimental spectra, reproducing the observed Debye-type frequency dispersion.

Our modelling approach is equivalent to the original analysis by Maxwell and Wagner60,61, which led to the Debye-like Maxwell–Wagner (MW) formalism commonly used to interpret dielectric relaxations arising from DC conductivity in macroscale spectra of heterogeneous lossy dielectrics62,63,64 (see the ‘Alternative phenomenological Debye-like MW analysis' section). Using the complex dielectric constants defined in equation (1), Maxwell and Wagner showed that the effective capacitance of a planar layered system, in which each layer has constant ε and σ, acquired a frequency dependence similar to a Debye-type relaxation62,63. In our case, the AFM tip replaces the top electrode in their derivation, precluding an exact analytical solution and necessitating 3D numerical simulations. Nevertheless, the underlying electrostatic problem is the same, therefore no further frequency dependence of ε and σ in equation (1) for the water slab is required to reproduce the observed dispersion, unless an extra relaxation process is present. In our case, no such further relaxation needs to be assumed or is expected to occur, based on present understanding of strongly confined water. Consistent with this, the experimental spectra exhibited only a single Debye-like relaxation at lower frequencies arising from DC conductivity (for more details, see the ‘Analysis of local dielectric spectra' section).

Experimental |dC/dz| spectra were fitted with the ε// and σ// of water as the only fitting parameters. All of the other parameters needed for the simulations were determined experimentally, as detailed above. ε⊥ was set to the values measured in ref. 22 and σ⊥ was set to the measured value for our bulk water (σbulk = 2 × 10−4 S m−1). The extracted ε// and σ// values were found to depend little on exact values of ε⊥ or σ⊥, indicating that our experimental geometry was rather insensitive to the out-of-plane characteristics of water, and the influence was negligible for our smallest channels (Extended Data Figs. 6e,f and 8e,f). This is because the impedance of the nanochannel in the out-of-plane direction is much smaller than the series impedance from the hBN layers and AFM tip–surface capacitances, whereas the impedance of the nanochannel in the in-plane direction is much larger (see the ‘Electrical modelling' section). From these fitted values of ε// and σ//, we inferred the interfacial dielectric constant, ε//int, and conductivity, σ//int, of the confined water layer using the three-capacitor model, as explained in the main text, without introducing ε//int and σ//int directly into the electrostatic problem. This approach minimized the complexity of our numerical calculations.

For brevity, in all of the figures, |dC/dz| refers to the relative dielectric contrast (unless stated otherwise), that is, the response relative to the hBN spacer so that |dC/dz| ≡ dC(zscan,ε⊥,//,σ⊥,//)/dz − dC(zscan,ε⊥,//hBN,0)/dz. Accordingly, we computed the absolute value of |dC/dz| over the centre of the water channel as a function of f and subtracted the corresponding values for the case of the tip placed over the centre of the hBN spacer, matching the experimental data processing. This differential approach avoids systematic errors. As mentioned above, it reduces the impact of uncertainties in geometric parameters and allows us to model only the local geometry, as the long-range geometric contributions do not affect |dC/dz| variations relative to the spacer. Furthermore, each device was modelled using its actual dimensions (spacer and channel width and height, top and bottom hBN heights) and with the measured radius of the AFM tip used in that experiment. This ensured that the 3D calculations reproduced the realistic electric-field distribution between the tip and the confined water, yielding reliable electrical properties of water with minimal approximations.

The thickness H of the hBN bottom layer determines whether the measurements are mostly sensitive to ε// or ε⊥. Extended Data Fig. 7 illustrates this for the case of channel thickness h = 5 nm at high f, beyond the conductivity relaxation regime (see the ‘Analysis of local dielectric spectra' section) and for a large AFM tip radius (100 nm), as used in our experiments. When the channel is in the immediate proximity to a metallic surface (Extended Data Fig. 7a), as in ref. 22, the |dC/dz| signal is independent of ε// and, consequently, the extracted ε represents the out-of-plane component, ε⊥. Furthermore, measurements are sensitive only to relatively small values of ε⊥ (up to about 20 for h = 5 nm), as the signal saturates with further increases in ε⊥ (for larger channel thicknesses, the sensitivity extends to increasingly larger values of ε⊥, as shown in ref. 22). Conversely, when the channel is on a thick hBN layer (H = 200 nm; Extended Data Fig. 7b), the |dC/dz| signal greatly increases for ε// > 20, becoming dominated by the in-plane component. Therefore, for relatively large values of ε// ranging from about 80 to about 1,000, as measured in this work, the signal at such H shows little dependence on ε⊥. Extended Data Fig. 7c shows how the signal evolves as a function of H. In these simulations, we increased the cone height and cantilever length of the AFM tip to their nominal values (Hcone = 12 μm and Lcantilever = 20 μm). This allowed us to include electrostatic contributions from longer-range components of the atomic force microscopy probe65, which we found to be relatively small but still non-negligible for very thick bottom hBN (H > 500 nm). The results show that the |dC/dz| signal and its sensitivity to ε// peaks between 50 and 500 nm (Extended Data Fig. 7c). For thinner hBN layers, the ε// contribution is relatively small or negligible and the signal is dominated by ε⊥. For hBN thicker than 500 nm, the |dC/dz| signal decreases, becoming less sensitive to the investigated local electrical properties, consistent with previous results56. This is expected because the AFM tip is moved far away from the bottom electrode. In this work, we used bottom hBN layers of thickness up to 200 nm. This limitation was dictated by constraints in the fabrication of our devices, because thicker hBN crystals were stiffer and provided poor adhesion, leading to delamination on filling the channels with water.

We emphasize that, because the amplitude of the dielectric spectra depends on the scan height, data analysis may also be affected by this parameter. Specifically, although the value of σ// is independent of zscan (as the cut-off frequency remains unchanged with scan height; Extended Data Fig. 6g,h), the extracted ε// may be influenced, as it is given by the amplitude of the high-f plateau. As described above, in this study, we used special procedures to control zscan and determine its value with maximum possible accuracy, estimated at ±1 nm. Despite the steep increase of |dC/dz| with decreasing z, such 1-nm experimental uncertainty has negligible impact on the extracted ε//, even for our smallest channels. This is because our analysis relies on the measurement of variations of |dC/dz| relative to the hBN spacer region at the same zscan. This differential approach makes the analysis robust against small uncertainties in zscan. To illustrate this robustness, Extended Data Fig. 7h shows 3D simulated curves for the best-fit zscan value (corresponding to the data in Extended Data Fig. 10c) and for best-fit zscan ± 1 nm. The three curves nearly overlap, with experimental data points scattered around them, consistent with the stated ±1 nm experimental uncertainty. The obtained 30% error in the extracted ε// = 900 incorporates this uncertainty, along with the standard deviation for data points on the high-f plateau. Notably, qualitative experimental evidence allows us to discard large uncertainties in zscan as an alternative explanation for the enhanced ε// observed in our smallest water channels. Indeed, to justify the large values of |dC/dz| observed at high f with bulk-like ε// would imply extremely small scan heights (⪝5 nm). This is shown in Extended Data Fig. 7g, in which we plot the sensitivity curve of |dC/dz| to ε// at various values of zscan for 1.5-nm channels. However, such small values of zscan are physically impossible in our constant-height scan mode, as below about 15 nm, the tip collapses onto the surface (see the ‘Dielectric images and dielectric spectra acquisition' section). Also, the implied small values of zscan would lead to much larger |dC/dz| values than observed for the low-f spectral plateau, which is highly sensitive to the scan height (see the ‘Analysis of local dielectric spectra' section). In other words, although the high-f plateau could theoretically be reproduced by assuming a much smaller scan height (roughly 5 nm for the case of the representative device with h ≈ 1.5 nm in Extended Data Fig. 10c), such a simulation would fail to reproduce the low-f plateau, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 7h. These observations rule out substantial errors in zscan and the large ε// reported here for our smallest devices can be explained by inaccuracies in the scan height.

We stress that the electric field above the hBN spacer varies little with the electrical properties of confined water (Extended Data Fig. 5c–h) and that our differential analysis relative to the hBN spacer region does not introduce systematic errors associated to such electric-field variations. This is demonstrated in Extended Data Fig. 5b, which shows full-3D numerical simulations of the absolute value of |dC/dz| versus tip-surface distance z calculated with the tip above the centre of the hBN spacer at different f, comparing water-filled and empty channels, for our smallest channels (h = 1.5 nm). All curves practically overlap, with deviations at intermediate and high f not exceeding 0.1 zF nm−1, an order of magnitude smaller than our experimental uncertainty (about 1 zF nm−1). Only at the lowest f do the deviations increase notably because of the in-plane conductivity of water but still remain within experimental uncertainty. Furthermore, despite their minimal impact, these small variations are fully accounted for in our analysis, which incorporates the realistic electric-field distribution and device geometry. This also shows that, even if these field variations were not accounted for—for example, if using the simplified analytical model described below—the errors would be negligible, particularly at GHz frequencies at which we extract ε//.

Because of the non-uniform distribution of electric field across nanochannels and the complex geometry of AFM probes, the electrostatic problem cannot be solved exactly using analytical models. Hence, to fit the experimental data and obtain the results shown in Fig. 3, we used the 3D numerical simulations described above. Nonetheless, it is informative to provide an analytical approximation that would substantiate our numerical results and offer further physical insight into the observed spectral behaviour that is relatively independent of the details of experimental geometry. Such an approximation could be used for semi-quantitative estimates. To this end, we used the point-charge model in which the AFM tip was replaced by a point charge Q positioned at distance z = zscan + R from the top hBN surface (Extended Data Fig. 8a). The devices were modelled as a stack of different slabs, infinite in the in-plane direction. The slabs corresponding to the hBN layers were positioned at 0 < z < −Htop and −(Htop + h) < z < −(Htop + h + H) and modelled as insulators with zero conductivity. The water layer at −Htop < z < −(Htop + h) was described by anisotropic dielectric constants ε//,⊥ and conductivities σ//,⊥. The boundary condition of zero voltage was imposed at z = −(Htop + h + H) to model the highly conducting ground electrode. By making use of the in-plane translational invariance, the Laplace equation for the Fourier transform electrostatic potential in the in-plane direction ϕq(z) becomes

in which q = (qx,qy) is the wave vector in the in-plane direction and the position-dependent dielectric constants are denoted as ε//(z) and ε⊥(z), respectively. The dielectric constant of the hBN slabs was, for simplicity, assumed to be isotropic with ε//(z) = ε⊥(z) = εhBN = 4. The Laplace equation was solved within each slab using exponential functions. The solutions were matched at each interface by imposing the following boundary conditions: continuity of ϕq(z) and

in which η is an infinitesimal constant. A similar relation holds at the point-charge location, zscan + R, but the right-hand side in equation (3) becomes equal to Q. The potential in real space ϕ(r,z) was then obtained by performing the Fourier transform of ϕq(z) in the in-plane direction. The capacitance was estimated as C = Q/ϕ(0,zscan) and, from the latter, the capacitance gradient |dC/dz| was calculated. Examples of the calculated dielectric spectra for representative parameters of our devices and ε and σ of water are given in Extended Data Fig. 8, in which, again for brevity, |dC/dz| indicates its value relative to the case of the heterostructure fully made of hBN, |dC/dz| = dC(zscan,ε⊥,//,σ⊥,//)/dz − dC(zscan,εhBN,0)/dz. The calculated spectra show that the model captures all of the main features of the observed behaviour as a function of various parameters and agrees well with our numerical simulations in Extended Data Fig. 6. Note, however, that, because the analytical model assumes an infinite water layer and does not account for a finite w, the transition between low-f and high-f plateaus becomes less pronounced (Extended Data Fig. 8d). The analytical results agree with the numerical simulations only for w much larger than the tip radius R (Extended Data Fig. 6d). Accordingly, if only the analytical model were used to fit the reported experimental data, this would result in systematic underestimation of both ε// and σ//. In particular, the values extracted for quasi-2D water layers (h ⪝ 2 nm) would be underestimated by a factor of about 5, although all of the trends with changing h would remain correct.

The observed dispersion arises from DC conductive losses of water within the channels, not from its dipolar orientational (Debye) relaxation66. The latter in bulk water occurs only at f ≈ 10 GHz (ref. 67), well above the frequencies examined here. Furthermore, the spectra exhibit very high low-f plateaus, which, if fitted with Debye-like models, would yield physically implausible values for the ε// of water (see the ‘Alternative phenomenological Debye-like MW analysis' section). Instead, these plateaus are accurately reproduced by our model using realistic values of σ// of water in the conductive term of equation (1). A similar situation is encountered in the analysis of macroscale dielectric spectra of heterogeneous lossy dielectrics measured by broadband dielectric spectroscopy62 (for example, colloidal suspensions and composite liquid/solid materials such as water confined in porous media68,69), in which MW interfacial polarization relaxations60,61 emerge. In such complex heterogeneous systems, phenomenological Debye-like models become necessary, because the measured response represents the effective dielectric constant of the entire system and explicit modelling of each dielectric component is precluded by geometric complexity. Although these approximations can fit macroscale spectra, they typically yield unrealistically high ε at low frequencies, often reaching very large values (>104). Such high apparent permittivities, also reported for water confined in porous media68, do not represent intrinsic dielectric constants but, rather, reflect DC conductive losses68,70. By contrast, our three-layer nanochannel system enables a ‘first-principles' description in which each dielectric layer is modelled explicitly with its own frequency-independent ε and σ, as in equation (1). This approach allows ε// and σ// to be determined independently from the spectra without introducing unphysical parameters or approximations.

No further frequency dependence of ε// and σ// of water was required in this analysis, as the measured spectra show only a single Debye-like relaxation at low f arising from DC conductivity, with no indication of more relaxations. This is evident from the high-f plateaus, which remain flat and correspond to bulk-like or enhanced values of ε//. If in our smallest channels (<4 nm) the intrinsic dipolar relaxation of water were shifted to lower f by the geometric confinement, we would expect either an extra dielectric plateau or broadening of the Debye-like relaxation transition region, both leading to reduced high-f values of ε//. Instead, we consistently observed high, flat plateaus at high f across all of our devices, ruling out further dipolar relaxations in the in-plane direction. The same reasoning applies to anomalous Debye-like dipolar relaxations of the hydrogen-bond network reported for confined water69 in the 100 kHz to 10 MHz range, which would also reduce both the low-f and the high-f plateaus, an effect not observed here. Although a weak dipolar relaxation from hydrogen-bond restructuring in the out-of-plane direction cannot be entirely ruled out in our largest channels, this is unlikely for our smallest channels, which show very low ε⊥ at low frequencies (kHz), as previously reported22. In any case, variations in ε⊥ have negligible impact on the extracted ε// and σ// and, therefore, would not alter our conclusions.

The reason for a DC conductivity contribution to our spectra can be understood by noticing that we measured the modulus of dC/dz, that is, the modulus of the complex dielectric constant \({|\varepsilon }_{\perp ,//}^{* }(\omega )|\). As a result, the dielectric response is determined by both ε and σ and, depending on frequency, either the first or the second term in equation (1) becomes dominant. At sufficiently low f, the conductivity term always dominates \({|\varepsilon }_{\perp ,//}^{* }(\omega )|\), similar to the case of macroscale measurements using standard broadband dielectric spectroscopy62. To this end, it is useful to recall that, at low frequencies, the spectrum of deionized water at macroscale is known67 to be dominated by σbulk. Therefore, the spectrum is effectively divided into two regions separated by the conductivity relaxation frequency, fr,bulk, at which the behaviour changes. In the conduction-dominated region (f < fr,bulk), the dielectric response decreases with increasing f, whereas for f > fr,bulk, it is constant and depends only on εbulk. The value of fr,bulk is given by62

which follows from equation (1) if we use |ε⊥,//| = εbulk and |σ⊥,//| = σbulk. Note that this frequency is analogous to the cut-off frequency for systems that can be modelled by a simple RC circuit (see the ‘Electrical modelling' section). For the bulk water used in our experiments (εbulk ≈ 80, σbulk ≈ 2 × 10−4 S m−1), equation (4) yields approximately 45 kHz. This value agrees well with fr,bulk obtained from both numerical and analytical modelling discussed above for the specific experimental geometry. Indeed, the analyses shown in Extended Data Figs. 6b and 8b yielded the purely dielectric behaviour characterized by high-f plateaus starting at f ⪞ 45 kHz for all of our nanochannels, irrespective of their height h. The extra plateau found in our simulations at low f reflects the presence of non-lossy dielectrics (air gap between the AFM tip and the device; the top and bottom hBN layers). These dielectrics can be represented as further capacitances in series to the contribution of water (see the ‘Electrical modelling' section). Accordingly, for f below the cut-off frequency fc,bulk, the modelled response becomes purely dielectric, reflecting the series capacitances. For fc,bulk < f <fr,bulk, the response is dominated by the σ of water, whereas above the relaxation frequency fr,bulk, it is again purely dielectric but now dominated by the ε of water. For other relevant values of σ and ε of water, the spectra exhibit similar behaviour (Extended Data Figs. 6e,f and 8e,f): there is a low-f plateau up to the cut-off frequency fc, above which the response decreases with increasing f, and the high-f plateau develops above the conductivity relaxation frequency fr.

The onset of the low-f plateau with decreasing f is determined by the in-plane conductivity of water σ//, whereas no information can be inferred about σ⊥ from our experimental data because the measurement geometry is insensitive to the latter conductivity. This can be seen in Extended Data Figs. 6e and 8e, in which the low-f plateau shifts in frequency with varying σ//, but not σ⊥, and completely disappears if σ// = 0 and σ⊥ ≠ 0. Qualitatively, the stronger dielectric response at low f reflects the fact that the electric potential drops mostly between the AFM tip and the conductive water layer. We used our numerical simulations to illustrate this effect (Extended Data Fig. 5). At low f and σ// ≠ 0, the electric potential decreases almost entirely across the air and the top hBN layer with little voltage drop left below the water layer (Extended Data Fig. 5f). Also, the potential distribution extends along the length of the nanochannel for several micrometres (Extended Data Fig. 5d). By contrast, at high f > fr, the potential drop occurs across the entire thickness of our devices, similar to the case in which the AFM tip is placed above hBN spacers (Extended Data Fig. 5f–h). The potential drop at high f also extends nearly equally in all of the lateral directions around the tip apex (Extended Data Fig. 5e), similar to the case in Extended Data Fig. 5c for non-conducting water layer (σ// = 0). The effective screening by the conductivity of water along the channel length explains the observed large low-f response. Note that the absolute value of the low-f response is independent of σ// but depends on geometric parameters, in particular the channel width w, tip radius R (Extended Data Fig. 6c) and the bottom-layer thickness H (Extended Data Figs. 7c and 8c). This makes simulations essential for accurate evaluation of the magnitude of changes on the dispersion curves.

Although the value of σ// does not affect the low-f response, it controls the cut-off frequency fc, which shifts to higher f proportionally to σ// (Extended Data Figs. 6e and 8e) but independently of ε// (Extended Data Figs. 6f and 8f). This behaviour can be described by

in which α is the geometrical parameter that can be estimated analytically (see the ‘Electrical modelling' section). For more accurate results, α was obtained using numerical simulations (Extended Data Fig. 10), which yielded α ≈ 2.8 × 10−3, 6.2 × 10−4 and 9.2 × 10−5 for our three representative devices discussed in the main text, with h ≈ 30, 5 and 1.5 nm, respectively. These values of α suggest that fc should shift relatively little (from about 10 kHz to about 500 Hz) if water filling the channels exhibited the bulk properties (Extended Data Figs. 6b,c and 8b,c). This shift is much smaller than that observed experimentally and, in fact, occurs in the opposite direction, towards lower f for smaller h, in strong contrast to the experimental behaviour (Fig. 2a). This reiterates the fact that the observed increase in fc with decreasing h cannot be associated with changes in geometry but comes from a huge increase in the σ// of water for stronger confinement.

At high f, beyond the conductivity relaxation regime, water behaves as a purely dielectric media and, accordingly, the relative height of the high-f plateau is no longer dependent of σ// but depends on the ε of water, the geometry of the channel (in particular its height h) and the AFM tip radius (Extended Data Fig. 6c). The height of the plateau allows us to extract ε// using numerical simulations. Notably, for small channels and large in-plane dielectric constant (ε// ≥ 80), the contribution of ε⊥ becomes negligible (Extended Data Figs. 6f and 8f). Furthermore, we find that fr shifts to higher frequencies proportionally to σ// and inversely proportionally to ε// and is given by

This equation is independent of the device geometry and presents an equivalent of equation (4) valid at the macroscale. Therefore, once σ// is known, ε// can be directly obtained from fr using equation (6), provided that fr is well separated from fc, as in the case of our smallest channels. Also, if α is known, both σ// and ε// could be readily estimated from the two characteristic frequencies fc and fr without the need for simulations, simply using the equations

which follow directly from equations (5) and (6). Note that the above considerations and equations (5)–(8) can also be helpful for the analysis of dielectric spectra obtained using other scanning probe approaches44, including those that examine higher derivatives of |dC/dz| and scanning impedance/microwave microscopy that directly investigates the local impedance.

It is instructive to use an equivalent impedance circuit to describe the observed dielectric dispersion. However, because of long-range contributions from various AFM cantilever components and the complex geometry of our nanochannel devices that result in a non-uniform distribution of the electric field, an equivalent circuit should be so complicated that it is unrealistic to describe our spectra quantitatively. Below, we provide a simplified model that aims to explain the physics behind and support our numerical results (Extended Data Fig. 9). To this end, the AFM tip–nanochannel interaction can be modelled by the capacitance, Ctip, that—for simplicity—accounts for both tip–air and top-hBN-layer capacitances and, to a first approximation, can be calculated as Ctip = 2πε0Rln(1 + R(1 − sinθ)/(zscan + Htop/ε⊥hBN)) using the formula described in ref. 57. We neglect the stray capacitances associated with the AFM cantilever and consider only the tip apex capacitance that is expected to provide the dominant contribution. As for the water-filled nanochannel, we consider it as a distributed RC network shown in Extended Data Fig. 9a. It consists of two elementary RC circuits describing in-plane and out-of-plane impedances Z//(ω) = R///(1 + iωR//C//) and Z⊥(ω) = R⊥/(1 + iωR⊥C⊥), respectively. R⊥,// and C⊥,// can be estimated as C// = ε0ε//wh/Δl, R// = Δl/(σ//wh) for the in-plane direction and C⊥ = ε0ε⊥wΔl/h and R⊥ = h/(σ⊥wΔl) for the out-of-plane direction, in which Δl is the length of the circuit element along the channel. We also considered another capacitance Cb in series to Z⊥, to model the effect of the bottom hBN layer between the water channel and the ground. Plugging in the experimental values relevant to our devices, we can readily find that Z⊥(ω) ≪ 1/(ωCb) for all frequencies, meaning that the contribution of Z⊥(ω) is negligible in our experiments, in agreement with the above numerical and analytical calculations. The distributed network can then be simplified further and described by the electrical circuit shown in Extended Data Fig. 9b, in which the water impedance is modelled by a single RC unit in the in-plane direction, that is, Zch(ω) = R///(1 + iωR//C//), in which C// = ε0ε//wh/l*, R// = l*/(σ//wh) and l* is the effective length of the nanochannel contributing to electrostatic interactions with the AFM tip. With reference to Extended Data Fig. 5d, l* notably exceeds the tip diameter and, without loss of generality, can be assumed to be on the order of several micrometres. The total equivalent impedance between the AFM tip and the ground is then given by

in which Cgeom = CtipCb/(Ctip + Cb) is the capacitance that depends on geometric parameters but not on the electrical properties of water. Extended Data Fig. 9c shows |Z| as a function of f for the three representative devices. The effective capacitance of the modelled circuit is given by 1/ωZ(ω) and shows the same qualitative dependence on f, σ and ε of the capacitance gradient, |dC/dz|. Extended Data Fig. 9d plots |1/ωZ(ω)| that indeed exhibits both low-f and high-f plateaus characterized by frequencies fc and fr, in good agreement with the experiment and numerical simulations. Despite its simplicity, the electrical model also reproduces well the changes in the high-f plateau with varying ε// of water (Extended Data Fig. 9f) and changes in fc with varying σ// (Extended Data Fig. 9e).

Using this model, we can also corroborate the expressions for fc and fr given by equations (5) and (6). Indeed, the pole of equation (9) yields the relaxation frequency as fr = 1/(2πR//C//) and, plugging in R// and C// in terms of σ// and ε//, results in equation (6). The zero of equation (9) yields the cut-off frequency so that fc ≅ 1/(2πR//Cgeom), for which we take into account that Cgeom is larger than C//. Accordingly, fc is proportional to σ// ∝ 1/R// and depends on the measurement geometry (through Ctip and Cb) but is independent of ε//, in agreement with our numerical simulations. Expressing Ctip, Cb and R// in terms of geometric and electrical parameters as defined above and taking Cb = ε0εhBNwl*/H, we obtain equation (5), in which, in the case of our geometry, the geometric factor α can be approximated to α ≅ (hw/l*)(1/(2πR) + H/(εhBNwl*)). Using the specific parameters for our representative devices (h ≈ 30, 5 and 1.5 nm) and the effective channel length l* = 3 μm, this yields α of about 4 × 10−3, 1 × 10−3 and 2 × 10−4, respectively, in reasonable agreement with the numerically simulated values of α. Thus, equations (7) and (8) with α calculated analytically, as obtained from the simplified electrical model shown in Extended Data Fig. 9b, also allow for semi-quantitative estimates of σ// and ε//, which are found to differ by only a factor of less than 2 from the values extracted through our more quantitative, numerical analysis.

For completeness, we demonstrate that applying the MW formalism typically used for macroscale dielectric spectra62,63,64 would yield the same ε// and σ// values as reported in Fig. 3, although in a more convoluted way. In this alternative framework, the anisotropic, complex dielectric function in equation (1) for the water slab is replaced with the following expression:

in which τ⊥ and τ// are characteristic Debye-type relaxation times and εlf⊥ (εhf⊥) and εlf// (εhf//) are the low-f (high-f) dielectric constants of the water slab, respectively, in each direction. No broadening parameters are required, as a single, ideal Debye-type relaxation describes our spectra. We omit the explicit conductivity term and further simplify equation (10) to:

because the Debye term in equation (10) inherently accounts for conductivity contributions at finite frequencies. This is evident by rewriting equation (11) in terms of its real and imaginary parts:

This equation reproduces the observed spectral behaviour. However, because the imaginary part vanishes as ω → 0, fitting the observed low-f plateau requires assuming unrealistically large in-plane εlf//, as usually happens in the MW analysis of macroscale systems68,70. Extended Data Fig. 11 shows results from implementing equation (10) in our 3D numerical simulations and fitting simulated |dC/dz| to the experimental spectra for our representative nanochannels with thicknesses h = 30, 5 and 1.5 nm. Consistent with the fittings in Extended Data Fig. 10, the simulated spectra are largely insensitive to ε⊥ or σ⊥ and the fits yield the same in-plane dielectric constants at high f as our model, that is, ε// = εhf// (Extended Data Fig. 10 and Fig. 3a). They correspond to intrinsic dielectric constants of water, extracted beyond the MW relaxation regime (≫10 MHz), in which the conductivity of water no longer dominates. This shows that the extracted ε// are independent of the specific analysis used. At low f, however, the fit using equation (10) yields very large dielectric constants (εlf// ≈ 104–106) up to the cut-off frequency fc. These values are not physical dielectric constants and should not be mistaken with the values of ε// reported in Fig. 3a. They simply reflect the in-plane DC conductivity of the water, which—in this formalism—can be estimated as σ// = ε0εlf///τ//, yielding the same σ// values as obtained from equation (1) (Extended Data Fig. 10 and Fig. 3b). Alternatively, using the fitted high-f dielectric constant, εhf//, and the relaxation frequency, which—in this approximation—is given by fr = σ///(2πε0εhf//), we again recover the same σ// values.

Although this phenomenological approximation ultimately gives identical ε// and σ// to our model, it has notable drawbacks. First, as discussed above, it yields unphysically large εlf// that have no physical meaning. Second, unlike macroscale measurements, in which the MW approximation can be fitted directly to the measured effective dielectric function, our nanoscale spectra still require full-3D numerical simulations to account for the system geometry, such as the AFM tip geometry, the scan height and the nanochannels structure. Moreover, in this framework, extracting σ// depends on either εlf// or εhf//, both of which can only be determined from 3D numerical fitting of the low-f or high-f plateaus, respectively. By contrast, in our model, σ// is directly proportional to the cut-off frequency fc through the geometric factor α (equation (5)), which can be estimated analytically, allowing extraction of σ// without further numerical simulations.

We emphasize that, despite similarities, there are also key differences between our local spectra and those measured at the macroscale. Therefore, caution is needed when applying the MW approximation to our local measurements. First, several combinations of εlf// and τ// can fit the low-f plateau equally well, because neither parameter has physical meaning. In fact, in our local spectra, the amplitude of the low-f plateau is set by the geometric capacitances in series with the channels—determined primarily by the AFM tip size, the channel thickness and its distance from the bottom gate—rather than by the conductivity of water. As a result, higher values of σ// do not lead to higher low-f plateaus in our spectra, as we might naively expect. Instead, it only shifts the MW relaxation to higher frequencies, as described by equation (5). We also note that, in our ‘first-principles' model, the complex dielectric constants defined in equation (1) diverge at zero frequency for a finite conductivity, but this divergence is truncated by the system geometry directly treated in the modelling, producing a Debye-like plateau independent of the ε// or σ// of water. Finally, the characteristic frequency 1/(2πτ//) of the Debye-like relaxation in equation (10) does not coincide with the cut-off frequency fc. Again, this is because, in our local measurements, fc depends on the system geometry. In the MW formalism, fc = αMW/(2πτ//), in which αMW is a different system-dependent parameter that is not purely geometric but related to the purely geometric parameter α introduced in our model by αMW = αεlf//, in which εlf// is extracted from numerically fitting the low-f plateau. These observations highlight that, although the Debye-like MW approximation ultimately produces the same results as those obtained using equations (1) and (5)–(8), it is less straightforward, depends more heavily on simulations and introduces parameters without physical meaning.

a, Optical image of a representative device with channel height h ≈ 5 nm. The edges of the spacer layer are indicated by the white dashed lines. The large square region (pink) is the suspended SiN membrane. It has an approximately 20-μm-long rectangular slit in its centre (white) that connects nanochannels to a water reservoir at the back side of the device. b, Dark-field optical image of the same device. c, Zoom into its central region in which numerous parallel channels can be seen. d,e, Sketch of the device geometry: its cross-section (d) and top view (e) (not to scale). f, AFM topography image of the central region of the device. The black dashed lines indicate the position of the aperture. The white dashed curve indicates the edges of the hBN spacer crystal. Scale bars, 20 μm (a,b); 10 μm (c); 3 μm (f).

a, AFM topography image of a representative device with h ≈ 5 nm before filling it with water—same image as in Extended Data Fig. 1f but using a flattening filter to better visualize the sagging of the top hBN layer into nanochannels. The image was taken in the intermittent-contact attractive mode with no voltage applied. b,c, Same as a but with applying a low-f electric field (vAC = 8 V, 1 kHz) before (b) and after (c) filling the nanochannels with water. The contrast above the channels changes from light cyan in b to red in c, indicating successful filling of water. This contrast in c, which shows an apparent roughness change of several nanometres, arises from the large in-plane conductivity of water and not from actual topographical features. The top surface of the device becomes essentially atomically flat after water filling, with residual roughness <3 Å for all of our devices, as demonstrated in f and g (see also the ‘Device fabrication' section in Methods). d, Zoom-in of the central region in a. The top hBN layer is partially sagged into the empty channels. e, Further zoom-in showing the region indicated by the dashed rectangle in d. f, Same as e but after filling nanochannels with water. It shows that the top hBN layer became flat, no longer sagging inside the nanochannels. g, Topography profiles over three channels in e and f, as indicated by colour-coded lines. h, Dielectric image taken from the same region as in f at a constant height and at 1 GHz. The plotted values of |dC/dz| are variations after subtracting the |dC/dz| values found at the centre of the hBN spacer region. Scale bars: 3 μm (a–c); 2 μm (d), 1 μm (e,f,h).

Source data

a, Representative |dC/dz|(x,z) image taken at 2 kHz for channels with h ≈ 5 nm. The image shows three nanochannels and was acquired by measuring |dC/dz| at various constant heights and a fixed y position. The tip approached the surface from above using small steps. b, Absolute values of |dC/dz| for scanning along the lateral (x) axis at constant y and various heights. The profiles were averaged over about ten lines using images in a. The signal became sensitive to the presence of water inside the channels at z ≲ 30 nm. c, Gain-calibrated |dC/dz|(z) curves at different frequencies taken over the centre of the spacer region (colour-coded lines). White symbols indicate the values of |dC/dz| and zscan corresponding to the profiles shown in b. Inset, same curves without calibration of the electrical gain g and the offsets (colour-coded). We used the curve at 2 kHz as a reference to calibrate g at high frequencies by matching the reference curve with the curves taken at higher f, using only g and an offset as fitting parameters. d, Schematic representation of our 3D AFM datasets |dC/dz|(x,z,f) obtained by acquiring subsequent images |dC/dz|(x,z) for many frequencies from kHz to GHz. The black dashed arrows in a and d indicate the position at which the |dC/dz|(z) curves in c were acquired before taking such 3D images. e,f, Example of broadband dielectric imaging spectroscopy on a test sample of hBN on doped silicon using the same g calibration procedure: topography image (grey coloured) of 21-nm-thick hBN crystal on doped Si and corresponding calibrated dielectric images (cyan-coloured images) at frequencies 6 MHz, 240 MHz and 1.1 GHz at a constant height (about 45 nm). The plotted values of |dC/dz| are variations after subtracting the |dC/dz| values measured on the Si substrate. Scale bars, 1 μm. The curves in f are gain-calibrated |dC/dz|(z) curves taken above the Si substrate (solid curves) and the hBN layer (dotted) at various f. The gain g for each f was obtained by scaling the curves measured on doped Si to the low-f reference curve at 2 kHz using only g and an offset as fitting parameters. By fitting the calibrated curves on hBN using the procedure and analytical formula in ref. 72, we obtained the dielectric constant of the hBN layer as a function of f (inset). Its average value across all of the f up to GHz was found to be ε⊥hBN = 2.9 ± 0.2, which is in good agreement with the expected bulk value for hBN in the perpendicular direction (ε⊥hBN ≈ 3, dashed line). Bars, standard error defined as 95% confidence interval of the fitting, not shown when smaller than the symbol. Other fitting parameters: AFM tip R = 102 nm and θ = 25°, obtained by fitting the curve taken on doped Si at 2 kHz.

Recalled memories become transiently labile and require stabilization1,2,3. The mechanism for stabilizing memories of survival-critical experiences, which are often emotionally salient and repeated, remains unclear4. Here we identify an astrocytic ensemble that is transcriptionally primed by emotional experience and functionally triggered by repeated experience to stabilize labile memory. Using a novel brain-wide Fos tagging and imaging method, we found that astrocytic Fos ensembles were preferentially recruited in regions with neuronal engrams5 and were more widespread during fear recall than during conditioning. We established the induction mechanism of the astrocytic ensemble, which involves two steps: (1) an initial fear experience that induces day-long, slow astrocytic state changes with noradrenaline receptor upregulation; and (2) enhanced noradrenaline responses during recall, a repeated experience, enabling astrocytes to integrate coincident signals from local engrams and long-range noradrenergic projections, which induce secondary astrocytic state changes, including the upregulation of Fos and the neuromodulatory molecule IGFBP2. Pharmacological and genetic perturbation of the astrocytic ensemble signalling modulate engrams, and memory stability and precision. The astrocytic ensemble thus acts as a multiday trace in a subset of astrocytes after experience-dependent neural activity, which are eligible to capture future repeated experiences for stabilizing memories.

Recall transiently destabilizes memories, which require re-stabilization to become long-lasting1,2,3. Despite its importance in human cognition and neuropsychiatric disorders6,7, the mechanisms that specifically stabilize memories of critical experiences—those that are essential for survival and frequently marked by emotional salience and repetition—remain incompletely understood. Memory traces are linked to specialized neuronal ensembles (neuronal engrams), which include neuronal populations that become Fos+ during both initial and repeated experiences8. However, neuronal Fos alone, a plasticity marker that indicates circuit remodelling9, is insufficient for memory stabilization, implying the need for additional cellular substrates.

By tiling the entire mammalian central nervous system (CNS), astrocytes structurally and functionally interact with neurons and other glia. Their functions contribute to information processing and animal behaviour, and their dysfunctions are widely implicated in CNS disorders10,11. Astrocytes are known to be developmentally diverse12,13,14 and can adaptively change their molecular programmes in response to physiology11,15,16,17,18 and pathology19,20,21—hereafter referred to as state—in specific ways that suggest flexibly altered functions in a context-dependent manner. This adaptability is akin to experience-dependent neuronal responses (such as Fos upregulation)22 and the subsequent formation of inter-regional neuronal engram network8. However, the manifold nature of astrocyte responses through an extensive array of cell-surface receptors for neuroactive biomolecules19,23,24 have made it challenging to determine whether, when and how multiple inputs are integrated by a subset of astrocytes to generate specific states that form astrocyte ensembles that are responsible for particular cellular outputs15,18,24,25. This is because the field has lacked adequate tools to explore behaviourally relevant astrocyte ensembles (BAEs) in an unbiased manner at the single-cell level as well as in a brain-wide manner, which would enable ensemble-specific molecular dissection and functional perturbation.

To agnostically and holistically identify BAEs, we developed a brain-wide astrocyte Fos tagging tool that enables permanent genetic access to BAEs that express Fos due to a specific experience. Although behaviourally relevant stimuli-induced astrocyte Fos mRNA22 and c-Fos protein18,26 have been observed in selected brain regions, its brain-wide profiling remains largely unexplored. We systematically validated a novel genetic and imaging strategy for whole-brain BAE tagging, demonstrating astrocyte selectivity, Fos sensitivity and temporal regulation (Extended Data Figs. 1–3). First, using a CNS-wide-transducing adenovirus (AAV) vector (AAV-PHP.eB) with an astrocyte-specific GfaABC1D promoter27, we achieved widespread, astrocyte-selective (97.3–99.5%) expression (Extended Data Fig. 1). Second, we tested whether using AAV-PHP.eB to express Cre-dependent mNeonGreen (mNG) can serve as a marker of transient astrocytic Fos induction in Fos-iCreERT2 (TRAP2) mice28. This intersectional approach aimed to drive astrocytic mNG expression only when the Fos promoter was active during fast-acting 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) administration, enabling behaviour epoch-specific astrocyte Fos tagging across the CNS. As a positive control, we virally expressed the astrocytic Gαq-coupled designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) hM3Dq, a strong inducer of astrocyte c-Fos26,29,30, combined with 4-OHT and the hM3Dq agonist clozapine N-oxide (CNO) intraperitoneal injection. hM3Dq stimulation yielded approximately 282 mNG+ astrocytes per mm2, and significantly lower tagging in controls (Extended Data Fig. 2). Third, to probe the temporal dynamics of Fos-mNG tagging, dark-adapted mice were exposed to light at various intervals relative to 4-OHT administration28. Tagging peaked within a 6-h window around 4-OHT administration, with an approximately 22-fold increase in astrocytes in visual cortex compared with those in somatosensory cortex, indicating regional specificity and dependence on local neuronal activity (Extended Data Fig. 3). Collectively, these experiments validated our behaviour epoch-specific, brain-wide BAE tagging strategy.

To broadly explore BAEs in a learning paradigm, we used a contextual fear conditioning and recall task5,28 (Fig. 1a). TRAP2::AAV-PHP.eB-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG mice underwent three days of habituation to minimize contextual novelty and isolate associative components of fear learning and recall28,31. On day 4, one group received 3 foot shocks with immediate 4-OHT (FC), and another received 4-OHT immediately after recall 24 h post-FC (FR). Controls were non-shocked mice (NoFC) or fear-conditioned mice kept in the home cage for 24 h and given 4-OHT without recall (NoFR). Shocked groups exhibited robust freezing in the conditioned chamber, indicating learning and recall (Fig. 1b). One week later, whole-brain serial two-photon tomography (STPT)32 enabled the detection of individual mNG+ astrocytes (BAEs) (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). After excluding ventricular niches for bona fide astrocyte counts (Methods), BAE counts across 677 regions covered approximately 80.7% of the brain (Supplementary Table 2).

Whereas the number of Fos+ neurons increased during both FC and FR, forming networks causally linked to fear memory traces—commonly referred to as engram neurons5,8,28, the density of Fos+ astrocytes during FC (FC-BAE; Fig. 1c) was seldom distinguishable from the NoFC control (NoFC-BAE). However, we found that the number of BAEs during recall (FR-BAE) was augmented across multiple regions (Fig. 1c). This was not simply reflecting delayed Fos upregulation after FC, because Fos induction was significantly higher in FR than in NoFR. Normalized comparisons across engram regions5 (Fig. 1d) showed a significantly greater number of FR-BAEs compared with FC-BAEs, particularly in the amygdala (Fig. 1e), the region long implicated in fear memory across species3,4,33,34,35. Consistently, in the lateral and basolateral amygdala (LA/B), astrocytic c-Fos protein was unchanged after FC or in NoFR versus NoFC, but FR induced a marked increase at 1.5 h with partial decay by 6 h (Extended Data Fig. 4). Consistently, the number of of FR-BAEs in the LA/B (FR-BAELA/B) was robust whether 4-OHT was given immediately or 3 h post-FR (Extended Data Fig. 5). These data indicate that astrocyte Fos promoter activity, and the associated surge in Fos mRNA and c-Fos protein expression, peaks within a biologically plausible window of 0–3 h following FR, but not following FC.

A recent study18 reported an increase in hippocampal astrocytic Fos after FC without habituation, contrasting with our findings (Fig. 1c–f). We hypothesized that this reflects contextual novelty: without prior habituation, novelty strongly drives astrocytic Fos. Supporting this, our ‘FC + novelty' group (FC in novel context with no habituation) showed widespread astrocytic Fos, including in CA1 (Extended Data Fig. 6). Thus, the CA1 astrocytic Fos is likely to signal novelty, whereas our habituated FC protocol reveals astrocytic ensembles that are more selectively engaged in learning and recall.

To holistically compare the anatomical positioning of BAEs with previously reported brain-wide Fos+ neuron distribution during FC and FR5, we analysed subregions from previously defined regions in which Fos+ neuron counts of FC and FR were significantly higher than in non-shocked controls, referred to as neuronal ‘engram significant brain regions'5 (Fig. 1e–g and Methods). The number of Fos+ neurons increased during FC versus non-shocked controls, whereas there was no apparent change in astrocytic Fos counts (Fig. 1f). By contrast, FR elicited a strong correlation between neuronal and astrocytic Fos induction (r = 0.56; Fig. 1g,h), suggesting that local astrocyte–neuron interactions may underlie FR-BAE formation22. Notably, amygdala subregions that displayed selective astrocytic Fos increases during FR (Fig. 1e) also showed parallel neuronal Fos increases (Fig. 1h, yellow dots).

To test whether astrocytic and neuronal ensembles are co-engaged within the same regions, we performed dual-colour Fos tagging in the amygdala of TRAP2 mice (Fig. 1i–k). Neuron-specific DIO-mCherry and astrocyte-specific DIO-mNG AAVs were co-injected, and four groups were analysed: NoFC, FC, NoFR and FR. Neuronal Fos increased after FC or FR, consistent with past reports5,8,22. By contrast, astrocytic tagging was minimal following FC and NoFR but was robustly induced after FR (Fig. 1i–k), replicating our brain-wide observations (Fig. 1c–h). These results confirm that astrocyte Fos induction in the amygdala is recall-specific and distinct from neuronal ensemble dynamics.

To identify mechanisms underlying astrocyte Fos induction, we combined pharmacological screening, circuit genetics, in vivo imaging and transcriptomics (Figs. 2–4). Growth factors that activate c-Fos in neurons36 did not trigger c-Fos signals in primary astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 7), indicating that the induction mechanisms of c-Fos in neurons and astrocytes are distinct. Given the accumulating evidence that astrocyte G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation upregulates c-Fos expression26,29,30, we then stimulated primary astrocytes with a variety of neurotransmitters that bind to GPCRs expressed in astrocytes11,22,23, observing that noradrenaline (NA) increased c-Fos signals (Fig. 2b,c). The astrocyte c-Fos signals induced by NA at 0.1 µM and 1 µM were both abolished by propranolol (Fig. 2d), which antagonizes Gαs-coupled β-adrenergic receptors (β-receptors), but not by prazosin or atipamezole, which antagonize Gαq-coupled α1-adrenoreceptors (α1-receptors) or Gαi-coupled α2-adrenoreceptors, respectively (Fig. 2d). The astrocyte c-Fos induction was resistant to the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM)37. The membrane-permeable Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin did not increase astrocyte c-Fos signals (Fig. 2d). However, the inhibition of cAMP production by the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 attenuated astrocyte c-Fos signals induced by the adenylate cyclase–cAMP activator forskolin, the β-receptor agonist isoproterenol or NA (Fig. 2d). Together, these data show that NA induces c-Fos signals in primary astrocytes mainly through Gαs-coupled β-receptors and subsequent increases in cAMP.

Astrocytes in vivo respond to both local circuits and long-range neuromodulators15. Our data (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 3d) suggest that local activity also contributes to Fos induction in vivo. Given the transcriptional differences between in vitro and in vivo astrocytes, notably the reduced expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3, encoded by Grm3) in cultured astrocytes17,38, which is abundantly expressed in adult in vivo astrocytes39, we heterologously expressed mGluR3 in primary astrocytes via AAVs to mimic the in vivo context (Fig. 2e). In mGluR3-expressing astrocytes, glutamate alone was ineffective, but in combination with NA it strongly enhanced c-Fos intensity (Fig. 2f,g). No such synergy was seen in mGluR3-negative astrocytes. Because Gαi-coupled GPCRs such as mGluR3 can enhance Gβγ–Ca2+ signalling when Gαq–phospholipase Cβ is co-activated29,40, NA may recruit α1-receptors (Gαq) and mGluR3 (Gαi) to cooperate with β-receptor–cAMP pathways (Fig. 2h). Supporting this, ionomycin-induced Ca2+ signals enhanced c-Fos when combined with NA, isoproterenol or forskolin (Fig. 2i). Thus, astrocytic c-Fos is driven primarily by β-receptor–cAMP and is further potentiated by convergent glutamate and NA signalling.

To test this convergence in vivo, we expressed neuron-specific hM3Dq in LA/B and locus coeruleus (LC), which mainly consists of noradrenergic neurons to stimulate them with CNO (Fig. 2j–m). The number of Fos-mNG+ astrocytes remained low when only LA/B or LC neurons were activated, but increased markedly when both were stimulated (Fig. 2j–m). This provides in vivo evidence that coincident local and noradrenergic inputs induce astrocytic Fos.

We next tested the necessity of local and far-reaching NA neural signals during FR-BAE tagging. TRAP2::AAV-PHP.eB-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG mice received one of four perturbations at the time of tagging: β-receptor antagonism with propranolol (Fig. 2n) or hM4Di-mediated silencing of LC neurons (Fig. 2o), amygdalar neurons (Fig. 2p) or amygdalar engram neurons tagged with the robust activity marking (RAM) system41,42 whose hM4Di-based silencing (Extended Data Fig. 8) is known to reduce fear memory recall41 (Fig. 2q). In all conditions, FR-BAE density decreased significantly (Fig. 2r), demonstrating dependence on both LC-NA and local engram activity.

To further test whether FR-BAEs reside in anatomical contexts where they could receive convergent inputs from both noradrenergic projections and local engram neurons, we performed dual-colour Fos tagging with neuron-specific DIO-mCherry and astrocyte-specific DIO-mNG AAVs in TRAP2 mice, combined with noradrenaline transporter (NET) immunostaining to visualize noradrenergic projections (Extended Data Fig. 9). Territories of FR-BAEs showed greater overlap with noradrenergic projections and FR engram neurons than those of non-FR-BAEs, with no change in astrocyte territory size. These findings indicate that FR-BAEs are positioned to integrate convergent inputs from noradrenergic projections and local engram neurons, supporting the model that their coincidence drives FR-BAE induction in the amygdala.

Our data (Fig. 2) support a convergence model in which NA and engram activity induce astrocyte Fos. However, since both activities occur during FC and FR8,43, the stronger astrocyte Fos induction during FR than FC (Fig. 1) raises the question of how astrocytes generate this selective response. To address this, we examined NA release and astrocyte cAMP–Ca2+ signalling dynamics across fear learning and recall using in vivo fibre photometry (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 8). We deployed AAV2/9-hSyn1-GRABNE2h44 to monitor bulk NA signals in the LA/B of freely behaving mice (Fig. 3a,b). During habituation 24 h prior to FC, NA signals were observed when the mice were placed into context A (CtxA; foot shock chamber) (peak ΔF/F = 0.142 ± 0.017), probably reflecting mild stressors and/or locomotion44 (NoFC; Fig. 3b). On top of the contextual NA signals, single foot shocks evoked enhanced and relatively fast (peak ΔF/F = 0.206 ± 0.04; half-decay = 4.3 min) NA responses in LA/B (FC; Fig. 3b). In addition, further enhanced (peak ΔF/F = 0.211 ± 0.022) and prolonged (half-decay = 13.5 min) NA signals were observed during the contextual FR (FR; Fig. 3b). The prolonged NA signals were absent in context B (CtxB) (Extended Data Fig. 10c,d), a neutral, non-conditioned context where mice show no freezing (Extended Data Fig. 10b), indicating that recall of contextual fear drives sustained NA signals.

We next used dual-colour fibre photometry (AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-cAMPinG1 and AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-RCaMP345) to measure astrocyte cAMP and Ca2+ signals (Fig. 3c). Consistent with the NA signals (Fig. 3a,b), cAMPinG1 signals increased during habituation and foot shocks, which fully decayed within about 2 min (NoFC and FC; Fig. 3d). On the FR day, however, astrocytes displayed a progressive increase in cAMP (FR; Fig. 3d), which was absent in CtxB (Extended Data Fig. 10e,f). β-receptor antagonism (propranolol) in vivo abolished the astrocytic cAMP signalling during FR (Fig. 3d), which suppressed FR-BAE induction (Fig. 2n,r) and freezing (Extended Data Fig. 10b′). Foot shock elicited astrocyte Ca2+ signals as reported previously46, and Ca2+ event frequency increased during FR (Fig. 3e). These data collectively indicate that fear experiences induce the enhancement of NA signals within the amygdala, which strongly trigger astrocyte cAMP signals through β-receptors during FR.

The increased astrocyte cAMP–Ca2+ signalling during FR raised the question of how astrocytes mount stronger responses during recall than during conditioning, despite NA release and engram neural activity occurring in both fear experiences. To address this, we examined experience-dependent molecular changes in astrocytes under NoFC, FC, NoFR and FR conditions. We dissected amygdala tissue 90 min after behavioural testing and isolated astrocytes by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using the ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit β2 (ATP1B2)47 antibody ACSA2 (Extended Data Fig. 11a) and performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). After quality control, we obtained profiles of 1,903 astrocytes (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 11b,c) and identified 4 transcriptionally distinct astrocyte clusters (AST1–4; Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 11d,e and Supplementary Table 3). We did not observe any noticeable shifts in the subcluster composition across conditions, suggesting that FC and FR do not alter cluster identity. Fos-positive astrocytes comprised 2.9–4.2% of total astrocytes (Fig. 4b), consistent with earlier data (Extended Data Fig. 4). Of note, FR astrocytes showed the highest Fos levels (Fig. 4b), in line with BAE tagging (Fig. 1). Whereas scRNA-seq provides a snapshot at a single time point (approximately twofold increase in FR versus FC; Fig. 4b), the Fos-TRAP system integrates promoter activity over hours, which is likely to account for the greater fold differences observed with tagging (more than 30-fold in FR versus FC; Fig. 1d,e).

Subsequent analyses revealed that Adra1a (α1-receptor) and Adrb1 (β1-adrenoreceptor) as the two dominant adrenoreceptor genes expressed in amygdalar astrocytes. Notably, both receptors were upregulated in the FC group (1.5 h post-FC) and further elevated in the NoFR group (24 h post-FC without recall), suggesting continued priming of astrocytes over time (Fig. 4c). This data suggests a model in which FC induces a molecular state change in astrocytes, with a latency, increasing adrenoreceptor expression to potentiate NA signalling and enable future repeated fear-evoked Fos induction during FR. The enhancement in astrocytic adrenoreceptor expression is likely to underlie the NA–β-receptor-driven cAMP signals during FR (Fig. 3c,d) and Fos induction in response to recall of strong fear memory a day after conditioning (Fig. 1). To test this model, we explored temporal changes in adrenoreceptor expression, their link to FR-BAE induction, and causal roles in Fos induction.

We examined the time course of Adra1a and Adrb1 expression following FC, using single-cell RNAscope on amygdalar sections collected at 1.5 h, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days and 14 days post-conditioning (Fig. 4d–f). Adrb1 expression was significantly increased from 1.5 h to 3 days post-conditioning (approximately twofold versus NoFC; Fig. 4e), but returned to baseline by 14 days. By contrast, Adra1a expression was increased at 1 day post-conditioning (Fig. 4e), showed partial decay by 2 to 3 days, and peaked again at 14 days. We calculated a co-expression index for each cell (relative Adrb1 expression × relative Adra1a expression; Methods) and found a peak at 1 day post-FC (Fig. 4f), followed by gradual decline. To test whether this molecular profile predicts the degree of astrocyte Fos induction during recall, we performed FR-BAE tagging at multiple time points post-FC (1 day, 2 days, 3 days and 14 days; Fig. 4g,h). Consistent with the adrenoreceptor co-expression time course (Fig. 4f), FR-BAE density peaked at 1 day and declined thereafter (Fig. 4h), suggesting a defined window for FR-BAE induction. Moreover, RNAscope further revealed strong Fos–Adrb1 correlation in FR astrocytes (Fig. 4i–k).

To determine whether these adrenoreceptors are causally required for FR-BAE induction, we performed astrocyte-specific knockdown of Adra1a or Adrb1 in the amygdala (Fig. 4l) using floxed mouse lines48,49,50, AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre-4x6T51 and Flp-based Fos-tagging AAVs (AAV2/5-Fos-FlpoERT2 and AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-fDIO-mNG). Knockdown of either receptor (Fig. 4m,n) significantly reduced FR-BAE density (Fig. 4o,p), indicating that both Gαq-coupled α1-receptors and Gαs-coupled β1-receptors are necessary for FR-BAE induction in vivo. Our earlier finding that the α1-receptor antagonist prazosin did not block NA-induced c-Fos induction in cultured astrocytes (Fig. 2d) probably reflects the downregulation of Adra1a in vitro17, highlighting the importance of in vivo validation. Collectively, our data support a model in which initial fear experience primes astrocytes to upregulate adrenoreceptor expression over time, creating a multiday molecular trace that allows future NA release upon repeated experiences (that is, recall) to selectively recruit the astrocyte ensemble.

Transcriptomics enabled us to probe molecular changes of FR-BAEs linked to functional outputs. We mined differentially expressed genes between Adrb1-positive and Adrb1-negative astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 12a) and identified Igfbp2 as highly upregulated in Adrb1-positive astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 12a,b). Our single-cell RNAscope revealed highly correlated expression of Adrb1 and Igfbp2 (Extended Data Fig. 12c–e), suggesting that astrocytic Adrb1 upregulation could promote Igfbp2 induction. Igfbp2 encodes the secreted protein IGFBP2, which was recently reported to be enriched in ‘peri-neuronal engram' Fos+ astrocytes of the amygdala after fear recall22.

Given that IGFBP2 and its binding partners, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), are crucial for synaptic plasticity52,53 and that chronic deletion of IGFBP2 disrupts synaptic transmission, circuit maturation and memory22,52,54, we hypothesized that IGFBP2 expression in FR-BAELA/B contributes to circuit de-stabilization and re-stabilization upon recall2,3. We tested this hypothesis with a spatiotemporally specific in vivo pharmacological perturbation of IGFBP2 (Extended Data Fig. 12f–h). We bilaterally infused an IGFBP2-neutralizing antibody52 (IGFBP2-Ab; 1 mg ml−1) immediately after FR in CtxA—that is, within the reconsolidation window during which memories become labile to be weakened or strengthened2. Mice received repeated daily infusions and FR sessions for five days (Extended Data Fig. 12f). IGFBP2-Ab treatment reduced freezing compared with controls (Extended Data Fig. 12g,h), indicating impaired memory stabilization; controls infused with IgG showed no change. Combined, our transcriptomics, RNAscope and pharmacological perturbation data indicate that a subset of astrocytes increases adrenoreceptor expression upon fear experiences, enhancing NA responsiveness and recall-driven induction of Fos and Igfbp2 to stabilize fear memory.

To directly examine the causal role of FR-BAE signalling in memory stabilization, we performed a loss-of-function experiment selectively targeting FR-BAEs in LA/B. We used iβARK, a genetically encoded 122-amino acid peptide that binds Gαq–GTP to suppress GPCR signalling26 (Extended Data Fig. 13a). In ex vivo Ca2+ imaging in amygdalar astrocytes, iβARK reduced α1-receptor-evoked Ca2+ responses relative to its mutant control, although some residual oscillatory activity persisted (Extended Data Fig. 13c,f,g), consistent with our prior findings in the striatum26. To improve efficacy, we developed iβARK2 by fusing the original peptide to a membrane-anchoring Lck domain, enabling more effective proximity-based inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 13a,b). iβARK2 showed robust membrane localization across astrocytic compartments, including fine processes (Extended Data Fig. 13d). Astrocytes expressing iβARK2 displayed significantly attenuated Ca2+ responses relative to both iβARK and the control iβARK2mut (Extended Data Fig. 13e–g). We next generated Cre-dependent AAV versions of iβARK2 and iβARK2mut for use in Fos-iCreERT2 TRAP mice to selectively target FR-BAEs (Fig. 5a,b). Remarkably, silencing FR-BAEs with iβARK2 impaired memory stabilization upon repeated recall (Fig. 5c), consistent with the behavioural effects observed upon neutralization of astrocyte-derived IGFBP2 (Extended Data Fig. 12f–h). Moreover, astrocytic IGFBP2 levels were significantly reduced in iβARK2-expressing mice compared with iβARK2mut controls (Fig. 5d), suggesting that suppression of GPCR signalling in FR-BAEs disrupts the recall-dependent transcriptional induction of IGFBP2 and compromises memory stabilization.

To further explore the causal impact of BAE signalling on neuronal engram and memory formation, we performed a gain-of-function experiment targeting astrocytic β1-receptors in LA/B. Astrocytes transduced with AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Adrb1 for Adrb1 overexpression (Adrb1-OE) showed significantly increased Igfbp2 expression compared with controls (Fig. 5f). Adrb1 overexpression also increased the density of FR-BAEs (Fos-mNG+ astrocytes) by around threefold relative to controls (Fig. 5g,h), indicating that astrocyte β1-receptor overexpression amplifies the recall-induced astrocyte ensemble.

We next functionally assessed the behavioural effect of the augmented astrocyte ensembles (Fig. 5i–l and Extended Data Fig. 14). We detected no differences in ambulation in an open arena or time spent in the centre zone during habituation between control and Adrb1-OE mice (Extended Data Fig. 14a,b). We then tested whether Adrb1 overexpression affected memory stabilization. With three-shock conditioning, both groups showed equivalent freezing during initial recall and second recall after reconsolidation (Fig. 5j), potentially owing to a ceiling effect. To create parametric space to detect enhancements in memory, we trained mice to a weak (one-shock) conditioning paradigm (Fig. 5i,k). Adrb1-OE mice did not show altered freezing during FR one day after FC; however, Adrb1-OE mice exhibited significantly increased freezing during the second recall (Fig. 5k), indicating enhanced memory stabilization following the reconsolidation after initial recall. In another cohort with three-shock conditioning, initial recall showed no significant difference in freezing between the groups (Extended Data Fig. 14i,j). However, we observed significantly enhanced freezing in an altered context (CtxB) in mice with Adrb1 overexpression compared with controls (Fig. 5l). These data suggest that overstabilization of the initial fear memory leads to generalization or a loss of memory precision41,55,56,57.

Finally, we explored whether fear generalization is accompanied by activity of engram neurons. We bilaterally injected AAV2/8-hSyn1-DIO-mCherry with and without AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Adrb1, and tagged engram neurons during FR. Mice were euthanized 1.5 h after the CtxB freezing test and the reactivation of FR engram neurons was assessed by c-Fos immunoreactivity (Fig. 5m–o). The overall number of mCherry+ neurons (FR engram neurons) was not significantly different between groups, but the c-Fos levels in FR engram neurons in the Adrb1-OE mice, which showed fear generalization, were significantly higher than those in control mice (Fig. 5o). These findings suggest that the larger astrocyte ensembles contribute to enhance subsequent reactivation of engram neurons, consistent with the view that memory retrievability is not determined during memory formation, but may be regulated after memory retrieval8, and demonstrating that astrocytes are involved in that crucial process.

These data demonstrate that astrocytes can link discrete fear experiences across at least a day-long timescale. As postulated more than a century ago58 and recently implicated in brain computation11,25,59,60, astrocytes may integrate information on slower timescales than neurons. Whereas neurons and astrocytes have been traditionally compared over milliseconds versus seconds-to-minutes, our findings reveal a functionally significant mismatch on the scale of days. Unlike neurons that express the immediate early genes during both FC and FR5,8,28, astrocytes respond to fear conditioning (FC) with rapid Ca2+ and cAMP increases61, but undergo slower transcriptional state changes62. Our single-cell transcriptomics and RNAscope revealed that multiple days post-FC, without recall, astrocytes upregulated Adra1a and Adrb1, marking a learning-dependent state that facilitates heightened responses during repeated experiences (FR). This in turn drives expression of Fos and Igfbp2, supporting memory stabilization. The astrocyte ensembles identified in this study may partially meet the criteria for engram cells8 that undergo enduring biochemical changes upon experiences. However, our findings suggest that the astrocytic ensemble may not serve as a direct memory trace encoding experience-specific information like neurons because its perturbation did not alter initial fear recall. Instead, it may function as an eligibility trace for memory stabilization over days, creating a permissive microenvironment within circuits that supports the stabilization of memories related to repeated experiences. From a computational and bioenergetic perspective, astrocytes may underlie retrospective linking63,64, which benefits from spaced intervals over days between learning sessions65 by providing a slow modulatory trace that complements fast neuronal activity64, thereby offloading the energetically costly task of maintaining firing patterns in neurons across days and enabling more stable circuit transformations60.

Mounting evidence from animal3,4,57 and human imaging6 studies has highlighted the amygdala and NA in modulating long-term memory. Early pharmacological studies targeting protein synthesis66, β-receptors67, PKA35 or cAMP–CREB34 in the amygdala disrupted memory re-stabilization, which our findings indicate could partially be mediated by astrocytes. We show that astrocytes undergo learning-dependent increases in adrenoreceptor expressions, and manipulating these receptors alters memory stability, precision and neuronal engram representations. Notably, both NA input and reactivated neuronal engram activity are required to recruit astrocytic ensembles that stabilize labile memories. These findings imply that astrocyte ensembles may not simply be passive bulk substrates of NA signals, but instead exert behaviourally relevant, circuit-specific regulations through astrocyte-defined microcircuitry15,68. Disrupting the precise NA–astrocyte signalling through β1R overexpression led to fear generalization, suggesting physiological astrocytic roles in selective memory stability that constrain maladaptive updating. In this regard, targeting these astrocyte–neuron interaction mechanisms could be beneficial in treating cognitive and neuropsychiatric dysfunctions, including post-traumatic stress disorder, in which hyperactivity of the NA system is a prominent feature4,69.

Deciphering how diverse astrocyte responses link to multiple circuit outputs has long been a challenge15. Considerable effort has been devoted to probe24 or perturb11 astrocyte Ca2+ signals since they were first reported70, yet causal relationships are usually inferred from separate subjects, leaving input–output links unclear. Astrocyte perturbation in a bulk manner is also incongruent with the heterogeneity of astrocyte identity49,71, state62,72 and response59,73. Our approaches bridge this gap: by exploiting context-specific astrocyte state changes18,20,22, the brain-wide BAE tagging method enables broad exploration of ensembles causal for neural processing and behaviour. This framework facilitates research into astrocytic ensembles across diverse behaviours and disease conditions. Expanding such efforts will accelerate discoveries in computation and pathology that require understanding of multicellular interactions as a core attribute of brain biology.

Young adult (8- to 12-week-old) wild-type C57BL/6NCrSlc mice obtained from the Japan SLC, Fos2A-iCreERT2 (TRAP228, JAX 030323) mice obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, Adra1a flox mice49,74 obtained from RIKEN (RBRC11837) and Adrb1 flox mice50 (accession number CDB1068K, generated by RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research) were used for in vivo experiments. TRAP2 mice were bred and maintained in our animal facility, backcrossed with C57BL/6NCrSlc at least eight times before use for experiments. Wild-type C57BL/6NCrSlc female mice were obtained from the Japan SLC to obtain postnatal day 0–1 (P0–P1) pups. Experiments were done using both male and female mice. Number of mice used in each experiment is listed in the main text and/or figure legends accordingly. Mice were housed in groups of 2–5 in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room (23 ± 3 °C, 45 ± 5% humidity) under a 12-h light:dark cycle (lights on from 07:00 to 19:00) and given ad libitum access to water and laboratory mouse diet at all times. After fibre implantation, the mice were single housed under a 12-h light:dark cycle (lights on from 07:00 to 19:00) and given ad libitum access to water and laboratory mouse diet at all times. After fibre implantation, the mice were singly housed. All experiments were approved by the RIKEN Animal Care and Use Committee.

AAVpro 293T cells (Clontech, 632273) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco, 11995073) with fetal bovine serum (FBS; Cosmo Bio, CCP-FBS-BR-500) and 0.1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, 15240062). Cells were grown in a humidified cell culture incubation with 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

All plasmid constructs were generated using standard molecular biology techniques and the In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Clontech). The pZac2.1 GfaABC1D-Rpl22-HA plasmids (Addgene plasmid #111811) were digested with XhoI and NotI, which removed the Rpl22-HA sequence. Multiple cloning sequences (MCS) comprised of restriction enzyme sites that were absent from the backbone pZac2.1 plasmid were generated via gene synthesis (Eurofins Genomics) and incorporated to produce pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-MCS plasmids. The PCR-amplified DIO-GFP sequence from Addgene plasmid #28304 was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCAG-tdTomato (Addgene #83029) between EcoRI sites to generate pCAG-DIO-EGFP-tdTomato. The PCR-amplified DIO-EGFP-tdTomato was inserted into the XbaI and NotI sites of the pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-MCS plasmid to generate pZac2.1-GfaBC1D-DIO-EGFP-tdTomato plasmids. The PCR-amplified WPRE sequence from pFBAAV-CAG-XCaMP-R-WPRE (a gift from H. Bito12) was inserted into the NotI site of the resulting plasmid to generate pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-DIO-EGFP-tdTomato-WPRE plasmids. The plasmids were digested with NotI and AgeI, which removed the tdTomato sequence, and a PCR-amplified mScarlet-I sequence (Addgene #98816) was incorporated, and the resulting plasmids were digested with XhoI and KpnI, which removed the EGFP sequence, and the mNG sequence from Addgene #99135 was ligated using DNA ligation kit (Takara) to generate pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-mScarlet-I-WPRE plasmids. The mScarlet-I sequence was removed with restriction enzymatic digestion with PspOMI and NotI to generate pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-WPRE plasmids. The PCR-amplified hM4Di-mCherry sequence from Addgene #92286 was cloned into the PmeI site of pAAV-RAM-d2TTA::TRE-MCS-WPRE (Addgene #63931) to generate pAAV-RAM-d2TTA::TRE-hM4Di-mCherry-WPRE plasmids. pAAV-GfaABC1D-Flag-mAdrb1-WPRE, pAAV-GfaABC1D-mGrm3-mCherry-WPRE, pAAV-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A), pAAV-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK, pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A), pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK pAAV-Fos-FlpoERT2 and pAAV-GfaABC1D-FRT-mNG plasmids were designed by the authors and constructed by VectorBuilder. The PCR-amplified DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A) and DIO-Lck-mcherry-iβARK sequence from pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A) and pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK was clone into the EcoRI site of pAAV-GfaABC1D-MCS-4x6T-WPRE (Addgene #196417) to generate pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A)-4x6T and pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK-4x6T. pAAV-GfaABC1D-mGrm3-mCherry-WPRE was digested with EcoNI and AccI to remove mGrm3-mCherry, and PCR-amplified mGrm3 was cloned back to the backbone to generate AAV-GfaABC1D-mGrm3-WPRE plasmids. The PCR-amplified XCaMP-Gf-WPRE from the pFBAAV-CAG-XCaMP-Gf-WPRE plasmid (a gift from H. Bito75) was cloned into the NcoI and HindIII site of pAAV-hSyn1-cyto-mRuby3-iATPSnFR1.0 (Addgene #102557) to generate pAAV-hSyn1-XCaMP-Gf-WPRE plasmids. The mCherry-CAAX sequence digested with EcoRI of the pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-mCherry-CAAX plasmid (a gift from T. Takano76) was ligated into the EcoRI and EcoRV the resultant plasmids to generate pAAV-hSyn1-mCherry-CAAX-WPRE plasmids. All constructs were sequenced before use. All our constructs have been deposited to Addgene in the Nagai Lab repository for unrestricted distribution (http://www.addgene.org/Jun_Nagai, Supplementary Table 4).

Recombinant AAVs were generated by triple transfection of AAVpro 293T cells (Clontech, 632273) using polyethylenimine (PEI; Polysciences inc., 24765-100). Cells were cultured up to 50–70% confluency in DMEM (Gibco, 11995073) with FBS (Cosmo Bio, CCP-FBS-BR-500) and 0.1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, 15240062). The plasmids and PEI were mixed with Opti-MEM (31985-088) and kept for 5 min at room temperature. The mixture was combined with a DNA mix which contained pAAV Capsids, pHelper (Agilent Technologies, 240071-54) and pAAV transgenes. All these plasmids had a concentration of 4.2 μg per dish. The DNA mix was then applied with PEI/Opti-MEM, and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Then, this solution was added to the cells and incubated for 24 h. After incubation, the medium was changed to DMEM with 2% FBS and 0.1% antibiotic-antimycotic. Viral particles were collected from the medium at 120 h post-transfection. Cell pellets were centrifuged (3,500 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was filtered by Setricup (Merc, S2HVU02RE) and pellets were resuspended in FBS-free DMEM and freeze-thawed three times. In the case of PHP.eB capsid virus production, the supernatant was resuspended in DMEM and fractured by harshly pipetting. Thawed pellets were centrifuged (3,500 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) again and the supernatant was filtered by Setricup (Merc, S2HVU02RE). Media containing viral particles were centrifuged (22,000 rpm, 2 h, 4 °C) by Optima XE-100 (Beckman Coulter, A94516). The pellets were collected with 10–50 μl PBS and clarified by centrifugation (4,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant-containing viral particles were stored at 4 °C. AAV titre was analysed by quantitative PCR (QuantStudio 12 K; Applied Biosystems) using primers designed to selectively bind AAV2 inverted terminal repeats (forward: 5′-AACATGCTACGCAGAGAGGGAGTGG-3′, reverse: 5′-CATGAGACAAGGAACCCCTAGTGATGGAG-3′).

All surgical procedures were conducted under general anaesthesia using continuous isoflurane (induction at 5%, maintenance at 1.5% to 2% vol/vol). Depth of anaesthesia was monitored continuously and adjusted when necessary. Intravenous administration of AAV-PHP.eB (50 µl to deliver 2.5 × 1012 genome copies (GCs) per mouse) was performed by injection into the retro-orbital sinus of TRAP2 mice. Two weeks after AAV-PHP.eB GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-WPRE or AAV-PHP.eBGfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-mScaret-I-WPRE injections, mice were administered 4-OHT for inducing Cre recombination under the Fos promoter (Fos tagging) and then returned to their home cage until they were euthanized 7 days after tagging. In some cases, Fos tagging was performed using the FLP–FRT system (fDIO), and mice were euthanized one day after tagging. For stereotaxic microinjection of AAVs, mice were fitted into a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments) with their heads secured by blunt ear bars and their noses placed into a veterinary grade anaesthesia and ventilation system (VetEquip 911103). The surgical incision site was then cleaned with 70% ethanol (vol/vol). Craniotomies (1–2 mm in diameter) were made powered by a high-speed drill at specific coordinates based on the bregma position. Bilateral viral injections were conducted using a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments) to guide the placement of beveled glass pipettes (World Precision Instruments, 1B100-4) into the regions of interest: the basolateral amygdala (anterior–posterior (AP): −1.48 mm, medial–lateral (ML): 3.3 mm, dorsal–ventral (DV): 5.00 mm to bregma) and LC (AP: −5.4 mm, ML: 0.85 mm, DV: 3.7 mm to bregma). Total of 0.3 μl of AAV was delivered at 0.1 μl min−1 using a syringe pump (SmartTouch Pump, World Precision Instruments). The glass pipette was withdrawn 5–10 min after the infusion to prevent the backflow. Mice were then sutured, returned to their home cage, and allowed to rest for at least two to three weeks before any assessments were conducted. AAV titres (GCs per ml) were adjusted with sterile saline to deliver the indicated genome copies into the regions of interest: AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-WPRE (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-hM3Dq-mCherry (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/DJ8-RAM-d2TTA::TRE-hM4Di-WPRE (3.0 × 1013), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Flag-mAdrb1-WPRE (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/9-rTH-Cre (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/8-hSyn1-DIO-hM3Dq (1.0 × 1013), AAV2/8-hSyn1-DIO-hM4Di (1.0 × 1013), AAV2/8-hSyn1-DIO-mCherry (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/DJ8-Ef1a-hM3Dq (4.8 × 1011), AAV2/DJ8-Ef1a-hM4Di (4.0 × 1012), AAV2/5-hSyn1-mCherry-CAXX (3.0 × 1012) AAV2/9-hSyn1-GRABNE2h-WPRE (2.7 × 1012), AAV2/1 GfaABC1D-cAMPinG1-NE (1.3 × 1013), and AAV2/1 GfaABC1D-RCaMP3 (1.5 × 1013), GfaABC1D-GCaMP6f (1.1 × 1013), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-iβARK-mCherry (1.3 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-iβARK(D110A)-mCherry (1.3 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK (1.3 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A) (1.1 × 1013), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK-4x6T (3.0 × 1013), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A) (3.0 × 1013), AAV2/5-Fos-FlpoERT2 (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-fDIO-mNG (1.0 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre-4x6T (1.2 × 1013).

4-OHT (Sigma, H6278) was dissolved at 25 mg ml−1 in 100% ethanol with agitation at 37 °C for 15 min and was then aliquoted and stored at −20 °C for up to several weeks until use. Before use, 4-OHT was redissolved in ethanol by shaking at 37 °C for 15 min and corn oil (Sigma, 259853 and S5007) was added to give a final concentration of 3 mg ml−1 4-OHT. The ethanol was evaporated by incubation at 50 °C. The final 3 mg ml−1 4-OHT solutions were always used on the day they were prepared. All 4-OHT injections were delivered intraperitoneally at 50 mg kg−1 2–4 weeks after AAV injection into TRAP2 mice for inducing Cre recombination under the Fos promoter.

CNO (Tocris, 4936) was administered intraperitoneally 0.5 h before the initiation of behavioural assessments. CNO was administered intraperitoneally 20 min before 4-OHT intraperitoneal injection. Propranolol (MedChemExpress, HY-B0573) was dissolved in dH2O at 100 mM and stored at −20 °C. The final solutions were always used on the day they were prepared.

Mice were placed on doxycycline (40 mg kg−1, Bio-Serv, F4159) chow 24 h prior to and for at least 1 week after viral injection, switched to doxycycline-free chow 48 h before recall, and euthanized 24 h later. IGFBP2 antibody was infused bilaterally through implanted guide cannulas targeting basolateral amygdala. Infusions were performed using an internal cannula connected to a 10-µl Hamiltion syringe. One microgram of IGFBP2 antibody (1 mg ml−1, 1 µl per site) was infused into mice immediately after a fear recall paradigm at 400 nl min−1 using a syringe pump (SmartTouch Pump, World Precision Instruments).

Mice were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for fixation. The dissected brains were post-fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% PFA in PBS, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS. The brains were embedded with OCT compound (Sakura Finetek Japan, 4583) and sliced into coronal sections with a thickness of 50 μm at −20 °C using cryostat (CryoStar NX70, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 956960). The sections were washed with PBS 3 times for 5 min each and stored in 50% glycerol (Fujifilm, 075-00616) in PBS at −20 °C. For staining with c-Fos antibody, the sections were permeabilized with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 (Nacalai tesque, 35501), incubated at room temperature for 3 h, and then incubated with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1% normal donkey serum (NDS, Sigma-Aldrich, D9663) at room temperature for 1 h for blocking, and then incubated at 4 °C overnight in blocking buffer. With the following primary antibodies, Triton X-100 was used at 0.1% for permeabilization and PBS containing 1% NDS was used for blocking and antibody reactions: rat anti-GFAP (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 13-0300), mouse anti-S100β (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich, S2532), goat-Sox9 (1:100, R&D systems, AF3075) mouse anti-RFP (1:500, MBL, M155-3), rabbit anti-RFP (1:500, Rockland, 600-401-379), mouse anti-NET (1:2,000, MAb technologies, NET05-2) and rabbit anti-c-Fos (1:5,000, Synaptic Systems, 226003). After washing with PBS 3 times for 10 min each, the sections were incubated at room temperature for 2 h in blocking buffer with the following secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rat, Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-chicken, Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-goat, Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-chicken (1:1,000, Abcam, ThermoFisher and Jackson ImmunoResearch). The sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight in blocking buffer with secondary antibodies when staining with anti-c-Fos antibody. After washing with PBS 3 times for 10 min each, the sections were mounted on slides (Fluoromount-G, Southern bio, 0100-35) and visualized under a confocal laser microscope (Olympus, FV3000) and a fluorescent microscope (Olympus, VS200). Immunoreactivities were analysed using ImageJ software (NIH). The numbers of c-Fos+ neurons (Fig. 5o and Extended Data Fig. 8b) and astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 4b) were quantified based on a consistent c-Fos intensity threshold for each experiment. This threshold was defined such that the number of c-Fos+ neurons or astrocytes corresponded to the values previously reported18,42,77. Number of cells, field of views, sections and mice used in each analysis is listed in the main text and/or figure legends accordingly.

Mice were singly housed in a light-proof chamber for 48 h. On the day of tagging, mice were exposed to 1 h of light inside the chamber and injected intraperitoneally with 50 mg kg−1 4-OHT either 24 h, 12 h, 6 h or 3 h before or 0 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h or 24 h after the termination of light exposure. Mice were returned to the dark chamber for an additional two days and then returned to a regular light-dark cycle until the time of euthanasia seven days after tagging.

Behavioural tests were performed during the light cycle between 07:00 and 19:00. Temperature and humidity of the experimental rooms were maintained at 23 ± 2 °C and 55 ± 5%, respectively. Background noise (55 dB) was generated by a white noise generator (Ohara). All the experimental mice were transferred to the behaviour testing room at least 1 h before the tests to acclimatize to the environment and to reduce stress. Mice were habituated by freely exploring the conditioning chamber (CtxA) that consisted of a square partition (30 × 30 × 15 cm; 100 lux and no odour) with a grid floor wired to a shock generator (Ohara) for 15 min per day for 3 days. On the fourth day, they were either fear conditioned (1 time or 3 times shock; 2 s, 0.3 mA) (FC group) or presented with no shocks (NoFC group) in the conditioning chamber. One day after the conditioning, mice were either returned to CtxA for 3 min for fear memory recall (FR group) or kept in their home cages (NoFR group). Freezing durations exceeding 70% in the conditioned chamber 1 day post-conditioning with 3 foot shocks or exceeding 50% 1 day post-conditioning with a single foot shock, are considered indicative of sufficient conditioning. All the experimental mice received intraperitoneal injections of 4-OHT (50 mg kg−1) immediately after the task for Fos tagging. Freezing was automatically measured throughout the testing trial by the TimeFZ4 software (version 2021_7_29, Ohara) and subsequently processed by a blinded investigator. The chambers were cleaned with 70% ethanol between tests. In some cases, 10 mg kg−1 Propranolol (MedChemExpress, HY-B0573) was administered by intraperitoneal injection to mice 0.5 h before, and 2.5 h and 5.5 h after 4-OHT-based Fos tagging in order to block β-adrenergic signalling throughout the tagging timeframe. In some experiments using DREADDs, mice were injected with CNO (1 mg kg−1) 10 min before the task in CtxA. For experiments in Fig. 2n in which CNO was used for silencing neuronal activity or propranolol was used for antagonizing β-adrenoreceptor signalling to test their roles in astrocyte Fos induction during fear memory recall, both were administered with consideration of their pharmacokinetics. Propranolol was given both before and after the behavioural session to ensure effective β-receptor blockade throughout the several-hour Fos-tagging window (Extended Data Fig. 3), given its short half-life78 (~1.5–2 h), whereas CNO was given once before the session owing to its prolonged effect79 (>6 h). Freezing was measured for 3 min in the CtxB chamber, which consisted of a rhombic partition (30 cm × 60 cm × 15 cm, 10 lux and 1% acetic acid odour) with a flat floor (Ohara).

Mice were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with PBS, followed by 4% PFA in PBS for fixation of brain tissues. The dissected brains were post-fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% PFA in PBS and stored in PBS at 4 °C until embedding. To oxidize agarose, 2.25 g agarose (A6013, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 100 ml of 10 mM sodium periodate (S1878, Sigma-Aldrich)/50 mM phosphate buffer and stirred gently for 2.5 h at room temperature in the dark. The oxidized agarose was filtered on a bottle-top vacuum filter (0.2 μm, 569-0020, Thermo Scientific) washed 3 times with phosphate buffer and resuspended in 50 ml of phosphate buffer to make 4.5% oxidized agarose solution. The oxidized agarose solution was boiled with a microwave oven to melt the agarose and kept at 60–65 °C. The brains were pat-dried and embedded in oxidized agarose solution with a plastic mould (18646A, Polysciences). For covalent crosslinking between oxidized agarose and the surface of the brain, borate/borohydride solution was prepared the day before use by adding 0.2 g sodium borohydride (452882, Sigma-Aldrich) in 100 ml of prewarmed (40 °C) borate buffer (50 mM borax, 221732, Sigma-Aldrich; 50 mM boric acid, B6768, Sigma-Aldrich; pH 9.0–9.5) in the chemical fume hood. The agarose block was removed from the mould, soaked in borate/borohydride solution to initiate crosslinking and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The block was washed and kept in phosphate buffer at 4 °C until imaging.

The agarose block was mounted on a glass slide using Loctite 401 glue immediately before imaging. STPT was performed with the TissueCyte 1400FC system (TissueVision) equipped with Coherent Chameleon Ultra II laser (Coherent) or Spectra-Physics Insight X3+ laser (MKS Spectra-Physics) and a Nikon 16× water-immersion objective (MRP07220, NA: 0.8). The laser wavelength was tuned at 1,000 nm. Brains were coronally sectioned with a built-in vibrating microtome at 50-μm thickness with a frequency of 60 Hz and a speed of 0.5 mm s−1. Four optical z-planes were taken at 50 μm, 62.5 μm, 75 μm and 87.5 μm below the cut surface of the tissue block. To scan an entire coronal plane, individual tile images were acquired (832 × 832 pixels per frame, resolution at 1.382 μm per pixel) by moving the stage between each tile. Following the full scanning of a coronal plane, a 50-μm section was cut away by vibrating microtome and imaging of a new cut surface repeated to acquire optical sections covering the entire brain from the caudal to the rostral side (~320 coronal sections). The raw image tiles were first trimmed and subjected to flat field correction, then stitched into 2D mosaic coronal section images using the Autostitcher software (TissueVision). The signals from the green channel (500–550 nm, mNG signal) and from the far-red channel (>600 nm, background) were simultaneously acquired, and the latter was used to subtract background from the green channel to enhance the signal to noise ratio. Each region of the whole brain was aligned and segmented according to the Mouse Brain Atlas (NeuroInfo, MBL Bioscience, BN-200). Owing to the high quality preservation of tissue architecture during imaging, we semi-automatically performed alignment to a standard mouse brain atlas, segmentation of 839 brain regions, and detection of single Fos-tagged mNG astrocytes (BAEs), defined by their territories that typically displayed diameters of approximately 40 to 60 μm with ~10-µm-wide cell bodies68 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). Consistent with our intersectional genetic approach, we rarely observed neuron-like mNG-positive cells, with larger cell bodies (>~20-μm diameter) and elongated processes (>~50-μm). We only found these cells in regions nearby ventricles and the midline where well-characterized GFAP-positive neural progenitor cells reside48,80, and they were excluded in subsequent analyses. As a result, using this brain-wide analysis approach we successfully quantified the density of BAEs in 677 brain regions that accounted for 80.7% of the whole brain.

To observe correlation between Fos+ astrocytes and neurons, we used the same TRAP2 (Fos-iCreERT2) system28 used by Roy et al.5, but instead with a Cre-dependent mNG reporter expressed in Fos+ astrocytes, allowing comparison of Fos+ cell counts from anatomically matched regions between studies. The regions of interest were first narrowed to the 117 engram-signifiant regions defined by Roy et al. Then, to ensure analysis of bona fide astrocyte-tagged regions, areas with possible neuronal leakage (mNG+ neuron-like cells), particularly near ventricles were excluded (see above). In addition, high-level hierarchical structure areas (such as midbrain or thalamus) with extremely high total counts that skew correlation analysis were also excluded. In the end, this selection yielded 75 regions for subsequent correlational analyses. Changes in Fos+ astrocyte numbers (FC–NoFC and FR–NoFC) were calculated using the non-foot shocked control group as the baseline, consistent with Roy et al. Supplementary table 1 from Roy et al. provided region-by-region counts of Fos+ neurons in non-foot shocked controls, FC and FR groups, enabling us to extract the corresponding changes in Fos+ neuron numbers for each of the 75 regions. Pearson correlation analyses between these neuronal and astrocytic Fos+ cell count changes were performed.

For image visualization in 3D, low-resolution image stacks were created across all four channels. These stacks were downsampled to 25 μm per pixel resolution in the x and y axes, while the inter-slice distance was maintained at 50 μm, resulting in a voxel resolution of 25 × 25 × 50 μm3. To minimize high-frequency artifacts, median filtering and Gaussian smoothing were applied to the coronal images prior to downscaling. The processed 3D image stacks were stored in the NIfTI format, and the world coordinates were adjusted to align roughly with the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework v.3 (CCFv3)81. For registration to the CCFv3, the Allen STP-1675 template (filename: P56_Atlas.nii.gz; available at https://scalablebrainatlas.incf.org/mouse/ABA_v3#downloads) was used as the reference image. This template, generated from STPT averaged over 1,675 specimens, was combined with corresponding atlas annotations (filename: P56_Annotation.nii.gz). Image alignment was performed using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs)82. An affine registration was first applied at 3 scales (downscaling factors of 4, 2 and 1) with Gaussian smoothing of 2, 1 and 1 voxels and 250, 200 and 50 iterations, respectively. This was followed by deformable (SyN) registration at four scales (downscaling factors of 8, 4, 2 and 1) with Gaussian smoothing of 4, 2, 1 and 1 voxels and 1,000, 500, 100 and 50 iterations, respectively, using mutual information as the metric. After computing the transformation, individual image stacks and atlas labels were mapped to and from the CCFv3 image space. After aligning with the NIfTI world coordinates, cell positions were mapped to the Allen template using the antsApplyTransformsToPoints function from ANTs. Brain regions from the Allen atlas annotations were then assigned to individual cells based on their locations in the CCFv3 image space.

Astrocyte primary cultures were obtained as previously described with some modifications83. In brief, cerebral cortical tissues were isolated from P0–P1 neonatal mice and dissociated with a scalpel, gently agitated in 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, 25300-054), and rapidly strained with a Falcon 100 µm cell strainer (352360). Dissociated cells were seeded at a rate of four brains per bottle on poly-d-lysine-coated bottles. The cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, 11995073) supplemented with FBS (Cosmo Bio, CCP-FBS-BR-500) and penicillin-streptomycin. When the cells reached confluence after several weeks, the culture bottles were gently shaken at 120 rpm overnight at 37 °C to remove non-astrocytic cells. Astrocytes were then detached using Trypsin-EDTA, replated onto poly-d-lysine-coated bottles, and after 1–2 weeks, cultures were shaken again at 120 rpm for 4 h. Astrocytes were then re-seeded on coverslips in 12-well plates at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells per well, which were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, with the medium being changed every 2 to 3 days.

Five days after re-seeding, primary astrocytes were incubated with tetrodotoxin (TTX at 1 µM, Fujifilm, 207-15901) to eliminate the potential effect of neuronal firing, for at least 5 min to allow adequate equilibration, together with the following inhibitors, blockers or chelators indicated for each experiment unless otherwise described: prazosin hydrochloride (MedChemExpress, HY-B0193A), atipamezole hydrochloride (Tokyo Chemical Industry, A2956), propranolol hydrochloride (MedChemExpress, HY-B0573), BAPTA-AM (SIGMA, A1076), and SQ 22536 (Tokyo chemical industry, Q0105). The cultures were then incubated with the following growth factors, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators or neuropeptides in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 1.5 h: l-glutamic acid monosodium salt hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, G5889), GABA (Sigma-Aldrich, A2129), ATP disodium salt hydrate from yeast (Nacalai tesque, 01072-24), l-noradrenaline hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, 74480), dopamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, H8502), acetylcholine chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, A6625), serotonin hydrochloride (Alfa Aesar, B21263.03), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, Fujifilm, 028-16451), neurotrophin-3 (Fujifilm, 146-09231, 50 ng ml−1), neurotrophin-4 (Fujifilm, 142-06634, 100 ng ml−1), forskolin (Fujifilm, 067-02191, 10 μM), nerve growth factor-β (NGFβ, Fujifilm, 141-07601, 100 ng ml−1), epidermal growth factor (EGF, Fujifilm, 059-07873, 100 ng ml−1), PDGF-AA (Fujifilm, 163–19731, 100 ng ml−1), PDGF-BB (Fujifilm, 164–24031, 100 ng ml−1), Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF, Fujifilm, 032-23501, 100 ng ml−1), IGF1 (Fujifilm, 099-04511, 100 ng ml−1). The following agonist and ionophore were used: isoproterenol (MedChemExpress, HY-B0468) and ionomycin (LKT laboratories, I5752). Ninety minutes after incubation, primary astrocytes were fixed in 4% PFA (Nacalai Tesque) for 10 min, washed with PBS 3 times, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Nacalai Tesque) for 10 min and blocked with 1% NDS (Sigma-Aldrich, D9663) for 30 min. Primary astrocytes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-c-Fos (1:1,000, Synaptic Systems, 226003), rat anti-GFAP (1:1,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 13-0300), rabbit anti-IBA1 (1:1,000, Fujifilm, 019-19741), chicken anti-TUJ1 (1:1,000 Novus Biologicals, NB100-1612), mouse anti-OLIG2 (1:100, Millipore, MABN50). The cultures were washed 3 times in PBS for 10 min each, then incubated with DAPI (1:10,000, Sigma-Aldrich, D9542) and the following secondary antibodies (1:1,000) in PBS containing 1% NDS for 1 h at room temperature: Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rat (abcam, ab150153), Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-mouse (abcam, ab175700), Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit (Abcam, ab175692), Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit (abcam, ab150067), Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-chicken (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 703-605-155). Fluorescent images were taken using a 20× objective lens (UPlanXApo 20×, Olympus) with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus, FV3000 with Fluoview). Immunoreactivity quantification of c-Fos was performed using ImageJ. The c-Fos brightness of GFAP-positive astrocytes were measured by the intensity of ROIs that encompassed the cell nuclei. In some experiments involving a heterologous expression of mGluR3, we applied AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Grm3 (800,000 multiplicity of infection) 5 h after re-seeding for expressing mGluR3 in primary astrocytes and incubated for 5 days before pharmacological experiments. Ninety minutes after stimulation with 0.1 µM NA and/or 100 µM glutamate in the presence of 1 µM TTX, primary astrocytes were fixed and stained as described above using primary antibodies: rabbit anti-mGluR3 (1:500, abcam, ab166608) and mouse anti-c-Fos (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc166940). It is noteworthy that the mouse anti-c-Fos antibody, different from the rabbit anti-c-Fos antibody used in other experiments, exhibited overall low immunoreactivity. However, this did not affect the quantification of c-Fos mobilization. Fluorescent imaging and quantification of c-Fos intensity were performed as described above.

AAVs for expressing the noradrenaline biosensor GRABNE2h on the neuronal cell surface, or calcium indicator RCaMP3 in astrocytes with cAMP sensor cAMPinG1 in astrocytes were unilaterally injected into the basolateral amygdala. Optical fibres were implanted above the injection site two weeks post-injection to capture emission of fluorescence signals, with recordings conducted one week after fibre implantation. For fluorescence signal collection, mice were tethered to a patch cable, and a 465 nm LED light (Doric, 40–50 µW at the tip of patch cable) or a 560 nm LED light (Doric, 40–50 µW at the tip of patch cable) was used to excite the signal, with an isosbestic 405 nm LED light used to correct for movement artifacts. Mice tethered to the patch cable were habituated in a testing chamber for 5 min on the day of recording. A time-division multiplexing scheme was used, where the 465 nm, 560 nm and 405 nm LED lights were emitted alternately at 20 Hz (turned on for 24 ms and off for 26 ms), with the timing precisely controlled by a programmable pulse generator (Master-9, AMPI). Each excitation light was reflected by a dichroic mirror and coupled into an optical fibre cable (Doric, 200 μm in diameter, 2 m in length, NA 0.57) through a pinhole (200 μm in diameter). The fluorescence signals were detected by a photomultiplier tube with a GaAsP photocathode (H16722-40; Hamamatsu Photonics) and digitized by a data acquisition module (USB-6341, National Instruments). A custom-written LabVIEW program extracted signals at a sampling frequency of 1 kHz in real time. Fluorescence signals collected during each light pulse were averaged, after dropping the first and last 2 samples (1 ms each) to eliminate potential noise caused during the alternation of LED lights. The data were smoothed using moving average and corrected for bleaching correction by fitting to least-squares linear. The fluorescence response was calculated (fitted 465 + 1)/(fitted 405 + 1) − baseline. The baselines of GRABNE2h and astrocyte cAMPinG1 signals were identified during periods of no spontaneous signals in home cages for 1–2 min before the context exposure. Signal analyses were performed in Python (v.3.0.0) using JupyterLab (v.3.6.7, Project Jupyter). Numerical computations and data handling were conducted using NumPy84 (v.1.26.4) and Pandas (v.2.1.4, NumFOCUS). The area under the curve of fluorescence traces was calculated with scikit-learn (sklearn, v.1.2.2, RRID:SCR_002577), and half-decay times of signal responses were extracted. Astrocytic RCaMP3 signals were bandpass filtered between 0.0003 and 1 Hz with SciPy85 (v.1.11.4). Peaks of Ca2+ signals were defined as data points exceeding 4× s.d. above the baseline mean, with baseline noise estimated from ≥20 s intervals lacking spontaneous activity in home cage recordings before context exposure. Signal traces were visualized with Matplotlib86 (v.3.8.0).

Coronal amygdalar slices were prepared from adult mice with AAV injection26,87. In brief, animals were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated with sharp shears. The brains were placed and sliced in ice-cold modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing the following (in mM): 194 sucrose, 30 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4 and 10 d-glucose, saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. A vibratome (DSK NLS-MT) was used to cut 300-µm brain sections. The slices were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at 32–34 °C in normal ACSF containing (in mM); 124 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4 and 10 d-glucose continuously bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Slices were then stored at 21–23 °C in the same buffer until use. All slices were used within 2–6 h of slicing. Cells for all the experiments were imaged with a 16× water-immersion objective lens (Nikon, N16XLWD-PF, MRP07220, NA: 0.8) with Nikon two-photon laser-scanning microscope (A1R MP) equipped with a 920 nm wavelength laser (Alcor, Spark Lasers). To image GCaMP6f signals, astrocytes located in the LA/B and typically ∼20 to ∼30 µm below the slice surface were selected for imaging. Images were acquired at 1 frame per second. Slices were maintained in ACSF (124 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM d-glucose and 2.0 mM CaCl2) through a perfusion system. Phenylephrine (PE, Tocris Bioscience 2838) was applied in the bath in the presence of 300 nM tetrodotoxin (Cayman Chemical 14964) were applied in the bath at least 5 min prior to recording to allow adequate equilibration. A constant flow of fresh buffer perfused the imaging chamber at all times. Spontaneous Ca2+ activity was recorded for 3 min (0 µM PE), followed by a 2-minute bath application of 1 µM PE, a 5-min washout, a 2-min application of 3 µM PE, and a 5-min washout. Ca2+ signals were processed in ImageJ (NIH) and presented as the relative change in fluorescence (ΔF/F).

Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane 90 min after the initiation of behavioural paradigms and transcardially perfused with PBS (30 ml for 2 min). The amygdala was freshly dissected out using a Brain Matrix (Ted Pella, 15067) and was placed into cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (14025092, Gibco) containing 10 mM HEPES (17514-15, Naclai Tesque), 0.54% glucose (16806-25, Naclai Tesque), 5.0 µg ml−1 actinomycin D (A1410, Sigma-Aldrich), 10 µM triptolide (T3652, Sigma-Aldrich) and 27.1 µg ml−1 anisomycin (A9789, Sigma-Aldrich), as previously described88,89. Then, the tissue block was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 3 ml enzyme solution (HBSS, 10 mM HEPES, 0.54% glucose, 0.5 mM EDTA (15575020, Invitrogen), 1.0 mM l-cysteine (10309-41, Naclai Tesque), 5.0 µg ml−1 actinomycin D, 10 µM triptolide and 27.1 µg ml−1 anisomycin) containing 20 U papain per mouse (LS003127, Worthington Biochemical). The tissue was then homogenized by passing through a 18 G needle and was further incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Following homogenization using a 20 G needle, the resulting cell suspension was centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. The homogenate was separated by gradient centrifugation with 30% Percoll (P1644, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS at 500g for 25 min at 4 °C (no brake). The pellet containing astrocytes at the bottom of the tube was then collected and washed once with PBS containing 2% FBS and 10 mM EDTA before staining. Fc receptors were blocked with Fc block (2.4G2, BD Bioscience) for 10 min at 4 °C before incubation with primary antibodies. Cells were stained with antibodies directed against CD11b-BV786 (1:200, M1/70, BD Bioscience), CD45-APC-Cy7 (1:200, 30-F11, BioLegend), O1-eFluor660 (1:200, 50-6506-82, eBioscience) and ASCA2-PE-Cy7 (1:200, 130-116-246, Miltenyi Biotec) for 40 min at 4 °C. Additionally, cells were treated with hashtag antibodies to label source samples (TotalSeqB0301-B0310, B0312 and B0314, BioLegend). After washing, cells were sorted using a CytoFLEX SRT (Beckman Coulter). Data were acquired with CytExpert software (Beckman Coulter). Post-acquisition analysis was performed using FlowJo software, version 10.9.0. Single-cell libraries were generated and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer. Sequence reads were processed and aligned to the mouse genome (mm10, GENCODE vM23/Ensembl98; https://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A.tar.gz) using CellRanger 3.0. Initially, genes expressed in <3 cells and cells with <100 genes and mitochondrial reads <6% were excluded from the analysis. Pericytes were removed from amygdalar cells based on Pdgfrb. Hashtag oligos (HTOs) were demultiplexed using HTODemux and singlet cells were used for subsequent analysis. Principal component analysis was performed on the expression data matrix using the Seurat. Thirty principal components were used for generating tSNE plots. Transcriptomic clusters were identified from a total 1,903 amygdalar astrocytes with resolution set to 0.4. Differentially expressed gene candidates from a comparison of Adrb1-positive and Adrb1-negative astrocytes were estimated using Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test.

Cryosections were prepared as described above and stored at −80 °C. RNAscope in situ hybridization was performed using RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v.2 with TSA Vivid Dyes (ACDBio, 323270), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sections were washed for 5 min with PBS, and then heated at 60 °C for 30 min before post-fix. After dehydration in an ethanol series, hydrogen peroxide was applied for 10 min at room temperature. The sections were washed with ddH2O twice, and then incubated in Target Retrieval Reagents for 5 min at 90–100 °C. A wash with ddH2O for 15 s was followed by a dehydration with 100% ethanol for 3 min and dried at room temperature. Then, the sections were incubated with Protease III for 30 min at 40 °C. The sections were washed with ddH2O twice and then incubated with probes Mm-Fos (ACDBio, 316921), Mm-Adra1a (ACDBio, 408611), Mm-Adrb1-C2 (ACDBio, 449761-C2), Mm-Igfbp2 (ACDBio, 405951) and Mm-Slc1a3-C3 (ACDBio, 430781-C3) for 2 h at 40 °C. Thereafter, the sections were washed twice with wash buffer for 2 min between incubations at 40 °C. The sections were incubated in AMP1 for 30 min, AMP2 for 30 min and AMP3 for 15 min at 40 °C, then incubated in horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 15 min, fluorophore for 30 min and HRP-blocker for 15 min at 40 °C for each channel. In the staining of mCherry, slices were washed in 0.1 M PBS 3 times for 10 min each, followed by immunohistochemistry that was performed as described above. Following primary and secondary antibodies used: rabbit anti-RFP (1:250, Rockland, 600-401-379), Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit (1:1,000, Abcam, ab175692). Finally, the sections were incubated with DAPI at room temperature, removed DAPI, and mounted in Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen, P36934). Images were obtained in the same way as immunohistochemistry described above except with a step size of 0.5 µm. Images were processed with ImageJ. Astrocyte somata were delineated using Slc1a3 signals. The intensity of Fos, Adra1a, Adrb1 and Igfbp2 signals within the somata were measured. To account for differences in somata sizes, the signals were normalized using Slc1a3. Subsequently, the normalized signals were z-scored within each sample to evaluate gene expression across a heterogeneous cell population. This approach facilitated the robust identification of cells exhibiting high gene expression relative to the population mean. In Fig. 4e,f, adrenoreceptor-positive cells were identified based on scRNA-seq data, selecting the top 50% of cells ranked by Adra1a expression and the top 20% of cells ranked by Adrb1 expression. Co-expression index of Adra1a and Adrb1, calculated by relative expression level of Adra1a to NoFC median multiplied by relative expression level of Adrb1 for each cell. In Fig. 4j, the correlation analysis of Fos and Adrb1, expression levels were evaluated using z-scores of RNAscope signal intensity to assess gene expression across a heterogeneous population of cells, enabling robust identification of cells with high gene expression relative to the population mean. Specifically, we identified astrocytes with z-scores greater than 2 in RNAscope Fos signal intensity as Fos-high astrocytes, capturing 3% of the astrocyte population with significantly elevated Fos expression, consistent with scRNA-seq data in Fig. 4c where Fos-positive astrocytes occupied 4% of the total astrocytes analysed. Similarly, Adrb1-high astrocytes were identified using z-scores greater than 0.5, capturing 26% of astrocytes, also in line with scRNA-seq data in Fig. 4c where Adrb1-positive astrocytes occupied 20% of the total astrocytes analysed. In addition, Igfbp2-high astrocytes were identified using z-scores greater than 0.5, capturing 24% of all astrocytes in Extended Data Fig. 12d,e, which is consistent with scRNA-seq data indicating that Igfbp2-positive astrocytes occupy 24% of the total astrocytes analysed.

Most statistical tests were run in Prism 10.1.2 (GraphPad). The specific tests used are indicated in the figure legends and Supplementary Table 1. All tests were two-sided unless otherwise noted. Astrocyte Fos count analyses across groups for each brain region were run with R v.4.3.2 on RStudio v.2023.12.1.402 and relied on the tidyverse, car, dunn.test and dplyr packages and base R functions aov(), TukeyHSD() and p.adjust(). The data were first analysed with Levene's test for homogeneity of variance. Brain regions that passed Levene's test (P > 0.05) were followed by a one-way ANOVA test with Tukey's honest significant difference test and regions that failed Levene's test (P < 0.05; no homogeneity of variances) were followed by the Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's post hoc test and Bonferroni adjustment. False discovery rates were calculated across groups and brain regions from post hoc P values using the Benjamini–Hochberg method.

Mice were randomly assigned to experimental groups, and mice assigned to different experimental conditions were run in parallel. Mouse experiments and analyses were done blinded to group allocation. Tissue samples that yielded insufficient cell counts (less than 30 cells) during scRNA-seq quality control were excluded from the study. The results of statistical comparisons, n numbers and P values are shown in the figure panels or figure legends along with averages. n is defined as the numbers of cells, sections or mice throughout on a case-by-case basis; the unit of analysis is stated in the text or in each figure legend.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","A New Road Safety Group Targets Self-Driving Cars","https://www.wired.com/story/road-safety-group-save-us-targets-self-driving-cars/","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

A new advocacy group is pushing state lawmakers to pass more stringent autonomous vehicle regulations. The group, Safe Autonomous Vehicles Everywhere in the United States (SAVE-US), says its goal is to ensure that new self-driving technology will save lives instead of doing harm. Its work has a clear target: Tesla.

The campaign, announced on Wednesday, counts among its goals passing legislation that would require tech developers to be clearer about the limits of their driving technology; report more specific and public crash information to states; and use multiple sensors on their vehicles. In the US, regulations governing autonomous vehicles are generally handled by the states, whose laws range from stringent (California) to relatively permissive (Arizona, Texas). Fourteen US states don't have autonomous-vehicle-related laws at all. The group will initially target lawmakers in large states, including Illinois, New York, and New Jersey, says Shua Sanchez, the group's national campaign director.

Sanchez and Bob Somers, SAVE-US's technical adviser, met this summer outside an administrative hearing in Oakland, California. Inside, attorneys for California's Department of Motor Vehicles argued that Tesla should temporarily lose its license to manufacture and sell vehicles in the state because, they alleged, the electric automaker had falsely advertised its Full Self-Driving and Autopilot driver assistance features.

Sanchez, a physicist, had been following Tesla closely since he got involved in the Tesla Takedown movement earlier this year, leading demonstrations outside of a showroom in Boston to protest CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Somers had worked as an engineer at the self-driving vehicle developer Zoox for half a decade. (He's since left the autonomous vehicle industry.)

In Oakland, they agreed: Autonomous vehicle technology has the potential to save lives. But rushing the technology, or confusing customers about its limits, is unsafe and could doom the whole project. (An administrative judge is due to decide on the Tesla case later this year.)

""It's fair to say that Tesla is the worst actor in this space, but that definitely doesn't mean every other company is a perfect actor either,” says Sanchez. “If we don't have good regulations in place, we leave the door open for any company to pursue an unsafe path.”

Unlike many of its competitors, which use pricier radars and lidars plus cameras, Tesla depends on vision-only software, arguing that more effective cameras and AI-trained software alone can safely pilot its vehicles. The tech strategy is at the center of one of Tesla's chief promises: That one day, the cars it has already manufactured will be able to completely drive themselves thanks to a quick software update. Competitors, including Waymo and Zoox, use more expensive and purpose-built robotaxis to pull off their autonomous rides. Last week, the US federal government said it had opened an investigation of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (Supervised) driver assistance software following reports that the feature, which is not autonomous and must be supervised by a driver behind the wheel, ran red lights and drove on the wrong side of the street.

“We want to encode the industry's best practices into a framework to make sure that developers aren't competing on safety,” says Somers, the former AV engineer. Safety, he means, should always be assumed with self-driving tech.

Tesla didn't respond to WIRED's request for comment.

SAVE-US declined to answer specific questions about its sources of funding. “SAVE-US is backed by a few funders who have an interest in autonomous vehicle technology and see a need for regulations right now,” says Jeff Coote, a spokesperson for the group.

The group does have links to political groups that have advocated for progressive causes and campaigns. Coote and SAVE-US executive director Sam Haass also work for Slingshot Strategies, a political consulting firm that mostly works with Democrats (though Coote notes the firm also works on bipartisan issues). Another firm with progressive links, Kinetic Strategies, worked on the advocacy group's website.

Coote says putting firmer guardrails on autonomous vehicle technology could be a winning political issue. “If you look at AI and data centers, for instance, people are upset and scared of being taken advantage of by big companies and getting screwed over,” he says. “The same can be said for AVs; people are open to the technology, but only if assured it is deployed safely.”

If you want to talk about perf in the context of a text editor show me how big of a file you can load--especially if the file has no line breaks. Emacs has trouble here. If you load a minified js file it slows to a crawl especially if syntax highlighting is on. Also show me how fast the start up time is. This is another area where Emacs does not do well.So Zed is available on Windows--but only if you have a x64 processor. Lots of people run Windows on Arm64 and I don't see any mention of Arm64. This is where the puck is heading.Also noticed Emacs key binding is in beta still.

Is this an alternative to nginx or something?

reply

A stand-out feature has been ACME support built-in, and it's a fairly capable reverse proxy. I've seen organizations use Caddy to provision certificates for customer domains at scale with very good results.

reply

Personally, I much prefer the way caddy does configuration / plugins (as someone reasonably conversant in how nginx does those things) - comparable to ""sysv init scripts vs systemd unit files"".

I was in charge of the electronic document management system of a university, and kept having issues with deleting pdf files after opening them. The error said the files were still in use, and exiting Acrobat didn't solve the issue either. Apparently, the background service keeps the file open to upload it, and I had to forcefully close open files just to delete pdf files.Acrobat is abusing a standard, portable document format, and trying to become synonymous with it, despite being very hostile against users.

What? They're just extending the portability by uploading the files to the cloud so you can view them from anywhere! /sI'm assuming/hoping that's all it is in whatever this uploading is. Did you find out why it was uploading files, and more importantly, where?

I worked on a PDF form that was distributed widely within a Gov department. It would be routinely saved locally and emailed half completed up the managerial chain for sign-off on the request.It had a lot of dynamic fields so you had to allow it to run macros.The first thing it did was check the version of the just opened form and replace it with the latest PDF from the department's server.It also had save/resume functionality which would only work in Acrobat Reader at the time.Edit: Shout out to Inkscape which I find is a handy replacement for Illustrator and doing minor fixes to PDFs.

Its a good start but some issues (on Win10 using the binary from releases) that became pretty apparent right off the bat. I took an instructables page[1], that on Windows I had used 'print to PDF' to print it from Firefox into one long PDF. Using 'j' to scroll down, stops at the end of the page but keeps pretending its going down so you end up down a bunch of virtual lines that don't exist, 'J' will move you to the next page but not to the top of the next page? Two copies of the same file (but from different places, one from the NAS and one from the local disk) open, then neither one of them rendered. The status line suggested they were on different pages but there was nothing on the screen.That said, it started quickly and time to first page render was fast (with a single file open). I tried it on a more conventional file (datasheet) and again with 'j' or 'k' it moves the page down or up and leave blank space where the page was, neither the next or previous pages are anywhere to be seen until you type 'J' or 'K'. That's a bit unintuitive.[1] https://www.instructables.com/HackerBox-0110-Synth/

Photographer Qingrong Yang was visiting Yundang Lake near his home in Fujian province, China, when he captured the stunning scene in the photo above.

Yang regularly goes to this lake to photograph feeding frenzies—when birds fly low over the surface to grab fish leaping to escape underwater predators. During this one, he snapped a photo at the exact moment a ladyfish snatched its prey right out from under a little egret's beak. It won Yang the Behavior: Birds category award in the 2025 Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition.

This annual contest, organized by the Natural History Museum in London, showcases the best wildlife photos of the year. Read on to see more of this year's jaw-dropping award winners.

Marine conservation photojournalist Shane Gross waited for several weeks to capture this rarely seen peppered moray eel behavior on D'Arros Island, Amirante, Seychelles. Peppered moray eels can hunt both above and below the water's surface and are well-adapted to the intertidal zone. These three were scavenging for dead fish when Gross spotted them and snapped a photo.

Photographer and biologist Javier Aznar González de Rueda explores the complex relationship between humans and rattlesnakes throughout the U.S. He spotted this black-tailed rattler on the road at night outside of Fort Davis, Texas. González took this picture as the snake raised its tail and began rattling to ward off the perceived threat of the snake handler who moved it from the road.

While hiking in the Lepini Mountains of central Italy, teenage wildlife photographer Andrea Dominzi stumbled upon abandoned machinery in an area once logged for beech trees. Soon, he realized he wasn't the only observer. A longhorn beetle of the species Morimus asper made the perfect subject for this photo. Framed as though the beetle is looking out over the disturbed patch of forest, tells a poignant story of habitat loss and hope for renewal.

Wildlife photographer Dennis Stogsdill had spent days searching for wild cats in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, when a call came over the radio. A caracal—a medium-sized wild cat known for its impressive leaping ability—had been spotted at Ndutu Lake. When Stogsdill arrived, he found the cat hunting lesser flamingos and took this striking photo of the hunter proudly displaying its catch.

Nature photographer Georgina Steytler spent years looking for the gum-leaf skeletonizer caterpillar, also known as the “mad hatterpillar.” While exploring Torndirrup National Park in Western Australia, she noticed eucalyptus trees with skeletonized leaves—a sign that the animal had been grazing there. Once she found her subject, she took this backlit image showcasing its bizarre headgear, made up of the old head capsules it keeps every time it sheds its skin.

Wildlife and nature photographer Luca Lorenz snapped this photo of a curious harbor seal popping its head above water off the archipelago of Heligoland, Germany. Lorenz minimized the lens aperture to bring the full expanse of the sea into focus and captured the texture of the ocean surface as rain pattered against it.

Post-doc researcher and wildlife photographer Quentin Martinez found this group of lesser tree frogs during a rainy night on Kaw Mountain in French Guiana. These vibrant frogs had gathered for a breeding event, producing short, shrill calls to attract mates. This species breeds only during heavy rainfall, assembling in huge numbers to mate for just a few hours.

Wildlife and landscape photographer Wim van den Heever is the overall winner of this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year awards—and the winner of the urban wildlife category—for this haunting image. It took Heever a decade to capture this perfectly framed image of a brown hyena standing before the dilapidated ruins of an abandoned mining town in Kolmanskop, near Luderitz, Namibia.

Brown hyenas are the rarest hyena species in the world, and their nocturnal, solitary nature makes them challenging subjects to photograph. They are known to pass through Kolmanskop on their way to hunt Cape fur seal pups or scavenge for carrion that washes ashore along the Namib Desert coast.

In 1950, famed astrophysicist Enrico Fermi posed a profound question during a casual lunch with colleagues: Where is everybody? In other words, if there's an extremely high probability that advanced alien civilizations exist somewhere, why haven't we found evidence of them?

That's how the story goes, at least. But regardless of the circumstances surrounding its utterance, that question—known today as the Fermi paradox—has captured the minds of researchers ever since. In a new paper, which has not yet been peer reviewed, astrophysicist Robin Cordet proposes “radical mundanity” as one possible explanation.

Cordet, a senior research scientist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who is based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, suggests the galaxy is home to a modest number of alien civilizations that aren't that much more advanced than our own. Because their technology is similarly limited, neither civilization can detect the other.

“The idea is that they're more advanced, but not much more advanced. It's like having an iPhone 42 rather than an iPhone 17,” Corbet told The Guardian. “This feels more possible, more natural, because it's not proposing anything very extreme.”

Calculations using the Drake Equation—a formula that estimates the number of civilizations in the Milky Way that are capable of transmitting radio signals—suggest a fair few should exist. Our civilization has been bleeding radio signals for decades, so we know the answer to the Drake Equation must be at least one. More radically, astrophysicists have proposed that it would take a relatively short amount of time, on astronomical timescales, for advanced civilizations to spread across the entire galaxy.

If aliens accomplished this feat, humanity should be able to detect their presence through a number of different technosignatures. These might include an artificial electromagnetic beacon, signs of astro-engineering such as heat emanating from Dyson spheres (hypothetical energy-harvesting megastructures built around stars), or extraterrestrial artifacts on Earth. So far, however, we haven't found any of these.

Astrophysicists have come up with many different hypotheses to explain this lack of evidence, also known as “the great silence.” Maybe intelligent extraterrestrials are just too advanced for humanity to detect them, or perhaps they choose to stay away from Earth? Maybe we really are alone in the galaxy after all? Or more pessimistically, maybe all sufficiently advanced civilizations end up destroying themselves.

To Corbet, these possibilities seemed extreme, so he decided to ask a different question: What if civilizations have a natural technological limit that stops them from becoming advanced enough to create detectable technosignatures or to detect us?

According to Corbet's hypothesis, humanity may be near the upper limit of technological progress. Alien civilizations could hit a similar plateau, never advancing far enough to easily detect or contact others.

This idea, known as the radical mundanity principle, suggests that alien societies aren't building massive space structures or traveling at light speed. Instead, they're probably a lot like us—and just as limited in their ability to find others in the galaxy. And they stay that way, eventually losing interest in cosmic exploration over time.

Even if this hypothesis is correct, that doesn't mean we'll never find evidence of an alien civilization. In his paper, Corbet explains that a technologically mundane world may still be detectable via leakage radiation, and such a discovery “may not be too far off” if radio telescopes continue to advance.

But don't get too excited. “Although this would have profound implications in many ways, it may not lead to a huge gain in our technology level, and could leave us somewhat disappointed,” Corbet concludes.

ASML has enough. For now.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The chief financial officer of ASML has told Bloomberg that the lithography giant is well prepared for China's export controls regime on rare earth elements and technologies for their mining and refining. The company has long lead times for its advanced tools, so it has plenty of raw materials in stock to support short-term demand from its clients. What happens after the company's reserves deplete is something unclear, though.

""We have long lead times, and therefore, also in our supply chain, we make sure that we have the materials in that we that we need for the next couple of months,"" said Roger Dassen, CFO of ASML, in a conversation with Bloomberg.

Under the new export control rules China imposed last week, companies have to get an export license to ship such rare earth materials as holmium, thulium, or ytterbium, or products based on these materials, from China's Ministry of Commerce. Furthermore, China imposed its export controls beyond its own borders on products containing rare earth materials originating from China if their value content within that product is more than 0.1% starting December 1, 2025.

This decision of the Chinese government could essentially stop all the supplies of all rare earth materials and products containing them across the world, something that could harm ASML, which uses a number of them inside its DUV and EUV lithography systems, metrology tools, and inspection tools.

However, Dassen downplayed the possibility of halting production after December 1, saying that the company's supply planning and long production cycles give it enough flexibility to absorb temporary disruptions. Meanwhile, the company now has over a month to buy rare earth materials or components containing them before the new export controls regime is enacted.

Speaking of China, ASML re-emphasized that it expects demand from its customers in the People's Republic to drop in 2026 due to the revocation of fast-track VEU license exemptions for Micron, Samsung, SK hynix, and TSMC, as well as softening demand from local chipmakers.

""When we look at China, we believe that the demand of our Chinese customers is going to be significantly lower in 2026 than it has been in 2024 and 2025 when we had very strong business there,"" said Christophe Fouquet, chief executive of ASML, during the company's earnings call with investors and analysts.

A greater proportion of physicians left clinical practice in 2019 than in 2013, across regions and specialties, with higher risks for exit among female and rural physicians.

“This evidence can help facilitate clinical operations and policy efforts to maintain the physician workforce, and accordingly, patients' access to physician care,” the study authors wrote.

This study was led by Lisa S. Rotenstein, MD, MBA, MSc, of the University of California, San Francisco. It was published online on October 07, 2025, in Annals of Internal Medicine.

The results may not represent physicians who did not take Medicare. Physicians were classified by the specialty they billed most often. The outcome measured complete exit from practice rather than drops in time spent working.

This study received funding from the Physicians Foundation. One author reported receiving support from the funding agency.

How much does location actually play a role in where you want to go to residency? 

As a doctor who's currently in residency, this was a huge factor for me because I knew that my quality of life outside of work was going to drastically affect how I was going to perform at work. 

I wanted to be in a location where I felt I had a good support system and like I could be outside and have good physical activity. I also knew that I did not want to take public transportation. 

I prioritized all of these things to formulate my rank list of different residency programs where I wanted to ultimately practice. 

If this is something that you feel will drastically affect your mental health, I would highly recommend considering it before you make your rank list for residency.

A recent case series from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) underscores how little is known about the overlap between asthma and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) — two chronic inflammatory diseases that may share immunologic pathways but remain poorly studied together.

Richard P. Ramonell, MD, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and a pulmonary and critical care specialist at the Asthma Institute within the UPMC Comprehensive Lung Center, Pittsburgh, said the analysis arose from clinical observations that some patients with established asthma later developed RA.

Ramonell and colleagues conducted a retrospective chart review of patients seen by a single physician at the UPMC Comprehensive Lung Center between 2006 and 2023. The analysis included adults with confirmed asthma who were subsequently diagnosed with RA by a rheumatologist. Severe asthma was classified according to European Respiratory Society-American Thoracic Society criteria.

Nine patients met inclusion criteria including diagnostic criteria for asthma: characteristic symptoms and either a positive bronchodilator response or historical documentation of one in combination with a confirmed diagnosis of RA. Eight of the nine had severe asthma. The median age was 71 years; five developed asthma later in life (median age of onset, 28 years). The median age at RA onset was 60 years, and the median interval between the two diagnoses was 20 years. Two thirds of patients were never smokers, and the median BMI was 28.5.

Although asthma and RA are both immune-mediated disorders, research examining their coexistence has yielded conflicting results.

“The evidence base investigating the relationship between asthma and RA is somewhat sparse and often contradictory,” Ramonell told Medscape Medical News. “At present, the literature does not show strong, consistent relationships between these two conditions across all studies.”

For instance, a Minnesota population-based case-control study found that asthma was associated with a higher odds ratio of RA (odds ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.05-2.9), Ramonell said. In contrast, a cross-sectional study using data from the Israeli Defense Force database found RA was more frequently diagnosed in individuals without asthma, he noted.

Heterogeneity among patient populations, differences in asthma phenotypes between individuals with mild-to-moderate and severe asthma, and confounding factors likely contribute to these inconsistencies, as does the fact that larger cohort studies largely feature individuals with milder asthma. This contrasts with the population reported by Ramonell, where nearly all patients had severe asthma. “More mechanistic work needs to be done to explore this relationship in much greater detail,” he added.

The UPMC researchers aimed to better understand how chronic airway inflammation might contribute to the development of autoimmunity.

“In our manuscript, we ascribe to the mucosal origin theory of RA,” Ramonell explained. “This theory generally states that chronic mucosal inflammation — such as airway inflammation — could induce loss of self-tolerance against citrullinated proteins. Through epitope spreading, these self-targeted adaptive immune responses could begin to target citrullinated proteins in joints.”

Although the study was not designed to assess whether RA affects asthma severity or treatment response, Ramonell emphasized the need for heightened clinical awareness. “We have a lower threshold to ask about joint symptoms, perform joint examinations, order RA serologic testing, and refer to rheumatology,” he said. “Communication between services remains paramount.”

To date, no formal guidelines or consensus recommendations exist for the management of patients with both asthma and RA. Ramonell said the goal of the case series was to call attention to these evidence gaps and encourage further investigation into shared mechanisms and management strategies.

He also advocated for a multidisciplinary approach to care. “Using a co-management model with aligned treatment goals — such as pursuing corticosteroid-sparing treatments for both diseases where possible — tends to result in better overall care for individuals with comorbid asthma and RA,” he said.

Ramonell declared receiving consulting fees from GSK and Regeneron.

AMSTERDAM — A noninvasive EEG-based test may help predict the risk of sexual dysfunction for patients considering treatment with antidepressants, a new study showed.

The Loudness Dependence of Auditory Evoked Potentials (LDAEP) test indirectly measures central serotonergic activity, which research suggests may be involved with sexual disturbances reported in up to 70% of patients who take selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). 

Researchers found that individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) who had low pretreatment LDAEP scores were more likely to report sexual side effects after treatment with an SSRI. 

“Currently, patients only discover sexual side effects after they've already started antidepressant medication,” said senior author Kristian Jensen, MD, PhD, of the Neurobiology Research Unit, Rigshospitalet, Denmark, and associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, in a press release.

“If confirmed, our findings could enable a more precise approach to depression treatment, helping doctors select medications to minimize sexual side effects in those patients most likely to develop SSRI-related problems. This could help treatment adherence and overall quality of life and generally give better treatment options for depression,” he added.

The findings were presented October 14 at the 38th European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Congress (ECNP) 2025.

As many as 60% of individuals with MDD report sexual disturbance. While SSRIs can improve mood and sexual functioning, they can also contribute to sexual dysfunction by decreasing sexual desire and arousal and making it harder to achieve an orgasm, the researchers noted.

An increase in central serotonin levels caused by SSRIs could be the mechanism behind SSRI-related sexual dysfunction, they added.

The LDAEP test indirectly measures serotonin activity in the brain by analyzing how sounds played at different volumes affect auditory evoked potentials in the primary auditory cortex.

Previous research had suggested that the test may flag individuals at risk for sexual side effects during SSRI treatment. 

To investigate further, researchers enrolled 90 unmedicated adults (median age, 27.5 years; 73% female) who had been diagnosed with MDD for a duration of less than 2 years. 

Participants underwent LDAEP testing at baseline, wearing a headset equipped with 256 electrodes. Sound tones are played through earphones at volumes ranging from 60dB (which is as loud as a conversation) to 100dB (as loud as a loud hairdryer). The test takes about 30 minutes, researchers said. 

After testing, participants received escitalopram at 5-20 mg for 8 weeks. 

Eight patients whose depression did not improve by week 4 (defined as less than 25% reduction in the Hamilton Depression Rating 6-item subscale) were switched to the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor duloxetine.

Sexual function was measured before and after treatment, using the validated Danish version of the Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (CSFQ), and SSRI-related sexual side effects were assessed at the end of treatment with the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersøgelser standardized clinician-rated evaluation of SSRI side effects.

After 8 weeks of treatment, 30% of men and 74% of women had sexual dysfunction as assessed by the CSFQ.

Pretreatment LDAEP was associated with SSRI-related orgasmic dysfunction at week 8 (P = .039) and predicted orgasmic dysfunction with 87% accuracy (P = .017), but it was only marginally associated with SSRI-related decreased libido (P = .050).

Participants with lower pretreatment LDAEP were more likely to report sexual side effects after treatment (P = .031). 

A lower LDAEP response indicates higher serotonin activity, and “high serotonergic activity is an indication of more susceptibility to sexual dysfunction,” first author Gudrun Dilja Ketilsdottir, a medical student at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, told Medscape Medical News.

While 70% of women and 58% of men had reported pre-treatment sexual disturbances, LDAEP was not associated with pretreatment sexual function (P = .11).

“Our findings seem only to apply to medication-induced sexual problems, so it's not a general test for sexual difficulties,” said Jensen. 

Researchers noted that a larger sample of male participants is needed to get a more accurate understanding of SSRI-related erectile dysfunction. 

Study findings are currently under peer review, researchers said, adding that they hope to replicate their findings in a new 600-patient study.

Although LDAEP is not available in the clinic, “that may change if this test lives up to expectations,” Jensen said.

Commenting on the study for Medscape Medical News, Eric Ruhe, MD, PhD, professor in difficult-to-treat depression at Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands, said the appeal of LDAEP is the idea of an objective, noninvasive measure of serotonergic activity.

However, Ruhe — who was not involved in the research — noted a potential problem with how patients might interpret test results. 

“If the test is positive, we then have the problem of people not complying with first-line treatment. So, would they want to be treated with the optimal drug for depression, or would they want to be treated to avoid sexual adversity? That remains the devil's dilemma. But, I guess it's a choice for the patient,” he said.

Also weighing in, Sameer Jauhar, MBChB, PhD, clinical associate professor in affective disorders and psychosis, at Imperial College London, UK, noted that using LDAEP to measure serotonergic function is a bit unusual.

“It is not measuring it in the way we generally measure neurotransmitters in the brain, i.e. through molecular imaging, such as PET,” he said in a statement from the UK nonprofit Science Media Centre.

“The hypothesis is scientifically sound — higher central serotonin pre-treatment is associated with more sexual dysfunction when someone takes an SSRI, which will increase central serotonin further [and] further cause sexual dysfunction,” he added.

“The associations observed are certainly in the right direction,” he added. “The predictive accuracy of the measure — over 80% — is very high and will require clarification in a peer-reviewed publication, as sometimes smaller sample sizes can inflate this,” Jauhar noted.

The work was supported by the Lundbeck Foundation and Research Fund of the Mental Health Services — Capital Region of Denmark. The researchers and Ruhe reported no conflicts. Jauhar reported personal fees from Recordati, LB Pharmaceuticals, Boehringer Ingelheim, Wellcome Trust, Lundbeck, Janssen, and Sunovion, and nonfinancial support from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, British Association for Psychopharmacology, and Royal College of Psychiatrists.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Union (EU) announced today a new agreement to support the digital transformation of health systems and wider adoption of WHO's Global Digital Health Certification Network (GDHCN) in sub-Saharan Africa. This EU–WHO partnership will improve pandemic preparedness and accelerate progress towards better health and well-being for all.

The agreement was announced at the World Health Summit 2025 by Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems, Access and Data; Dr Mohamed Yakub Janabi, WHO Regional Director for Africa; and Mr Martin Seychell, Deputy Director-General of the European Commission Directorate-General for International Partnerships.

The GDHCN is a global system that enables countries to securely and reliably verify nationally approved digital health credentials across borders. The system builds on the European Union Digital COVID Certificate (EU DCC), which facilitated verification of vaccination, testing and recovery certification for international travelers connecting 76 countries and territories. However, only four countries from the WHO African Region-Benin, Cabo Verde, Seychelles and Togo-were able to join the EU DCC network.

Since its transfer to the WHO in 2023, the GDHCN has shown strong potential to support the digitization of the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP), commonly known as the Yellow Card, in alignment with the updated International Health Regulations (IHR). Making the most of its potential could enhance global vaccination tracking, reduce fraud, and simplify international health requirements.

Under the new joint agreement, which includes an €8 million EU grant spanning 2025 to 2028, WHO and the European Union will collaborate to bolster national efforts to advance the digital transformation of health systems in sub-Saharan Africa. WHO will provide technical and policy expertise, in collaboration with regional partners such as the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).

The EU investment is part of the Digital Health workstream of the Team Europe Initiative on the EU-AU Health Partnership, which brings together European and African stakeholders to build resilient digital health ecosystems across the continent, and aligned with the EU Global Gateway strategy.

The GDHCN supports countries in building trusted, interoperable digital health systems that directly benefit people - providing secure, portable health records accessible wherever they travel, including during health emergencies. Personal health records are managed securely by each individual country or their health system. These records cannot be accessed by other parties, including WHO.

The network is built on internationally recognized standards for privacy, data protection, and interoperability, and participation of countries is voluntary. The network fosters cross-border collaboration among countries and partners, strengthening health security today, while laying the foundation for more resilient, person-centered health systems for future generations.

At 36, Press has cemented her legacy as one of U.S. soccer's all-time greats.

Christen Press, one of the most celebrated players in U.S. women's soccer history, is officially hanging up her cleats.

At 36, the two-time World Cup champion and Angel City FC forward announced her retirement from professional soccer, sharing the emotional news in an interview with ""Good Morning America"" that aired Wednesday.

""I'm retiring from professional soccer, and I've decided that this is my last season and my last few games,"" Press said. ""I feel a mix of everything. There's yes, there's relief, there's joy, there's excitement, there's fear, there's so much grief. I have so much grief, a part of me, a piece of me, I'm losing her.""

Over the course of her remarkable career, Press earned 155 caps and scored 64 goals for the U.S. Women's National Team, helping lead the squad to two FIFA Women's World Cup titles.

Known for her speed, technical precision and calm under pressure, Press became a defining figure of the USWNT's golden era.

Her influence extended well beyond the field. As a trailblazer for equity in women's sports and a founding member of Angel City FC, Press helped shape the next generation of women's soccer in Los Angeles.

Three years ago, Press suffered a devastating knee injury that sidelined her for more than a year.

Despite a determined comeback and return to the pitch last season, she said her decision to retire came from wanting to choose her moment, not have it chosen for her.

""I thought I would wait until I didn't want to play anymore,"" she explained. ""But I realized that time's never going to come and I can play, and my body can keep going. And I think it was really important for me to make this decision for myself before that became a different reality.""

Press will play her final Angel City home game this Sunday, fittingly, not far from where her journey first began.

Soccer, Press added, has always been a family affair.

Her father, a former college football player, was the first to spark her love for the game.

""He had three girls, and so this is how he connected to us,"" she shared. ""And I think because of that, it became so important to my mom to have that connection between my dad and I.""

But it was her mother, Stacy, who became her source of strength during the most difficult moments of her career.

In 2018, as her mother battled brain cancer, Press didn't want to leave her side until her mom insisted she rejoin the national team. That same week, she scored a game-winning goal against Spain.

""My dad was upstairs watching the game on his iPad, and he ran downstairs to my mom to show her the goal,"" she recalled. ""And my dad told me that my mom took his hand and she smiled and she actually passed away that night. And I think in some ways it gave her a little peace.""

Press's next chapter will be one of partnership -- both in life and in passion.

Earlier this year, she and former teammate and longtime partner Tobin Heath revealed that they are married, after quietly tying the knot years earlier.

""There was a time where a lot was off limits and Tobin and I's approach was wanting to keep our relationship sacred and out of the public eye,"" she said. ""We actually have been married long before this year. And you know, my manager, my family [were] just as surprised as you were, but everyone knew that I was in [a] committed relationship.""

Together, the couple co-founded a media company and co-host The RE-CAP Show podcast, where they talk candidly about life, love, and the game that brought them together.

""It's authentic, because it is just the same conversations we often are having here at the house,"" she said.

Heath retired from soccer earlier this year, and Press admitted that her wife's decision influenced her own.

""She would absolutely hate me saying this, but a lot,"" she said. ""I think it is time for my family to move on to our next chapter, we're going to be a part of this game forever, but it's time for it to look different for us.""

As she is about to step off the field for the last time, Press said she feels grateful for her career, her family, and the city that raised her.

""I get to leave this game with a family, a dog, a wife, a house in the city that I grew up in that I love, and that feels like a really soft landing,"" she said.

FIFA has issued a statement after US President Donald Trump threatened to change the host cities for next summer's World Cup.

The tournament will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada, with the final set to take place at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on July 19.

However, despite the competition being just nine months away, Trump has warned that he could intervene and change the host cities.

He claims he could contact FIFA President Gianni Infantino to pressure Democrat-run cities to take a tougher stance on crime.

At a cabinet meeting on Sunday, he said: “If somebody is doing a bad job and I feel there are unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location.'

""He wouldn't love to do it, but he would do it very easily.”

In response, a FIFA spokesperson told POLITICO: “Safety and security are of the utmost importance at all FIFA events worldwide.

Advert

""And it is ultimately the government's responsibility to decide what's in the best interest of public safety.

""We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to fulfill all necessary requirements for a successful 2026 World Cup.”

The United States are set to host two of the world's biggest sporting events in the coming years.

After next summer's World Cup, Los Angeles will stage the Summer Olympics in 2028.

Advert

Trump's latest comments are now the second time he has threatened to change World Cup venues.

City officials have since spoken out against Trump, stressing that they have spent several years preparing to host matches.

Lisa Gillmor, the mayor of Santa Clara, California, said: “Any suggestion that Santa Clara is unsafe is simply not based in fact.

Advert

""We have been preparing for these games for nearly 3 years, and we will be proud to welcome the world to Santa Clara for the World Cup next year.""

Another official from a host city added that the agreements over which locations would stage matches were finalised back in 2017 and 2018.

The controversy is just the latest difficulty ahead of the World Cup.

Fans have already hit out at the prices, with the cheapest seats for the final starting out at $2,030 (£1,510), and the most expensive reaching $6,000 (£4,462).

Advert

FIFA has also adopted a 'dynamic pricing' system for the tournament, allowing ticket prices to rise sharply in response to higher demand.

And weather conditions could also pose a logistical challenge, with extreme heat likely to force later kick-off times.

President Trump has once again suggested relocating World Cup matches from cities that he deems unsafe — this time, threatening to move games from Boston, one of 11 U.S. cities hosting the FIFA games next year.

Speaking from the Oval Office during his meeting with Argentina's president on Tuesday, Trump's remarks came in response to a reporter who asked him about Boston mayor Michelle Wu and the potential of relocating World Cup games from the city.

“We can take them away,” Trump said. “I love the people of Boston. I know the games are sold out, but your mayor is not good.” Referring to Wu, he added, “She's intelligent … but she's radical left.”

Trump then said, “They're taking over parts of Boston,” without further explanation. He continued, “We could get them back in about two seconds. All she has to do is call us.”

It's unclear who or what the president was referring to. The reporter, in their line of questioning, referred to “street takeovers” before asking about Boston.

Protestors last week clashed with police during pro-Palestinian demonstrations that turned violent near Boston Common, leading to multiple arrests. Boston prosecutors have since charged 13 protestors with felonies, suggesting the city is willing to come down hard on civil unrest as federal interventions in other Democrat-led cities continue.

“Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions,” Wu said in a statement.

Gillette Stadium, home of the NFL's New England Patriots, will host seven World Cup matches next year. The stadium sits about 30 miles outside of Boston.

This is the second time Trump suggested he would relocate World Cup games next year from cities he deems unsafe. However, as The Athletic reported last month, the U.S. government had no official role in choosing World Cup host cities and does not have any explicit authority to relocate games.

Regardless, Trump on Tuesday doubled down on his perceived influence over the games, leaning into his close relationship with FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino.

“If I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni — the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal — and I would say, ‘let's move it to another location,' and he would do that.” Trump said. “He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.”

FIFA, soccer's governing body, issued the following statement to The Athletic regarding Trump's latest remarks: “Safety and security are the top priorities at all FIFA events worldwide. Safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety. We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfill all necessary requirements.”

Trump and Infantino's friendship is well-documented. Infantino was recently Trump's guest at the Summit for Peace in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, and, last week, Infantino said “Trump definitely deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for his decisive actions” in the Middle East.

In Trump's comments about Boston, the president also suggested once again the possibility of relocating the Olympic Games from Los Angeles in 2028. Both Boston and Los Angeles are run by Democratic mayors, Wu in Boston and Karen Bass in L.A. When referring to the Olympics, Trump shared his disdain for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, also a Democrat and an outspoken critic of Trump, saying Newsom “has got to get his act together.”

Trump's comments about relocating games from Boston came during his meeting with Argentina's president, Javier Milei, as his administration moves forward with a 20 billion dollar bailout of the South American country, with apparent strings attached.

Trump's response to the reporter's brief question about Wu and World Cup games in Boston lasted less than four minutes, with a chunk of his response referring to Los Angeles' response to the devastating wildfires that ravaged Southern California earlier this year.

Trump quickly reverted back to Boston, before taking one final question in the Oval Office. “Boston better clean up their act,” he said. “That's all I can say.”

President Donald Trump said he may call FIFA's president to suggest World Cup games be moved out of Boston if he believes there are safety concerns in the city.

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu responded after President Donald Trump threatened to pull FIFA World Cup games out of the city next year. 

""Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions,"" she said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.

Boston is currently set to host seven matches when the World Cup comes to North America next summer. The slate includes five group-stage games, one Round of 32 fixture and the first quarterfinal on July 9.

Trump made the suggestion that he would have games moved out of Boston while speaking to reporters on Tuesday while discussing an incident that happened in the city this week when a group of people took over one of the city's streets in a violent display. 

According to the Boston Police Department, over 100 people were involved in the takeover that involved street racing just after 2 a.m. on Oct. 5. Officers found people trying to attack police cruisers with fireworks, cones, poles and other items. One police cruiser was destroyed by flames and needed to be towed away from the area, officials said.

""We can take them away. I love the people of Boston. And I know the games are sold out, but the mayor is not good. There are worse than her. At least she's intelligent. You know, some are extremely low IQ. Those bother me more. She's intelligent, but she's radical left,"" Trump said. 

Trump added he would call FIFA President Gianni Infantino to have the games moved.

""The answer is yes, if somebody's doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location,' and he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it, very easily he'd do it. And this is the right time to do it."" 

Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey addressed the violent incident in Boston on Tuesday.

Kane missed a key spot kick in the 2022 quarter-final against France Julian Finney/Getty Images

Harry Kane has revealed his penalty miss against France in the 2022 World Cup was “the worst” he has felt in football but that he has used it as motivation ever since.

Kane, 32, is set to captain England at a third World Cup next summer, leading the team out in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

In the 2022 tournament in Qatar, England were 2-1 down against France in the quarter-final. With five minutes they were awarded a penalty, but Kane skied it over the bar.

Speaking after confirming qualification for 2026, Kane said that he does not think about it too often now, but that he used it as motivation to improve over the last three years.

“After another major tournament, you get over it and you get on with it,” he said. “I scored a penalty in the semi-final of Euro 2024, which was as high pressure as you are going to get.

“I always try and learn from those moments. After that penalty, I went 31 penalties, I think, without missing. I changed my technique a little bit, I improved, which I was proud of. That's what I will always try to do.”

Even after a stellar three years since Qatar, that is still his last World Cup memory, and so Kane will have to wait until June to change that.

“I'm looking forward to the next World Cup to try and put that right, to try and go further, to try and lift the trophy,” he added. “And the opportunity is always there when that is coming around. I think those moments only shape you as a person, as a player and it's definitely helped me to become a better player.”

The fact that the England captain made such an uncharacteristic error at such a crucial moment — England would have faced Morocco in the semi-final had they got there — made it so difficult for him to take.

“That was probably the worst that I have felt, in any moment,” Kane said. “Obviously I've lost finals before. To have that responsibility, it fell on my shoulders, and not being able to execute something that I've been to execute many times in my career. That was the hardest part to process and take. But as always as a sportsman, putting yourself in that situation, there's going to be moments where it doesn't quite go your way.”

Speaking on The Athletic FC podcast this week, former England goalkeeper Rob Green spoke about training with Kane as a young player and his penalty prowess.

“When he gets a penalty, he's that good — look at where he goes, his patterns, his foot movement,” Green said. “We looked at it and we went, ‘If he goes to my right, I've actually got no chance in saving it.'

“Now he's brought in the stutter as well. If you go early, you're dead, so that is just a microcosm because you stand there and you go, ‘Okay, he is the best I've seen at in certain areas.' On an angle within the ‘V' of the pitch, coming out from the goal, if he's in that area, he's the best I've seen at just finding the corner consistently.”



While this will be Kane's third World Cup, there are plenty of players in this England squad — Elliot Anderson, Djed Spence, Myles Lewis-Skelly — who have not been to a senior international tournament before.

“I just think they are the greatest tournaments to be a part of,” Kane said. “I spoke to some of the guys here who haven't experienced that yet, trying to tell them how excited they should be and it's a great thing to look forward to. For me, it's using those experiences to try and help some of the other lads and for them, it's just to go full gas and enjoy the experience.”

After steady improvement in recent years, Kane believes now is England's moment to aim to win.

The striker feels he is in the form of his life with Bayern Munich, but by the time of the next major tournament — Euro 2028, which England will co-host — Kane will be 34. He is targeting 100 England goals, having scored numbers 75 and 76 in Riga on Tuesday night, so he does not have imminent international retirement plans.

“We've been knocking on the door,” Kane reflected. “I remember talking to Gareth (Southgate) a long time ago about some of the other big nations, how you've got to get to semi-finals, to finals, it doesn't just happen overnight. You've got to keep being in those situations. And we've done that.

“But we know we're just at the bottom of the mountain still. To win a World Cup is going to be incredibly hard. We'll have to beat the biggest teams on the biggest stage. These moments, these feelings we've got together right now are important stepping stones to arriving in the summer, and being fearless against anyone.”

Trump doubled down Wednesday on his suggestion to move the games from Mass.

Trump doubled down Wednesday on his suggestion to move the games from Mass.

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu responded to Donald Trump after he suggested Tuesday that he could pull 2026 World Cup games from Gillette Stadium over ""unsafe conditions"" in Massachusetts, citing recent street takeovers.

Wu appeared on a podcast on Wednesday and said it would be unlikely that the games could change venues so late in the process. 

""Many, many months of planning now, much of it is locked down by contract, so no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it,"" Wu said.

On Wednesday, Trump doubled down on his suggestion to pull the games and on his attacks on Wu.

""Boston has a bad mayor who at least is a reasonable IQ person,"" Trump said. ""She's got four areas that are wrong. Somebody said, would we think about taking the World Cup away from Boston if they don't straighten it out? The answer is yes, we have the right to do that with FIFA.""

Boston was named a host city in 2022, with seven matches set to be played at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough. New England has been planning for the games since, estimating an $8 billion economic boost.  

""Just ongoing threats that are issued to individuals and communities who refuse to back down,"" Wu said.

Experts say the relocation of matches could invite legal issues. 

""Are they going to be able to recoup their losses that they already have, the contracts they've already put into place, that they already have guarantees in them?"" Sports Event Management Expert Lee Esckilsen said.

World Cup host sites aren't up to Trump. The 11 U.S. cities — plus three in Mexico and two in Canada — are contracted with FIFA, which would face significant logistical and legal issues to make changes in the eight months before the June 11 kickoff.

“It's FIFA's tournament, FIFA's jurisdiction, FIFA makes those decisions,” the soccer body's vice president Victor Montagliani said earlier this month at a sports business conference in London.

Massachusetts Rep. Stephen Lynch says he is confident that the games will go on as scheduled at Gillette Stadium.

""It'll go well. I'm hoping the president won't do something silly or vengeful just to create more harm,"" Lynch said. 

In a meeting with Argentina's president Tuesday, Trump referred to his contentious relationship with Wu and alluded to violent car meets, including one in Boston's South End that left a marked police cruiser destroyed by fire — an incident that was part of several other similar attacks in Massachusetts over one weekend.

""I think she is hurting Boston. The answer is yes. If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, let's move it to another location, if I thought Boston was going to cause safety conditions for the World Cup,"" Trump said. ""I could say the same thing for the Olympics.""

“It was a good match, I'm very happy,” said Ruud, who improved to 4-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Cilic. “Marin is a great player, very aggressive. He got a better start than me, so I just tried to get my form and rhythm back into the match. I'm really happy with the win.”

Despite his early deficit, Ruud soon took control from the baseline, combining precise groundstrokes with dominant serving to turn the match around. He held serve to love in four straight games in the first set and won all 12 first-serve points in the second, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Ruud's one-hour, 50-minute triumph provided a boost to his bid to reach the Nitto ATP Finals for the fourth time. The 2022 runner-up at the season finale is 11th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. In the quarter-finals, he will face Sebastian Korda.

The 2019 Stockholm champion, Denis Shapovalov, averted a scare against wild card Leo Borg in front of a vibrant atmosphere inside the Royal Tennis Hall. The Canadian failed to serve out the match at 5-4 in the second set, but eventually regrouped for a 6-2, 5-7, 6-1 victory.

Borg, the son of ATP No. 1 Club member Bjorn Borg, was aiming to record his third ATP Tour win, but he was unable to draw on the crowd support and contain Shapovalov in the decider. The third-seeded Canadian is into his fourth Stockholm quarter-final in five appearances at the ATP 250 and awaits Jacob Fearnley or Swedish wild card Elias Ymer.

Korda earlier overcame Kamil Majchrzak 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 in a thrilling two-hour, 33-minute contest. The American dropped just four of 28 points on serve, according to Infosys ATP Stats, in the final set to earn his 100th hard-court win, becoming the fifth player born in the 2000s to do so.

In first-round action on Wednesday,  Lorenzo Sonego kickstarted his quest for a second indoor title by defeating British qualifier Arthur Fery 6-4, 6-2. Sonego set a second-round meeting with Aleksandar Kovecevic, who led eighth seed Camilo Ugo Carabelli 4-6, 7-5, 4-0 when the Argentine was forced to retire through injury.

Marton Fucsovics eased past Jesper de Jong 6-1, 6-2 to book a clash with top seed and 2022 Stockholm champion Holger Rune.

Third seed Flavio Cobolli earned victory on his Almaty Open debut Wednesday, when he moved past Rinky Hijikata 6-4, 7-5 to end his brief losing run on the Tour.

After defeating Andrey Rublev in Beijing, the Italian suffered consecutive defeats, falling to Learner Tien at the ATP 500 and then Jaume Munar in Shanghai. However, he looked close to his best against Hijikata, striking 21 winners and committing just seven unforced errors to advance to the quarter-finals after 79 minutes.

Cobolli has enjoyed a standout year, winning titles in Hamburg and Bucharest. The 23-year-old is currently No. 22 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings but would return to the Top 20 with a title run in Almaty, where he will next face James Duckworth.

Australian qualifier Duckworth upset seventh seed and last year's finalist Gabriel Diallo 7-6(3), 6-7(3), 6-4 for the biggest win of his season. The World No. 138 did not face a break point en route to his win, according to Infosys ATP Stats.



Earlier, Shintaro Mochizuki defeated Arthur Cazaux 6-4, 6-4 to earn his third tour-level win of the season. The 22-year-old is up three spots to No. 99 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and will hope to break the Top 100 for the first time. He will next play fourth seed Luciano Darderi.

Alex Michelsen snapped a five-match losing streak to reach the second round. The American, who had not won a match since Cincinnati in August, downed Beibit Zhukayev 6-2, 6-3 and will next meet Aleksandar Vukic.

""I am pleased with my level,"" Michelsen said. ""He is a dangerous player, has a big serve. I am super happy to get the win and super happy to be in Almaty for the first time.""

Fabian Marozsan sunk fifth seed Brandon Nakashima 7-6(5), 6-1 to reach his second tour-level quarter-final within a month. The 26-year-old is the first Hungarian to reach the last eight in tournament history and will meet second seed Daniil Medvedev or Adam Walton.






Jan-Lennard Struff also advanced, clawing past Mackenzie McDonald 2-6, 6-3, 6-4. The German struck 25 winners to improve to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against the American. Struff will next face top seed and defending champion Karen Khachanov. Frenchman Corentin Moutet eliminated home favourite Alexander Shevchenko 7-5, 6-3. Moutet was a semi-finalist last month in Hangzhou.

The 21-year-old believes the altitude at Kazakhstan's largest tennis event plays into his favor of making some noise indoors.ByMatt FitzgeraldPublished Oct 15, 2025 copy_link

ALMATY—Alex Michelsen didn't arrive to Kazakhstan for this week's Almaty Open until Monday, though he had his reasons. For the American reached his second career ATP Masters 1000 doubles final in Shanghai, ultimately finishing runner-up with Sweden's Andre Goransson.“It's good matches, it's good money and it's good pressure points as well,” he tells TENNIS.com.“It's obviously not anywhere near the same as singles, but you get the serve reps, the return reps, you get the reps at the net, and I think that's really beneficial to my game.”Getting himself back into a match day rhythm paid off two days later. On Wednesday, Michelsen made a winning debut inside the Almaty Arena, defeating local hopeful Beibit Zhukayev, 6-2, 6-3, to snap a five-match losing streak in singles, dating back to the Cincinnati Open.

“Definitely a tough go lately in singles, so super happy to end that little streak I was on. The altitude here, I feel like it's helpful for my game. Shots are penetrating a little more,” assesses Michelsen. “Beibit's got a massive serve, so I knew going in that he was gonna hold serve well. I think he might have hurt himself. I saw he had a lot of tape and his back was taped up.“I played super well at the baseline for the first time in a long time. A lot of positives going forward.”The world No. 36 evened his career indoor record to 10-10. When asked, Michelsen agrees it's a playing environment he should be generating more success from given his game. “I've definitely underachieved indoors,” he states before expressing that he “absolutely loves” playing under a roof.Against Zhukayev, his intent to finish at the net where possible was clear throughout their encounter.“The balls die like they do everywhere nowadays, but when they're not super dead, I think it's a little easier to be offensive. Especially in the altitude, the balls are flying a little more,” he says. “That's one of the key components of my game and I can be on my front foot looking to come forward.”

After his victory, the on-court emcee presented the 21-year-old with a Kazakh coin for his collection. Michelsen hasn't had much time to spare for sightseeing in the city hosting his latest tour stop. Beyond the quick turnaround from China, the two-person team working with the Aliso Viejo, Calif. native this week includes a familiar face and a new addition whose career-high ranking of No. 30 is equal to Michelsen's.“I'm here with Kristof Vliegen, new coach. As of now we're doing a little trial period,” he reveals. “So let's see how it goes. And then I'm with my trainer Byron (Manning), I've been with him for a couple of years.”A win Thursday over Aleksandar Vukic would send Michelsen through to his seventh tour-level quarterfinal of the year. The sixth seed is bidding to become the ninth first-time winner on the ATP Tour this season.“I definitely want to get a title.

The series, titled ‘Start of Watch,' will follow younger versions of Michael Connelly's characters.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


	The world of Harry Bosch continues to grow. 


	Cable and streaming outlet MGM+ has ordered a series called Bosch: Start of Watch, a prequel to the Bosch series that starred Titus Welliver as the title character, the LAPD detective from Michael Connelly's best-selling novels. Cameron Monaghan (Shameless, Gotham) will play the young Harry, and Omari Hardwick (Power) will also star.




Start of Watch will be the fourth series in the Bosch-verse, following Prime Video's Bosch, sequel Bosch: Legacy and spinoff Ballard, which was recently renewed for a second season. Franchise veterans Tom Bernardo and Brian Anthony co-created the series and will executive produce, with Bernardo serving as showrunner. The show is set to film in Los Angeles.

	Fabel Entertainment is producing, as it has for the rest of the franchise. Along with Bernardo and Anthony, Connelly, Henrik Bastin, Jamie Boscardin Martin and Jasmine Russ executive produce. Theresa Snider of Hieronymus Pictures is a co-EP.


	“We are thrilled to expand the Bosch universe with this compelling origin story that showcases how one of television's most beloved detectives became the man we know today,” said MGM+ head Michael Wright. “With Cameron Monaghan and Omari Hardwick bringing these complex characters to life, and the creative vision of Michael Connelly and our talented executive producers, Bosch: Start of Watch promises to deliver the gritty, authentic storytelling that honors the franchise's legacy while opening an exciting new chapter.”

	











Start of Watch will be set in 1991, with the 26-year-old Harry as an LAPD rookie under the tutelage of training officer Eli Bridges (Hardwick). “The series will explore a city on the edge, teeming with racial tension, gang violence, and a fractured LAPD,” the logline reads. “Amid routine calls and growing unrest, Bosch finds himself drawn into a high-profile heist and a web of criminal corruption that will test his loyalty to the badge and shape his future as the detective who lives by the code, ‘Everybody counts or nobody counts.'”


	“I'm deeply grateful to Michael Wright and the team at MGM+ for championing this next chapter in Bosch's journey with such remarkable care and integrity,” said Connelly. “Being able to see how Harry Bosch became the man we have loved for 10 seasons is a gift to me and his many fans. I can't wait to dig in with Cameron and the writers to explore this uncharted character territory.”

	The Daniels' untitled movie is back on the Universal schedule, now set for Friday, Nov. 19, 2027. That's the Friday before Thanksgiving, which falls on Nov. 25 that year. 


	The next movie from the multi-Oscar winning Everything Everywhere All at Once duo is shrouded in secrecy. The movie's release will rep a little more than five years since Everything Everywhere All at Once hit theaters, that A24 title still anomaly at the specialty box office as theaters were fitting their footing roughly a year after their 2021 re-opening from Covid's closure. 


	The movie was originally scheduled for June 12, 2026 before being unset. The Daniels' movie takes the place of a reserved hold that Universal had on Nov. 19, 2027 for an untitled event movie. The pic is scheduled to open before Disney's Frozen 3 on Nov. 24, 2027. 

	











	Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert inked a five-year exclusive deal with Universal back in August 2022.

An Oscar-nominated actress, Penelope Milford, celebrated for her captivating performances in “Coming Home” and “Heathers,” has died at age 77. As per a report in The Hollywood Reporter, her family confirmed she passed away on Tuesday in an assisted living facility in Saugerties, New York. The cause of death was not disclosed.

A post shared by Fernando Duarte (@fernandoduartegts1)

Milford was best known for her Academy Award–nominated role as Jane Fonda's free-spirited roommate in Hal Ashby's 1978 drama “Coming Home.”

 Her performance earned her widespread critical praise and placed her among Hollywood's most promising talents of the era.

Milford's film career included memorable roles in “Valentino,” where she portrayed a silent film star opposite Rudolf Nureyev, and Franco Zeffirelli's “Endless Love.” 

She later brought humor and heart to the cult classic “Heathers,” playing the empathetic school guidance counselor Pauline Fleming.

A post shared by Jodee Jernigan (@jodeejernigan)

Her work in “Coming Home” earned her one of four Oscar nominations for the film, alongside co-stars Jane Fonda, Jon Voight, and Bruce Dern. 

A post shared by Andrew Glazebrook (@glazy_uk)

Maggie Smith ultimately won the Academy Award that year for “California Suite”. Her portrayal of Vi Munson remains one of the most moving depictions of compassion and friendship in 1970s cinema.

A post shared by Chris O'Neill (@chrisoneill2020)

Before finding success on film, she honed her craft on stage, appearing twice on Broadway. She joined the 1972 cast of “Lenny” and later earned a Drama Desk nomination for her performance in the long-running Civil War musical “Shenandoah.”

Mildford's stage presence carried over into television and film, with credits in “The Last Word,” “Take This Job and Shove It,” “Normal Life,” and the acclaimed telefilms “Seizure: The Story of Kathy Morris” and “The Burning Bed.” Critics often praised her for bringing emotional intelligence and depth to every role she took on.

The actress rose to prominence in both television and film after getting her start on Broadway. Metro reported that she performed opposite Richard Gere in the acclaimed play “Richard Fariña: Long Time Coming and a Long Time Gone,” and the two later dated offstage.

Away from the screen, Milford also ran an art gallery in Los Angeles in the mid-1980s and dedicated time to teaching acting and performing in local theater (as reported by Variety). A devout Christian Scientist, she later moved to Saugerties in 2003, where she remodeled a historic home and stayed involved in her community.

Her brother, actor and musician Kim Milford, died in 1980 at age 37, as reported by The Huffington Post. She was briefly married to poet Michael Lally during the 1980s. She is survived by her brother Douglas and three nieces and nephews.

Her artistic legacy, from her Academy Award recognition to her lifelong devotion to creative expression, continues to inspire fans and fellow performers around the world.

Sun O))) have signed to Sub Pop and shared their first songs for the venerated Seattle-based label. “Eternity's Pillars,” “Raise the Chalice,” and “Reverential” are out now on streaming services and as a limited-edition 12” vinyl single. Hear all three tracks below.

“‘Eternity's Pillars' is named for the mid-1980s television program created and hosted by jazz visionary and spiritual guru Alice Coltrane Turiyasangitananda, focusing on her incessant belief in music's capacity to attain spiritual transcendence,” Sun O))) shared in a press statement. “‘Raise the Chalice' is named for a rallying cry often uttered by Northwest legend Ron Guardipee throughout the mid-1990s. ‘Reverential' equally pays respect and sends loud praise to those who came before us with the heaviest burdens, expressions with music and art being the materials of an antiphon.”

Now a duo of founding members Stephen O'Malley and Greg Anderson, Sunn O))) shared their last new studio LPs, Life Metal and Pyroclasts, in 2019. The band also documented their BBC Radio 6 session from that same year in the 2021 live album Metta, Benevolence.

Of the many times Bob Mould‘s band Sugar unexpectedly found itself at the center of pop culture in the Nineties, one in particular springs to mind for him: a 1992 festival in Belgium where Sugar were on the same bill as Metallica, Neil Young and Crazy Horse, Lenny Kravitz, and the Black Crowes. For Mould, who emerged from indie rock the previous decade with Minneapolis' mighty Hüsker Dü, it was far from a typical gig. “Being on the periphery of the excess of those times was pretty crazy,” he says. “It was very, very different than jumping in a van and doing a punk rock tour. It was like, ‘So, Metallica bring washers and dryers out with them. I get it now.'”


	Compared with his years in Hüsker Dü and the many decades after on his own, Sugar were a streaking comet in Mould's career: two albums and one EP in two years, then over and out. But within that compressed time, Sugar brought Mould, bassist David Barbe, and drummer Malcolm Travis as close to the mainstream as Mould would ever get. In addition to that Belgium festival, the band played others with headliners like the Cure, powering through sandblasters like “If I Can't Change Your Mind,” “JC Auto,” and “Your Favorite Thing,” which found a home on alt-rock radio.

	











	Now, 30 years after Sugar played their last show — and more than a dozen years after an attempted but abandoned reunion — the band has returned. The group teased something was in the works on social media last week and this week unveiled a newly recorded raver, “House of Dead Memories.” There are shows announced in London and New York, too, set for May 2026.

	











	Ironically, Sugar weren't even originally intended to be a band. Mould's first post-Hüskers album, Workbook, was critically lauded — “See a Little Light” was a college radio hit and found its way onto soundtracks — but the follow-up, the bleaker and tenser Black Sheets of Rain, received a more muted response. Mould plowed on, recruiting former Mercyland bassist Barbe and Human Switchboard and Zulus drummer Travis as his new rhythm section. As they were rehearsing in Athens, Georgia, to make a Mould album, the trio were invited to play a one-off show at the 40 Watt Club there.

	“We were like, ‘Sure, why not?'” Mould says. “It was already feeling like a band.” Next came a name, inspired by a packet on a coffee-shop table, and Mould unexpectedly had his first group after the glorious but often fraught ride that was Hüsker Dü. “I knew David and Malcom and their abilities and personalities, and I thought, ‘I bet this will work — I think it should work,'” he recalls. “And it did work.”


	Released in 1992, just after Nirvana's Nevermind and Pearl Jam's Ten messed with everyone's expectations of how rock could sound and sell, Sugar's debut, Copper Blue, was the right record at the right moment in the culture. “I was over in Europe in the summer of '91, playing a lot of festivals with Nirvana and Dinosaur Jr., and the table was getting set then for everything,” he says. “And to have Nirvana blow up like that, at the moment I'm coming back with a power-pop thing as opposed to what Workbook and Black Sheets were: I wish I could say, ‘Oh yeah, I knew this was coming.'”


	While not quite Nevermind in terms of sales, Copper Blue introduced Mould and his raging voice and guitar to a raft of Lollapalooza-minded kids — who probably didn't know much about his previous band but loved Mould's razor-edged songs and the MTV-friendly videos that accompanied them. “I got my ass handed to me a little bit by Black Sheets of Rain, so I went into Sugar with a little bit of ‘I'll show everybody,'” he says. “And everything sort of blew up immediately. I didn't wish for it, but when it happened It was like, ‘Well, here we are.'”


	With Sugar's success, Mould was thrust into a world of big-league alt-rock he'd only slightly experienced before. “It was a crazy time,” he says. “Whether I was in the office or doing press or writing and recording in the studio, I did not have a life beyond keeping that rocket in the sky for as long as I could. I wasn't a stranger to mainstream stuff, since Hüsker Dü was on The Joan Rivers Show. But when it's coming at you every day, that was sort of wild.”

	Late in 1994, Barbe told Mould he wanted to spend more time with his family, and the timing proved right for Sugar to wind down: A few months before, Kurt Cobain had killed himself. “Kurt's passing really hit me personally,” Mould says. “Sugar were in Atlanta, working in the studio, and to see Kurt Loder pop up on the TV and say, ‘Kurt Cobain is dead,' it was pretty demoralizing. It made me wonder, ‘What is this?' Kurt's situation was unique to him but not dissimilar to what was starting to happen when young people get really successful and lose track of things. And I thought, ‘Wow, this business is sort of harsh.'”


	Sugar played one week of shows in Japan early in 1995 and called it a day, with Travis moving on to other bands and Barbe shifting to academia (he currently teaches music business at the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business). In the 30 years since, Mould has made innumerable records on his own, ventured into DJ'ing and electronica, wrote scripts for World Championship Wrestling, and toured and recorded regularly with his current rhythm section, Jason Narducy and Jon Wurster. Sugar first resurfaced in 2011, as the 20th anniversary of Copper Blue approached. Mould, Barbe, and Travis got together and rehearsed for a possible reunion, but the musical vibe was not as inspiring as Mould had hoped. “I was a little resistant to the idea of going out on a 20-year thing,” he says. “I know a lot of people were doing it. So we got together and took a shot at it, and I think we all walked away thinking, ‘Eh, not right now.' At least for me, it was like, ‘I think I'm going to do what I'm doing.'”


	Last fall, as he was working what would be his next record, Here We Go Crazy, Mould began to sense a surge of interest in his old band, from music business folks who sensed a market and BMG, which was planning a Copper Blue reissue and a Sugar singles collection. “Fans have always shown interest,” he says. “But people in the business, whether it was BMG to different promoters around the country, were voicing things.” 


	Mould and Barbe had toured together, playing separate sets, but a year ago, the trio reconvened once more, at Barbe's Athens, Georgia, studio to play the old material. “This second time felt much, much better for all three of us, personally and as a former band,” Mould says. “So we started looking at getting back together to do a few things.”

	











	Earlier this year, they took the next step. When the band reformed 14 years ago, Mould had just written “House of Dead Memories,” which he never recorded but unearthed for Sugar's resurrection. “It's a failed-relationship song, nothing too unique for me,” he says with a chuckle. “But the riff is definitely a Sugar-type riff, and it was fun to get the three of us on the floor together to record for the first time in ages.” So much so, apparently, that the take of “House of Dead Memories” we're hearing is the first one. 


	In a curious bit of timing, another part of Mould's past will be resurfacing this fall. Arriving next month is 1985: The Miracle Year, a collection of unreleased Hüsker Dü live recordings from that pivotal moment in the band's history. Centered around a tape of an entire set recorded at Minneapolis' First Avenue club in January of that year, and fleshed out with other recordings from 1985, the album captures the blistering roar, frenetic energy, and punchy songs that Mould, Greg Norton, and the late Grant Hart made (along with covers of Donovan's “Sunshine Superman,” the Beatles' “Ticket to Ride” and “Helter Skelter,” and “Love Is All Around,” the Mary Tyler Moore Show theme song). It's a sound that, decades later, still surprised Mould when he heard the restored tapes. 


	“I was pretty speechless,” he says. “At that period, we were firing on so many cylinders at once that I never had a moment to stop and think. I just knew we were the best. I didn't know how much fire we had, so to hear it close to 40 years later, I was like, ‘Jesus Christ, this is insane.'”


	As Mould has talked about and written about in his memoir See a Little Light, Hüsker Dü could be an insane experience unto itself, thanks to tension between Mould and Hart, but the time frame of the collection brought back largely positive memories. “What we did in January '85 is in such contrast to whatever collapse happened in December of '87 and whatever animus happened in the decades after,” he says. “Grant and I were in touch, but it was a complicated, complex situation. We were very strong-minded, very stubborn, opinionated young men in a band. But 1985 was the year New Day Rising came out, and going into the summer Grant and I took full control of everything and we made ‘Makes No Sense at All' and then Flip Your Wig. Those were good times.”

	Mould particularly feels the absence of Hart (who died in 2017 of liver cancer) in the album's packaging. “Grant was always in charge of the art department, and it's been tough,” he says. “When a new designer comes along, I'm like, ‘Well, let me think about what Grant would have think of this.' People step in and do what they can. But for me personally, it's always, ‘What would Grant do with this?' It's a big chair to fill.”

	











	As far as Sugar, Mould says the response to their reunion announcement and “House of Dead Memories” will determine what to do beyond the two sets of concerts already set. “I don't want to get out too far in front of the skis, as they say,” he says. “People's reactions will probably guide a lot of the possibilities in front of us, whether it's more songs or more shows. All three of us are all in for whatever feels right. I just want to see if people are still interested.”

Jared Leto may have gotten the Grid shut down for good.

A new report from THR alleges that Disney is considering the nuclear option for the Tron franchise in the wake of Tron: Ares‘ struggling box office performance. The latest movie in the franchise opened last weekend to a $33.2 million domestic opening and only brought in around $60.2 million in total. As a point of comparison, Leto's last high-profile flop, the critically maligned Sony Spider-Man spinoff vehicle Morbius, opened to $39 million in 2022 before going on to bring in just $167 million worldwide.

Now, according to the trade's sources, it appears that Tron in general will “likely retire from the big screen.”

The franchise has never had the most stellar record at the box office, which is in part the reason why it took 28 years to see Tron: Legacy hit screens—and why even its own $400 million box office taking wasn't deemed worthy enough to warrant a sequel for another 15 years. But for all the lingering controversies around its eclectic lead actor, it was Leto himself who played a major part in Tron: Ares happening at all.

Disney was in development on a new Tron movie as early as October 2010, with plans to create a direct sequel to the premise and characters introduced in Legacy. The project remained in limbo until 2015, when Disney officially greenlit a Legacy sequel, only to be dramatically scrapped by the studio months later. Leto spearheaded attempts to revive a soft reboot of the series, pushing plans to elevate the Ares character included in earlier drafts into a starring role for himself. By 2017, Leto was on board to both produce and star in the new project, culminating in the Tron: Ares we now see on screen, for better or worse.

But for all of Leto's efforts—and it's clear he is not the sole reason that Ares has failed to click with a significant chunk of critics and audiences alike—they may have only served to send Tron offline for good. He's not done with genre roles any time soon though, considering he's set to play Skeletor in the upcoming Masters of the Universe movie, but perhaps the days of the actor driving a product like Ares to fruition may be as over as the Tron franchise itself might be.

That's the thing about Tron though: people have waited very long times to get more of it. The Grid might have the plug pulled for now, but it wouldn't be that surprising to see someone else take a crack at rebooting it back to life in another decade or two.
