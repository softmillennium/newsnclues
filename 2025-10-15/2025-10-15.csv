            President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to relocate World Cup matches set to be played next year in suburban Boston, after suggesting that parts of the city had been “taken over” by unrest.
    


            Foxborough, Massachusetts, home to the NFL's New England Patriots and about 30 miles from Boston, is set to stage matches as the US cohosts the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada. Trump was asked about Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu, a Democrat whom he called “intelligent” but “radical left.”
    


            “We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. “I love the people of Boston and I know the games are sold out. But your mayor is not good.”
    


            He suggested “they're taking over parts of Boston” without offering details, but added “we could get them back in about two seconds.”
    


            The Trump administration has already deployed National Guard troops to Washington and Memphis, and efforts to do so in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, have sparked legal fights.
    


            Wu's office did not react directly to Trump's threat, issuing a statement that read, “Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions.”
    


            Trump's comments came during his meeting with Argentina President Javier Milei and it wasn't immediately clear what he was referring to by parts of Boston having been seized. Earlier this month, however, there were multiple arrests in connection with a pro-Palestinian protest that turned violent on Boston Common. Four police officers were injured.
    


            Trump has previously suggested he could declare cities “not safe” for the 104-game soccer tournament and alter a detailed hosting plan that FIFA confirmed in 2022. It includes games at NFL stadiums near New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
    


Trump's travel ban allows athletes from affected nations into US for the World Cup and Olympics. Fans may be stuck at home



            World Cup host sites aren't up to Trump. The 11 US cities — plus three in Mexico and two in Canada — are contracted with FIFA, which would face significant logistical and legal issues to make changes in the eight months before the June 11 kickoff.
    


            “It's FIFA's tournament, FIFA's jurisdiction, FIFA makes those decisions,” the soccer body's vice president Victor Montagliani said earlier this month at a sports business conference in London.
    


            Trump nonetheless said, “If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who's phenomenal – and I would say, ‘Let's move into another location' and they would do that.”
    


            The president meant FIFA head Gianni Infantino, a close ally. Trump said Infantino “wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.”

The US State Department said on Tuesday that it has revoked the visas of several individuals who publicly celebrated the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Kirk, who co-founded Turning Point USA and rose to prominence by debating politics on college campuses, was killed by a sniper last month while speaking to students in Utah.

In a post on X on Tuesday – Kirk's birthday – the State Department said that the US “has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans.”

The department posted screenshots of messages and quotes it said were made by six people from Germany, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Paraguay, and South Africa.

An Argentinian national allegedly accused Kirk of spreading racist views and claimed he “deserved” to die, while a German national allegedly wrote, “when fascists die, democrats don't complain.” A person from Brazil was said to have written that Kirk “was the reason for a Nazi rally where they marched in homage to him” and had “died too late.”

An Argentine national said that Kirk “devoted his entire life spreading racist, xenophobic, misogynistic rhetoric” and deserves to burn in hell.Visa revoked. pic.twitter.com/4bQoXisHsz

The US State Department said the posts were “just a few examples of aliens who are no longer welcome in the US,” adding that it would continue to identify foreigners who celebrated Kirk's death.

A Mexican national said that Kirk “died being a racist, he died being a misogynist” and stated that “there are people who deserve to die. There are people who would make the world better off dead.”Visa revoked.

On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump posthumously awarded Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. Kirk's widow, Erika, received the medal on his behalf.

Dozens of people in the US have lost their jobs or been suspended for mocking or justifying Kirk's death. Although most Democrats condemned the killing, Trump and other Republicans have blamed the “radical left” for inciting political violence.

France is leading an EU effort to scan private messages, Telegram founder Pavel Durov said on Tuesday. The bloc recently delayed the proposed “Chat Control” law over privacy concerns after Germany opposed the plan, the Russian-born billionaire stressed.

The proposed legislation, intended to combat child sexual abuse material (CSAM), would require digital platforms to detect and report harmful content, including messages protected by end-to-end encryption. While EU officials have presented it as a tool to protect children online, critics argue that it risks enabling mass surveillance and seriously undermining digital privacy.

Durov shared a message Telegram sent to its French users, accusing politicians of supporting what he described as “an authoritarian law.” The post mentioned both current and former interior ministers, Laurent Nunez and Bruno Retailleau, as backers of the legislation that claims to “fight crime,” but targets regular people.

“Today, we defended privacy: Germany's sudden stand saved our rights. But freedoms are still threatened. While French leaders push for total access to private messages, the basic rights of French people – and all Europeans – remain in danger,” the message reads.

🇪🇺 Telegram sent this message to all its users in France regarding Chat Control. People must know the names of those who try to steal their freedoms:Today, the European Union nearly banned your right to privacy. It was set to vote on a law that would force apps to scan every…

The billionaire added that the proposed measure exempts officials and police messages, adding that it would fail to stop criminals that could just use VPNs or special websites to hide.

The legislation, often referred to as “Chat Control,” was shelved earlier this week over worries it could undermine fundamental privacy rights. Luxembourg, Austria, Germany and Poland had previously voiced strong opposition, warning that the bill could set a dangerous precedent for scanning all forms of online communication and threaten fundamental privacy rights.

Durov, who has repeatedly clashed with Western governments, has faced legal pressure in Europe over Telegram's content policies. Last year, the entrepreneur was arrested in Paris and charged with complicity in crimes linked to Telegram users, but was released on bail. He called the case politically motivated.

The Telegram founder has also accused French intelligence of pressuring him to suppress conservative voices during elections in Moldova and Romania. According to Durov, EU laws such as the Digital Services Act and the AI Act are paving the way for the centralized control of information.

British authorities are losing control over the country's borders amid soaring illegal immigration, according to UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood.

The cabinet official is expected to deliver the warning at a summit with Balkan interior ministers in London on Wednesday, which will be focused on curbing migrant flows to the UK.

According to the excerpts of her planned speech, which has already been published by several UK outlets, Mahmood will point out that “the public rightly expect that their government will be able to determine who enters their country and who must leave.”

“Today, in this country, that is not the case,” she acknowledges in the pre-written address. “The failure to bring order to our borders is eroding trust not just in us as political leaders… but in the credibility of the state itself.”

Still, Mahmood stresses that the only way to rectify the issue is international cooperation, not “turn[ing] inwards,” with one way being the creation of “return hubs” for migrants.

On Tuesday, she announced that the government would raise the English-language requirement for migrants from a General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) to A-level proficiency.

The UK has for years been reeling under the migration crisis, with government data showing 49,000 irregular arrivals in the year ending June 2025, up 27% from the similar period the previous year. Small-boat crossings accounted for 88% of these, up 38% year on year.

Amid what many see as the Labour government's failure to resolve the crisis, large demonstrations were held across Britain last month as part of “Operation Raise the Colours,” with protesters waving St. George's and Union Jack flags.

Meanwhile, support for the anti-immigration and EU-skeptical Reform party, led by MP Nigel Farage, has risen to 35%, with Labour and the Conservatives trailing behind at 20% and 17% respectively, according to a poll conducted by the BMG research company which was released last month.

Politico documented the use of slurs, including the N-word and a homophobic term, and antisemitic comments in chats

Some leaders of Young Republican groups throughout the country are facing major backlash after some of their racist and highly offensive messages in private group chats were revealed by Politico.

Democratic and Republican politicians denounced the language used and criticized the group. The Young Republican National Federation has called for resignations. The Kansas Young Republican group has been shut down and now a handful of those involved in the racist chat have lost their jobs.

The Young Republican National Federation called on those involved in the chat to “immediately resign from all positions” within the organization.

Politico on Tuesday revealed 2,900 pages of leaked chats from a Telegram group chat involving Young Republican leaders. The chats included racist and offensive language.

Members of the group, which included people actively working with elected officials and some attempting to take leadership positions in the national Young Republican organization, were aware that if the contents of their messages were revealed they could face severe repercussions.

“If we ever had a leak of this chat we would be cooked fr fr,” said Bobby Walker in the chat, who was recently made chair of the New York State Young Republicans.

But the Young Republicans kept typing away, sharing offensive messages and racist comments.

As Politico reports, members in the chat referred to Black people as monkeys and “the watermelon people”. They joked about killing political opponents by putting them in gas chambers. “I love hitler,” one chat member quipped, who also made antisemitic comments. Another participant called the mass rape of Indigenous people “epic”. One member expressed his support for Republicans he believed supported slavery. And a participant talked about driving a competing Young Republican opponent to suicide.

Politico documented that slurs and epithets, including the N-word and a homophobic term. The word “retarded” appeared more than 251 times combined in the chat.

Democrats were also quick to decry the Young Republicans' chat and politicians associated with the group's participants.

Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, said Republican representatives Mike Lawler and Elise Stefanik have been “palling around with these racist, antisemitic and bigoted ‘Young Republicans' for years,” adding that the representatives' “phony outrage” was only for show.

Kathy Hochul, the New York governor, expressed outrage at the messages.

“Some bad apples? These are the future of the Republican party,” Hochul said during a press conference. “This is so vile it's hard to find the words to put into context that these are people who are part of one of two major parties and they believe in gas chambers and rape and discrimination based on the color of people's skin.”

Hochul also called on the chat members to be kicked out of the Republican party. “This bullshit has to stop,” she added.

Republicans around the country have also tried to distance themselves from the chat participants, with one notable exception: JD Vance.

In a post on X, the vice-president pointed at Democratic candidate for Virginia attorney general Jay Jones, who was embroiled in a texting scandal of his own. It was revealed earlier this month that Jones texted a colleague about shooting a Republican political adversary.

Vance on X said Jones's comments were “way worse” than the Young Republicans' group chat, adding that he refuses to “join the pearl clutching when powerful people call for political violence”. Others on the right, who have denounced the Young Republicans' chat, similarly pointed to Jones's text scandal, including rightwing influencer Brilyn Hollyhand.

Outside social media, however, the Young Republicans' leaked chats have led to some to lose their jobs.

The former chair of the New York State Young Republicans at the time of the chats, Peter Giunta, was one of the most prominent participants. Giunta was fired from his position as New York assembly member Michael Reilly's chief of staff.

“The comments shared in the group chat that have been reported are extremely troubling and disappointing. They do not align with my values. As a result, Mr Giunta's assignment in my office has ended,” Reilly said in a statement to Staten Island Live.

Stefanik, a New York Republican representative who previously lauded Giunta for his “tremendous leadership” of the New York Young Republicans, decried the chat, with a spokesperson telling Politico that Stefanik “calls for any NY Young Republicans responsible for these horrific comments in this chat to step down immediately”. The spokesperson clarified the congresswoman did not employ anyone in the chat.

Stefanik then took to social media on Tuesday night, called the Politico story a “hit piece”, pointed to the Jones texting scandal and accused New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani of embracing “terrorist sympathizers”.

Another participant from New York, Joe Maligno, is no longer working for the New York state unified court system.

The scandal has also led to one Young Republican chapter to be placed on hold. The Kansas Republican party deactivated the state's Young Republican organization after Politico's report. Two top members of the state's Young Republican group were active in the chat, with Politico reporting that the group's vice-chair, William Hendrix, used the N-word more than a dozen times. Prior to the story's publication, Hendrix lost his job with the Kansas attorney general, Kris Kobach, due to the messages.

One of the chat's members, Vermont state senator Samuel Douglass, is facing calls to step down after the revelations. And Bobby Walker, who was slated to join candidate Peter Oberacker's congressional campaign, had his job offer revoked.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Backlash as California governor rejects measure allowing preferential treatment for descendants of enslaved people

California's governor, Gavin Newsom, is facing backlash from progressives over his veto of a reparations bill that would have allowed universities to give preference to applicants descended from enslaved people.

Assembly Bill 7, widely supported by Democratic lawmakers, established that California colleges “may consider” preferential treatment for individuals who establish direct lineage to a person subjected to American chattel slavery before 1900. The legislation, one of several reparations measures Newsom has vetoed, did not compel institutions to change admissions policies, and supporters said it was carefully written to withstand legal challenges.

Proponents of the bill said that by focusing on connections to slavery, instead of race, the bill did not violate bans on affirmative action or the US supreme court's 2023 ruling against race-consciousness in admissions. AB7 also made clear that preferential treatment based on race remained unlawful and institutions could not violate federal law.

In a brief veto message on Monday, Newsom, a Democrat, said the bill was “unnecessary” since “institutions already have the authority to determine whether to provide admissions preferences”. He “encouraged” colleges to “review and determine how, when, and if this type of preference can be adopted”.

AB7 supporters and racial justice advocates said on Tuesday that the veto was a discouraging setback in the long-running reparations movement in California and they were taken aback by Newsom's opposition to a bill aligned with his stated commitment to address disparities stemming from slavery.

“As a Black Californian and Black American, I'm deeply disappointed,” Isaac Bryan, a Democratic assembly member and AB7 author, told the Guardian. “Black Americans are looking for deeper solidarity in this moment when the federal government is lethally rejecting our existence, our history, our employment in the federal government, our access to institutions of higher learning, and our rights to healthcare and nutritional assistance.”

Bryan said he was surprised by the veto, noting his bill had support from more than two-thirds of state lawmakers and compared with other bills this year, drew especially high numbers of supporters testifying in favor of it. Opposition did not show up to the final two committee hearings and Newsom never offered amendments that could have addressed his concerns, Bryan added.

“The greatest legacy of slavery is the wealth gap between Black Americans and other people in society,” Bryan said. “One of the ways we could have improved upward mobility would have been to allow greater access to institutions of higher learning … We're going to have to go back to the drawing board and fight for the tangible repair that folks deserve.”

Bryan said he was skeptical of Newsom's claim that the bill was “unnecessary”, noting that the legislature had previously enacted bills meant to bolster and codify existing state laws and policies. He cited Newsom's support of his 2024 reform bill to explicitly authorize alternatives to jail that were already happening in some communities, as well as California enshrining established abortion rights into its constitution.

“The veto message was unsatisfactory and hypocritical,” Bryan said. “When you call something ‘unnecessary' that is this important and meaningful, especially to Black Americans, that language is perhaps more harmful than was realized.”

Newsom's spokesperson declined to comment.

Legal scholars were divided about potential challenges the law might have faced. Two experts told the Los Angeles Times the bill was properly tailored to reduce legal risks by supporting a specific descendant community, while critics of the legislation said it was an unconstitutional workaround of affirmative action bans.

Bryan noted the state had poured significant resources into litigation to defend Californians and progressive policies during Donald Trump's second term. The state, he said, would have been well-positioned to defend AB7, and a court battle could have affirmed California's right to enact reparative policies, laying the foundation for future work.

He said he was also worried the veto would make California institutions less likely to pursue these kinds of admissions efforts without the explicit support AB7 offered.

The governor's legacy on reparations is mixed.

In 2020, he signed a first-in-the-nation law establishing a taskforce to study reparations for Black Americans. Last year, he backed legislation offering a formal apology for slavery.

Newsom recently supported the creation of the Bureau for Descendants of American Slavery, the first-ever permanent state agency dedicated to advancing reparative initiatives.

This week, however, he also vetoed a bill mandating the state investigate claims from families who say the government unjustly seized their property due to their race, with Newsom citing fiscal concerns. And he cited concerns about legal risks in his veto of a bill that would have set aside 10% of funds from a first-time homebuyers loan program for enslaved people's descendants.

Dr David C Turner III, who helped coordinate a coalition supporting AB7, said Newsom's veto “showed a lack of political imagination and lack of political will”.

Turner, a senior adviser for the Alliance for Boys and Men of Color, a national network of advocacy groups, said the rejection of the bill by a governor with widely discussed presidential ambitions, was part of a pattern of mainstream Democrats being “afraid of looking too politically woke and too politically left”.

“His opposition is leaning into fascist values and makes no apologies about it. So he needs to lean into progressive values and leftist populism and do the things that are popular because that will actually get him elected,” Turner said. “He wants to position himself as a champion of social justice issues and diversity and higher education … He apologizes for slavery, but when bills come across his desk to actually rectify these things, he vetoes them.”

Turner, who is also a professor of Black life and racial justice at University of California, Los Angeles, said he had seen first-hand the impact of academia's lack of diversity, noting that in his courses on social movements, community organizing, youth justice and other topics, he often has no more than six Black students in classes with 100 members.

“A lot of talented Black students opt to go to other places, because they want to feel as if their campuses are going to protect them,” he said. Signing AB7, he added, “would have sent a message to California's Black students and students of color more broadly that we see you and we are going to work to rectify the harm that we the state have caused in your communities.”

Bryan and Turner said AB7 supporters would redouble efforts to get policies enacted that directly address the lingering consequences of slavery and were hopeful the state's new bureau would create momentum.

Turner said campus groups should fight to make admissions more equitable at their institutions. While there will be discussions of adjusting language or strategies to get policies such as AB7 adopted, advocates' core intent would not change, he said: “We're fighting the long fight. This won't be the last time the governor hears from us. We're going to regroup and figure this out together, because that is the long tradition of organizing we come from.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Experts are enforcing emergency measures to prevent the spread of the highly contagious neurodegenerative disease

Wildlife officials in Florida have discovered only the second case in the state of a deadly infection known colloquially as “zombie deer disease”, and are enforcing emergency measures to try to prevent a spread.

The highly contagious chronic wasting disease (CWD) was found during routine screening in the carcass of a young white-tailed doe that was struck by a vehicle in Holmes county, close to the Alabama border, early last month. The only previous recorded instance in Florida was in a four-year-old doe killed about a mile away in June 2023.

Experts are warning of a domino effect on wildlife management if the neurodegenerative disease, more prevalent in western and north-eastern states, is not contained. Although not harmful to humans, it has no vaccine or cure, and spreads easily through animal-to-animal contact, environmental contamination and ticks.

“This disease right now is probably the greatest threat to deer and deer hunting in North America,” said wildlife biologist Steven Shea, an expert in deer populations who manages more than half a million acres of species habitat in central Florida.

“Based on everything we know, CWD is going to continue to spread. Every instance where it's been tried to be contained and eradicated has been unsuccessful. So really what agencies are trying to do is basically slow down the spread, keep it in a relatively small area.”

The Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission (FWC) has implemented a special management zone and program of enhanced surveillance and monitoring in Holmes and neighboring Jackson and Washington counties. Test results are pending on 90 animals.

The disease is a so-called silent killer because an infected deer can live for several years without exhibiting symptoms. It will eventually succumb to brain tissue damage and experience a range of symptoms including weight loss, behavioral abnormalities, loss of coordination, excessive salivation and eventually death, according to the University of Florida's department of wildlife ecology and conservation.

The state's white-tailed deer population is estimated at up to 700,000, with about 100,000 hunted each year, making it Florida's most popular game animal.

FWC implemented special rules in the CWD management zone for the deer hunting season beginning later this month, including mandatory checking of all carcasses.

“Florida's early detection puts us in a best-case scenario for CWD management, as a smaller outbreak is more realistic to contain,” James Kelly, the commission's CWD surveillance coordinator, said in a statement.

“Hunters are our first line of defense in managing this disease. Each sample helps us track the spread of the disease and informs our strategies to manage it effectively.”

Shea said he feared a “domino effect” if CWD took hold in Florida.

“Hunters have to send a head in for testing, they're waiting on the meat, and if it comes back positive they have to discard the meat,” he said.

“So we're fearful the number of hunters of white-tailed deer will drop.

A surname is written after the first name, which is also referred to as a given name or, traditionally, a Christian name. A closer look at the history of surnames reveals some fascinating insights into their origins.
  It may come as a surprise to some that up until about 1,000 years ago, surnames were                                    



                                                                                Rehearsal time is over. The world's best and most ambitious young pianists have descended on Warsaw for the Frederic Chopin International Piano Competition — for some, a gateway to classical music glory. 
Fans from around the globe snapped up tickets as much as a year ago. The lucky ones attended the opening night concert on Oct. 3 and will follow along as the contest builds to a thrilling climax on Oct. 20.
Winning the Chopin International — held every five years in the 19th-century composer's homeland — can raise the curtain to playing at venues across the globe and signing contracts

While many early surnames in England were strongly influenced by the work people did, like Carpenter or Plumber, jobs were not the only factor. Physical characteristics, personal nicknames, geographical locations and even parents' first names also played a role.
  It's not hard to imagine how the color of a person's hair could have led to a surname like “Redhead” or “White,” while a darker complexion might have resulted in the last name “Black.” Meanwhile, someone known as a quick runner might have earned the surname “Swift,” while a clever or cunning individual could have been called “Fox”                                    ","{'href': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}","world"

High-level trade talks between Canadian and U.S. officials have resumed in Washington as a united front among the provinces has begun to unravel in the face of punishing tariffs on autos, steel, aluminum and lumber.

Privy Council Clerk Michael Sabia, the country's top public servant, has joined Canadian Ambassador Kirsten Hillman, the chief trade negotiator, in Washington to continue talks with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, according to the Prime Minister's Office. 

Dominic LeBlanc, the minister responsible for Canada-U.S. trade, is also in Washington as part of the negotiating team, his communications director Jean-Sébastien Comeau said. 

Prime Minister Mark Carney is holding a morning virtual cabinet meeting where the trade talks are expected to be high on the agenda.

Canadian softwood producers brace for impact from new U.S. tariffs

Ottawa has been focused on lifting U.S. sectoral tariffs, which President Donald Trump has justified under a national-security provision known as Section 232 in American trade law. 

When the U.S. talks broke for the weekend, Mr. Carney said they were at an intense stage, as his negotiating team sought tariff relief on key Canadian sectors.

The latest hit to the Canadian economy came late Tuesday when Stellantis announced it was shifting a production line at its Brampton plant to one in the United States. On same day, U.S. tariffs of 10 per cent on softwood lumber came into effect, bringing the total tariff on such products to 45 per cent.

The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of 50 per cent on steel and aluminum, and 25 per cent on Canadian autos, with a carve-out for the value of the vehicle made from U.S. parts.

Stellantis shifts Jeep production to Illinois from Brampton

The Canadian premiers, who previously stood united with Ottawa, have begun to criticize the Prime Minister's trade strategy. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has called for countertariffs, while B.C. Premier David Eby has been critical of Ottawa over U.S. softwood tariffs that are forcing lumber mill shutdowns.

In Kenora, Ont., Mr. Ford told reporters he's meeting the Prime Minister in Toronto on Thursday and will urge him to hit the Americans hard on retaliatory tariffs unless a deal is reached.

Meanwhile, Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe and Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew are calling on Ottawa to lift its 100-per-cent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles so that Beijing will once again open its doors to Canadian canola.

Brian Clow, who managed U.S. trade as deputy chief of staff to former prime minister Justin Trudeau, said the premiers are not as united as they were during the 2018 NAFTA negotiations. He said this is partly because Mr. Trump is doing more tariff damage than in his first term.

“So the premiers are feeling more pressure to save entire industries that risk dying completely without a resolution,” Mr. Clow said. “It's not helpful to the federal negotiators when premiers are openly lobbying Ottawa to support their sectors at the expense of another province.”

Mr. Clow said China is seeking to exploit those divisions by pitting Western canola against Ontario cars. 

After news broke about Stellantis moving production of the Jeep Compass to Illinois as part of a US$13-billion plan to boost U.S. production, the Prime Minister promised to help the displaced workers.

“We are working with the company to develop the right measures to protect Stellantis employees and to create new opportunities for them in and around Brampton,” he said in a Tuesday statement. 

However, he warned that Stellantis's move is a “direct consequence of current U.S. tariffs and potential future U.S. trade actions.”

Opinion: Canada's auto industry has faced struggles before. We endured then and can endure now

“Until a more certain trade environment for the North American auto sector is established through the upcoming review of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), decisions on new investments in the auto sector will continue to be affected,” he said.

The Prime Minister promised that the coming Nov. 4 federal budget will contain strategic investments that will transform “our economy from being overly reliant on our largest trade partner to being resilient to global shocks.”

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre was quick to criticize Mr. Carney for failing to reach a deal with the Americans, and leaving 3,000 Stellantis auto workers in the lurch.

“Mark Carney's response is for auto workers to wait until he can renegotiate CUSMA. After failing to get the deal he promised three months ago, auto workers can no longer afford to wait,” he said in a Wednesday statement. 

“Thousands now have to worry about paying their mortgages, putting food on the table or having to tell their kids they can't afford to register for hockey this winter.”

Mr. Poilievre noted that 700 General Motors auto workers in Oshawa will soon lose their jobs as well, and GM has announced a US$4-billion investment in American auto plants.

Mr. Carney, who ran on a promise to defend the Canadian economy against U.S. protectionism, has been under pressure to secure relief from punitive U.S. tariffs.

Trade talks between the two countries faltered after no deal was reached by an August deadline imposed by Mr. Trump. But the relationship appeared to strengthen in the weeks leading up to Tuesday's visit, which was Mr. Carney's second as Prime Minister after a previous trip in May.

Aid trucks rolled into Gaza on Wednesday and Israel resumed preparations to open the main Rafah crossing after a dispute over the return of the bodies of dead hostages that had threatened to derail the fragile ceasefire deal with Hamas. 

Israel had threatened to keep Rafah shut and reduce aid supplies because Hamas was returning bodies too slowly, showing the risks to a truce that has stopped two years of devastating warfare in Gaza and freed all living hostages held by Hamas. 

Here's what you need to know about Gaza and the Israel-Hamas war, including the ceasefire deal, the toll of the war so far and what comes next.

However, the militant group returned more Israeli bodies overnight, and an Israeli security official said on Wednesday preparations were under way to open Rafah to Gazan citizens, while a second official said that 600 aid trucks would go in.

Hamas returned four bodies confirmed as dead hostages on Monday and another four bodies late on Tuesday, though Israeli authorities said one of those bodies was not that of a hostage. 

The dispute over the return of bodies still has the potential to upset the ceasefire deal along with other major issues that are yet to be resolved. 

Palestinians voiced ongoing struggles as they have 'no food, no housing' in Gaza City.

Reuters

Israel has said that the next phase of the truce calls for Hamas to disarm and cede power, which it has so far refused to do. It has launched a security crackdown, parading its power in Gaza through public executions and clashes with local clans. 

Longer-term elements of the ceasefire plan, including how Gaza will be governed, the make-up of an international “stabilization force” and moves toward the creation of a Palestinian state have yet to emerge. 

Israelis return to Oct. 7 sites, but some don't see long-lasting peace

Twenty-one bodies of hostages remain in Gaza, though some may be very hard to find or recover because of destruction during the conflict. An international task force is meant to find them. 

The deal also requires Israel to return the bodies of 360 Palestinian militants killed in battle. The first group of 45 was handed over on Tuesday and were being identified, said Palestinian health authorities.

The war has caused a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, with nearly all inhabitants driven from their homes, a global hunger monitor saying famine was present in the enclave and health authorities overwhelmed. 

“Our situation is utterly tragic. We went back to our homes in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood and found there are no homes at all. There is no shelter. Nothing,” said Moemen Hassanein in Gaza City, with tents and shanties behind him.

Reuters video showed a first group of trucks moving from the Egyptian side of the border into the Rafah crossing at dawn on Wednesday, some tankers carrying fuel and others loaded with pallets of aid. 

Opinion: Donald Trump was the essential element for the Gaza ceasefire

However, it was not clear if that convoy would complete its crossing into Gaza as part of the 600 trucks that were due to enter the enclave on Wednesday – the daily number required under the ceasefire plan. Aid trucks entered Gaza through other crossings. 

The Rafah crossing with Egypt is due to be open for people to cross on Thursday with a European Union mission deployed there, two sources said. It was not immediately clear if there would be any restrictions applied on the movement of people.

The Palestinian Authority, which governs in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said it was preparing to operate the crossing. 

Some Palestinians awaiting medical evacuation told Reuters they had not yet received notification to prepare for travel.

Israel's public broadcaster Kan reported that Wednesday's aid deliveries would include food, medical supplies, fuel, cooking gas and equipment to repair vital infrastructure. 

“Humanitarian aid continues to enter the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom Crossing and other crossings after Israeli security inspection,” the Israeli security official said.

Underscoring the political challenges facing the truce, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, an opponent of the ceasefire plan, said on X that the aid delivery was a “disgrace.”

“Nazi terrorism understands only force, and the only way to solve problems with it is to wipe it off the face of the earth,” he added, accusing Hamas of lies and abuse over the return of hostages' bodies.

Several other Palestinian factions in Gaza have backed a days-long Hamas security crackdown as it battles local clans. 

The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, one of the groups backing the Hamas crackdown, described the clans being targeted as “hubs of crime.” Hamas has executed several people that it accused of collaborating with Israel.

The U.S. military's Middle East command called on Hamas to “suspend violence and shooting at innocent Palestinian civilians” and to disarm “without delay.” 

U.S. President Donald Trump, who brokered the ceasefire deal, this week endorsed Hamas' crackdown on gangs, while warning it would face air strikes if it did not later disarm.

Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas condemned the public executions after a video, authenticated by Reuters, showed masked gunmen shooting dead seven men in a Gaza street. 

Israeli forces inside Gaza have pulled back to what the truce deal calls a yellow line just outside the main cities. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said it would immediately enforce any violation of the line. 

President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants dead hostages held in Gaza back and warns Hamas 'if they don't disarm, we will disarm them.'

NEW YORK, NY, Oct. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 

VaynerX, in partnership with Muck Rack and Ipsos, today announced the release of a new research report, Inside Modern PR: Trust, Timing & Building Credibility – A Deep Dive Into Earned Attention in 2025. The report provides a comprehensive look at the evolving landscape of media consumption and attention, highlighting a critical new mandate for public relations practitioners. 

The research, which surveyed US consumers and brand leaders, reveals that while legacy media remains the anchor of trust (57% of consumers cite local news as their most trusted source), social platforms dominate the news diet for younger audiences (85% of 18–34-year-olds). This coexisting but nuanced environment demands that effective modern PR must fuse the credibility signals of traditional media with the scale and immediacy of social. 

Key Findings from the Report:

“There's a real opportunity for brand leaders that understand how to harness legacy and social media alongside their consumers,” said VaynerX CMO Avery Akkineni. “Effective modern PR strategies will consistently deliver evidence and resonance, while ensuring messages are authentic, verifiable, and everywhere. It's exactly what we're helping our clients do every single day across VaynerX.”

“This research echoes what communicators tell us every day, credibility isn't static, it's earned moment by moment,” added Greg Galant, cofounder and CEO of Muck Rack. “PR leaders are redefining trust in real time. The ones who will succeed are those who show up authentically across platforms, back their stories with evidence and build reputations that stand up to public scrutiny.”

“Truth and trust are the foundation of what we do at Ipsos, ensuring decisions - from the ballot box to the board room - are rooted in evidence and facts,” said Nick Mercurio, Chief Client & Growth Officer, Ipsos North America. “As misinformation fuels skepticism, it creates huge implications and a clear opportunity for brands. Companies that lead with honesty and consistency will be the ones to grow.”

Dozens of news organizations have refused to accept Pentagon's new press policy, saying it amounts to a crackdown on the media.

Several US and international news organizations on Tuesday refused to sign the new rules proposed by the Pentagon for media access.

At least 30 news outlets, including the New York Times, the Associated Press, Reuters, AFP and Fox News, rejected the Pentagon's new media policy, saying that it violates the constitutionally protected right to free speech. 

The Pentagon had warned that it would revoke press badges for news organizations that did not agree with the media access rules. 

Under the new policy, journalists have to acknowledge that they could be deemed security risks and have their Pentagon press badges revoked if they ask department employees to disclose classified and some types of unclassified information.

The new rules come after the Department of Defense has already restricted media access inside the Pentagon, forced some outlets to vacate offices in the building, and reduced the number of press briefings. 

Chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement on Monday: ""The policy does not ask for them to agree, just to acknowledge that they understand what our policy is.""

Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth called the requirements ""common sense,"" adding that ""we're trying to make sure national security is respected.""

The Pentagon Press Association (PPA) said, the media policy ""gags Pentagon employees"" by threatening retaliation against reporters who seek out information that has not been pre-approved for release.

Major broadcasting networks ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News and NBC issued a joint statement saying they will not sign the new rules, which would ""restrict journalists' ability to keep the nation and the world informed of important national security issues.""

""The policy is without precedent and threatens core journalistic protections. We will continue to cover the US military as each of our organizations has done for many decades, upholding the principles of a free and independent press,"" the five networks said in a joint statement.

In addition to Fox News, other conservative outlets are also reportedly refusing to agree to the new policy which could see a total of some 100 press passes revoked.

However, at least one news organization did sign the new policy: the far-right cable network One America News.

A state-backed semiconductor association says it ""firmly opposes"" the Netherlands taking control of a European subsidiary of Chinese chip company Wingtech. The Dutch cited national security and availability concerns.

China's leading semiconductor association on Tuesday said the Dutch government was ""abusing the concept of 'national security'"" in taking control of Nijmegen-based semiconductor manufacturer Nexperia, a fully-owned subsidiary of Chinese company Wingtech. 

Wingtech's shares slid by the maximum permitted 10% before being frozen in Tuesday's trading in Shanghai for a second consecutive day, after the Netherlands announced the move late on Sunday. 

The Netherlands invoked the country's Goods Availability Act citing national security concerns to take control of Nexperia in late September, the government said when it announced the move late on Sunday evening. 

The company can continue regular production and operation, but its decisions can be blocked or reversed by the Dutch government. 

The government said in its statement that it took the step because of ""recent and acute signals of serious governance shortcomings and actions"" within Nexperia. 

The company makes chips for cars and consumer electronics — including ""wide gap"" chips suited for AI projects and other high-voltage, high-temperature usage. Until Wingtech's 2018 buyout for €3.63 billion (roughly $4.2 billion at current exchange rates) it was a subsidiary of engineering giant Philips.

The Netherlands cited concerns about technology transfers to Wingtech in its statement.

Semiconductor shortages and availability issues have hampered an array of industries for several years, with the industry a growing battleground for governments around the world.

China has a large and growing foothold in the industry, though it still lags behind regional rivals like Taiwan and South Korea, while US companies still lead the world in sales and the country plans to considerably bolster its declined manufacturing capacity in the next few years.

The China Semiconductor Indusrty Association (CSIA) responded critically to the Dutch move early on Tuesday, as Nexperia parent company Wingtech's share values plummeted. 

""We oppose the practice of abusing the concept of 'national security' and imposing selective and discriminatory restrictions on overseas branches of Chinese enterprises,"" the CSIA said in a statement. 

""Discriminatory measures targeting specific enterprises with undermine the open, inclusive and collaborative global semiconductor ecosystem, and we firmly oppose such measures,"" it said. 

A Foreign Ministry spokesman in Beijing had made similar comments about China consistently opposing ""generalizing the concept of national security."" 

Stock markets in Asia reacted uneasily to the news early this week. 

Wingtech Technology's share price fell by the maximum permitted 10% for a second consecutive day and was then frozen. The CSI Semiconductor Industry Index was also down 6.9% in Tuesday's trade.

The US put Wingtech on its ""entity list"" of companies seen as threats to national security, for its alleged role in ""aiding China's government's efforts to acquire entities with sensitive semiconductor manufacturing capacity,"" and last month expanded its list to include subsidiaries. 

Reuters news agency, however, quoted a Dutch Economic Affairs Ministry spokesperson as saying its Nexperia decision and the timing were ""purely coincidental."" 

Nexperia itself had said it would comply with new US rules and that its Chinese parent company was kept at arm's length.

Wingtech called the Dutch intervention ""excessive interference driven by geopolitical bias,"" and also accused non-Chinese executives of a ""cloaked power grab,"" trying to alter the equity structure of the 100%-Wingtech-owned company via the courts.

Wingtech and Nexperia also came under scrutiny in the UK in 2022, when the Chinese company used its Dutch subsidiary to acquire an 86% stake in the UK's largest microchip plant, Newport Wafer Fab. The government later forced the company to divest, deeming the Chinese ownership a national security risk.

NATO defense ministers are meeting in Brussels after Russian drones and aircraft violated member states' airspace. Meanwhile, the WHO says one of its teams came under attack in Ukraine. DW has more.             

       Here is a roundup of news related to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on October 15, 2025.

Berlin will finance a US weapons package worth $500 million (roughly €429.8 million) for Ukraine, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius announced on Wednesday.

Speaking in Brussels at a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, Pistorius said the package will include air defense systems, Patriot missiles, radar systems and precision-guided artillery rockets and ammunition.

The package addresses ""a number of urgent requirements of Ukraine,"" Pistorius said.

Separately, the German defense minister also announced the delivery of another two IRIS-T air defense systems, including a number of guided missiles, shoulder-fired air defense missiles, anti-tank weapons, communication devices and hand-held weapons.

German military aid to Ukraine totalled over $2 billion, Pistorius said.

Swedish armed forces were following on Wednesday a Russian submarine that entered the Baltic Sea a day earlier, in what the Swedish military described as a ""routine operation.""

The submarine entered the Baltic Sea via the Great Belt, a Danish strait, according to a statement by the Swedish military.

""The armed forces' jet fighters and warships met up with the submarine in the Kattegatt [strait between Denmark and Sweden] and are now following it,"" the military said, describing it as a ""a routine operation taking place in close collaboration with our allies.""

The military added that it had a ""good overview of our immediate vicinity.""

Tensions have flared in the Baltic Sea since Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said on Wednesday the military alliance was testing new anti-drone defenses on its eastern flank to counter threats from Moscow.

""NATO will implement a number of additional counter drone measures that will build on and expand and accelerate our ability to counter drones,"" Rutte said after a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels. ""We are testing integrated systems that will help us detect, track and neutralise aerial threats.""

The announcement comes as the European Union is looking into setting up a ""drone wall"" to counter the threat of Russian drones infiltrating EU airspace, which has happened at least in Poland and Estonia recently, with more drone sightings having temporarily groundede flights in several European airports.

Rutte has stressed there would be no duplication between the NATO and EU drone projects.

""Let me say it once and for all, the EU and NATO are working hand in hand, closely together, and we both know our strength,"" he said.

US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned Moscow on Wednesday that Washington and its allies were ready to ""impose costs on Russia for its continued aggression"" if the Ukraine war doesn't end.

""If we must take this step, the US War Department stands ready to do our part in ways that only the United States can do,"" Hegseth said at a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group — a coalition of over 50 countries focused on streamlining the delivery of military equipment to Ukraine — at NATO headquarters.

NATO defense ministers are meeting to look at ways to boost the alliance's ability to defend against airspace violations by Russia and bolster support for Ukraine.

Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told a news conference that the US was ready to impose tariffs on China over its Russian oil purchase but only if European allies were willing to take part in such a measure.

""It is the purchase of Russian oil by China that fuels the Russian war machines. China buys 60%, six zero percent, of Russian energy. They buy 90% of Iranian energy,"" he said.

The Trump administration has reignited its trade war with Beijing, with Trump threatening a new whopping 100% additional tariffs in reaction to China's restrictions on rare earths export.

Germany and Turkey will hold talks over the potential deliveries of Eurofighter jets, a Berlin Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday, confirming Berlin has agreed to the negotiations.

""The German government has responded positively to a preliminary request from Airbus to negotiate the delivery of Eurofighters to Turkey,"" the spokesperson said, adding that the aircraft would be used for ""collective defence within the NATO framework.""

German top diplomat Johann Wadephul is due in the Turkish capital Ankara on Friday to go over the issue with his Turkish counterpart, the spokesperson added.

The discussion comes as European members of the NATO alliance scramble to firm up air defenses against Russia, amid a string of drone sightings across various European airports.

The UK has issued a fresh round of sanctions targeting Russia's oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil as well as 44 tankers from the so-called ""shadow fleet.""

In a statement on Wednesday, the UK Foreign Office said the 90 new sanctions reflect London's determination to cut off Russian President Vladimir Putin's revenue streams.

Rosneft and Lukoil export 3.1 million barrels of oil per day, the Foreign Office said, adding that the former alone is responsible for nearly half of all Russian oil production.

""At this critical moment for Ukraine, Europe is stepping up. Together, the UK and our allies are piling the pressure on Putin - going after his oil, gas and shadow fleet — and we will not relent until he abandons his failed war of conquest and gets serious about peace,"" British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said.

Since Western countries sanctioned Russia's oil exports, the Kremlin has relied on a group of aging oil tankers to transport oil to buyers across the world.

""We are sending a clear signal: Russian oil is off the market,"" British Chancellor Rachel Reeves said.

Russia continued with its escalating attacks on Ukraine's energy system overnight, causing outages in seven mostly eastern regions, power grid operator Ukrenergo said.

State-run gas firm Naftogaz said a thermal power plant had also been hit, without identifying the location.

Russia has been stepping up its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure as winter and the heating season approach.

In a report, state-run energy company Naftogaz said Russian forces had attacked gas facilities three times in the past seven days, including ""critically important facilities"" in the Kharkiv, Sumy and Chernihiv regions.

Ukrainian Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk said earlier this month that Ukraine wanted to import 30% more gas after the damage caused by the Russian strikes.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has said his country will increase its contribution to policing European airspace following a spate of Russian aerial incursions and mysterious drone sightings.

Germany was prepared to take the lead in any EU air defense shield, Reuters news agency reported. 

At a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels on Wednesday, Pistorius said Germany would send Eurofighters to carry out patrol flights in Poland, which saw a major Russian drone incursion in September, as well as spend €10 billion ($11.6 billion) on all kinds of drones in the coming years.

""We will contribute to protecting the eastern flank with patrol flights,"" he said, adding Germany would be ""more active, more present and more visible"" on NATO's eastern border. 

When asked whether Germany would help finance US Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine, he said a decision would be taken when the time came to do so.

 US President Donald Trump says he is currently considering whether to allow the long-range Tomahawks, which would enable Ukraine to carry out attacks far within Russia, to be purchased by or for Kyiv.

US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Wednesday called on NATO member states to purchase more weapons for Ukraine under his country's Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) scheme, which has replaced US arms donations to Kyiv. 

""Our expectation today is that more countries donate even more, that they purchase even more to provide for Ukraine, to bring that conflict to a peaceful conclusion,"" he told reports ahead of a meeting with other NATO defense ministers in Brussels.

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said he expected further pledges, noting that $2 billion (€1.7 billion) already had been committed through the mechanism.

Sweden, Estonia and Finland pledged contributions on Wednesday, joining a number of other European countries, including Germany, who are already purchasing weapons through the scheme

Spain, Italy, France and Britain have so far not joined, drawing criticism from Washington.

Under the Trump administration, the US, previously a major supplier of military aid to Ukraine, has ceased donating military equipment to Kyiv.

According to Germany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy, most military aid to Ukraine now flows through PURL.

However, it reported on Tuesday that military aid to Ukraine fell nonetheless by 43% in July and August compared with the first half of the year.

Families living in villages near the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kupiansk have been ordered to leave their homes amid what local authorities have called the ""worsening security situation"" in the region.

Russian forces have been advancing on Kupiansk for months as they push westward through central and eastern Ukraine.

The governor of northeastern Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, wrote on Telegram that a total of 409 families with 601 children were told to leave 27 localities.

A local official later told the public broadcaster Suspilne the number of localities affected had risen to 40.

World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said an UN convoy, including a team from his agency, came under attack in southern Ukraine on Tuesday while on an aid mission.

He wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the team managed to deliver medical supplies to the city of Bilozerka, in the Kherson district, despite the incident, adding that two World Food Programme trucks were damaged.

""Attacks on humanitarians must end,"" Tedros wrote in his statement.  

 

NATO defense ministers are meeting in Brussels amid fears that Russia is probing the alliance's reactions with a number of high-profile incursions into its members' airspace.

Among other things, the ministers are expected to discuss establishing what the EU calls a ""drone wall"" to counter the Russian threat, a project NATO chief Mark Rutte said was being worked on jointly with the bloc.

Europe has seen a recent spate of mysterious drone flights that have disrupted airports and flown close to military sites in several countries.

NATO is currently looking at incorporating low-cost technologies, such as those used by Ukraine, into its anti-drone defenses.

Current anti-drone systems rely largely on expensive missiles and aircraft.

The ministers are also to look at shoring up support for Ukraine against Moscow's full-scale invasion of its territory, with a study released on Tuesday showing a major drop in Western military aid to Kyiv in recent months.

The study by Germany's Kiel Institute showed such support dropping by 43% iin July and August compared to the first half of the year, even after Kyiv's European allies began purchasing US arms for Ukraine under a US scheme known as the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL).

Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden have all bought weapons under the scheme, but Italy and Spain, among others, have sent very little. France does not intend to take part in the arrangement.

Spain's defense minister, Margarita Robles Fernandez, is also likely to come under pressure from her US counterpart, Pete Hegseth, over Madrid's failure to meet NATO spending targets. 

This failure already drew criticism last week from US President Donald Trump, who threatened to throw Spain out of NATO if it did not comply.

The campaign is part of a larger $3.2 million contract that also includes paying pastors to produce content. 

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

A newly-created firm called Show Faith by Works is embarking on a “geofencing” campaign to target Christian churches and colleges across the American Southwest with pro-Israel advertisements. The pastors and congregations themselves are seemingly unaware of this campaign, and some have concerns with Israel's methods to target Christians.

According to the firm's filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), Show Faith by Works will “geofence the actual boundaries of every Major (sic) church in California, Arizona, Nevada, and Coloardo (sic) and all Christian Colleges during worship times” and then “track attendees and continue to target [them] with ads” on behalf of Israel. The geofencing campaign is part of a larger $3.2 million contract that also includes trying to hire celebrity spokespeople and paying pastors to produce content.

RS reached out to hundreds of churches in California, Arizona, Nevada, and Colorado that were listed as potential targets of the geofencing campaign. None that responded were aware of the campaign. “We were not aware of that, no — you are the first to bring that to our attention,” said the press office for Bethel Church in Redding, California.

The project manager of the operation, Chad Schnitger, explained in an email to RS that the ads may include “invitations for Christians to visit one of our upcoming Mobile Museum exhibits, or to go to our website to learn more about the program, or to visit Israel with your church.” The firm's pitch deck describes the ads as “pro-lsreal (sic) and anti-Palestinian.”

The “Mobile Museum” Schnitger is referring to is a mobile trailer coordinated by his firm that will visit Christian colleges and churches highlighting atrocities from the Hamas attack on October 7, as well as “footage of IDF explaining the difficulty of fighting bad guys in hostile territory with civilians.” Schnitger confirmed the firm currently has one mobile museum exhibit, and that it would be ready to start travelling to churches and colleges in about a month.

Geofencing has long been a way for corporations to capture audiences by using their location services. It allows corporations to market their products using the location of mobile devices, triggering texts, in-app notifications, or mobile ads when users enter a certain physical boundary.

In an interview with RS, Megan Iorio, Senior Counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, described geofencing as a “privacy nightmare.” Iorio explained that data brokers vacuum up data from various applications that use location services, and then will either sell that data to marketing firms or offer marketing tools themselves. Then, users with location services enabled might, for instance, see an H&M advertisement if they walk within a certain radius of an H&M store.

Schnitger said that media reports covering the geofencing campaign have been “sensationalized” and pointed out that it's a common marketing tool; “It is not sending information back to a foreign entity; it's a way to deliver ads … This is a 1-way ad push using marketing tools that have been in place for over 10 years.” Iorio explained that while it is commonplace, the technique is “incredibly invasive.”

“The fact it has become so common and that foreign governments are now using it for targeted, precise influence campaigns shows how much we need regulation to stamp down on the practice. Today, it's the Israeli government looking to curry favor among Christians, but tomorrow it could be a foreign adversary looking to foment discord in a specific US city, and that has broad national security implications.” she added.

Some members of the communities listed as potential targets of Israel's geofencing campaign share these concerns about Israel using this marketing technique.

Micah, a mechanical engineer in Colorado Springs, has been conducting outreach to pastors and local newspapers in order to raise awareness that seven local churches were listed in the document as targets of the geofencing campaign. Micah circulated a document outlining his concerns, which RS obtained a copy of.

“What jumps out immediately is how the entire document talks about Christians as targets to be manipulated. This isn't respectful outreach — it's warfare language,” he wrote.

One of Micah's main concerns is that the firm is paying pastors on behalf of Israel. Show Faith by Works' pitch deck includes a plan to give stipends for “individual guest pastors, bilingual pastors, or pastors who match target demographics to record messages based on content creation targets.” Micah says that this “creates financial conflicts of interest where religious leaders become financially dependent on foreign government messaging, compromising their independence and integrity.”

Asa, Micah's brother, attends Scottsdale Bible Church in Arizona, one of the churches listed by Show Faith by Works. Asa said that Show Faith by Works' campaign is a reaction to Israel losing the support of America's youth. “This entire project is an attempt to regain the attention and hearts/support of Gen Z through the use of religious manipulation,” he said. Micah and Asa requested that RS exclude their full names to discuss the matter freely.

Schnitger is optimistic about swaying Christians' views on Israel. “For those who dislike Israel, maybe some of these exhibits and materials will change your mind.” Part of that effort is to stress anti-Palestinian talking points. The firm's pitch deck includes talking points about how “[P]alestinian and Iranian goals are not land-focused, but genocidal.”

Timothy Feldman, a software engineer in Plano, Texas, explained in an email to RS that he was upset to see his church listed as a potential target for Israel's geofencing campaign. “I am disgusted that a genocidal apartheid state is attempting to whitewash its atrocities by propagandizing the good people of Christ United Methodist Church,” said Feldman.

Despite the inclusion of Texas churches like the one in Plano in the pitch deck, Schnitger clarified in an email that the firm is currently not doing anything in Texas.

A church worker in Prescott, Arizona, saw his church on the list too and explained to RS in a phone interview that it's unclear how the pastors will respond. “The demographics in Prescott tend to be pro-Israel, so it's hard to know how the church leadership will react to this. All we can do is make people aware of it,” he said, requesting anonymity to speak freely about the issue.

The geofencing campaign will be overseen by Eran Shayovich, the Chief of Staff at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel. Shayovich is spearheading an initiative called “project 545,” which he describes as a campaign to “amplify Israel's strategic communication and public diplomacy efforts.” Shayovich is also the point of contact for Brad Parscale, Trump's former campaign manager who is coordinating efforts to train ChatGPT on behalf of Israel and integrate pro-Israel messaging into conservative media.

Some states have taken action against geofencing as a practice. In June, Oregon passed a law that prohibits the sale of precise geolocation information, following a similar provision passed by Maryland last year.

Lina Khan's FTC banned several data brokers from collecting and selling data from sensitive locations such as churches and military installations. While these companies — including Gravy Analytics and Mobilewalla — have attracted significant media attention over the last several years, there is an extensive industry of data brokers that continue to operate in the shadows buying and selling location data at places of worship.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

“New York will not sit idly by while trans people are attacked,” Mamdani said in his new campaign ad.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani released a campaign ad this week honoring transgender trailblazers in the city and vowing to make New York City a sanctuary for trans people.

The ad marks a notable departure from the Democratic Party's current tone on trans rights. Since the party's 2024 presidential loss to Donald Trump, strategists have increasingly peddled the myth that support for transgender people is a liability for candidates — a notion that Mamdani appears to reject.

In the campaign ad, Mamdani sits behind a large desk near the Christopher Street Pier, where many Black and Latinx unhoused LGBTQ people sought refuge in the 1970s after being pushed to the margins of the city. In the background of the ad is the song “It's Okay to Cry” by legendary transgender artist SOPHIE.

Mamdani tells the story of Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson, trans activists who led the Stonewall Inn uprisings of 1969 and laid the foundation for the city's first Pride celebration. The Christopher Street pier is “a place of immense contradictions,” he says— just like New York City itself.

“It's where outsiders found belonging, and it's also where Marsha P. Johnson's body was found, the victim of a suspected murder no one was ever prosecuted for,” he says.

As a result of the “cruelty” Rivera faced, Mamadani says, she developed a substance use problem and often faced homelessness. But despite these challenges, Rivera continued her fight for trans liberation, even when many in the mainstream gay rights movement at the time sought to exclude trans people.

Citing Rivera and Johnson's struggle for equality and recognition, Mamdani says, “We can chart a clear path forward that makes our city inclusive.”

He also calls out Trump specifically, noting that the president “has waged a scorched-earth campaign against trans people,” expending “enormous energy” targeting them.

“New York will not sit idly by while trans people are attacked,” Mamdani says. If elected mayor, he promises to “deploy hundreds of lawyers to combat Trump's hate, make New York City an LGBTQIA+ sanctuary city, and create the Office of LGBTQIA+ Affairs to allocate millions [of dollars] for youth and adult housing programs as well as gender-affirming care.”

He concludes by stating that voters in the city can honor the memory of Rivera and Johnson “by building a city where trans New Yorkers are cherished.”

“In a time of darkness, New York must be the light,” Mamdani says.

Transgender commentators praised the ad, suggesting that other Democratic candidates should take a page out of Mamdani's playbook.

“When's the last time you saw that? A major Democratic politician releasing a campaign video that's just… about trans rights? Not a 10-second aside in a broader equality montage. Not a single line buried in a stump speech. An entire video,” wrote trans writer Parker Molloy.

Molloy added:

Look, I get it. Not everyone cares about a New York City mayoral race. But this matters because it shows what's possible when a politician decides trans people aren't disposable.

Columnist Katelyn Burns, who was the first openly trans Capitol Hill reporter in U.S. history, agreed. “It's an entire political ad, from a major Democratic politician, that is exclusively defending trans rights. Has this ever happened before?” she asked, adding that “trans issues aren't this shameful thing that Democratic consultants suggest we hide from.” 

“Political issues aren't siloes, they're all connected, and Mamdani recognizes that. Other Democrats need to see it too, and I hope they are paying attention,” Burns said.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

 What His Assault on the U.S. Military Means for America

 Max Boot

It might be difficult to remember now, but U.S. President Donald Trump delivered his first blow to American civil-military relations in 2017, when he first started talking about “my generals.” He had appointed a former Marine general, James Mattis, as secretary of defense, which is a position typically reserved for civilians to preserve civilian control of the military. Mattis became the first former general to serve as defense secretary since George Marshall in 1950, and he needed to secure a congressional waiver in order to take the job.

Trump also appointed other high-ranking military officers to civilian posts, including former Marine General John Kelly (who served first as secretary of homeland security and then as White House chief of staff) and his first two national security advisers: Michael Flynn, a retired three-star general, and H. R. McMaster, an active-duty three-star general. Even Vice President Mike Pence's national security adviser was a retired army lieutenant general: Keith Kellogg (who is now special envoy for Ukraine). Few, if any, previous U.S. presidents had so brazenly tried to benefit from proximity to the U.S. military. Appointing so many generals to such high offices is more typical of a military junta than of a constitutional republic. But Trump reveled in the aura of toughness conveyed by these military men; he delighted, for example, in referring to Mattis as “Mad Dog,” a nickname that the cerebral general hated.

It did not take Trump long to become disenchanted with his generals. Within two years, he fired almost all of them, insulting most on their way out the door. He later said that Army General Mark Milley, his handpicked choice for chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (and one of the few Trump kept until the end of his term), should have been executed for treason because he had called his Chinese counterpart to offer reassurances that the United States was not planning to start a war after the storming of the Capitol by Trump's supporters on January 6, 2021.

When Trump came into office for a second time this past January, he was deeply suspicious of the uniformed military, believing that the retired and active-duty generals he had appointed during his first term had stymied his unilateralist and isolationist instincts. Trump came to see all these generals as part of a “deep state” cabal frustrating his MAGA mandate, and he was determined not to fall into the same trap in his second term.

As a result, Trump went much further down the chain of command to choose his current secretary of defense, selecting Pete Hegseth, a Fox News weekend host who had never risen above the rank of major in the Army National Guard and who had never run any large organization. His chief qualification appears to be unquestioning subservience to Trump, and he has subjected the military to a culture war agenda, highlighted by his recent dressing down of admirals and generals at Quantico, Virginia, in which he promised to purge “woke garbage.”

Among other steps, Hegseth is returning Confederate names to military bases and styling himself as “secretary of war” after Trump issued an executive order to rename the Department of Defense to the less “wokey” Department of War. (Trump does not have the legal authority to rename the Department of Defense with an executive order.) Both Trump and Hegseth have subjected service members—ranging from junior troops to senior generals—to political lectures that are inappropriate in military settings. In an early October speech, for instance, to mark the navy's 250th birthday, Trump referred to Democrats as a “little gnat that's on our shoulder” while Hegseth looked on approvingly. Among the steps that Trump and Hegseth have taken to bend the armed forces to their will, the most worrisome include firing more than a dozen respected general officers (many of them women and minorities) for no good reason, imposing their ideology on military classrooms and websites, and deploying the armed forces for legally dubious missions both domestically and internationally as part of its undeclared war on crime.

By being so slavish in serving the president, Hegseth has managed to keep his job despite widespread reports of infighting and dysfunction in his office, as well as his willingness to share highly sensitive details of upcoming airstrikes in an unsecure Signal chat that included a prominent journalist. But his job tenure has come at high cost to the armed forces—and the country.

It's easy to lose sight of how radical the MAGA military agenda is when focusing on each action in isolation. Only by glancing at the entirety of what Trump and Hegseth have wrought can one see what a far-reaching assault they are mounting on the apolitical professionalism that has made the U.S. armed forces one of the most admired institutions in American society—and one of the most emulated and envied militaries around the world. Indeed, the attempt by Trump and Hegseth to roll back military professionalism and to politicize the armed forces is not just a question of degrading military morale and effectiveness, hurting recruiting and retention, and distracting the armed forces from their primary mission (such as countering Russian and Chinese aggression), although those are all real concerns. What Trump and Hegseth are doing also represents a threat to democracy—and a profound test for service members, who do not swear a personal loyalty oath to the president but swear to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States.”

The Trump administration wasted no time stamping the MAGA brand on the U.S. armed forces. On January 21, one day into the new presidency, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security fired Admiral Linda Fagan, the first female commandant of the Coast Guard, without stating a reason. Administration officials leaked on background that she was relieved for, among other offenses, a supposedly “excessive focus” on diversity and inclusion efforts. Four days later, Trump fired inspectors general at 15 federal agencies, including the Department of Defense. These are the internal watchdogs who are supposed to root out fraud, abuse, inefficiency, and other problems, thereby serving as a check on executive branch leaders. Getting rid of the incumbents signaled that scrutiny of administration actions would not be welcome in the future. Four days after that, Hegseth revoked the security detail protecting Milley, by now retired, even though Tehran had placed a price on his head after the U.S. armed forces killed the commander of Iran's Quds Force during Trump's first term.

Less than a month later, on a Friday night in February, Trump fired General C. Q. Brown, the second Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the first woman to rise to chief of naval operations. Again, no reason was given, leading to widespread suspicion that Brown's race and Franchetti's sex had a lot to do with their fate. (Trump also simultaneously fired General James Slife, a white man who was vice chief of the U.S. Air Force.) Brown, a low-key but widely respected leader, was said to have incurred the administration's wrath by making a video in 2020, during the George Floyd protests, talking about the discrimination he had faced during his rise through the ranks. Hegseth had also suggested in the past that Brown, who had previously served as chief of staff of the air force, had been promoted because of his skin color.

While the president was personally relieving these senior officers, Hegseth was firing the judge advocates general (JAGs) of the army, air force, and navy. These are the senior officers charged with ensuring that their services comply with the law. Their dismissal was to be expected given Hegseth's long-standing contempt for “jagoffs,” his derisive nickname for the JAGs. Hegseth has previously defended service members accused of war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq, convincing Trump to pardon several of them during his first term. More recently, Hegseth has said that he wants the “War Department” to focus on “maximum lethality, not tepid legality,” thereby issuing a de facto invitation to the troops to engage in unlawful conduct.



Brown's replacement as chairman of the Joint Chiefs was an unusual choice: Dan “Razin” Caine, a retired air force three-star general who was brought back to active duty and promoted to full general. He did not meet the statutory requirements to be chairman—by law that post is supposed to be filled by a four-star general who was previously vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, a service chief, or a combatant commander. But Trump convinced the Senate to waive the rules and confirm Caine because he was evidently convinced that the general was one of his political supporters. Trump often told the story—which is denied by Caine and those who know him—that the general had donned a MAGA hat and pledged unwavering loyalty when he met with Trump in Iraq in 2018.

In fact, Caine has been careful to act apolitically since being confirmed. For example, at a June 22 press conference about the U.S. airstrikes on the Iranian nuclear program, Hegseth lavished praise on Trump and echoed his unproven assertions about the Iranian nuclear program being “obliterated,” while Caine stuck to praising U.S. military personnel and offered more measured bomb-damage assessments. But Caine's very selection is a message about how Trump demands political loyalty above all else in his generals—and how little he values diversity.

In the months since the initial round of firings, the Trump purge has claimed two other well-respected female general officers: Navy Vice Admiral Shoshana Chatfield, a former president of the Navy War College, was relieved in April as the U.S. representative to the NATO Military committee, and Vice Admiral Yvette Davis was removed in July as the superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy after only a year in the job. (Superintendents typically serve three to four years.) Apparently, Chatfield's offense was saying “Our diversity is our strength,” which Hegseth has called “the single dumbest phrase in military history.”

Hegseth denies that race or gender played a role in these removals—he routinely claims that every move he makes is designed to promote “lethality”—but such claims ring hollow given how much emphasis the defense secretary has placed on removing all traces of diversity, equity, and inclusion from the military, an institution that helped lead the desegregation of American society. Hegseth, for instance, ended celebrations of Black History Month and Women's History Month and demanded that any “DEI” material be scrubbed from Department of Defense schools, military academies, and websites. This led to the removal of any mention of the Tuskegee Airmen (the Black pilots of World War II), the Navajo Code Talkers (the Native Americans who were integral to Marine Corps operations in the Pacific), and Jackie Robinson (the first Black major league baseball player, who also served in the army). A navy tanker named for Harvey Milk, the slain gay rights leader and navy veteran, was renamed. Some—but not all—of these Orwellian erasures were subsequently rescinded, such as the purging of images, presumably because of the word “gay,” of the Enola Gay, the B-29 that dropped the first atomic bomb on Japan and which was named after the pilot's mother. Many of the 381 volumes that were initially removed from the shelves of the Naval Academy library were also eventually returned. But not everything was restored, and the pressure on the military to hew to the MAGA agenda remains.

For instance, in July, Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll ordered West Point to rescind an offer of employment to Jen Easterly, an army veteran and West Point alumna who had led the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency during the Biden administration. Then, in September, the West Point alumni group canceled a ceremony to present the actor Tom Hanks with the Sylvanus Thayer Award, conferred annually on an “outstanding citizen” who exemplifies the academy's devotion to “Duty, Honor, Country.” Hanks—who has made numerous films and TV shows celebrating U.S. military valor and helped raise money for military memorials and veterans—was a supporter of former President Joe Biden and a critic of Trump. Trump, in turn, celebrated the decision on social media, writing, “We don't need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards!!!” West Point has also closed down clubs for minority cadets such as the Asian-Pacific Forum Club, the Latin Cultural Club, and the National Society of Black Engineers Club. In May, the philosophy professor Graham Parsons wrote in a New York Times op-ed that he was leaving the faculty because West Point was “eliminating courses, modifying syllabuses and censoring arguments to comport with the ideological tastes of the Trump administration.”



As part of his anti-“woke” agenda, Hegseth has also restored the Confederate names of military bases that were dropped as a result of legislation that Congress passed over Trump's veto in January 2021. Hegseth is skirting the law by renaming the bases after veterans who have the same last names as the Confederates they were originally named after. Thus, Fort Liberty again becomes Fort Bragg—this time supposedly named not for Confederate General Braxton Bragg but for Private Roland L. Bragg, a hitherto obscure infantryman who fought in the Battle of the Bulge. This legerdemain combines Hegseth's opposition to “wokeness” with his contempt for the rule of law.

That same impulse is evident in the air force's decision to grant a funeral with full military honors to Ashli Babbitt, an air force veteran who was killed by police while trying to break into the House chamber during the January 6, 2021, insurrection instigated by Trump. Retired Army Lieutenant General Mark Hertling wrote in The Bulwark that he was “infuriated” by the decision because “she did not die defending the Constitution. She died trying to overturn it.”

After the assassination of the prominent Trump supporter Charlie Kirk on September 10, Hegseth ordered his aides to find and punish any military members or Pentagon civilians who posted anything online that appeared to “celebrate or mock” his death. Online vigilantes joined in by posting on X under the hashtag #RevolutionariesintheRanks to uncover supposed offenders. Many of the highlighted comments did not actually condone the murder but simply took issue with some of Kirk's controversial statements. As of early October, The Washington Post reported, the Defense Department had investigated nearly 300 employees, both uniformed and civilian, resulting in a number of disciplinary actions, including firings.

Hegseth has also tried to stifle critical press coverage by demanding that all media organizations accredited to cover the Pentagon sign an agreement that they will not report or solicit any information they are not explicitly authorized to have by department leaders. The Pentagon press office threatened to revoke media credentials for any organizations that refused to sign this agreement, which media organizations argue impinges on their First Amendment rights.

Meanwhile, Hegseth has continued purging senior officers for blatantly political reasons. On April 3, he fired General Timothy Haugh, the head of Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, along with the civilian deputy director at the NSA, Wendy Noble. No explanation was offered, but Laura Loomer, a Trump supporter and avid conspiracy theorist, claimed credit by saying that she had denounced the two senior officials during a meeting with Trump. Loomer argued they were both “disloyal” to the president because Haugh was supposedly “handpicked” by Mark Milley in 2023, when Milley was still chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. There is no accusation that Haugh and Noble were not doing a good job and no evidence that they were subverting the president.

A few months later, in August, Hegseth got rid of more senior officers, firing Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency; Vice Admiral Nancy Lacore, the chief of the Navy Reserve; Rear Admiral Milton Sands, a Navy SEAL officer who oversees Naval Special Warfare Command; and General David Allvin, the chief of staff of the air force, who will be retiring two years into a four-year term. It wasn't clear why all these leaders were cashiered, beyond the obvious fact that Lacore is a woman and Kruse presided over an agency that issued a preliminary intelligence estimate that found that Iran's nuclear facilities were not “obliterated” by a U.S. airstrike, as Trump had claimed. That Kruse was fired for having his agency offer a good-faith intelligence estimate strongly signals that truth telling from either the armed forces or the intelligence community is not welcome in this administration—at least not when the truth conflicts with the president's spin.

Presidents, of course, have the right to fire general officers and have done so in the past. Harry Truman relieved General Douglas MacArthur for defying his decision not to extend the Korean War to China, and Barack Obama relieved General Stanley McChrystal after his staff members were quoted in a magazine article disparaging Obama and Biden, his vice president. But there is no precedent for the rapid dismissal of so many senior officers without any real explanation, evidence of failings, or misconduct. This looks like an attempt by Trump and Hegseth to install compliant general officers who will do the president's bidding, no matter what, even if the president is demanding actions that are unwise, unethical, or illegal—or all three. The message they are sending is that any officers who question the president's whims will find themselves in civilian clothes in short order.

The purge of honest and independent officials will have serious repercussions for U.S. foreign policy. In the future, when the president and his top aides are making vital national security decisions, they are less likely to have access to a full range of intelligence and opinions about the merits of various courses of action, because the professionals at the Defense Department and in the intelligence community will know they are only supposed to tell the president what he wants to hear. It is a recipe for the kind of groupthink that got the United States into the Vietnam and Iraq wars.

The worrisome impact of such moves can already be seen in the administration's dubious deployments of the military both domestically and internationally for missions far removed from traditional warfighting. One wonders, for instance, if senior military officials raised concerns about Trump's decision to send the armed forces into what the president calls “Democrat-run” cities. Since the start of his term, Trump has ordered National Guard troops into Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Memphis, and Portland, while also proposing deployments in Louisiana. In his September speech to generals and admirals, Trump said, “We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.” Trump cites as a rationale supposed crime “emergencies,” even though crime rates have been falling across the country and there is no indication that local law enforcement has lost control. In June, for instance, Trump federalized the California National Guard over the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom and deployed 4,000 National Guard troops, along with 700 active-duty marines, to Los Angeles in response to protests caused by the administration's massive immigration roundups. This was the first time since 1965 that a president had federalized the National Guard over the objections of a governor.

Newsom filed a lawsuit, and U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, in San Francisco, ruled in September that the deployment was a violation of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids the use of the military for domestic law enforcement in most situations. “There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence,” the judge wrote. “Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law.” Trump's efforts to deploy the guard to Portland and Chicago have also run into legal difficulty. When Trump tried to nationalize Oregon's guard, U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut—whom Trump himself appointed—slapped the effort down as an illegal federal power grab. When Trump then tried to send in the California guard as a workaround, Immergut issued another injunction. In the case of Chicago, U.S. District Judge April Perry issued an injunction to prevent the deployment of the National Guard—an action upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Both Immergut and Perry suggested that the administration was being less than truthful about the reasons for the deployments, with Perry citing a “potential lack of candor” among officials.

Trump, however, is undeterred. The administration is appealing all these decisions. And his Defense Department is transparently trying to find excuses to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act, which allows the White House to use the military if there is a rebellion, or if civilian law enforcement cannot enforce the law. The president, it seems, will stop at nothing to get his way with American troops. Randy Manner, a retired army two-star general and former acting vice chief of the National Guard, told The Washington Post that the moves were “absolutely nothing more than a political grab of power” by Trump.

Just as worrisome as these domestic deployments is the use of the military in Trump's undeclared war against drug cartels. On September 3, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that U.S. forces had blown up a speedboat in the Caribbean that was allegedly full of Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members and illicit drugs. Eleven people on board died. The administration claimed to have ordered the lethal strike under the president's Article 2 authority as commander in chief, with Rubio arguing that “the president has a right to eliminate immediate threats to the United States.” But it is not clear how the boat posed an “immediate threat,” even if it was full of drugs. Rubio even said that the boat was actually headed for Trinidad, and it subsequently emerged that the boat had already turned back toward Venezuela by the time it was attacked. The military sank it anyway, with a military aircraft—apparently a drone—launching multiple attacks until no one was left alive.

The administration did not provide much more information about the incident, leading some veterans of counternarcotics operations to speculate that the boat might have been carrying migrants rather than drugs. Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said after his staff received an administration briefing on the attack: “They have offered no positive identification that the boat was Venezuelan, nor that its crew were members of Tren de Aragua or any other cartel.”

Since that initial strike, the Defense Department has announced that it has blown up four more vessels that were allegedly smuggling drugs, killing 16 more people. The administration has not offered much information about any of these incidents and has not publicly released any evidence that the boats were actually full of illicit narcotics or where they were heading.



The Trump administration has designated Tren de Aragua and other drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, but that doesn't give the president permission to kill its members on sight. That would be akin to telling military personnel to shoot suspected drug dealers without benefit of trial—a crime for which former Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte is now on trial before the International Criminal Court. Trump has expressed his admiration for Duterte and advocated the death penalty for drug dealers, but Congress has not passed any authorization for the use of military force that would allow such an attack.

If this was not a lawful use of force, as many experts have concluded, then it was an extrajudicial killing—a potential war crime. Yet some senior officials are celebrating it regardless. Vice President JD Vance, posting on X, called the attack on the alleged drug smuggling boat “the highest and best use of our military.” When an online critic argued that “killing the citizens of another nation who are civilians without any due process is called a war crime,” Vance replied, “I don't give a shit what you call it.”

Vance may not care, but the service members involved and their civilian superiors should. The Supreme Court has granted presidents immunity from prosecution for official acts, but that immunity does not extend to anyone else involved in the operation—or in subsequent such attacks that the president is threatening to carry out.

It is disturbing to see the U.S. military employed in such a potentially unlawful fashion. But it is also disturbing to note that, so far, there has been no public protest from anyone in uniform.

On the one hand, this is to be expected: the U.S. military is supposed to be apolitical and does not make a habit of criticizing commanders in chief. Attempts by senior officers to fight back against improper and illegal commands may lead to an even bigger civil-military crisis and potentially draw the armed forces deeper into the political mire—the last place they want to be. The good news is that the U.S. armed forces have a long, deeply inculcated tradition of protecting and defending the Constitution, and that the military is a vast institution, most of it based mercifully far from Washington. It will be impossible for Trump and Hegseth to undo in one presidential term the principles that have been inculcated in the armed forces for centuries.

But by trying to politicize the military, the Trump administration is breaking trust with the men and women in uniform and driving talented leaders out of the force. The dearth of military pushback, then, begs the question of how effectively Trump and Hegseth have cleaned house, rooting out those who might disagree with them. It is unclear if there are senior officers still objecting behind closed doors, or if everyone is keeping silent in order to save their jobs. This uncertainty will have profound effects on the public's confidence in the nation's armed forces. Going forward, even perfectly appropriate and legal military actions may be viewed through the prism of the administration's attempts to turn the armed forces into a MAGA militia.



That is not fair to the troops, and it tampers with the fundamental principles that have made the American military such a successful fighting force for so long. Moreover, Trump's actions threaten to set off a chain reaction that will damage the armed forces long after he leaves office. If today's military leaders are perceived as “MAGA” generals, then a future Democratic administration will be tempted to appoint its own stalwarts, who in turn will be dismissed by the next Republican president. Generals and admirals may become known as political partisans, and the U.S. military could be subjected to high leadership turnover.

The most generous explanation of the silence of the general officers is that they are hoping to keep their heads down for now, hedging that they will be in a position to serve as a check on presidential overreach if and when the situation gets truly dire. And some officers may, indeed, find themselves in that position. Trump is an aspiring authoritarian who has already done much to undermine the rule of law and democracy. He is likely to up the pressure in the months and years ahead. In 2020, he asked the military to shoot peaceful protesters, according to then Defense Secretary Mark Esper. Esper and Milley refused, and the idea was abandoned. Later, after Trump lost the November election, the disgraced former general Michael Flynn reportedly advocated using troops to seize ballot boxes and overturn the election results. Even if Trump had tried to implement this idea (and there is no evidence that he did), it's extremely unlikely that Esper or Milley would have gone along.

But it is unclear if Caine and other top military officials will say no if Trump makes similar requests. Will senior leaders handpicked by Trump resist, or will they salute and obey? On that question could hang the fate of the republic.

In figuring out whether they should follow commands that undermine U.S. democracy, senior officers should consider an open letter published in 2022 by a group of eight former secretaries of defense and five former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including Mattis and Esper. Although Trump's name was never mentioned, his first term clearly informed every sentence.

The first paragraph noted: “Military professionals confront an extremely adverse environment characterized by the divisiveness of affective polarization that culminated in the first election in over a century when the peaceful transfer of political power was disrupted and in doubt.” The letter went on to lay out the “the core principles and best practices” that should govern “healthy American civil-military relations.” The first of these, naturally, was “civilian control of the military,” but the former officials emphasized that this control must be exercised “within a constitutional framework under the rule of law” and that both the legislative and judicial branches had an important role to play. Although the letter noted that “military officials are required to carry out legal orders the wisdom of which they doubt,” it also said that “civilian officials should provide the military ample opportunity to express their doubts in appropriate venues.”

In other words, if military leaders are being ordered to do things they should not be doing, they need to let the people and their elected representatives know. “Appropriate venues” can include not only internal executive branch deliberations but also congressional testimony or even media interviews. Although this option was not mentioned in the open letter, in the worst case, senior officers could threaten to resign in protest.

There is, admittedly, no tradition in U.S. history of military leaders resigning in protest, but there is also little precedent for the kinds of orders that Trump and Hegseth are now issuing. Ideally, Congress and the courts, the press, and the public will ultimately mobilize to protect the professionalism of the armed forces, but so far, the Republican-controlled Congress has been MIA in overseeing administration misconduct. In the short run, therefore, the troops will have to fend for themselves as best as they can. They should recall what Mattis used to tell his marines: “Carry out your mission and keep your honor clean.”

 To Outcompete China, Washington Must Unleash the Private Sector

 Todd Young

In September 2024, Akeso, a little-known Chinese biopharmaceutical company, announced that clinical trials had shown that its new drug could halt the progression of a type of lung cancer for nearly a full year. These results sent shock waves through the pharmaceutical industry: the previous best-in-class drug, produced by the U.S. pharmaceutical giant Merck, delayed new tumor growth for only six months.

Spurred by breakthroughs like this, China is becoming a world-leading biotechnology innovator. Western biopharmaceutical companies are clamoring to ink deals with their Chinese counterparts. Over the last five years, the number of agreements struck by Chinese companies producing cancer drugs to license their intellectual property has more than doubled. The total market capitalization of China's publicly listed biotech firms has reached $1.5 trillion, second only to that of the United States.

As China surges, many traditional American strengths have atrophied. The United States lacks a targeted federal strategy for biotechnology, and its policymaking is fragmented and uncoordinated. Federal research funding has stagnated, while skittish investors are avoiding cutting-edge projects. Regulatory burdens slow down innovators who want to go from lab to market. And the United States' research infrastructure, biological data reserves, and workforce development pipeline are not just faltering—they are being left in the dust by Beijing.

The United States cannot, and should not, try to beat China by being more like China, which relies on subsidizing handpicked firms. Instead, the United States should lean into its existing advantages, especially its private sector. By proactively remedying market failures, the federal government can help unleash private-sector capital to fuel the country's world-class biotechnology industry. If the United States successfully reasserts its biotech leadership, it can ensure that the new technology makes everyone safer, healthier, and more secure. But if the United States remains passive, China will shape how biotechnology develops, threatening not only U.S. dominance in this vital sector but also its national security.

China is gaining ground in biotechnology just as the field is entering a fundamentally new age. Thanks to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, engineering, and automation, researchers can now model extraordinarily complex biological systems without needing to fully understand how those systems work. In 2021, for instance, researchers from Google's AI lab, DeepMind, solved the previously impossible challenge of understanding and predicting how proteins fold. Before AI, enumerating all possible shapes of a single protein would have taken longer than the age of the known universe. DeepMind's AlphaFold system, in contrast, can accurately predict the shape of a protein in minutes.

Humans are now on the cusp of understanding and programming cells as easily as they program computers. AI models are learning how to become fluent in the language of DNA, just as they can communicate easily in English or Mandarin. Technology is also democratizing biotechnology, in much the way that personal computers became more affordable in the 1990s. The cost of sequencing a human genome, for example, has dropped from hundreds of millions of dollars in the early 2000s to hundreds of dollars today.

As biotechnology becomes more accessible, its applications are multiplying by the day. Noninvasive genetic testing has existed for decades; breakthroughs in genomics are now transforming how doctors treat previously incurable diseases. In 2023, for example, researchers developed the first FDA-approved gene therapy based on CRISPR-Cas9 technology, using a patient's own edited stem cells to treat sickle cell disease. Research labs are deploying AI to further develop these biotechnologies, which could lead to new treatments and medicine for a range of life-threatening diseases.

Emerging biotechnology has major ramifications for national security and geopolitical competition. It has the potential to reshape every strategic sector, including defense, agriculture, energy, and manufacturing. In the realm of the military, biotechnology could allow countries to reshore the production of chemicals used in munitions. Soldiers could synthesize food, medication, and other battlefield essentials on the frontlines by using technologies that fit inside a backpack.

Manufacturers could also use custom-designed proteins to separate critical minerals from waste in the mining process, which could lower the costs of extracting such minerals, increase their production, and reduce dependence on unreliable supply chain partners. Farmers could grow drought- and pest-resistant crops. Biotechnology could even change the future of computing power by replacing silicon-based storage hardware with a synthetic, biological alternative that could hold significantly more data in less space.

These innovations could help a country thrive—or be used to hurt a rival. A military could exploit human enhancements to outmaneuver and overwhelm an adversary. Modified pathogens could be developed and unleashed into an enemy's agricultural system, wiping out farmers' livelihoods and causing prices at the grocery store to skyrocket. And adversaries could weaponize dependencies on pharmaceuticals to disrupt a country's supplies of vital medications.

The country that leads global biotechnology will determine how and to what ends this transformative technology is used. For most of the twentieth century, the United States dominated the field. In the 1940s, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in partnership with the private sector, discovered and mass-produced new strains of penicillin. In the 1970s, American biochemists discovered how to cut and splice DNA fragments, paving the way for the development of synthetic medicines. In the 1990s, the United States led the effort to sequence the full human genome for the first time. To this day, the United States has more biotechnology patents, companies, and Nobel Prize winners than any other country.

But China is swiftly closing the gap. For nearly 20 years, China has made biotechnology a strategic priority, implementing a comprehensive package of financing, subsidies, and diplomatic support for its domestic industry. In 2020, Chinese leader Xi Jinping stressed the need to incorporate biosecurity into the country's national security system, pushing for more independent scientific innovation so that China would not need to depend on the United States.

Both the Chinese Communist Party and the army have taken Xi's charge to heart. They have launched a so-called whole-of-nation effort—centralizing control of science and technology efforts and leveraging all available state resources at their disposal—to develop cutting-edge biotechnologies to advance their military and economic objectives. Beijing is investing heavily in gene editing, bionic robots, human-machine teaming (that is, collaboration between humans and machines), and biomanufacturing. It has collapsed the barriers between civilian and defense research so that ostensibly private Chinese companies, such as the biotechnology giant BGI Group, serve the CCP's military and technology research goals. It is no coincidence that BGI also manages the China National GeneBank, which stores genetic data and biological samples.

Beijing has turned to a familiar playbook to promote its biotech goals. It lavishes subsidies on its chosen champions and helps them acquire U.S. companies that are developing promising technologies. In 2013, for instance, BGI purchased the U.S.-based company Complete Genomics, which made BGI the world leader in genetic sequencing. Market dominance and scale make it possible for BGI to box out promising U.S. startups. The Chinese company WuXi AppTec—whose market share in biotech mirrors Huawei's commanding position in telecommunications—has gobbled up U.S. firms to gain access to their intellectual property. Today, the vast majority of U.S. biopharmaceutical companies depend on WuXi and similar Chinese firms for everything from drug discovery research services to manufacturing of finished pharmaceuticals.

The Chinese government supports biotech with investments in both physical and human capital. Beijing has built and funded over 100 world-class biotechnology parks with state-of-the-art lab space for companies. China's state-owned enterprises are investing in biotech firms, and several have begun making acquisitions to expand overseas. Authorities have also urged venture capital firms to fund biotech ventures and companies. And an increasing number of Chinese students trained abroad are returning home, bolstering China's rising competitiveness in the global race for scientific talent.

Beijing's strategy is working. From 2016 to 2021, the market value of Chinese biotech firms grew 100-fold to $300 billion. By 2023, China's investment in biopharmaceutical research and development had soared to $15 billion, from $35 million in 2015. From January to July 2025, the Hang Seng Biotech Index, which tracks the top 30 biotechnology, medical device, and pharmaceutical companies listed in Hong Kong, rose more than 60 percent, far outpacing the three percent gain in the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index over the same time frame.

China's dominance goes beyond market gains. In 2024, China surpassed the United States in world-class cancer research output, as measured by the Nature index of top journals in science and health. In synthetic biology, too, China has upstaged the United States as the top source of research. In 2010, researchers based in the United States published 45 percent of the most-cited research papers in the field, while those in China accounted for 13 percent. In 2023, researchers in China published 60 percent, while their U.S. counterparts produced only seven percent.



China has now surpassed the United States in drug clinical trials, registering more than 7,100 in 2024, to the United States' 6,000. Offering government-backed scale and low prices, the global share of China's pharmaceutical output quadrupled from 2002 to 2019. U.S. and foreign drug manufacturers are increasingly dependent on Chinese sources for the raw materials and intermediate inputs for active pharmaceutical ingredients, and on fully Chinese-made active ingredients, as well.

Beijing's biotechnology success is both an impressive achievement and a cause for deep concern for the United States and its partners. China's biotech industry operates with fewer ethical guardrails, which could cause irreversible damage. In 2018, a Chinese biophysicist used the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the genomes of human embryos, which broke global norms and opened up a Pandora's box of unknown consequences. The scientist was fired and sentenced to three years in prison, but he is already back in the lab. Yet rogue scientists are not the only abusers of biotechnology. Journalists have documented how Chinese authorities are methodically collecting genomic data on millions of Uyghurs, a Muslim minority group, and using it to support a campaign of mass repression that the United States government has formally designated as genocide.

In 2021, Reuters revealed that a commercially available prenatal test developed by BGI that had been used by more than eight million women across at least 52 countries had been created in partnership with researchers connected to the Chinese military. BGI has worked closely with the People's Liberation Army and its affiliated medical universities on multiple other projects, including research that could have implications for improving the battlefield performance of Chinese soldiers. The CCP has given the world few reasons to trust that its biotechnology ambitions are benevolent.

The U.S. biotech industry is poised to grow, but it needs private capital to get off the sidelines and fuel the next wave of breakthroughs. While China provides its leading companies with cheap capital through government subsidies and investments, America's strong private markets remain its core advantage. The U.S. government needs to empower those markets to do their job by addressing the obstacles biotechnology companies face in scaling up innovations: complex regulations, underutilized capital, and insufficient protections against dangers such as intellectual property theft.

Since its creation in 2022, the bipartisan National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology, on which I serve as chairman, has searched for ways to advance U.S. leadership in biotechnology. Most important, the United States needs a private-public partnership to develop the domestic biotechnology industry so it can reach its full potential. Such an alliance would remedy the market failures that inhibit American innovators, investors, and entrepreneurs from achieving breakthroughs in the field. Supply-side actions such as research prizes and infrastructure investments can accelerate R & D, while targeted demand-side policies can reduce financial risks and regulatory bottlenecks and make the U.S. government a better customer for biotechnology products.

This spring, I helped introduce the bipartisan National Biotechnology Initiative Act of 2025, which would enshrine some of the commission's recommendations in federal law, including streamlining biotech regulations and establishing an office to coordinate national biotechnology strategy. I am also working with my colleagues to advance legislation to create an Independence Investment Fund that would invest in technology startups that strengthen U.S. national and economic security; authorize and finance a network of manufacturing facilities across the United States to scale up bioindustrial products before they are fully commercially viable; make investments to improve the effectiveness and reach of the popular Small Business Innovation Research/Technology Transfer program to support early-stage innovation; and use advance market commitments—promises to buy biotechnology products if they are successfully produced—and purchase agreements to smooth out unpredictable or inconsistent demand, among many other policies.

If the United States is to reassert its global biotechnology leadership and shape a secure, safe, and ethical biotechnology future, the U.S. government must work with allies. The United States and its likeminded partners must set the standards for how biotechnology is developed and used rather than wait for China to build a system that allows unethical gene editing and biotech-powered mass surveillance and repression.

The United States must show the world that Beijing's tactics are not aimed at mutually beneficial international partnerships, but at global biotechnological control. That pursuit of dominance will not be limited to overtaking the United States; the CCP's strategy is to use its growing biotech dominance as economic and geopolitical leverage around the world.

Whereas the Chinese party leadership appears to view other countries' bioeconomies as threats to be contained, the United States should view them as opportunities to secure and expand a shared biotechnological future. As with defense and economic alliances, the United States must work with partners to foster a collective security outlook that standardizes the approach to biotechnology protection. Specifically, the United States and its allies need to establish a unified approach to data security, export controls, and whether and how to accept investment from adversaries. Reciprocal biological data-sharing agreements would both advance collaborative research and implement and enforce secure, fair, and transparent data standards—especially when China has built its own large biodata repository, as its government has done in collaboration with BGI.



Advancing biotechnology also requires the United States to identify allies and partners that have complementary goals, capabilities, and expertise. Nearly every country has something valuable to offer, whether advanced manufacturing capabilities, computational biology prowess, or biobased chemicals and advanced therapeutics. Today, the State Department's International Technology Security and Innovation Fund, which finances partnerships to improve global supply chains, does not cover biotechnology; that must be remedied immediately. The Trump administration should also expand its diplomatic efforts to promote American biotechnology, reaching out to partners to expand market access and boost aggregate demand for U.S. biotechnology products.

The United States has learned the lesson of technological complacency before—and paid dearly for it. Semiconductors, much like biotechnology, were an American invention, first soldered together in garages in Palo Alto. For years, however, China moved aggressively to close the gap. In 2022, Congress passed the landmark CHIPS and Science Act, which aimed to spur the production of semiconductors on U.S. and allied soil and to use export controls to prevent the most advanced semiconductor technology from getting into adversaries' hands. This policy is succeeding. The United States is again becoming the leading global hub for advanced chip manufacturing, while its restrictions on adversaries' access to semiconductors have set back China's chip-making.

The United States can win the biotechnology race. By harnessing two of the United States' greatest strengths—its dynamic private sector and its unmatched network of allies and partners across the world—Congress and the Trump administration can ensure that the United States, not China, leads the biotechnology age. Strategic action now is the difference between controlling the biotechnology future or being controlled by it.

            An American tourist was fatally stabbed and another wounded during an attempted robbery early Wednesday in the coastal town of Cascais, west of Lisbon, according to authorities.
    


            The incident happened near the Church of the Navigators, with emergency services receiving an alert at around 3:16 a.m., CNN Portugal reported.
    


            Investigators say one of the tourists was returning to his hotel when three suspects confronted him and tried to rob him. The victim resisted, was punched, and attempted to flee while calling a friend for help. When the second tourist arrived at the scene, he was also assaulted.
    


            The attackers fatally stabbed one of the men and seriously injured the other before fleeing.
    


            The three suspects have been arrested and are now being questioned by police. One of the men faces a homicide charge, while the others are accused of taking part in the assault.
    


            The victim's death was first reported by Correio da Manhã and later confirmed by CNN Portugal.
    


            Emergency medical teams from the National Institute of Medical Emergency (INEM) attempted to resuscitate the man, but the stab wounds were deep and struck vital areas, authorities said.
    


            The second victim was taken to Santa Maria Hospital in Lisbon. Despite suffering deep cuts to his face and arms, he is no longer in critical condition, according to hospital officials.
    


            The State Department told CNN it is aware of reports of an attack on two US tourists in Cascais, and stands ready to provide consular assistance.

Live Updates


            • Major case: The Supreme Court heard oral arguments this morning in a major case that threatens to undermine the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Louisiana v. Callais centers on the creation of a second Black-majority congressional district in the state.
    


            • National impact: While the dispute is focused on Louisiana's congressional map, the outcome will have nationwide implications. Voting rights groups who warn that undermining some of the law's protections for redistricting risks “wiping out minority representation and re-segregating legislatures, city councils, and school boards.”
    


            • Potential future reversal: Signals from the conservative majority today have pointed to a potential reversal on the Louisiana map with a possible retrenchment of the landmark civil rights law.
    


            • 2026 midterms: How far the court goes could also impact the balance of power in the US House after the midterm elections. A ruling for Louisiana could prompt a redrawing of districts by other GOP-led states that would almost certainly give a boost to Republicans.
    


            The Supreme Court's conservative majority signaled deep skepticism today over a second majority Black district drawn in Louisiana, despite a lower court ruling that found the district was likely necessary to respect the landmark Voting Rights Act.
    


            At issue is a second majority Black district drawn in Louisiana following the 2020 census that elected Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat, to the House. The state drew that district in response to a lower court that found the state likely violated the landmark 1965 civil rights law with the initial version of its map.
    


            Key to the argument was Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who just two years ago was the deciding vote upholding the Voting Rights Act provision in a case involving Alabama's map. This time around, Kavanaugh repeatedly leaned into two points suggesting he had reservations with Louisiana's map.
    


            Kavanaugh, a conservative, and others signaled an interest in the Trump administration's approach to the Louisiana case. The Trump administration sided with Louisiana – and against the Black voters – but in a way that would likely erode the power of the Voting Rights Act while not gutting it entirely.
    


            Kavanaugh also returned to an argument about whether the Voting Rights Act can indefinitely require the drawing of “remedial” majority-minority districts. In other contexts, including college admissions, the court has ruled that such race-based decision making must have some sort of time limit.
    


            At one point, Kavanaugh quoted from earlier decisions suggesting that “race-based districting” embarks the nation on a “most dangerous course.”
    


            Early on, Chief Justice John Roberts – who joined with Kavanaugh and the court's liberals in the Alabama case two years ago – quickly sought to draw a distinction between that outcome and the Louisiana case, suggesting he didn't see the earlier precedent as controlling this case.
    


            The court's three-justice liberal wing focused much of its fire on Congress's intent in enacting the landmark Voting Rights Act in 1965: to root out discrimination that targeted African American voters. They have questioned the Trump administration's approach, suggesting it would require plaintiffs to meet a much higher standard than is required by the Voting Rights Act to find discriminatory maps.
    


            The Supreme Court's decision to hear arguments Wednesday on Louisiana's congressional map is highly unusual: It is a rare instance in which the justices are engaging in a do-over.
    


            The court already heard arguments in the Louisiana case in March, during its last term. Instead of handing down a decision in June, the court announced on its final day that it intended to schedule a new set of arguments in the case.
    


            Such re-arguments have often occurred in high-profile cases. Roe v. Wade, the case that established a constitutional right to abortion, was first argued in 1971 and again in 1972. The precedent was subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022.
    


Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark case that found school segregation unconstitutional, was argued in 1952 and then argued again in 1953.
    


            More recently, the high court argued the landmark campaign finance case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2009 and then again in 2010.
    


            The case before the Supreme Court is about Louisiana's congressional districts, but the decision will almost certainly have national implications.
    


            For one thing, it could ultimately reduce the number of representatives of color at all levels of government.
    


            Voting rights groups warn that a ruling in Louisiana's favor risks “wiping out minority representation and re-segregating legislatures, city councils, and school boards.”
    


            That would be most immediately apparent for Rep. Cleo Fields, a Black Democrat from Louisiana who represents the state's disputed 6th Congressional District. A ruling for Louisiana would almost certainly mean a significant redrawing of his congressional district.
    


            Because race and politics are often closely intertwined, a ruling in the case could change the balance of power in the House after the 2026 midterm election. A ruling for Louisiana could prompt a redrawing of districts by other GOP-led states that would almost certainly give a boost to Republicans.
    


            And because it's Louisiana, the case could also affect the districts of key House leaders, notably Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise – both Republicans who represent the state in Congress.
    


            A 39-year-old precedent, Thornburg v. Gingles, is playing a central role in the Supreme Court's oral arguments today over the Voting Rights Act.
    


            As part of its argument before the court, Louisiana officials have specifically called for the Gingles precedent to be overturned.
    


            The case dealt with North Carolina's legislative districts that were challenged by Black voters as violating the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court unanimously agreed with them.
    


            But the lasting legacy of the opinion is as the standard courts use to determine if a violation of the Voting Rights Act has occurred. Congress specifically declined to endorse the idea of “proportionality” – the idea that a third of districts should be available to Black candidates if African Americans make up a third of the population. Instead, courts look to the “Gingles factors.”
    


            First, a plaintiff must establish that a racial minority group is large enough and compact enough to make up a majority of a district. Second, plaintiffs must show that the group at issue is “politically cohesive.” Then, plaintiffs must demonstrate that the majority group (i.e. White voters) vote sufficiently together to defeat a minority group's preferred candidate.
    


            If a plaintiff challenging a map can meet those requirements, courts then look to what's known as the “totality of the circumstances” to determine if the district boundaries leave minority voters with “less opportunity than White voters to elect representatives of their choice.” Those can include factors like how much success minority candidates have in state elections as well as the state's past history of racial discrimination.
    


            Hashim Mooppan, a veteran attorney who has taken on several high-profile Supreme Court cases at the Justice Department this year, is now speaking on behalf of the Trump administration.
    


            Mooppan, a former clerk to the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, is the principal deputy solicitor general. Prior to joining the Trump administration, he was a partner at the Jones Day law firm.
    


            Even casual court observers may be familiar with Mooppan, a rising star who just argued another case before the high court involving “conversion therapy.” In that case, the administration sided with a licensed counselor in Colorado who is challenging the state's ban on the discredited practice.
    


            Mooppan was also a counselor to the solicitor general during the first Trump administration. The Trump administration is siding with Louisiana in the current redistricting fight.
    


            Justices often use oral arguments to signal to their colleagues how a case should be resolved, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh appears to using his questions about Louisiana's congressional map and the Voting Rights Act to do just that.
    


            Kavanaugh, a conservative, has repeatedly signaled an interest in the Trump administration's approach to the case. The Trump administration sided with Louisiana – and against the Black voters in the case – but in a way that is slightly less far reaching than the state's argument when it comes to the Voting Rights Act.
    


            The Trump administration has suggested that race might still be used in a limited way to redraw district boundaries in some circumstances. Louisiana has argued, by comparison, that race cannot be used at all. Just how that delta might play out in practice is not entirely clear but, at least in this case, Louisiana's current map would need to be redrawn under the Trump administration's approach.
    


            Kavanaugh, at one point, told the attorney for Louisiana that he thought the Trump administration's approach “solves a lot of the concerns that you've identified.”
    


            The lineup of attorneys in the case has affected the cadence of the Supreme Court's arguments in an unusual way. Because Louisiana switched its position – and no longer supports its own map – only one attorney stood before the justices to defend the current map, which includes a second Black majority district.
    


            That attorney was Janai Nelson, with the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund. She faced tough and skeptical questions from Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and others.
    


            Subsequent attorneys all believe that Louisiana's map should be tossed – based on different legal reasons. And now it is likely to be the court's three-justice liberal wing – Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson – who will likely do the most speaking.
    


            Edward Greim, an attorney who fought the IRS during the Obama administration over its scrutiny of conservative groups, is speaking on behalf of the “non-Black” voters who sued over the current version of Louisiana's map.
    


            Greim, a Missouri native and 2002 Harvard Law graduate, argued the same case when the justices heard it previously in March.
    


            Greim represented a group of Tea Party advocates in a high-profile, class action legal case alleging the IRS aggressively scrutinized conservative groups during the Obama administration. The case resulted in a settlement in 2017.
    


            Greim is arguing on behalf of a group of “non-Black” plaintiffs who alleged Louisiana's updated map violated the 14th and 15th Amendments, which were ratified after the Civil War.
    


            Justice Sonia Sotomayor stressed at one point that race has traditionally been used lawfully in the redistricting process as she pushed back on Louisiana's argument that it cannot be used to remedy violations of the Voting Rights Act.
    


            “Race is a part of redistricting always… Race is always a part of these decisions, and my colleagues are trying to tease it out in this intellectual way that doesn't deal with the fact that race is used to help people,” Sotomayor, the court's senior liberal member, told Louisiana Solicitor General Ben Aguiñaga.
    


            “Legislators might try to keep an ethnic community in one district. They might consider it to get a sense of which district to draw an incumbent into. They might review it to predict what kind of issues a district voter might be particularly interested in. They might use it to inform partisan goals,” she said. “We permit all of that.”
    


                    “What you're saying to us: ‘If you use it to remedy past, lingering discrimination, intentional discrimination, then you can't use it. You can use it to help yourself achieve goals that reduce a particular group's electoral participation, but you can't use it to remedy that situation.' That's what you want us to hold.”
                





            The congressional district that kicked off the current Supreme Court case is Louisiana's 6th District, currently held by Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat.
    


            The district slashes diagonally from Shreveport in the northwest of the state to Baton Rouge in the southeast for some 250 miles to create a district where Black residents make up some 54% of voters – up from about 24% under the old lines.
    


            Earlier this year, Chief Justice John Roberts referred to it as a “snake.” That's important because one of the traditional goals for mapmakers is to draw congressional districts that are “compact.”
    


            “If you look at CD6, what does ‘reasonably compact' mean?” Roberts said during the first arguments in March. “I mean, it's – it's a snake that runs from one end of the state to the other. I mean, how is that compact?”
    


            Several conservative Supreme Court justices signaled skepticism over the creation of a second majority Black district in Louisiana in the early stages of oral arguments Wednesday.
    


            In a mostly subdued series of questions, the conservative justices – notably Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh – asked questions that at least suggested concerns with Louisiana's drawing of a second Black majority district.
    


            It wasn't until roughly 45 minutes into arguments that some of them began raising fundamental constitutional questions about the use of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.
    


            Kavanaugh was perhaps the most important questioner during the first round. At one point, he quoted from earlier decisions suggesting that “race-based districting” embarks the nation on a “most dangerous course.”
    


            The Donald Trump-nominated justice also repeatedly returned to the question of whether states can rely on the Voting Rights Act to draw majority-minority districts indefinitely.
    


            Ben Aguiñaga, the top appellate attorney for the state of Louisiana, is at the podium on behalf of the Pelican State.
    


            A former clerk to Justice Samuel Alito and a Texas native, Aguiñaga has argued at the Supreme Court twice before, including once when justices heard this same case in March. He also argued on behalf of states who last year alleged that the government's efforts to combat online misinformation amounted to a form of unconstitutional censorship.
    


            Aguiñaga received his law degree from Louisiana State University in 2015 and clerked for US Circuit Judge Edith Jones on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.
    


            He spent a year as the chief of staff for the Civil Rights Division at the US Department of Justice during President Donald Trump's first administration. He was an attorney at Jones Day for nearly five years before joining the Louisiana attorney general's office in early 2024.
    


            When Justice Elena Kagan asked an attorney for Black voters in Louisiana what the “results on the ground” would be if the Supreme Court strikes down Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the lawyer made no bones about how devastating she believed the outcome would be.
    


            “Were Section Two to cease to operate in the way that you just described … what could happen? What would the results on the ground be?” Kagan, a member of the court's liberal wing, asked Janai Nelson.
    


            “I think the results would be pretty catastrophic,” Nelson responded quickly.
    


            She continued: “If we take Louisiana as one example, every congressional member who is Black was elected from a VRA opportunity district.”
    


                    “We only have the diversity that we see across the South, for example, because of litigation that forced the creation of opportunity districts under the Voting Rights Act.” 
                





            Justice Brett Kavanaugh is pressing on a point that is central to the case: Whether redistricting that takes race into account should be allowed to carry on indefinitely.
    


            It's potentially a signal that Kavanaugh is skeptical of the position raised by Black voters. The Supreme Court raised a similar point in striking down affirmative action admissions policies in 2023.
    


            “This court's cases, in a variety of contexts, has said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time,” the conservative justice asked.  “But that they should not be indefinite and should have an end point. What exactly do you think the end point should be?”
    


            Janai Nelson, representing the Black voters in Louisiana, has argued that the Voting Rights Act has a time limit built in, because states must redraw their maps with a new census every decade.
    


            One of the arguments Louisiana and critics of the Voting Rights Act is making is that the confusion around how to apply the law in redistricting has spurred a bevy of lawsuits, even as minority representation has increased and housing segregation has decreased.
    


            That line of attack has drawn some interest from conservative justices in the past.
    


            But an interesting brief from the Voting Rights Initiative at the University of Michigan Law School has made the opposition point: The number of vote dilution lawsuits based on Section 2 of the VRA, it says, has gone down.
    


            Janai Nelson, representing the Black voters in Louisiana, pointed to that brief early in her arguments on Wednesday.
    


            According to that brief, the number of Section 2 vote claims has almost halved over recent decades.
    


            “Courts today adjudicate far fewer Section 2 vote dilution claims, and find far fewer Section 2 violations, than in prior decades,” the brief claims.
    


            In his typical understated way, Chief Justice John Roberts threw some early shade in his opening question on the idea that Supreme Court already decided this case in favor of the Voting Rights Act two years ago.
    


            His pushback is important because the attorney for Black voters in the case noted the court just upheld the Voting Rights Act in a similar redistricting case dealing with Alabama two years ago. Roberts was having none of it – suggesting he doesn't believe the Alabama case resolves the issue.
    


            Roberts supported the Voting Rights Act in the Alabama case. His vote is likely up for grabs in the Louisiana appeal.
    


            In that case, Roberts said, the court “considered Alabama's particular challenge” not necessarily one that would apply to Louisiana.
    


            If the Supreme Court ultimately sides with Louisiana and overturns a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, the outcome will beg an obvious question: Why didn't the court do it two years ago?
    


            Way back in 2023, a 5-4 majority of the high court ordered Alabama officials to redraw that state's congressional map to allow an additional Black majority district. That outcome came even though Alabama raised some of the same arguments then that Louisiana is raising now.
    


            That decision came as a surprise, after oral arguments suggested a majority was likely on Alabama's side.
    


            And some of the language in that opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, is particularly striking when viewed alongside the arguments Louisiana is making in its appeal. Louisiana, for instance, has come out strong for the prospect that the Constitution requires a colorblind approach to redistricting.
    


            “The contention that mapmakers must be entirely ‘blind' to race has no footing” in the court's Voting Rights Act precedents, Roberts wrote in 2023.
    


            “The line that we have long drawn is between consciousness and predominance.”
    


            It would take only one justice to switch votes in that case, Allen v.Milligan, to land on a different outcome for Louisiana.
    


            Justice Clarence Thomas, a member of the court's conservative wing and its most senior associate justice, is asking the first question – which he almost always does these days during oral arguments at the Supreme Court.
    


            Thomas started off with a series of technical questions about the original court order striking down Louisiana's first map. Previously, the conservative justice has expressed skepticism about that court's decision – and he reiterated some of that skepticism on Wednesday.
    


            “There was never a full merits determination,” Thomas said.
    


            Thomas' position on the case is the clearest of all the nine justices. When the court declined to decide the Louisiana redistricting appeal earlier this year – holding it over for a second set of arguments – Thomas wrote separately to say he would have decided right then and there that the Voting Rights Act could not be used to justify creating another majority Black district.
    


            Thomas wrote then that the way a majority of the court has approached the issue is “broken beyond repair.”
    


            It's a point Thomas has been making for years. He has been joined at various times by fellow conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett.
    


            The unusual posture of the Supreme Court's major Voting Rights Act case means only one attorney will stand before the justices on Wednesday to defend Louisiana's congressional map. That task fell to Janai Nelson as oral arguments began just after 10 a.m. ET. 



            Nelson, a Fulbright scholar and former law professor, is the president and director-counsel of the storied NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
    


            Nelson is representing a group of Black voters who challenged Louisiana's first map under the Voting Rights Act. A lower court found that first version likely violated the VRA and that is what prompted the state to draw the second map, which is now at issue before the Supreme Court.
    


            Nelson received her law degree from UCLA and clerked for US Circuit Judge Theodore McMillian on the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals and US District Judge David Coar in Illinois.

            Republicans are ratcheting up their extraordinary efforts to tip the scales of the 2026 midterm elections by redistricting new GOP-leaning US House seats in the middle of the decade.
    


            Such efforts have now proceeded apace in Missouri and North Carolina. Indiana and Kansas are weighing it, too, with pressure from the Trump White House. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that his state would join the fray if the Supreme Court opens the floodgates to more partisan gerrymandering.
    


            All would join Texas, whose gambit to add five GOP seats set off this redistricting arms race and drew California Democrats to attempt to offset those gains.
    


            It's a striking power grab — one Democrats will try to match but can't.
    


            And it's all the more remarkable given Americans don't seem to like it, with polls showing they don't think this is how the people's business should be conducted.
    


            The GOP seems to have reasoned that this bare-knuckle tactic will be worth it, because people just don't care enough.
    


            As all this was happening this week, North Carolina state House Speaker Destin Hall on Monday offered a remarkable justification.
    


            “@POTUS's victory sent a clear message: the voters are with him,” Hall posted on X. “NC won't allow radical Dems like @CAgovernor to redraw districts and undermine the will of the people.”
    


            Hall made no mention of Texas getting the ball rolling by  undermining “the will of the people.”
    


            He also failed to mention that California Gov. Gavin Newsom will only succeed with “the will of the people” expressly on his side. That's because California, unlike these red states, requires voters to pass a ballot measure before Democrats can redraw their districts. (Voters will make that choice this fall.)
    


            That dynamic reinforces what a cynical power grab the GOP's efforts are.
    


            Pretty much every other state that's doing this appears to be violating the will of the people based on national polling that shows Americans don't like gerrymandering, especially mid-decade gerrymandering. (There's limited state-level data on the issue that meets CNN standards.)
    


            A CBS News-YouGov poll last month gave people a series of choices for how this mid-decade redistricting battle should play out.
    


            Just one-quarter thought their preferred side should draw more favorable districts. Three-quarters wanted either more competitive districts (32%) or for everyone to wait to draw new districts after the next census, like normal (43%).
    


            (Indeed, that's what's extraordinary here. Both sides gerrymander extensively after censuses are conducted, but it's very rare to do so in the middle of the decade when courts haven't ordered it. In the few cases that's been done, it's been Republicans leading the charge, as in Texas.)
    


            A Yahoo News-YouGov poll around the same time showed Americans taking a dim view of the GOP's gambit.
    


            Americans as a whole disapproved of what Texas did by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, 49%-25%. They disapproved of President Donald Trump encouraging other GOP-controlled states to mimic Texas by a similar margin, 52%-25%.
    


            In both cases, independents were 3-to-1 opposed.
    


            And that's where things get interesting. Given all of this, you might expect Americans to also take a dim view of what California Democrats are doing.
    


            But they didn't. The Yahoo News-YouGov survey noted that Newsom has pitched this as a “hardball” response to the GOP's power grab — which it certainly is. And Americans were actually about evenly split on whether it was a legitimate response. While 39% approved, 37% disapproved.
    


            That seems to echo growing signs in California that Newsom's efforts might succeed.
    


            In other words, Americans seem to see a difference between what the GOP is doing and what Democrats are doing.
    


            And there is certainly a difference, both in who started it and the magnitude of their efforts.
    


            The question from there is how much Americans care. Yes, they might regard gerrymandering as icky and mid-decade gerrymandering as even ickier, but that doesn't mean it will swing many votes.
    


            Indeed, a CNN poll last month showed just 25% American adults said the issue of “efforts to redraw the lines for congressional House districts” was “extremely important” to them. That was far less than many other issues like the economy (60%), health care (53%) and crime (42%). Though it did notably eclipse foreign policy (21%) and gender-identity and transgender issues (16%).
    


            Republicans trying to maintain their narrow grip on the US House seem to have reasoned that however much Americans might view their gambit as a cynical ploy, it'll be worth the handful of more favorable districts.
    


            It might be a good bet, but that doesn't mean they have “the will of the people” on their side.

            Federal agents have shifted attention away from serious gun crimes and shady weapons dealers to focus on President Donald Trump's crackdown on undocumented immigrants and deployments to patrol cities, according to current and former officials and data reviewed by CNN.
    


            As part of a surge of 23,000 federal officers from a slew of agencies sent to work on Trump's deportation efforts, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has reassigned 80% of special agents to immigration cases, according to a former senior official at the agency. Other agents have been assigned to surges Trump has ordered to Washington, DC, Los Angeles and other cities.
    


            ATF is just one of several federal law enforcement agencies that have felt a notable impact on normal duties while assisting with the immigration mission, a CNN review has found.
    


            ATF has lost one in every seven firearms license investigators to job reductions and retirements this year – and stands to lose 550 of the remaining 600 under Trump's new proposed budget. The agency also has adopted onerous new rules that make it nearly impossible to revoke licenses from firearms dealers who fail to do mandated background checks or who break other laws, according to former and current ATF officials.
    


            As a result, ATF did not move to revoke a single dealer's license in the first four and a half months of this year, a former senior official said, adding that the bureau was on pace for at least a 90% drop from last year under President Joe Biden – when 195 dealers lost the ability to sell guns.
    


            One ATF investigator said the shift in priorities is certain to have deadly consequences.
    


            “They're de-regulating an industry that sells tools that can take people's lives in seconds,” said the agent who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal. “We'll have guns getting into the hands of people who definitely shouldn't have them.”
    


            A CNN investigation in 2019 documented how unlicensed guns can wreak violent havoc and drive significant crime nationally.
    


            Critics say the effects at ATF reflect the broader costs of Trump's relentless immigration focus and his push to cut down agency staffing – a trend reflected in a drop in criminal referrals to the Department of Justice from other agencies, including an 8.6% decrease in Drug Enforcement Administration cases through July compared with a year ago, according to records obtained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. ATF has seen a 2% decline, that data show.
    


            But the drop in drug and gun cases is likely steeper than those statistics show, current and former agency officials said. The statistics don't indicate what kind of criminal charge each agency has filed with the DOJ – meaning that referrals from arrests made by ATF agents working immigration raids or city patrols, rather than gun cases, could be included in the data, TRAC said.
    


            At the FBI, 23% of agents have been detailed to focus on immigration, according to statistics shared with CNN by Virginia Sen. Mark Warner's office – including about 45% of agents in the 25 biggest field offices. Similarly, about three-fourths of DEA agents, a third of US deputy marshals, and nearly all Homeland Security Investigations agents have been diverted to work on immigration, according to ICE documents detailing assignments through the end of August that were first obtained by the Cato Institute.
    


            Trump won reelection on a campaign that promised mass deportations and a crackdown on crime. In a statement, the White House said its efforts using federal officers have led to the capture of gang members and a renewed focus on law enforcement.
    


            “Despite fake news narratives, the Administration is holding all criminals accountable whether they're illegal aliens or American citizens,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told CNN.
    


            The DOJ, in a statement, also disputed that the immigration push was affecting other criminal enforcement.
    


            “Our mission is to prosecute criminals, get illegal guns off our streets, and protect all Americans from violent crime, which can be done while simultaneously assisting our partners with immigration enforcement efforts,” a DOJ spokesperson said in a statement.
    


            The DOJ statement also said ATF agents have charged more than 4,000 suspects since January and seized more than 22,000 weapons. It isn't clear how these numbers compare to a year earlier.
    


            However, a former senior ATF official said the vast majority of suspects arrested by the agency this year came in immigration cases – not gun investigations.
    


            “It's what they're not doing,” said Scott Shuchart, a former ICE assistant director for regulatory affairs and policy. “They are harming the country by undermining federal law enforcement… They are going to get Americans killed so they can deport foreigners.”
    


            The ATF has been one of the hardest hit agencies by the White House's diversion of federal officers.
    


            The agency's roughly 5,000 employees include about 600 investigators, who conduct thousands of inspections annually of gun sellers and federal explosives licensees, and about 2,500 special agents, who investigate arson, bombings, the illegal use and trafficking of firearms or explosives, and incidents of terrorism, among other crimes.
    


            Work in both those sections has slowed sharply, current and former ATF employees who spoke to CNN said, with agents moved to help with immigration enforcement and crime prevention in DC and elsewhere.
    


            “The number of criminal investigations has bottomed out,” said a former senior ATF executive, who asked not to be named. “ATF agents essentially aren't opening cases solely based on domestic firearms trafficking.”
    


            While ATF officials expect those agents to return to their normal work at some point, the agency also faces a more than $400 million cut in the Trump administration's proposed budget for the new fiscal year beginning October 1 – roughly a quarter of its full budget.
    


            Former ATF officials said the bureau already has lost more than 100 inspectors and supervisors to attrition and reductions-in-force this year.
    


            The Trump administration's policy choices also have deeply affected the agency – particularly around gun regulations.
    


            In early April, the ATF repealed the Biden administration's “Zero Tolerance Policy,” which allowed inspectors to recommend expedited revocation of firearms licenses for certain serious violations. That Biden policy had resulted in an increase in revocations, up to 195 in 2024.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi said the rule had “unfairly targeted law-abiding gun owners.”
    


            ATF, which previously made revocations data and notices of revocations public, hasn't published that data since Trump took office.
    


            But as one result of the policy change, those inspectors still on the job are taking away far fewer licenses from gun sellers who break the law, agents said. Now, regardless of the severity of the violation, any license revocations must be approved by a string of senior leaders, internal ATF emails obtained by CNN show.
    


            “Since January, there's been a total 180º on our authority and what we can do,” said an ATF investigator, who asked not to be named because they were speaking without authorization. “As soon as the new administration was in, we got directed from leadership to put a full stop on all revocations of federal firearms licenses.”
    


            The investigator added, “We can't revoke someone's license; at most what we can do is issue a warning letter or have a warning conference. Even that is just a slap on the wrist. It isn't anything that would put these guys out of business.”
    


            ATF, in a statement on its website, said that the bureau is “ushering in a new chapter – marked by transparency, accountability, and partnership with the firearms industry.”
    


            Having fewer inspectors on the job has also led to fewer criminal referrals to DOJ, said a former senior bureau official who asked not to be named. Previously, about a third of ATF's criminal firearm trafficking investigations stemmed from leads that came via inspections, the official said.
    


            “Without that information, there will be a drastic decline in the number of traffickers that are identified and investigated. So, this has the potential to not only crush law enforcement's ability to obtain any investigative lead through (gun) trace(s), but also, it's going to completely hamper ATF's ability to investigate firearms trafficking,” the official said.
    


            Pam Hicks, former ATF chief counsel, said that cutting inspections “makes it less likely a crime gun can be completely traced next time. It undermines the entire system of how firearms laws work, of how the system is designed to work.”
    


            Fewer inspections may also make it easier for traffickers who sell guns to cartels in Mexico.
    


            “Seventy percent of weapons recovered in Mexico trace back to the US,” said Topher McDougal, a professor at the University of San Diego who has studied gun trafficking. He and a colleague used gun-tracing data that the US government doesn't release to the public but does provide to the Mexican government that was leaked in a hack of Mexican military records last year.
    


            That data showed that firearms license inspections significantly affect gun trafficking to Mexico, McDougal said. On average, a licensee who received a warning letter or notice of violation from the ATF was “90% less likely to have its weapons show up in Mexico the following year,” he said.
    


            Even the trade association for the firearms industry expressed concern about the severity of the proposed ATF budget and staffing cuts, saying they “might be better done with a scalpel instead of a meat cleaver.”
    


            The Trump administration has not said how long it plans to keep federal law enforcement agents on immigration assignments. At Trump's direction, agents from 13 federal agencies, including ATF, FBI and DEA, recently deployed in Memphis, Tennessee.
    


            Federal law enforcement agencies are exempt from furloughs during the government shutdown that started October 1. With Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought telling Congress that layoffs, which started Friday, could target agencies that don't fit into the Trump administration's priorities, it is unclear how the shutdown will affect ATF, the FBI and some other agencies.
    


            Other agencies beyond ATF are also feeling the strain.
    


            At the FBI, “a lot of the field offices have been told a third of your agents need to work on immigration issues,” a person familiar with the bureau's operations told CNN. “A lot of people, you're going to lose your sources, you're going to stop an investigation, to do street patrol in DC … Obviously other things can't get done, if you're doing these patrols.”
    


            Christopher O'Leary, a former senior executive at the FBI who now works for The Soufan Group, an intelligence and security consultancy, said that pulling agents into immigration or policing city streets necessarily means dropping other cases.
    


            “The FBI has a finite amount of resources,” he said. “You have to give something else up. They're not only giving up counterterrorism and counterespionage, but they've also turned away from white-collar crime, fraud and public corruption cases.”
    


            At the FBI, the shortfall has been aggravated by purges of more than two dozen agents and leaders fired or forced to resign for their work investigating the January 6 insurrection or for being perceived as opposed to Trump's agenda. Further, a person familiar with the bureau told CNN that more than 300 additional agents stepped down at the end of September, taking the Trump administration's “fork in the road” retirements.
    


            The White House's use of agents in immigration issues is driving agents to retire early or find other work, some former officials said.
    


            “There's a real disturbance throughout the organization,” said O'Leary, the former FBI executive, of his former agency. “If people are close to retirement they're counting down the days.” As for those being fired or forced to take early retirement, he said, “When they're thrown out, the younger agents who look up to them are asking is this the right place.”
    


            For agents who stay on the job, the diversions are driving a morale crisis that goes hand in hand with the drop in prosecutions.
    


            “No one signs up to be an FBI agent to go into a kitchen and arrest someone washing dishes, or joins the DEA to stop a landscaping truck,” said former Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske. “They're all used to being deployed for significant issues.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — With every passing day of the government shutdown, hundreds of thousands of federal employees furloughed or working without pay face mounting financial strain. And now they are confronting new uncertainty with the Trump administration's promised layoffs.

Little progress has been made to end the shutdown as it enters its third week, with Republicans and Democrats digging in and convinced their messaging is resonating with voters. The fate of the federal workers is among several pressure points that could eventually push the sides to agree to resolve the stalemate.

“Luckily I was able to pay rent this month,” said Peter Farruggia, a furloughed federal worker. “But for sure I am going to have bills that are going to go unpaid this month, and I really don't have many options.”

The shutdown has a familiar feel for many federal employees who endured past stalemates — including during President Donald Trump's first term — but this time, the stakes are higher. The Republican White House is leveraging federal workers' jobs to pressure Democrats to soften their demands.

The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Trump and other Republican leaders have said the government must reopen before they will negotiate with Democrats on the health subsidies.




Government shutdownThe AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them?

Farruggia is the executive committee chair of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883, representing employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency that faced a wave of layoffs over the weekend. Like 8,000 other CDC employees who have been furloughed from the agency, he was already living paycheck to paycheck, and the partial pay that arrived Friday was his last until the government comes back online.

With the agency's leadership in turmoil and still rattled from a shooting, the shutdown and new firings mean “people are scared, nervous, anxious, but also really just exasperated,” Farruggia said. 

After Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said last week on social media that the “RIFs have begun,” referring to reduction-in-force plans aimed at reducing the size of the federal government, Vice President JD Vance doubled down on the threat Sunday, saying “the longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be.”

The layoffs have begun across federal agencies. Labor unions have already filed a lawsuit to stop the move by Trump's budget office.

In a court filing on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget said well over 4,000 federal employees from eight departments and agencies would be fired in conjunction with the shutdown.

Jessica Sweet, an Albany, New York, Social Security claims specialist who is a union steward of AFGE Local 3343 in New York, said, “I, myself, have a backup plan” in case she is fired during the shutdown, “but I know most people don't.” 

She says the Social Security Administration is already so short-staffed from layoffs earlier this year brought on by the Department of Government Efficiency, she doesn't fear a massive layoff during the shutdown. 

“The one thing this administration has taught me is that nothing is ever for certain, even if it's codified into law,” she said.

Having received a partial payment in her last paycheck, Sweet has begun reaching out to her local power companies to request that she not get charged late fees, since “my bills won't wait for me to eventually get paid.”

For some federal workers, this isn't their first shutdown — the last one, during Trump's first term in 2019, stretched a record 34 days. But this time, federal employees are being used more directly as leverage in the political fight over government funding.

The Republican administration last week warned that there would be no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a shutdown — a reversal of long-standing policy affecting roughly 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a White House memo. The move, which Trump later backtracked on, was widely seen as a strong-arm tactic.

Adam Pelletier, a National Labor Relations Board field examiner whose agency furloughed nearly all of its workforce on Oct. 1, going from roughly 1,100 workers to fewer than a dozen people, said he wouldn't mind if the shutdown continued if it meant meaningful progress toward gaining health care protections for Americans across the country — a key demand by Democrats for ending the stalemate. 

Pelletier, a union leader for NLRB local 3, said “right now, nothing is being investigated at the NLRB. There's no elections for unions or elections for decertifications. Basically nothing is happening.”

As for the financial strain on workers, he said workers can't even find alternate employment to weather the shutdown because “the ethics office that would approve of those requests is not staffed now.”

National Treasury Employees Union President Doreen Greenwald, which represents workers across dozens of federal agencies, said several of the union's members had been laid off as of Friday. The Treasury Department would lose 1,446 workers, according to the filing.

Greenwald said it was unfortunate that the Trump administration was using “federal employees as political pawns by furloughing and proposing to fire them all to try to cause pressure in a political game of chicken.”

“This isn't about one party or the other. It's about real people,” said Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees.

“The correction officer worrying about his next paycheck. The TSA officer who still shows up to work because he or she loves their country, even though they're not getting paid. No American should ever have to choose between serving their country and feeding their family,” Kelley said.

Kelley and other major federal worker union leaders gathered blocks from the Capitol last week, urging congressional leaders to find a solution and put “people over politics.” The event grew emotional at times, with union heads outlining the difficulties facing their members and the stakes growing daily.

Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, which represents 110,000 workers nationwide, called on both sides of Congress to find a resolution. He said Trump appeared to aim to “degrade, frighten, antagonize hardworking federal employees.”

Chris Bartley, political program coordinator for the International Association of Fire Fighters, said thousands of firefighters were showing up for work without pay out of a sense of devotion but stressed that could have broader consequences.

“Families go without income,” Bartley said. “Morale and retention suffer. Public safety is compromised.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — After months of aggressive immigration enforcement measures from the Trump administration, Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander adults are more likely to hold a negative view of President Donald Trump's handling of immigration, a new AAPI Data/AP-NORC poll finds.

About 7 in 10 AAPI adults nationwide disapprove of Trump's approach on immigration, according to the survey from AAPI Data and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, an increase from 58% in March. The new poll also finds that a solid majority of AAPI adults say the Republican president has overstepped on deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, and most oppose several specific tactics used by the administration, such as using the military and National Guard to carry out arrests or deportations.

The findings come as federal immigration agents expand a crackdown in the Chicago area, where more than 1,000 immigrants have been arrested since last month. The escalation in Chicago is just part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to boost deportations, which has been a high priority for the president since he took office at the beginning of the year. 

This approach does not seem to be landing well among AAPI adults, a diverse and rapidly growing group where many were born outside the U.S. Even among foreign-born AAPI adults, who tend to be more conservative, most disapprove of the president's handling of immigration. 

Joie Meyer, 25, was born in China and adopted as an infant. The Miami resident, who identifies as a Democrat, supports secure borders but Trump's recent actions have made her wonder what would happen if she suddenly lost her citizenship. 

“If I was at risk of like being stripped away from my home, family, friends, everything I knew because of like a technicality, which is what some people are facing, that's just heartbreaking,” Meyer said, adding that she finds Trump's methods “punitive.”

AAPI adults are particularly likely to think Trump has crossed a line on immigration enforcement. About two-thirds say Trump has “gone too far” when it comes to deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, compared to about 6 in 10 Black and Hispanic adults in a separate AP-NORC poll conducted in September. In that survey, less than half of white adults thought Trump had overstepped on immigration. 




The finding, combined with AAPI adults' increased disapproval of Trump on immigration, signals that the president's handling of the issue over the past few months may have turned some people off. Some may be finding “a big difference in terms of what policy support looks like in theory and how it plays out,” said Karthick Ramakrishnan, AAPI Data executive director and researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.

Immigration is frequently in the local news for 38-year-old Peter Lee of Tacoma, Washington, where there is an active Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center. He sees Trump as hastily meeting deportation quotas without compassion.

“One, there doesn't seem to be a clear game plan for what he's doing in terms of immigration enforcement other than just pure numbers. Second it seems like his directives come from just gut, not fact-based,” said Lee, a Democrat, who is Korean American. “The fact that he's deporting people to third-party countries not of their origin, I think that it's ridiculous.”

American-born and foreign-born AAPI adults are equally likely to think Trump has overstepped on immigration overall. But they're more divided on issues related to illegal immigration.

Just over half of foreign-born AAPI adults, who tend to be older and more conservative than other AAPI adults, support deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who have been charged with misdemeanors, compared to 41% of American-born AAPI adults. AAPI adults who were born outside the U.S. are also more likely than American-born AAPI adults to support deporting all immigrants who are in the country illegally.

More than half of AAPI adults are foreign-born, Ramakrishnan said, adding that American-born AAPI adults may be less “attuned in terms of what it takes to maintain one's status.”

Tyrone Tai, 65, who has homes in Tampa and Lauderhill, Florida, was born in Jamaica. The half-Chinese and half-Jamaican immigrated with his parents to New York City when he was 12. He recalls how they struggled but eventually gained U.S. citizenship. He indicated Trump has “not gone far enough” when it comes to arresting those who “jump the line.” 

AAPI adults who were born outside the U.S. are more likely than American-born AAPI adults to approve of Trump's handling of immigration, although they still don't rate him especially highly on the issue. They're also more likely to approve of his handling of crime, suggesting that the president's efforts to link illegal immigration with crime may be resonating with some among this group.

Some of the Trump administration's tactics are particularly unpopular among AAPI adults, the poll found. For example, about 6 in 10 AAPI adults oppose conducting large-scale immigration enforcement operations in neighborhoods with high populations of immigrants, deploying the military or National Guard to carry out arrests and deportations, detaining immigrants at their workplaces, or allowing agents to cover their faces during arrests. 

Videos of ICE officers wearing masks and snatching people while they are at work or on a public street has rattled Michael Ida, a 56-year-old resident of Honolulu. An independent and Christian, Ida believes that some immigrants in the country illegally may deserve to stay.

“When it comes down to justice or mercy, we should err on the side of mercy. It's very disturbing to me,” Ida said. “As an Asian American especially, I feel like there's a little bit of anxiety to travel outside of Hawaii.”

Tai, however, says that ICE agents should be allowed to wear masks.

“Those poor ICE agents, they're doing their job there and people are basically threatening their families. That shouldn't be,” Tai said. 

Ida, who is half Korean and half Japanese, sees parallels with World War II, when in 1942 the U.S. government began forcing Japanese Americans from their homes and into incarceration camps. 

“History doesn't repeat but it rhymes. There's kind of echoes of what happened in the past.”

The poll of 1,027 U.S. adults who are Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders was conducted from Sept 2-9, 2025, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based Amplify AAPI Panel, designed to be representative of the Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 5.0 percentage points.

A Florida judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked the planned transfer of prime downtown Miami land for President Donald Trump's future presidential library.

The move by Circuit Judge Mavel Ruiz came after a Miami activist alleged that officials at a local college violated Florida's open government law when they gifted the sizable plot of real estate to the state, which then voted to transfer it to the foundation for the planned library.

“This is not an easy decision,” Mavel said Tuesday when explaining her ruling from the bench, finding that the college didn't give the public reasonable notice ahead of the vote last month.

“This is not a case, at least for this court, rooted in politics,” she added. 

The nearly 3-acre (1.2-hectare) property is a developer's dream and is valued at more than $67 million, according to a 2025 assessment by the Miami-Dade County property appraiser. One real estate expert wagered that the parcel — one of the last undeveloped lots on an iconic stretch of palm tree-lined Biscayne Boulevard — could sell for hundreds of millions of dollars more.

Marvin Dunn, an activist and chronicler of local Black history, filed a lawsuit this month in a Miami-Dade County court against the Board of Trustees for Miami Dade College, a state-run school that owned the property. He alleged that the board violated Florida's Government in the Sunshine law by not providing sufficient notice for its special meeting on Sept. 23, when it voted to give up the land.

An agenda released ahead of the meeting simply stated the board would consider conveying property to a state fund overseen by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet, but provided no details on which piece of property was being considered or why. Unlike every other meeting the board has held this year, the 8 a.m. meeting on Sept. 23 was not livestreamed.

A week later, DeSantis and other top GOP officials voted to transfer the land again, effectively putting the property under the control of the Trump family when they deeded it to the foundation for Trump's library. That foundation is led by three trustees: Eric Trump, Tiffany Trump's husband, Michael Boulos, and the president's attorney James Kiley.




Jesus Suarez, an attorney for the college, argued that MDC did what was required under the law and questioned Dunn's political motivations for filing the case.

“There is no requirement under Florida law that there be specificity on notice, because those trustees can come into that room and talk to each other about whatever they wish,” Suarez said. 

Attorneys for Dunn maintain that no one who wasn't already in on the deal could have known what the board would do. 

“The people have a right to know what they're going to decide to do when the transaction is so significant, so unusual and deprives the students and the college of this land,” said plaintiff's attorney Richard Brodsky, speaking with The Associated Press prior to the judge's decision.

Javier Ley-Soto, general counsel for Miami Dade College, testified that it is still in the process of finalizing the land transfer. Delays caused by an injunction could cost the college up to $300,000, he estimated. 

Other Florida locations had previously been floated as library sites, including properties associated with Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton and Florida International University in suburban Miami. DeSantis signed a bill this year preempting local governments from blocking development of a presidential library, aiming to overrule potential opposition in liberal-leaning counties or municipalities.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to relocate World Cup matches set to be played next year in suburban Boston, after suggesting that parts of the city had been “taken over” by unrest. 

Foxborough, Massachusetts, home to the NFL's New England Patriots and about 30 miles from Boston, is set to stage matches as the U.S. cohosts the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada. Trump was asked about Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu, a Democrat whom he called “intelligent” but “radical left.” 

“We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. “I love the people of Boston and I know the games are sold out. But your mayor is not good.”

He suggested “they're taking over parts of Boston” without offering details, but added “we could get them back in about two seconds.”

The Trump administration has already deployed National Guard troops to Washington and Memphis, and efforts to do so in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, have sparked legal fights. 

Wu's office did not react directly to Trump's threat, issuing a statement that read, “Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions.”

Trump's comments came during his meeting with Argentina President Javier Milei and it wasn't immediately clear what he was referring to by parts of Boston having been seized. Earlier this month, however, there were multiple arrests in connection with a pro-Palestinian protest that turned violent on Boston Common. Four police officers were injured. 




Trump has previously suggested he could declare cities “not safe” for the 104-game soccer tournament and alter a detailed hosting plan that FIFA confirmed in 2022. It includes games at NFL stadiums near New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

World Cup host sites aren't up to Trump. The 11 U.S. cities — plus three in Mexico and two in Canada — are contracted with FIFA, which would face significant logistical and legal issues to make changes in the eight months before the June 11 kickoff.

“It's FIFA's tournament, FIFA's jurisdiction, FIFA makes those decisions,” the soccer body's vice president Victor Montagliani said earlier this month at a sports business conference in London.

Trump nonetheless said, “If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who's phenomenal -- and I would say, ‘Let's move into another location' and they would do that.”

The president meant FIFA head Gianni Infantino, a close ally. Trump said Infantino “wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.”

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Dallin H. Oaks, a former Utah Supreme Court justice, was named Tuesday as the new president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its more than 17 million members worldwide. 

Oaks' selection to lead what is widely known as the Mormon church follows the recent death of his 101-year-old predecessor, Russell M. Nelson. His ascension is not a surprise; a longstanding church policy says the longest-tenured member of a top leadership body called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles becomes the next president. The tradition is meant to ensure a seamless transition and prevent internal or public lobbying.

“I accept with humility the responsibility that God has placed upon me and commit my whole heart and soul to the service to which I've been called,” Oaks said.

As president, he is considered a prophet and seer who will guide the church through divine revelation from God alongside two top counselors and members of the Quorum of the Twelve. He'll set policy and oversee the church's many business interests.

The church's leadership transition comes as many of its members have been shaken by a deadly attack on a Michigan congregation, and are grappling with the high-profile assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah, where the denomination is based.

At 93, Oaks will be one of the church's oldest presidents. He will serve in the role until he dies. Tenures for past presidents have varied, with the longest reaching nearly 30 years and the shortest being just nine months.




Experts are doubtful Oaks will pivot sharply from Nelson's approach to leadership because he was one of Nelson's closest advisers. But they say he might shift from Nelson's focus on the faith's global footprint to domestic issues. 

In the first significant difference from Nelson's presidency, Oaks announced during the faith's recent general conference that the church will slow the announcement of new temples.

For his top counselors, Oaks selected Henry B. Eyring, 92, who also served in that role for Nelson, and former lawyer D. Todd Christofferson, 80, the church's seventh most senior apostle. 

Oaks' choices demonstrate his “deliberate and methodical leadership style,” said Paul Reeve, Simmons Chair of Mormon Studies at the University of Utah. While Christofferson was a somewhat unexpected choice, Reeve said it makes sense that the former Utah Supreme Court justice known for his jurist sensibilities would pick a former lawyer.

“I confess that this is not what I expected when I woke up this morning,” Christofferson said during Tuesday's announcement. “But I am deeply honored by this calling and the trust that it carries.”

While serving on a lower leadership panel in the 1990s, Christofferson was involved in negotiations with Jewish leaders regarding the church's posthumous baptisms of Holocaust victims. In 1994, following intense criticism from the Jewish community, the church agreed to end those ceremonial baptisms. After it was revealed that they continued, church leaders reiterated in 2012 that the practice was not allowed.

Jeffrey R. Holland, 84, the most senior apostle after Oaks — and thus next in line to be president — was not selected as a counselor but will lead the Quorum of the Twelve. “The concern there is declining health,” Reeve explained.

Oaks is also known for his traditionalist beliefs on marriage and religious freedom. He has been a driving force in the church against same-sex marriage and in upholding a teaching that homosexuality is a sin — a position that causes uneasiness among some LGBTQ+ members and their allies.

He said in 2022 that social and legal pressure would not influence the church to change its posture on same-sex marriage and matters of gender identity. 

In recent years, Oaks has been part of some key church moves that suggest he might not make the topic a centerpiece of his administration, experts say. Oaks was Nelson's closest adviser in 2019 when Nelson rescinded a policy that banned baptisms for children of gay parents and labeled same-sex couples as sinners eligible for expulsion.

Christofferson, who has a gay brother, was the apostle who church leaders put forward to explain and justify the ban back in 2015. At the time, his brother had recently rejoined the church after ending a lengthy relationship with his same-sex partner.

Oaks has also been a strong advocate for civil public discourse. Early on as an apostle, he was involved in a crackdown on far-right extremism that resulted in some excommunications. In 2020, he gave a speech about having faith in elections without resorting to radicalism or violence.

When the corroded pipeline burst in 2015, inky crude spread along the Southern California coast, becoming the state's worst oil spill in decades.

More than 140,000 gallons (3,300 barrels) of oil gushed out, blackening beaches for 150 miles (240 kilometers) from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles, polluting a biologically rich habitat for endangered whales and sea turtles, killing scores of pelicans, seals and dolphins, and decimating the fishing industry.

Plains All American Pipeline in 2022 agreed to a $230 million settlement with fishers and coastal property owners without admitting liability. Federal inspectors found that the Houston-based company failed to quickly detect the rupture and responded too slowly. It faced an uphill battle to build a new pipeline.

Three decades-old drilling platforms were subsequently shuttered, but another Texas-based fossil fuel company supported by the Trump administration purchased the operation and is intent on pumping oil through the pipeline again. 

Sable Offshore Corp., headquartered in Houston, is facing a slew of legal challenges but is determined to restart production, even if that means confining it to federal waters, where state regulators have virtually no say. California controls the 3 miles (5 kilometers) nearest to shore. The platforms are 5 to 9 miles (8 to 14 kilometers) offshore.

The Trump administration has hailed Sable's plans as the kind of project the president wants to increase U.S. energy production as the federal government removes regulatory barriers. President Donald Trump has directed Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to undo his predecessor's ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts. 

“This project risks another environmental disaster in California at a time when demand for oil is going down and the climate crisis is escalating,” said Alex Katz, executive director of Environmental Defense Center, the Santa Barbara group formed in response to a massive spill in 1969.

The environmental organization is among several suing Sable. 

“Our concern is that there is no way to make this pipeline safe and that this company has proven that it cannot be trusted to operate safely, responsibly or even legally,” he said.

Actor and activist Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who lives in the area, has implored officials to stop Sable, saying at a March protest: “I can smell a rat. And this project is a rat.”

The California Coastal Commission fined Sable a record $18 million for ignoring cease-and-desist orders over repair work it says was done without permits. Sable said it has permits from the previous owner, Exxon Mobil, and sued the commission while work continued on the pipeline. In June, a state judge ordered it to stop while the case proceeds through the court. The commission and Sable are due back in court Wednesday. 

“This fly-by-night oil company has repeatedly abused the public's trust, racking up millions of dollars in fines and causing environmental damage along the treasured Gaviota Coast,” a state park south of Santa Barbara, said Joshua Smith, the commission's spokesman.

So far, Sable is undeterred. 

The California Attorney General's office sued Sable this month, saying it illegally discharged waste into waterways, and disregarded state law requiring permits before work along the pipeline route that crosses sensitive wildlife habitat.

“Sable placed profits over environmental protection in its rush to get oil on the market,” the agency said in its lawsuit. 

Last month, the Santa Barbara District Attorney filed felony criminal charges against Sable, also accusing it of polluting waterways and harming wildlife.

Sable said it has fully cooperated with local and state agencies, including the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and called the district attorney's allegation “inflammatory and extremely misleading.” It said a biologist and state fire marshal officials oversaw the work, and no wildlife was harmed. 

The company is seeking $347 million for the delays, and says if the state blocks it from restarting the onshore pipeline system, it will use a floating facility that would keep its entire operation in federal waters and use tankers to transport the oil to markets outside California. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, the company updated its plan to include the option. 

The U.S. Interior Department's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said in July it was working with Sable to bring a second rig online. 

“President Trump made it clear that American energy should come from American resources,” the agency's deputy director Kenny Stevens said in a statement then, heralding the “comeback story for Pacific production.”

The agency said there are an estimated 190 million barrels (6 billion gallons) of recoverable oil reserves in the area, nearly 80% of residual Pacific reserves. It noted advancements in preventing and preparing for oil spills and said the failed pipeline has been rigorously tested. 

“Continuous monitoring and improved technology significantly reduce the risk of a similar incident occurring in the future,” the agency said. 

On May 19 — the 10th anniversary of the disaster — CEO Jim Flores announced that Sable “is proud to have safely and responsibly achieved first production at the Santa Ynez Unit” — which includes three rigs in federal waters, offshore and onshore pipelines, and the Las Flores Canyon Processing Facility.

State officials countered that the company had only conducted testing and not commercial production. Sable's stock price dropped and some investors sued, alleging they were misled.

Sable purchased the Santa Ynez Unit from Exxon Mobil in 2024 for nearly $650 million primarily with a loan from Exxon. Exxon sold the shuttered operation after losing a court battle in 2023 to truck the crude through central California while the pipeline system was rebuilt or repaired. 

Flores said well tests at the Platform Harmony rig indicate there is much oil to be extracted and that it will relieve California's gas prices — among the nation's highest — by stabilizing supplies.

“Sable is very concerned about the crumbling energy complex in California,” Flores said in a statement to The Associated Press. “With the exit of two refineries last year and more shuttering soon, California's economy cannot survive without the strong energy infrastructure it enjoyed for the last 150 years.”

California has been reducing the state's production of fossil fuels in favor of clean energy for years. The movement has been spearheaded partly by Santa Barbara County, where elected officials voted in May to begin taking steps to phase out onshore oil and gas operations.

 Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest on efforts to secure peace in the Middle East on 'Special Report.'

Two Americans were still among the deceased hostages held by Hamas on Wednesday, as the Palestinian terror group failed to meet the terms of President Donald Trump's peace plan.

Nineteen-year-old U.S.-Israeli dual citizen Itay Chen was initially believed to have been kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, while serving along the Gaza border, but was later declared dead by the IDF. His body is still held by Hamas in Gaza. 

Capt. Omer Neutra, 21, a fellow American-Israeli from New York, was killed in battle that same day, and his body remains in captivity.

TRUMP ISSUES DIRE WARNING TO HAMAS: IF THEY DON'T DISARM ‘WE WILL DISARM THEM'

""This two-year emotional roller coaster has reached one of its highest peaks,"" said Ronen Neutra, father of Omer Neutra, in an interview with Fox News Digital.

On Monday, Neutra met with Trump for an hour during the president's visit to Israel.

""We voiced our concern that no deceased hostage should remain in Gaza. We know we're dealing with a terror organization that exploits every grey area in any deal. While the living hostages were returned as agreed, we're already seeing violations,"" Neutra said. ""The president assured us he would do everything to bring our children home.""

Earlier Wednesday, Neutra and his wife went to sleep only at 3 a.m, after learning that the four bodies released by Hamas once again did not include their son — and that one of them wasn't even a hostage.

The U.S. hostage families met incoming SPEHA Director Adam Boehler. The families thanked President Trump and his administration for all they have done on the hostage crisis. From left, Ronen Neutra, Jonathan Dekel Chen, Adi Alexander, Orna Neutra, Yael Alexander, Adam Boehler and Ruby Chen (Ruby Chen)

""I expect the United States to exert strong pressure on the mediators,"" Neutra told Fox News Digital. ""We've heard that Washington has spoken directly with Hamas in Egypt, and we demand full implementation of the agreement — or serious consequences: halting humanitarian aid, and stopping the movement of goods and people through the Rafah crossing.

""Our expectation is for President Trump to ensure that the two American citizens still held by Hamas — our son Omer and Itay Chen — are brought home for burial,"" he continued. ""After two years of fighting for this, we deserve closure — and our son deserves proper burial in the land he loved and defended.""

TRUMP HAS FREED MORE THAN 70 US HOSTAGES IN LESS THAN A YEAR; BIDEN RELEASED AROUND 70 IN FOUR YEARS

Under the terms of the agreement, Hamas was obligated to return all 28 bodies alongside the 20 living captives freed on Monday. However, the terror group has so far delivered only seven bodies — four on Monday and three more on Tuesday night — in clear violation of the deal. 

""There is a diplomatic effort to make sure the agreement is fulfilled,"" said Ruby Chen, the father of Itay Chen, the other remaining American held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza.

""Hamas did not provide the majority of the hostages yesterday, and we — the families — are, of course, very disappointed,"" he continued. ""Especially as an American citizen, I'm disappointed that the United States was not able to bring my son back. We demand that the window of opportunity that exists today to release the remaining hostages not be lost.""

Ruby Chen's son, IDF Sgt. Itay Chen, was serving along the Gaza border when he was taken hostage by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7. (IDF)

""The U.S. and the mediators must put pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages,"" Chen added, ""and leverage the agreed-upon components — such as the release of Palestinian prisoners and the reopening of the Rafah crossing.""

The Israel Defense Forces announced on Wednesday that one of the four bodies Hamas returned to Israel late Tuesday did not belong to any of the identified hostages.

Trump delivered a sharp warning to Hamas on Tuesday, vowing that the U.S. would act if the terrorist group fails to lay down its arms.

""They said they were going to disarm, and if they don't, we will disarm them,"" Trump told reporters at the White House while meeting with Argentine President Javier Milei.

Professor Hagai Levine, head of the health team for the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, described the emotional toll on families still awaiting news.

""It has a tremendous psychological impact — families cannot move forward until there is certainty, a proper burial, and full confidence regarding the fate of their loved ones,"" Levine told Fox News Digital.

""That's why bringing back all hostages — living and deceased — is critical for families, and for the nation as a whole, to begin healing,"" he added.

Levine explained that the identification and verification process for deceased hostages is carried out at the National Institute of Forensic Medicine in Abu Kabir in Tel Aviv.

""I'm in close contact with the staff at the institute,"" he said. ""We have complete trust in them. They use advanced technology and multiple methods for identification — including individual markings, unique tattoos, fingerprints, DNA comparison with pre-acquired family samples, and full-body CT scans.""

He cautioned that the process could take time, citing previous cases such as that of Shiri Bibas, whose body Hamas initially substituted with that of a Gazan woman before eventually returning her actual remains.

""Receiving the news is also a critical and emotional moment,"" Levine continued. ""It can bring a measure of relief and closure, but it's also an extremely stressful time — and we're there to support the families. Those still waiting fear their loved ones will be forgotten. The mission isn't complete until everyone is brought back to Israel.""

Israel's Kan 11 reported on Tuesday, citing Qatari media, that Egyptian teams had begun assisting in efforts to locate the remains of deceased hostages in Gaza.

Meanwhile, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum sent a letter to U.S. Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff, expressing their gratitude.

""We are immensely grateful and overjoyed to see 20 of our loved ones back home, finally reuniting with the families who have fought tirelessly for their return for so long. However, what we feared is now happening before our eyes. Only four deceased hostages are coming home today,"" the letter said.

""We must ensure that all remaining hostages come home. We cannot rest, and we know you will not rest, until every last hostage is returned,"" it added.

Brent Sadler, a naval warfare and advanced technology expert at the Heritage Foundation, shared what Americans can expect in the Trump administration's war on the cartels.

As the U.S. unleashes a series of lethal strikes on cartel drug boats and President Donald Trump declared an ""armed conflict"" with the cartels, experts gave insight on what Americans can expect to see next in the ""quasi-war"" taking place at the country's doorstep.

On Tuesday, Trump announced the U.S. military had carried out another kinetic strike on a suspected drug vessel off the coast of Venezuela, killing six suspected smugglers. This is the fifth of such strikes on a drug boat in the last several weeks and, according to experts, one of the first important steps to decimating the cartels.

The strikes come after the White House sent Congress a memo on Sept. 30 informing them that the U.S. is now participating in a ""non-international armed conflict"" with drug smugglers. Currently, the U.S. has amassed an impressive collection of naval and air assets stationed around Venezuela, a country whose socialist dictator, Nicolás Maduro, the Trump administration has accused of being in league with cartels.

Experts say these strikes could mark the start of a broader military campaign targeting cartel logistics and command networks.

WAR ON CARTELS? WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT HAS AN IRON-CLAD CASE TO STRIKE NARCO-TERRORIST GROUPS

Speaking with Fox News Digital, Derek Maltz, former acting director of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), called the Trump administration's moves ""unprecedented action for an unprecedented threat.""

He explained that, unlike in previous administrations, the second Trump administration has enabled a ""whole of government"" approach to targeting the cartels by designating them as ""foreign terrorist organizations."" This designation empowers not just agencies like the DEA to take action against the cartels but also the Departments of War, State, Treasury, Justice and others.

""This is not the same old drug crisis we've been talking about for 50 years. This is something totally different. This is a poisoning crisis and our kids are dying,"" Maltz said, adding, ""The cartels are killing more Americans than any other terrorist organization in the history of this country.""

In response, Maltz said the president is ""building a powerful force of good, an army of good, to help defeat evil and to actually destroy these adversaries that are killing our citizens at record levels.""

Maltz said the first step was shutting down the border to stop the flow of fentanyl, meth, cocaine and other drugs, as well as criminal elements into the U.S. overland. This, Maltz explained, pushed the cartels to carry drugs via sea and air routes, which has prompted the Trump administration to crack down on those as well.

He said that next the U.S. will need to hit the cartels' command nodes, either working through international partners like Mexico and El Salvador or, like the drug boat strikes, directly through U.S. military assets.

""Based on everything I've heard, the Mexican government is hitting labs very hard, making more arrests than they had… so they're aggressively going after the cartels. They're removing these really bad guys into America for prosecution.""

Brent Sadler, a senior research fellow for naval warfare and advanced technology at the Heritage Foundation's Allison Center for National Security, described the conflict with cartels as a type of ""quasi-war"" in which the U.S. is fighting against not only non-state, paramilitary-style cartels but also indirectly against international enemies like Venezuela, Hezbollah and China that have been working with the cartels.

""The demonstration of willingness to go and kill these cartel members while they're moving their ships full of drugs sends a chilling effect through their support network,"" he explained. ""And when they start losing that ability to pay off their support network, the business model falls apart and they actually start fighting each other; they turn in on each other.""

Sadler said that while the U.S. forces currently appear to be concentrated around Venezuela in the Caribbean, he expects the focus will eventually shift to the cartels' drug routes in the Pacific as well as transatlantic routes to Africa and Europe.

""I would not be surprised if you start to see the military hammer of this or the balance of the military assets shift either to the Pacific. Or if they shift over more to the Central Atlantic to go after these other routes.""

He predicted that the sea strikes will continue and that if cartels start to shift to rely more on airplanes, Americans may start to see some of those being ""shot out of the sky"" in international airspace.

Eventually, he said the strikes will likely be dialed down along with the scale of U.S. naval vessels in the Caribbean. As this happens, he said, the U.S. will likely both leverage its international partners and enable them to interdict drug vessels as well as sustain U.S. special operations capabilities, helicopters and aircraft operating out of Puerto Rico and other bases nearby, to provide overwatch and the ability to intercept ships.

Both Sadler and Maltz emphasized the importance of hitting the cartels from every angle, using every available partner and government agency, even education.

""We have to teach. We have to do a lot more work on the demand side,"" said Maltz.

He predicted that, once confirmed, Sara Carter, Trump's pick for the head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, would ""initiate a lot of educational programs"" designed to educate on the dangers of the new drugs being pushed by cartels and other foreign adversaries.

""We can hit boats, and we can go after command and control. But if we don't teach our kids and our parents in this country about this devastating crisis with these very, very dangerous, lethal substances that we've never seen in this country in history, then they're going to continue to find ways to get this stuff in here,"" said Maltz.

Fox News' Madison Scarpino reports from Tennessee on the task force's progress and what residents are saying about the federal effort to reduce crime.

The Trump administration's deployment of federal law enforcement officers to one of Tennessee's bluest cities has been welcomed as a much-needed reprieve by local police struggling with increased staffing shortages and astronomical crime rates.

Last month, President Donald Trump signed a memorandum mobilizing federal law enforcement agents to Memphis in an effort to combat crime rates and restore safety to the community. The task force includes federal agencies such as the FBI, ATF and Homeland Security Investigations joining the Tennessee National Guard, and is modeled after the deployment of officers in Washington, D.C. 

""The city of Memphis, Tennessee, is suffering from tremendous levels of violent crime that have overwhelmed its local government's ability to respond effectively,"" the president wrote.

The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

The memorandum is supported by Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who maintains command of the Guard troops deployed to the city, and comes amid the FBI releasing new 2024 data revealing Memphis had the highest violent crime rate in the country. 

Trump pointed to data from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation that revealed Memphis saw an increase in violent crimes reported in 2024 – marking a startling shift from the national trend suggesting crime numbers are down throughout the country.

The city also saw about 1,250 violent crime incidents per 50,000 people last year, more than doubling Nashville's average and quadrupling the state average, according to WSMV. 

In 2025, Memphis has recorded 161 homicides, with Trump revealing the city's homicide rate is higher than Chicago, Detroit, Washington, D.C., and other high-crime cities throughout the country.

The administration also looked at data showing Memphis' murder rates are approximately four times higher than Mexico City and 27 times higher than Havana, suggesting the city is more dangerous than areas abroad with elevated crime rates.

However, the Memphis Police Department has disputed the narrative that the city is plagued by crime.

""Murder is at a six-year low, aggravated assault at a five-year low and sexual assault at a 20-year low,"" the MPD said in a press release. 

The MPD did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

While city data shows the murder rate is down 21% since 2024, the numbers appear to encompass statistics from each calendar year – with 2025's full breakdown hinging on the completion of the year. 

Scottie DeLashmit, president of the Tennessee State Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, insists the move protects officers throughout the city at a time when the local police department is dealing with staffing shortages and low morale due to what he believes is relaxed bail policies.

""Our president has decided that he's coming to Memphis to try to bring law and order to [the city],"" DeLashmit told Fox News Digital. ""This is what we're told, which I think is a great idea. However, if we don't get a better prosecutor in Memphis, all we're doing is putting extra officers in danger.""

""If we don't prosecute the criminals once they are arrested, we just say, ‘OK, here's a signature bond,' and you're out and gone. What good is that officer's duties? That criminal is back on the street before the officer gets through doing the paperwork."" 

The Trump administration also pointed to Shelby County's newly implemented bail policies in the presidential memorandum. 

""In 2022, Shelby County overhauled its bail system at the behest of its Soros-funded District Attorney, instituting secured cash bail ‘only as a last resort' and relying on a system that often results in no bail,"" the memo reads.  

The Shelby County District Attorney's Office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

DeLashmit also discussed the crisis surrounding officer staffing and the work environment for police, adding that the Shelby County District Attorney's policies surrounding releasing arrestees and the city's ""no-pursuit"" policy are ""pretty disheartening"" for those patrolling the streets. 

""In Memphis, people will run for this for any reason just because they know Memphis officers aren't going to chase them, because they have a no-pursuit policy,"" DeLashmit told Fox News Digital. ""Not that you should pursue simple traffic [violations]. But if you do a heinous crime, such as kidnapping, rape or robbery, you should be able to chase for that."" 

DeLashmit welcomes the Trump administration's pursuit of restoring safety in Memphis by deploying federal law enforcement officers, while highlighting the real-world obstacles local police are currently facing. 

""The officers are working a tremendous amount of overtime, which means they are tired [and] their skills are not going to be 100%,"" DeLashmit said, adding that the response time for backup officers is also lengthened and therefore ""not a safe environment"" for the city's citizens.

The first troops began arriving in Memphis on Sept. 29, and have since made hundreds of arrests and issued more than 2,800 traffic citations, federal officials told The Associated Press. 

As the city continues to collaborate with the Trump administration, DeLashmit hopes the move will not only bring more officers back to work, but will reinforce a sense of security throughout Memphis that he believes has long been lost. 

""When I was growing up, [Memphis] was a safer city,"" he said. ""It was polite. You could walk anywhere, and hopefully we'll get back to that. I know times have changed and I'm not naïve. I know it won't be the way it was 30 years ago, but maybe we can go back to where it's at least safe to walk down the street without fear of being shot.""

The two leaders clasped hands for about 26 seconds.

President Donald Trump alluded to feeble world leaders present at the global summit held on Monday in Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh on the future of the war-ravaged Gaza Strip with an indirect rebuke of their counter-productive role to bring closure to Israel's war against the Hamas terrorist movement. 

When asked about world leaders that he viewed as feeble in the meeting location in Egypt, Trump said ""I won't comment on that. But you know probably who they are... There were a couple in the room.""

While Western leaders and the United Nations secretary-general sought to share in the limelight of Trump's Middle East success that brought an end to the Hamas-Israel war, veteran Mideast observers note that Trump primarily expressed gratitude to Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, as well as to Qatar and Egypt, while omitting traditional Western allies.

NETANYAHU CALLS TRUMP ISRAEL'S 'GREATEST FRIEND' AS FINAL LIVING HOSTAGES RELEASED

On Sunday, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee issued a stinging rebuke to Britain's Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, who declared, ""We've played a key role behind the scenes in shaping this"" with respect to Trump's peace achievement. Huckabee fired back: ""I assure you she's delusional. She can thank @realDonaldTrump anytime just to set the record straight.""

France's President Emmanuel Macron has been criticized by Trump for his initiative to recognize a Palestinian state. Trump previously said about Macron's role in recognizing a Palestinian state: ""What he says doesn't matter.""

Observers also pointed to an awkward 26-second-long handshake at the summit between the two in Egypt on Tuesday.

Last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio lambasted Australia, Canada, Britain and France for recognizing a Palestinian state because it makes it ""harder"" to end the war. Rubio added the acceptance of a Palestinian state ""emboldens"" Hamas. Rubio said he conveyed the U.S. position to its Western allies.

Ret. British Col. Richard Kemp, who spent time in Gaza during the over-two-year war, wrote on X: ""Tonight Trump name-checked countries that played a significant role in peace agreement. UK not included. Nor was France, Canada or Australia, the ‘recognisers.""

Richard Goldberg, a senior advisor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and former National Security Council official, told Fox News Digital that, ""We know for a fact that Hamas would pull back over and over again whenever there was a prospect of a U.N. Security Council action to pressure Israel, when Britain or Canada would announce an arms embargo on Israel, when French President Emmanuel Macron would organize a push for Palestinian state recognition. 

""This is happening right now in spite of all them because of one man who said to their faces in front of the world, I don't give a damn what you say or do, I will help Israel open the gates of hell unless the hostages come home now.""

He added, ""It's also a lesson for what comes next: Trump holds the cards for success or failure in demilitarizing Gaza and deradicalizing the Palestinians. If Trump lets the Europeans or the U.N. run the show, his plan is doomed; if he keeps his sword of Damocles hanging over the process, he may yet succeed.""

Special envoy, Steve Witkoff, later thanked the U.K.'s national security advisor in a statement on X: ""I would like to acknowledge the vital role of the United Kingdom in assisting and coordinating efforts that have led us to this historic day in Israel. In particular, I want to recognize the incredible input and tireless efforts of National Security Advisor Jonathan Powell.""

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch warned, ""Israel is finally seeing the hostages come home, and perhaps the guns fall silent. But let the world remember: this could have ended long ago if many around the world — from U.N. officials to so-called human rights groups like Amnesty International — had not spent two years justifying Hamas instead of confronting it.""

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who also flew to Egypt for the signing, has faced intense criticism in the German media for allegedly seeking to bask in the victory of Trump's triumph after he imposed a weapons embargo on Israel's army. Israeli tanks are dependent on German technological parts and Merz prohibited deliveries. 

Writing on the website of the conservative news outlet NIUS, its editor-in-chief, Julian Reichelt, said Merz ""supplied Hamas with air support while simultaneously denying Israel the weapons it needed to fight Hamas. He withdrew support to the Jews but increased financial support for the proven Hamas front organization UNRWA, which was directly involved in the Oct. 7 attack."" The airpower reference was Merz's decision to send humanitarian aid to Gaza via airlift deliveries. Hamas has repeatedly stolen aid that was meant for the Palestinian population.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Hochul fires at Stefanik over New York Young Republicans' leaked texts","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/state/3850664/hochul-stefanik-new-york-young-republicans-leaked-texts/","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 00:30:23 GMT","

Young Republicans leaders across the nation have exchanged racist texts that have been leaked in a new report, landing the New York GOP in the crossfire.

The Telegram messages, first reported by Politico, highlighted messages written by Young Republicans in New York, Kansas, Arizona, and Vermont. Among the messages, people labeled black people monkeys and “the watermelon people” and also called for rape against their political opponents, among other examples.

The New York State Young Republicans group was the most vocal in the group chat. In one instance, one of the group's leaders said, “I love Hitler,” and mused about placing their enemies in gas chambers. Another leader in the New York GOP group wondered about the possibility of the chat getting leaked.

In the hours since the report was published, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) denounced the messages and Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) over her previous praise of the state's Young Republicans. Stefanik and other New York Republicans have condemned the messages.

When asked by a reporter whether the messages reflect “some bad apples,” Hochul excoriated Republicans and suggested they are condoning the behavior.

“Some bad apples? These are the future of the Republican Party,” the Democratic governor answered. “This is so vile it is hard to find the words to put into context that these are people who are part of a political party — one of two major parties — and they believe in gas chambers and rape and discrimination based on the color of people's skin. These are racist, sexist, disgusting remarks.”

Hochul then criticized Stefanik for labeling New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani a “jihadist” and “terrorist,” called on Republicans to do a “reexamination” of their rhetoric, and floated possible punishments for the Young Republican leaders who wrote the hateful messages.

“Kick them out of the party. Take away their official roles. Stop using them as campaign advisers,” she said. “There needs to be consequences. This bulls*** has to stop.”

Stefanik previously described the New York State Young Republicans as “the backbone of our party.” The congresswoman is also tied to the group through an award she was gifted in August.

“As the proud representative of NY's 21st District, and the House Republican Leadership Chair, I am honored to receive the distinguished designation of Congresswoman of the Year!” Stefanik said in a statement at the time. “I want to thank Bobby Walker, Peter Giunta, and all of the hardworking Young Republicans who are the backbone of our party, for all the work they do to ensure Republican victories up and down the ballot in New York.”

Bobby Walker and Peter Giunta were two of the leaders who exchanged some of the texts that are now under scrutiny.

Hochul's campaign called on Stefanik to return the award following the report.

“Elise Stefanik can't hide behind staff to denounce the antisemitic, racist, hateful individuals she endorsed, funded, and praised as the ‘backbone' of the Republican Party,” a spokesperson for Hochul's campaign said, per Politico. “These are her people who said ‘I love Hitler' and named her their congresswoman of the year — an award she still hasn't returned. Stefanik's silence tells New Yorkers where she stands and who she stands with.”

In response to her connections to the group, Stefanik's campaign committee noted she has never employed any member of the group chat.

Alex deGrasse, a senior adviser to Stefanik, told the Washington Examiner, “Kathy Hochul's endorsed candidate Zohran Mamdani is an Antisemite Defund the Police Communist who embraces and campaigns with terrorists who say 9/11 was justified, say Israel doesn't have the right to exist as a Jewish state, and say he will arrest Netanyahu. And Kathy Hochul not only supports him, she endorsed him.”

On the subject of the Young Republicans group chat, deGrasse continued, “Congresswoman Stefanik was absolutely appalled to learn about the alleged comments made by leaders of the New York State Young Republicans and other state YRs in a large national group chat. According to the description provided by Politico, the comments were heinous, antisemitic, racist and unacceptable. While none have ever been employed  by Congresswoman Stefanik, if the description by Politico is accurate, Congresswoman Stefanik calls for any NY Young Republicans responsible for these horrific comments in this chat to step down immediately. Unlike Kathy Hochul who bends the knee and refuses to condemn the vile antisemitism spewed by leading NY Democrat candidates like Mamdani every single day, Congresswoman Stefanik will call out vile hate and demand accountability.”

Stefanik hasn't yet entered next year's race for governor of New York, although she is expected to make an announcement after next month's elections. Until then, she is raising money for a possible gubernatorial bid. Meanwhile, Hochul is preparing to launch her reelection campaign.

Democrats are using a $20 billion lifeline to Argentina to claim Republicans care more about bailing out foreign governments than helping Americans at home.

The messaging, a riff on President Donald Trump's “America First” policy agenda, intensified ahead of a White House visit by Argentinian President Javier Milei on Tuesday, where Trump said the United States would “be there” for Argentina, so long as Milei succeeds in midterm elections set to take place later this month.

Democrats have variously framed the bailout as an affront to American farmers, as Argentina sells its soybean crops at “manipulative prices” to China, as well as average voters who fear rising healthcare costs.

The latter argument marks a new wrinkle in a shutdown fight with Republicans as Democrats demand an extension of premium Obamacare subsidies to reopen the government, which shuttered over the demands on Oct. 1.

“If this administration has $20 billion to spare for a MAGA-friendly foreign government, how can they say we don't have the money to lower healthcare costs?” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said on the Senate floor.

TRUMP MAKES ARGENTINE CURRENCY SWAP CONTINGENT ON MILEI WIN

The Democratic talking point, made in the halls of Congress and a Democratic National Committee press call on Tuesday, reflects an attempt to turn Trump's signature policy doctrine against him.

Trump has used the “America First” mantra to encapsulate his agenda, from a crackdown on illegal immigration to his demands that NATO contribute more to its own self-defense. But the financial assistance for Argentina, structured in the form of a currency swap, has torn at the president's MAGA support and frustrated business groups that noted Argentina, an agricultural rival, sold shipments of soybeans to China as talk of a bailout became public.

Trump defended the economic package at the White House on Tuesday, arguing that the U.S. benefits from the Milei government staying in power. He represents a libertarian break from the socialist policies of other regional governments and has forged a closer relationship with the White House.

“It's just helping a great philosophy take over a great country,” Trump told reporters. “We don't have to do it. It's not going to make a big difference for our country, but it will in terms of South America.”

Democrats nonetheless see the issue as a liability for Trump, whose strikes on Iran and loose commitment to Ukraine have also rankled supporters.

On Tuesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) attempted to pass a bill, the “No Argentina Bailout Act,” to keep the Treasury Department from performing the currency swap, before her attempt was blocked by Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC).

“It is shameful that President Trump is propping up a foreign government, while he shuts down our own,” Warren said in a floor speech.

The message represents the latest attempt to move Republicans off their shutdown position – a clean funding extension with no policy changes attached. The House passed a bill last month that would keep the government operating through Nov. 21, but it has failed in the Senate eight times as Democrats use the funding cliff as leverage.

TRUMP BLUNTS GOP'S SHUTDOWN LEVERAGE WITH WELFARE AND MILITARY CARVEOUTS

Beyond the shutdown, Democrats have been using Trump's foreign policy to weaken his standing ahead of the midterm elections next year. His tariffs, in particular, have been wrapped into a broader critique that Republicans will send prices higher for consumers.

Trump and congressional Republicans made the same case successfully in November, when Democrats were swept out of power in the face of decades-high inflation.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump turned his attention on Tuesday to criminal behavior in Boston after multiple deployments of National Guard troops to cities throughout the country to help reduce crime. 

Trump suggested he might order the removal of the 2026 World Cup games from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, home of the NFL's New England Patriots. 

In a Tuesday meeting with Argentine President Javier Milei at the White House, Trump cited “unsafe conditions” in Boston. He mentioned recent violent car meets in Boston earlier this month, one of which left a police department cruiser destroyed by fire. 

The car meetups have been deemed “staged attacks” and organized through social media and group messaging platforms, local prosecutors said. 

“These street takeovers are not spontaneous events but are preplanned and coordinated through social media platforms and group messaging applications,” said Lisa Deacutis, assistant district attorney at the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office. “Participants share meeting points, times, and driving routes in advance to allow large numbers to join intersections before police arrive.”

The president claimed that “they're taking over parts of Boston” before stating, “But we could get them back in about two seconds.”

Trump was also critical of Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, calling her “radical left” and saying he was not pleased with her response to the violence.

​​”I think she is hurting Boston,” Trump said. “The answer is yes. If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, let's move it to another location, if I thought Boston was going to cause safety conditions for the World Cup. I could say the same thing for the Olympics.”

Wu's office issued a statement in response to Trump's comments. It did not mention the president's remarks but emphasized its excitement about Boston holding the event.

“Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions,” the statement read.

A Florida judge ruled on Tuesday to temporarily block the transfer of land in downtown Miami to be used for President Donald Trump's future presidential library.

The decision stems from a lawsuit filed last week by a Miami historian and racial activist who took issue with the Miami Dade College Board of Trustees' Sept. 23 vote to hand over 2.63 acres of land worth more than $67 million to Florida. Marvin Dunn, the plaintiff, alleges the board didn't provide sufficient notice for its meeting on the land transfer, arguing that the lack of public notice is in violation of state law.

Judicial Circuit Judge Mavel Ruiz agreed with Dunn's claim, determined he is likely to win the case, and ruled that the public college can't cede the land in the meantime.

“The court does not believe that the notice was reasonable,” she said after a Tuesday court hearing, adding that the case is not “rooted in politics.”

Dunn's attorney argued the case was rather about the board's alleged noncompliance with Florida's Government in the Sunshine Act, which requires meetings and records to be open to the public to ensure transparency.

“The people have a right to know what they're going to decide to do when the transaction is so significant, so unusual, and deprives the students and the college of this land,” the plaintiff's lawyer said.

The college board issued a public notice before the Sept. 23 meeting, stating that the purpose was to “discuss potential real estate transactions.” However, the notice did not specify which property would be discussed or disclose the purpose of the transaction.

The meeting also wasn't livestreamed, unlike previous meetings this year.

One week after the board meeting, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) and his Cabinet voted to transfer the land to the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Foundation. DeSantis announced plans for Trump's presidential library on the same day as the board voted to give up the land to the state.

An attorney for the college maintained the Board of Trustees complied with state law and questioned Dunn's political motivations in filing the case, considering it is related to Trump.

TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY PLANS IN MIAMI HIT WITH LAWSUIT OVER TRANSPARENCY CONCERNS

Tuesday's preliminary injunction comes one day after Ruiz declined to immediately bar Miami Dade College from deeding the land. She was concerned that Dunn had not yet established the right to sue by demonstrating his citizenship in Florida. On Monday, Dunn's legal team said their client's paperwork had not been fully processed due to office closures on Columbus Day.

There is no set time frame for the presidential library's construction or opening, but a more concrete plan is expected to be finalized in the next four years. The National Archives and Records Administration will launch a website dedicated to the presidential library on Jan. 20, 2029, when Trump's second term will end.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) took aim at Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) on Tuesday for refusing to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva amid the prolonged government shutdown.

“Speaker Johnson is just a little creep, and he's acting like a creep when it comes to this,” Gallego said on MSNBC, adding that the Republican leader is constantly changing his reasoning for not swearing in the Democratic congresswoman-elect.

Johnson has attributed the delay to the shutdown, which prevents the House from participating in a full legislative session. The House is currently in recess while the Senate debates each party's short-term funding resolution.

The House speaker says it is typically customary to swear in members-elect when the full House is present for legislative business, although he did swear in two Florida Republicans during a brief pro forma session in April because their families were in town.

Gallego said Johnson is potentially motivated by the bipartisan discharge petition that would force a full vote on the release of the files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The petition needs at least 218 signatures before the matter can be taken to a vote.

Grijalva intends to sign the petition, which is one signature short of the threshold.

“He is doing this because he wants to cover up for the president and the pedophiles on Epstein's list,” Gallego said, “and the only way that he can do that is to make sure that Adelita Grijalva doesn't become the 218th person to sign this discharge petition. That's it. That's the only reason why.”

Earlier Tuesday, Gallego and Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) approached Johnson on Capitol Hill to discuss Grijalva's situation.

“You just keep coming up with excuses,” Gallego told Johnson while reporters recorded the encounter.

In response, the speaker said his decision not to swear in Grijalva had “nothing to do with Epstein,” and that the allegation was “totally absurd.” He also called the confrontation a “publicity stunt.”

Grijalva won the special election late last month to succeed her late father, Raul Grijalva. Arizona state officials certified her victory on Tuesday, and they threatened to pursue legal action against Johnson if he fails to swear in Adelita Grijalva or provide a “reasonable explanation” as to when the ceremony will occur.

“Ms. Grijalva was elected with nearly 70% of the vote, and unofficial results were provided to you by the Arizona Secretary of State,” Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes wrote in a letter. “Ms. Grijalva and the State expected that you would follow your usual practice and swear her into office at the earliest opportunity, just as you had done with five previous members elected in special elections.”

“You and your staff have provided ever-shifting, unsatisfactory, and sometimes absurd stories as to why Ms. Grijalva has not been sworn in,” she added. “Arizona's right to a full delegation, and the right of the residents of [Arizona's 7th congressional district] to representation from the person they recently voted for, are not up for debate and may not be delayed or used as leverage in negotiations about unrelated legislation.”

Other Democrats beyond those in Arizona are also calling on Johnson to act.

ARIZONA OFFICIALS THREATEN JOHNSON WITH LEGAL ACTION IF HE DOES NOT SWEAR IN GRIJALVA

“Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva should be sworn in now,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) previously told reporters. “It should have happened this week, should have happened last week. It needs to happen next week.”

Notably, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) took 25 days to swear in Rep. Julia Letlow (R-LA), who won a 2021 special election to replace her late husband. It's been 21 days since Adelita Grijalva won her special election.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Defending Trump's lawfare as just deserts misremembers what actually happened.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Sign up for Trump's Return, a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.

When Republicans find themselves unable to defend something Donald Trump has done, they tend to look for a way to turn the blame onto his opponents. So it is with the president's prosecutorial rampage against his enemies.

The anti-anti-Trump right has declared that, although a series of vindictive charges against the likes of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James may be regrettable, Democrats brought it on themselves.

“Two wrongs do not make a right, but Democrats did start this,” argued the conservative columnist and talk-radio host Erick Erickson. It “should be beyond dispute that the Biden-era lawfare campaign against Donald Trump was both a huge electoral failure and a disaster for American civics,” wrote the columnist Dan McLaughlin in the National Review. The Washington Post's now-right-of-center Opinion section similarly complained: “Many Democrats still cannot see how their legal aggression against Trump during his four years out of power set the stage for the dangerous revenge tour on which he is now embarked.”

Adam Serwer: Trump's politicized prosecutions may hit a roadblock

This attempt to rationalize Trump's push to lock up his enemies as payback suffers from two enormous flaws. The first involves the space-time continuum. Trump spent his first term desperately looking for ways to prosecute or otherwise harm his adversaries. He endlessly demanded that the Justice Department go after a long list of targets, including, among many others, every recent Democratic presidential nominee (John Kerry, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Joe Biden). His appointee at the IRS also subjected Comey himself, as well as Andrew McCabe, his successor at the FBI, to IRS audits.

Most of Trump's aspirations failed, but only because the Justice Department was run by officials who at least generally hewed to its norms of independence. Trump has since overcome this barrier.

The second problem with the karma theory is that it accepts at face value Trump's claim that he was a victim of lawfare. Trump was no victim of the legal system. If anything, he received preferential treatment.

Trump faced a wide array of legal travails during Biden's presidency. The case that Trump and his defenders usually fixate on is his conviction for campaign-finance violations stemming from the hush-money payment to the adult-film actor Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Many legal analysts argued that the case was legitimate but too marginal to merit prosecution. I agreed at the time that Trump's treatment in this case was harsher than what an average person might receive in similar circumstances. But the Manhattan case was not brought by “the Democrats,” or even an official appointed by the Biden administration. It was pursued by one elected local Democratic prosecutor, Alvin Bragg.

More important, in every other case where Trump faced prosecution, he benefited from notably lenient treatment by prosecutors, the courts, or both.

Trump faced two legal cases involving his attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election: a local case in Georgia and a federal case brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith. That Trump's effort to steal the election was unlawful was hardly a partisan view. When Senate Republicans voted not to convict Trump for it in his 2021 impeachment trial, then–Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested the matter should be left to the courts. If either party could be blamed for turning Trump's coup attempt into a legal concern rather than a political one, it was surely the Republicans.

Trump managed to skirt both raps, not because he did nothing wrong but because the courts allowed him to drag both cases out. The DOJ does not prosecute sitting presidents, so Trump's reelection ensured they were both dismissed.

Trump deployed this strategy to similarly wriggle out of a separate federal case involving his mishandling of classified documents. His violations could not have been clearer: He took a huge amount of classified material from the White House, stored it all in comically unsecured locations (such as a Mar-a-Lago bathroom), repeatedly lied to the government about it, and directed subordinates to lie on his behalf.

Quinta Jurecic: Trump's revenge tour

Yet a judge Trump had appointed while president simply dismissed the case on the first day of the Republican National Convention in 2024. The conservative Supreme Court, steered by three of Trump's own appointees, helped him further with an extraordinary party-line ruling granting presidents broad immunity from prosecution.

All of this makes it rather hard to argue that Trump was treated especially harshly by the legal system. A more parsimonious explanation for why Trump kept getting prosecuted, and why Republican presidents and candidates such as George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney never did, is that Trump has spent his entire career treating laws as unhelpful suggestions.

The evidence to support this is considerable, including his defiance of Justice Department orders to stop discriminating against Black tenants nearly five decades ago, his habitual refusal to pay his bills, and his penchant for grift. Before he was elected president the first time, Republicans regularly questioned his mob ties and called him a con artist.

If you were to have told party elites 10 years ago that Trump would go on to lose his first reelection bid, try to stay in office anyway, and then face a series of legal prosecutions, they would have likely figured Trump had been playing fast and loose with the law once again. They would have been right.

A picture book is a deceptively complex object: Ideally, it should be mind-expanding, psychologically astute, vividly illustrated, and—the most elusive criterion—fun. It must entertain the child without boring the grown-up to tears. And it should teach children to match sounds to meaning, pictures to objects, cause to effect, without feeling like homework. Finding picture books is easy; the market is glutted with them. The hard part is picking out just the right ones. What follows is an effort to bring clarity to the earliest years of literacy, and to help foster a child's lifelong relationship with books. We hope this selection will assist harried caregivers in sorting the wheat from the chaff, while also giving these formative works the respect and scrutiny they deserve.

Because children's books vary so much according to age, we decided to limit our scope to titles that lead up to the transition from listening to an adult's narration to reading independently: illustrated stories without long chapters, meant to be shared. We then asked authors, librarians, and other experts for suggestions and debated works among ourselves, stress-testing both classics and newer books to come up with our final list—of titles you know and those you should.

Over the course of our project, some trends emerged: 1955—peak Baby Boom—was an auspicious year for the genre (when Eloise, Miffy, and the crayon-wielding Harold were created). The 1960s and '70s brought bold colors and loopier styles to the fore. The 21st century delivered a wider array of stories—migrant journeys, portraits of grief, African and East Asian folktales. No single trait unifies the works below, but each represents a feat of artistry, voice, or complexity that we found exceptional. They are the kinds of books that will be cherished well into the future, worn from use and perhaps replaced more than once. Because of this, they felt essential.

Roofman stays grounded by highlighting life's mundane thrills.

Delinquent protagonists in true-crime stories tend to have a memorable MO: Young lovebirds might find the thrill of theft romantic, while a teenager might relish roping her friends into targeting their favorite celebrities' homes. But Jeffrey Manchester, the robber known as “Roofman,” made headlines for being unusually polite when he executed his misdeeds. After he surprised McDonald's employees by dropping in through the roof—hence his nickname—and holding them at gunpoint, he gently reminded one of them to breathe while they collected cash. Before he locked them in the walk-in refrigerator, he made sure that they had coats to wear so they'd be comfortable in the cold.

Roofman, a movie dramatizing Manchester's life, is similarly eager to please. Starring Channing Tatum as the titular crook, the film transforms the absurd tale of a criminal on the run into an intimate character study. It begins in 2004, with Jeffrey landing in prison—only to escape shortly afterward and find shelter inside a Toys “R” Us. The ensuing series of events incorporate elements of romance and melodrama with farce and action. Anxious to reunite with his estranged family, he ventures outdoors under a false identity; he ends up falling in love with a single mom, Leigh (played by Kirsten Dunst), who works at the store Jeffrey has turned into his hideout. Roofman deftly blends genres to create a low-key crowd-pleaser—one that avoids merely reveling in what made Manchester notorious in the first place.

Movies based on the lives of real people can easily turn into hagiographies, hyperbolizing their circumstances or papering over their scandals. Even an uplifting sports drama such as Rudy or a period piece such as Argo exaggerates scenes for added tension, treating its heroes like unassailable underdogs. But the writer-director Derek Cianfrance, who's best known for making Blue Valentine and other complex tragedies, doesn't excuse Jeffrey for his lawlessness. Cianfrance depicts the character evenly, as someone who can be as clever as he is careless. Jeffrey is resourceful enough to build a security system for his refuge by stringing up baby monitors throughout the store—but he also eats so much candy that he gives himself a toothache. The opportunities for big set pieces are similarly subdued. The closest thing to a car chase comes when Jeffrey drives a used sedan he purchased for Leigh's elder daughter, pushing it beyond the speed limit to impress her. Tatum, too, infuses Jeffrey with a disarming naivete that makes him compelling to watch.

Read: The 14 movies to watch out for this fall

The actor is especially charming in his scenes with Dunst; the two share a down-to-earth chemistry as a pair of single parents who are surprised to find themselves in a budding romance in their 40s. Their relationship fuels the plot, making Jeffrey delay his getaway and revealing what the story is actually about: the emotional toll of starting over. If Leigh likes his cover identity—he calls himself “John Zorn” and gives her an invented backstory—Jeffrey reasons that maybe he doesn't need to keep looking for a way back to his old life of heists. Would acceptance into a new family, even under false pretenses, be enough for him to abandon his past? Is quiet domesticity worth the risk?

Cianfrance uses these questions to explore the humor and suspense in mundanity—how everyday drama can become all-consuming. For Jeffrey, accessing the Toys “R” Us security cameras has become quotidian, but decorating Leigh's apartment for Christmas provides a genuine thrill. Cianfrance captures Jeffrey's misadventures inside the store as if his protagonist is trapped in a cage, underlining how tiny his fugitive life is compared with the immensity of his relationship with Leigh. Even Jeffrey's initial escape from prison is small in scale, his movements practiced, his expressions stoic. He seems much more engaged when he's studying the store employees on the baby monitors as if they're the cast of a reality show. These moments help the film feel lived-in, its sentimentality earned rather than maudlin.

Roofman isn't entirely devoid of more conventional big-screen beats. Tatum mines plenty of laughter from the sillier parts of Jeffrey's story—he almost gets caught while naked one night—and a third-act heist leads to an explosion. But what's most pleasing to watch is Jeffrey's search for companionship: The real Jeffrey Manchester will perhaps always be remembered for his odd behavior as a burglar, but Roofman is more interested in why he couldn't resist connecting with a stranger. In the film, he had the money and the means to flee much earlier. Yet, as Jeffrey puts it in an early scene while attempting to fill a sorry-looking kiddie pool for his daughter's birthday, “it's the trying that counts.”

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement is papering social media with recruitment ads, flooding them onto local news stations in so-called sanctuary cities, talking up signing bonuses (up to $50,000 paid out over three years) and student debt repayment programs (up to $60,000). They want people to know they're looking for new faces.

ICE is not the only controversial agency that needs to recruit. The police need to recruit, corrections officers need to recruit, the military needs to recruit. But right now, ICE might be the most politically charged and disliked of all of them. And the story ICE is telling in those ads is markedly different from the story you see in contemporary military recruitment.

Military recruiting ads tend to sell you a character arc: You have unused potential, and the military will bring it out of you and transform you into a hero. You're joining the military for America, yes, but you're also joining for yourself, in a sort of intensified version of the American dream. America is a country where people have the freedom to be great, and the military will give you the tools and the discipline to truly make your greatness happen. That's why the famous army slogan is “Be all you can be.”

ICE ads are doing something different. Here's the story ICE is telling about America and itself as it tries to sell itself to the more than 10,000 new recruits it plans on bringing on before the end of the year.

Most of ICE's recruitment ads look as though someone typed “WWII aesthetic retro” into an AI image generator. They feature that ruddy '40s wartime color palette, cartoonish square-jawed men and sharp-eyebrowed women, stern Uncle Sam.

The vintage look helps these ads cultivate the nostalgic vibe they frequently turn to, alongside frequent calls to “recapture the America your forefathers created.” Sometimes, however, the implication is not just that America was great at some point in the hazy past, but that it was greatest specifically during your childhood, when your life was uncomplicated and your mother cooked your breakfast.

In one ad, ICE calls for viewers to “recapture our national identity” over a still image of a 1992 Apache helicopter flyover of a NASCAR race, a callback to the millennial childhood of the 30-somethings they're looking to recruit. Here, our “national identity” becomes not just loud machines going boom, but specifically the experience of being a '90s kid. If you join ICE, the implication goes, it will restore the purity of your childhood innocence to you.

Why has America lost its way since your childhood? And what is your role?

In the story ICE tells, you join up to be a hero, but, unlike with the military, you're not going through any kind of hero's journey. You already have the stuff. (Maybe that's why you don't get that much training?) The real story here is all about how America has changed — it's being invaded, and you, the hero, must protect her. That's why ICE's recruiting slogan is “Defend the homeland.”

“Which way, American man?” asks one caption, in what appears to be a reference to a meme, which is itself inspired by the infamous white nationalist text Which Way Western Man? While the meme is more recent, the book, which dates from 1978, claims there is a Jewish plot against Christians and argues that Adolf Hitler was right. The accompanying illustration on the ICE ad shows Uncle Sam, disheveled, staring at a series of signposts pointing toward “homeland,” “law & order,” versus “invasion,” and, most ominously, “cultural decline.”

“Cultural decline” makes it clear that ICE is not shy about telling its viewers exactly who those invaders are. It's one of those far-right buzzwords that means, more or less, that immigrants entering America with their own cultures are diluting American culture and making it less vital. The Western culture of classical Greece and Renaissance Europe, the argument goes, is one of humanity's greatest achievements, and allowing other cultures to amalgamate within it makes it weaken and decay. (Multiple cultures mixing together actually tends to lead to new artistic innovations and a more vital and interesting culture.)

For that reason, these ads are riddled with neoclassical imagery: America pictured as an Athena-like goddess, draped in Grecian robes and vowing to fight “for humanity and civilization.” Civilization here is specifically Western and specifically Christian. “Protect our sacred land,” says one ad over a bucolic image of a New England church steeple.

In one recruitment video, Micah Bock, a deputy assistant secretary at the US Department of Homeland Security, says: “We know what it means to be an American. Everyone knows what an American is.” He goes on to say that once the viewer joins ICE, “You'll block communists, terrorists, and globalists who dilute our culture and import their failed ideologies.”

“Keep criminal illegal aliens out,” says one recruitment ad over a photograph of shifty-looking brown men, one of whom is wearing a turban. “Want to help keep ‘Jihad' out of America?” asks an X post. Another post makes it clear that Latinos are an issue, too: “The American people gave us a mandate to rid our country of foreign invaders,” it says, over a photo of a joyous car full of Latino people waving flags for various Latin American countries.

ICE ads depict the agency as the home of uber-masculine, uber-competent men, for whom women are damsels to be protected and prizes to be won.

One ad pictures an ICE agent as a buff shirtless white man, grinning as he denies “communists, terrorists, and globalists” the chance to enter America. America itself is frequently embodied as a helpless woman who must be protected. Another ad shows officers in full gear surrounding a pretty girl who gazes up at them worshipfully. Finally, one ad just focuses on a big car. What could be manlier?

Perhaps ICE thinks it should be the home of all those strapping, big-car-buying Christian white men. Perhaps that's the kind of person the agency is trying to attract. Regardless, what data we have doesn't quite match up with the marketing angle.

ICE rarely releases internal demographics. However, as of 2017, roughly 20 percent of its agents were Hispanic or Latino. In 2018, women made up 45 percent of ICE's workforce. Meanwhile, with a base salary of $50,000 on the low end, it's unlikely that new recruits can afford one of those big $40,000 cars.

Trump's DHS communications office has always had a trollish, sadistic streak to its messaging. It saves its most appalling imagery for the posts it directs at migrants, warning them against entering the country, but a strong undercurrent to its ICE recruitment ads suggests that one of the perks of the job is getting to be violent and to humiliate the people you don't like.

Notably, that includes not just brown people but also liberal protesters, those uppity elitists who deserve to get taken down a peg or two. One X thread has the URL “join.ice.gov” printed over a series of photos of handcuffed activists with the caption “FAFO,” or “fuck around, find out.”

Another post, captioned, “We're having an All Night Revival,” shows a video montage of masked ICE officers locked in what looks like street combat with faceless figures, only to emerge victorious through the smoke of flash bombs, escorting handcuffed brown people into their vans. Some of them are shirtless, like the men Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had posing behind her at CECOT. Meanwhile, the ICE agents themselves are tricked out in combat gear that covers their faces. They are rendered more than human, larger-than-life action heroes.

Everyone's lost their identity here. There's nothing on the scale of the individual, only the clash of good vs. evil.

There's a remarkable defensiveness to the ICE ads, a kind of preemptory don't take it so seriously, it's just a joke. How else are you supposed to take a post, after all, that's just a picture of the Statue of Liberty with flashing red laser eyes?

The “if you get offended you fell for it” posture is one that the alt-right perfected in the years leading up to the first Trump administration, when they used ironic racism as a cover to inject neo-Nazi ideology into more mainstream corners of the internet. “The amount of humor and vulgarity confuses people,” admitted one prominent neo-Nazi. Still, he protested, “The true nature of the movement…is serious and idealistic” — the ideals in question being neo-Nazi ideals.

As the former alt-right crew infiltrates the federal government during the second Trump administration and loses the “alt” label, mainstream Republicans have begun to integrate their trolling 8chan-adjacent meme language into the right's standard aesthetic — namely, a Norman Rockwell image of classic Americana; American flags waving over a big blonde family eating an apple pie together, while an eagle flies in the distance. This imagery, always on the edge of self-parody, by now carries more than a whiff of insincere piety. It is the imagery of Ronald Reagan, of George W. Bush, of recessions and endless wars, that nevertheless still seems to promise something. It's an ambivalent aesthetic, which is why it melds so well with that giggling alt-right nihilism.

Combined, the two old aesthetics form a new one in which everything is plausibly a distasteful joke, and so at the same time, everything is serious. When they promise mass deportations: Why are you shocked? You didn't really take that literally, did you? When they perform mass deportations: Why are you shocked? Don't you remember they told you they would do it?

Enforcing the border doesn't require nullifying the Constitution.

When liberals denounce Donald Trump's authoritarianism, they often cast his immigration agenda as a case in point.

Back in June, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee decried the president's “mass deportation operations” as the “stepping stone” to his “radical attempts to seize absolute power.” In the same statement, they condemned the administration's deportation of noncriminal immigrants “as cruel,” lamenting the harms that it imposed on “law-abiding families.”

Personally, I agree with both of these indictments of Trump's policy. But it's important for Americans to understand that they can accept the first one, even if they reject the second: In other words, you don't need to share liberals' moral objections to large-scale deportation in order to accept that Trump's handling of that task is intolerably authoritarian.

For many liberals, the most morally horrifying aspect of Trump's immigration agenda is its consequences for undocumented people and their loved ones. Armed agents forcing children from their homes, breaking up families, and exiling hardworking people pursuing the American dream — all this seems needlessly cruel.

For precisely that reason, it strikes many progressives as evocative of fascism: The government appears to be tormenting a vulnerable minority population for the sake of tormenting a vulnerable minority population. Thus, from the left's vantage point, the humanitarian critique of deporting non-criminal immigrants — and the anti-authoritarian critique of Trump's approach to deporting them — can look like one and the same.

But not all Americans share these intuitions. A significant segment of voters (in some — though not all — polls, a majority) favor large-scale internal immigration enforcement. To them, liberals may sound as though we are equating “authoritarianism” with “the implementation of policies that I don't like.”

Indeed, some voters may feel that large-scale deportation efforts are the opposite of undemocratic. After all, immigration laws are the byproducts of democratic governance: Our elected representatives chose to put certain restrictions on migration. When people violate those laws, they undermine the electorate's sovereignty over an issue of public concern. From this viewpoint, deporting law-abiding immigrants may generate sad stories and ugly scenes. Yet if America were to adopt the rule, “if you make it past the border, you can stay forever, so long as you don't commit any crimes,” it would only encourage further subversion of its laws.

I think this line of thought puts too little weight on the welfare of the undocumented, the economic benefits of immigration, and America's capacity to deter unlawful inflows through border enforcement. But voters should know that they don't need to agree with liberals about all that in order to reject Trump's immigration policies.

The case for deeming those policies authoritarian does not hinge on the righteousness of cosmopolitan moral assumptions or economic theories. Rather, that case rests on the myriad ways that Trump's immigration agenda is egregiously undermining Americans' civil liberties and democratic freedoms.

Below, I will detail five reasons why even conservative voters should consider Trump's handling of immigration anti-democratic.

Even those who favor strict immigration enforcement should support immigrants' due process rights. After all, it is due process that prevents the government from deporting lawful US residents (either by mistake or design).

Yet Trump has explicitly called for ending due process in immigration cases and taken various actions consistent with that authoritarian ambition.

During his first term, he declared that the government should be able to deport undocumented immigrants “with no judges or court cases.” Since taking office a second time, the president has sought to curtail legal protections for those accused of being in the country illegally.

First, the Trump administration has expanded the use of “expedited removal” — a process that allows immigration authorities to deport the undocumented rapidly, without a full hearing. Historically, this process was used in a narrow set of circumstances: when an immigrant is intercepted near the US border without a valid visa, credible asylum claim, or proof that they have been in the US for longer than two weeks.

The idea here was that migrants who have just crossed the border do not possess the same legal protections as longtime residents. In some sense, they are still seeking admission into the country, rather than permission to remain in it. Therefore, Congress and the judiciary concluded that the government could deny such migrants a full court hearing, in the interests of administrative efficiency, particularly when border agents were overwhelmed by large inflows of asylum seekers.

But Trump has sought to authorize expedited removal throughout the United States. Under his guidance, the Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule that would empower Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to summarily deport any suspected immigrants who can't immediately prove that they've been in America for two years.

The risks of this policy to lawful US residents aren't merely theoretical. Even in the absence of such broad authorities, ICE and Customs and Border Protection have wrongfully detained or deported legal residents, including American citizens. According to a 2020 Government Accountability Office report, between 2015 and 2020, ICE arrested 674 potential US citizens, detained 121, and removed 70.

Courts have intervened to block Trump's expanded use of expedited removal, but the administration is appealing those rulings.

Meanwhile, Trump has sought to corrupt the independence of the immigration court system. Since taking office in January, 139 immigration judges have been fired, nudged from the bench with an early retirement offer, or involuntarily transferred. The purge is seemingly aimed at replacing neutral arbiters of immigration law with rubber stamps for Trump's enforcement agencies.

Finally, and most appallingly, the president has infamously deported longtime US residents — who'd been convicted of no crime — to a notorious prison in El Salvador, where inmates are reportedly subject to torture and indefinite detention. In the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the administration deported a resident unlawfully, and then claimed that it was powerless to reverse its mistake, since Garcia was now in the custody of a foreign power. The judiciary eventually forced the administration to return Garcia to the US. But his case illustrates the extremity of Trump's contempt for due process.

The president has also deployed federal troops to oversee immigration enforcement operations, in defiance of local political authorities.

This is a severe breach of liberal democratic norms. Immigration enforcement is a civil authority. And in the United States, responsibility for upholding civil laws is supposed to lie with civilian officials — not the military — except under the most extraordinary circumstances. This division of powers is codified in the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the use of armed forces for domestic policing absent explicit congressional authorization.

The administration has flouted this convention by invoking an obscure 1903 law, which authorizes the president to call up the National Guard if there is a “rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States” or if “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

Yet Trump has effectively defined such a rebellion as any public protest — even nonviolent ones — against immigration enforcement. In a June memorandum, Trump authorized the Guard's deployment to any “locations where protests against” ICE functions “are occurring or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments and planned operations.” In other words, the president asserted the authority to send the military anywhere in the US where a protest against his immigration policy is happening — or where his administration thinks a protest against its policy could happen.

The danger that this poses to democracy is straightforward. Unlike civilian police forces, the armed services operate at the president's command. If his use of the military for civilian functions isn't tightly constrained, there is a risk that he could exploit his martial authorities to insulate his regime from democratic control. Today, Trump is asserting the right to deploy troops to Democratic cities, to preempt protests he does not like. Tomorrow, he could do the same to obstruct the election of politicians he opposes.

Of course, that catastrophic outcome is far from guaranteed. But it is important to maintain institutional obstacles to it. Instead, Trump's immigration agenda is eroding them.

The president sees immigration policy as a tool for punishing speech he does not like.

This is not conjecture but a description of the administration's official policy.

Earlier this year, Trump declared, “To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,” further promising to “cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.”

This stance would be illiberal, even if the president were referring exclusively to genuine supporters of Hamas; the government should not revoke legal status from people on the basis of speech, no matter how reprehensible.

In reality, though, the administration's complaint was with any immigrant who advocated for a staunchly pro-Palestinian point of view.

In March 2024, Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish national residing in the US on a student visa, co-authored an op-ed in her university's newspaper, calling on it to divest from Israel and acknowledge the “Palestinian genocide.” This speech act put Öztürk on the radar of pro-Israel activists.

Upon taking office, Secretary of State Marco Rubio revoked Öztürk's visa. Six masked, plainclothes DHS agents proceeded to abduct her off the streets of Somerville, Massachusetts, and send her to an ICE processing facility in southern Louisiana.

The ostensible rationale for this was that Öztürk had engaged in pro-Hamas activities. But internal State Department documents, obtained by the Washington Post, revealed that the government possessed no evidence that Öztürk had ever publicly advocated for Hamas or participated in antisemitic activities.

The administration has similarly sought to revoke legal status from two lawful permanent residents — Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi — who participated in pro-Palestinian activism at Columbia University.

Federal courts have disputed the legality of all these actions, although Khalil presently faces a deportation order.

A core democratic freedom is protection from abuse by armed agents of the state. The Trump administration has undermined such liberty by insulating DHS officers from legal accountability.

It has done this through both formal and tacit means. On the first front, it has essentially shuttered the DHS's internal watchdog offices — the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman — which sought to protect detainees against abuse and unfair treatment. The latter office investigated more than 11,000 complaints in 2023.

Meanwhile, the administration has condoned the decision of many ICE agents to operate in masks and plainclothes. This policy enables abuse by making it harder for the mistreated to identify abusive officers and thus hold them to account.

The threat of ICE agents acting abusively is not hypothetical. Recently, an officer was caught on video shoving a woman to the ground inside a New York City courthouse. Initially, he was relieved of his duties pending an investigation. Then, just days later, he was reportedly reinstated after facing no discernible punishment.

Critically, all this is consistent with the president's own stated beliefs about how law enforcement officers should be allowed to operate. Speaking of his federal takeover of the DC police in August, Trump touted that, on his watch, cops would be “allowed to do whatever the hell they want.” He has also specifically said that when protesters throw rocks at ICE vehicles, the officers become entitled to “arrest these SLIMEBALLS” using “whatever means is necessary to do so.”

To this point, I've been outlining reasons why one should consider Trump's immigration policies anti-democratic, even if one regards mass deportation as legitimate.

But it's also true that any attempt to deport millions of noncriminal, undocumented immigrants is bound to impose costs on Americans' civil liberties.

The case for concentrating immigration enforcement on lawbreakers is not just humanitarian. Undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes are already known to the government and typically in its custody. As a result, DHS can remove them from the country without conducting sweeps that ensnare legal US residents.

Yet the Trump administration is committed to deporting as many of America's 14 million undocumented immigrants as they possibly can. And that has led them to embrace tactics like going door to door in a Chicago apartment building, demanding families prove their legal status in the middle of the night; storming car washes and throwing senior citizens to the ground; and fining legal immigrants for not carrying proof of their status on their person at all times.

To refrain from these tactics, and set narrower enforcement priorities, is not to nullify America's immigration statutes. The rule of law has never depended on perfect enforcement. Most crimes committed in the United States go unpunished, including nearly half of murders. We should obviously try to change that. But the only way to push the rate of unpunished criminality to anywhere near 0 percent would be to embrace gross violations of civil liberties: The government would need to surveil more or less all citizens more or less all of the time.

Most Americans would regard such enforcement as authoritarian. And so we instead accept that the police will prioritize the prevention and punishment of certain crimes, while acquiescing to a great deal of uncensured lawbreaking. Immigration enforcement entails similar trade-offs.

That doesn't mean that any enforcement regime broader than Joe Biden's is fascism. But I would encourage those unmoved by humanitarian objections to mass deportation to consider the inherent, civil libertarian costs of such a policy.

In any event, reasonable people can disagree about exactly how the government should balance the objectives of enforcing borders and honoring civil liberties. What should be beyond dispute, however, is that eroding Americans' most basic constitutional rights is never legitimate. And Trump's immigration agenda does precisely that.

Why A House of Dynamite is so damn scary.

There's no shortage of things that could end the world. But between climate change, risks from AI, and biological threats like pandemics, we seem to be forgetting about one human-made existential risk that has been with us for 80 years: the ever-present possibility of nuclear warfare.

But nuclear war hasn't forgotten about us.

“Because of extraordinary luck over 80 years, despite many close calls and near-misses, there hasn't been a detonation of nuclear weapons,” Elise Rowan, the deputy vice president of communications at the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), told me over email. “Every concern that is top of mind for Americans right now…could be eclipsed by a snap decision under pressure or even an accident.”

Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

That makes the new film A House of Dynamite the perfect movie for the moment.

Directed by Kathryn Bigelow for Netflix — out in select theaters now, and streaming on the service beginning October 24 — the film is divided into three acts that follow government workers, military officials, and finally the president himself (played by Idris Elba) in the roughly 18 minutes that pass between the detection of a nuclear missile launch over the Pacific and its arrival in Chicago.

The day starts like any other. Coworkers flirt and bicker. They make small talk about sports, kids, and snacking habits. A senior officer (Rebecca Ferguson) in the White House Situation Room, which provides 24/7 intelligence updates and decision support to US national security officials, chides a colleague for waiting until that night to propose marriage to his longtime girlfriend. Everything is normal until it isn't.

Even then, it takes minutes for the tension to mount, for the unthinkable to become thinkable. Soldiers in a remote Alaska base initially think it's a North Korean missile test that will land harmlessly in the Pacific.

After all, a real nuclear attack would probably involve hundreds of missiles, including decoys. That's how the Soviet air force officer Stanislov Petrov realized that the five American nuclear missiles heading toward the Soviet Union in 1983 were actually a false alarm caused by malfunctioning early-warning satellites. Petrov's good judgment — he decided not to report the finding up the military chain, which would have led to retaliation per Soviet doctrine — is how we avoided all-out nuclear war by way of Soviet retaliation.

Someone in the film naturally mentions the Petrov case. The US launches its anti-missile defense system from that base in Alaska. It's like hitting a bullet with a bullet, one character explains. “This is going to be the second-most exciting thing that happens today,” the senior officer in the Situation Room reassures the colleague planning to propose to his girlfriend.

But the interceptor fails to destroy the missile, which remains inbound for Chicago and its metro population of 10 million people. It's only after the fact that top officials learn that the defense systems charged with keeping the homeland safe from just such a strike have just a 61 percent chance of success. In real life, it's around a 55 percent success rate — and that's under controlled conditions.

“So it's a fucking coin toss?” the defense secretary (Jared Harris) exclaims. “That's what $50 billion buys us?”

That's plan A. And when it fails, there's no plan B.

What this shows, Rowan told me, is that the nuclear defense system “demands perfection from people and machines 100 percent of the time. And that's just not realistic.”

(Disclosure: I worked at NTI for two years on the Global Biological Policy and Programs team. I learned a lot about nuclear risks through osmosis, but my focus was on pandemic prevention, bioweapons deterrence, and biotechnology governance. I did not work on “nuclear pandemics,” as my uncle once asked me.)

Back to the movie. With the minutes ticking down, the military chief of the US Strategic Command advocates for a preemptive counterstrike, even though the US doesn't know who fired the missile or why, and even though doing so would mean the 10 million Americans who will die in the Chicago strike will only be the first to perish.

But it almost certainly wouldn't end there. Further retaliations could lead to the death of billions, perhaps spark nuclear winter, and potentially spell humanity's end.

What comes across in A House of Dynamite is that no one, in this most important moment in history, seems to be in control.

While it's impossible not to watch the film without nauseously picturing Donald Trump, who has the sole power to order a nuclear attack as the president, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in charge, it may not make a difference.

The experts, the president, the “other side” as far as we can tell from a brief conversation with the Russian foreign minister — everyone seems basically at a loss. It's not a matter of skill or nerve; nearly everyone does their job as best they can.

In the end, we never even learn who fired the missile. North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran are floated as possibilities. The movie doesn't tell us if the launch was a purposeful attack or an accident, an isolated incident or part of a coordinated campaign. I don't see my childhood home in the Chicago suburbs get vaporized. It's even possible that the missile doesn't detonate at all — that can happen. But even if it doesn't destroy the Chicagoland area, causing millions of deaths, the US might still respond preemptively, leading to an all-out nuclear war all the same.

The ambiguity, while narratively frustrating, is the point. It's not possible for us to know all of this in just the 18 minutes the intercontinental ballistic missile allows, just as it's not possible for the president to make a meaningfully informed decision on how to respond in that time. When presented with a menu of escalating retaliation options — “rare, medium, and well-done,” someone quips darkly — the president says he's ready to give the order. We don't see the results.

The film highlights how our approach to nuclear risks has changed since the Cold War. Things were simpler in those “us versus them” Cold War days, if not any less dangerous. But the world has since gotten multipolar. There are (at least) nine nuclear powers to keep track of, and emerging technologies like AI enhance the risks.

“I hope this film gets a new generation interested and engaged in nuclear issues,” Heather Williams, the director of the Project on Nuclear Issues at the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), told me by email. “There are still thousands of nuclear weapons in the world and some countries are still engaging in nuclear saber-rattling — the threat hasn't gone away.”

It's not all doom and gloom, though: In 1986, there were 70,000 nuclear weapons. There are 12,000 today — an 80 percent reduction of the world's total nukes. But for the first time in 40 years, that number is expected to increase. More countries want to add nukes to their arsenals, and the last verifiable limits on nuclear weapons in Russia and the US are going to expire in February.

So things are heading in the wrong direction. “We need the same level of public outcry that led to reductions and [nuclear weapon] verification measures that have made the world safer,” Rowan said. “People have power on this issue — they just have to reclaim it.”

The argument for having nukes is that they may deter conventional warfare as devastating as World War II. But you can't have deterrence in a world wiped out by nuclear apocalypse.

Based in San Salvador, Valeria Zavaleta is a digital artist who brings imaginary worlds to life. She uses a combination of 3D design, animation, and artificial intelligence to build digital experiences, and in doing so, she is opening doors for other young Salvadorans to follow in her footsteps.

Many young people in El Salvador face challenges to access work. According to the International Labour Organization, over 23% of young people in El Salvador are currently not in education, employment, or training. Digital skills and access to technology has also held young people back.

But that is changing, thanks to growing access to technology, connectivity and new opportunities.

Through initiatives like the Ilamatepec Project, the European Union is partnering with local organizations to invest in digital inclusion, education, and youth job creation across El Salvador. The project is part of the European Union's broader Global Gateway strategy, which aims to build strong, win-win partnerships with countries around the world. In El Salvador, that means helping young people with the skills and mentorship needed to compete in a global digital economy.

For Valeria, these efforts helped unlock new opportunities to share her work internationally and mentor the next generation of artists in her community. She's part of a growing movement of young Salvadorans who are transforming their futures through technology and art. With the European Union's support, that movement is gaining momentum.

Kim Dhatt, a 34-year-old recruitment specialist, was in a relationship with her ex-partner for four years. When they first got together, he earned slightly more than she did, and the difference didn't bother either of them. After a series of promotions over 18 months, her salary tripled — and then he couldn't deal, Dhatt says.

Her partner's self-worth was tied directly to his income, and it eroded as her salary grew, Dhatt tells me. He insisted on splitting costs 50-50, leaving her with a disposable income that she wanted to spend on nice things but felt like she couldn't. When she proposed booking a luxury vacation for the two of them, for example, he insisted they go on a cheaper trip and divide the cost. She felt like she was compromising. They argued often, and resentment curdled.

Dhatt's financial success soon exposed a tension that many couples face today: What happens when she earns more than him?

""I'd worked hard to achieve my income level, and I was not reaping the benefits of it,"" Dhatt says. ""When our relationship finally ended, he told me as he left that I have nothing to worry about because of my salary,"" she adds, which to her revealed how money was ""a bigger factor"" in their relationship than he'd previously admitted.

Divorce rates in heterosexual couples rise significantly when a woman is more professionally successful than the man, be that in terms of fame or, more commonly, money. Perhaps even more strikingly, studies also show that the marriages most likely to endure are those that most closely fit the traditional pattern of male breadwinner and female homemaker. A 2023 report from the Institute for Family Studies found that couples in which husbands earn more than their wives have the lowest chance of divorce, and that when a man earns upwards of $38,000-a-year more than his wife, the chances of divorce are lowest. The wider the traditional wage gap, it would seem, the stronger the marriage.

Despite recent leaps in progress toward gender equality both in the home and in the workplace, marital inequality might be the last vexing barrier to our ongoing quest for true gender parity.

No doubt one of today's highest profile wage-gap relationships with a female breadwinner is Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. The pop megastar's estimated net worth, about $1.6 billion, is about 30 times the NFL tight end's estimated $52 million.

When the pair announced their engagement in August, Lyz Lenz, a New York Times bestselling author of a memoir about her own divorce, cut through the internet's euphoria by offering some sobering stats and reflections on her own experience.

""The image they are projecting to us is that a successful woman has found a supportive partner, one who eagerly fawns over her new album cover while interviewing her for his own podcast,"" she wrote on her Substack. ""This reality is far from reality for most American women.""

Lenz noted that women who succeed as Swift has ""are often punished for it"" and that she herself has been forced to pay the price of being professionally and economically ambitious. ""Every time I succeed, there's a downside. The hate mail gets worse. The man I am dating backs away. A tabloid publishes a scathing story about me,"" she writes. ""I'm so, so tired.""

The data corroborates the vibe. A 2013 University of Chicago study of 4,000 married couples in the US found that as soon as a woman out-earns her husband, both are 6% less likely to report a ""very happy"" marriage. They're also 8% more likely to report marital troubles and 6 percent more likely to discuss separating. A Swedish study from 2016 found that a married woman is twice as likely as a man to be divorced three years after being promoted to CEO. A similar pattern follows in the public sector: Women who are elected to positions like mayor or parliamentarian double the chances of their marriages falling apart.

There are darker findings too. A 2023 study from Australia, for example, found that women who earn more than their male partners are also significantly more likely to be physically and emotionally abused by that partner. ""When women's income exceeds that of their partners,"" the authors write, ""the violation of a gender norm creates a strong negative effect.""

Scant research is available on the correlation between divorce rates and income inequality in same-sex marriages, but one paper from 2014 found that in those couples bigger earnings gaps also translate to a higher likelihood of a break-up.

More than a dozen women I spoke to for this story told me that money significantly shaped their relationship or marriage. Many men told me the same. And of the women who earned more than their male spouses, the majority said that this had a detrimental impact on their relationship. Several said that it was ""the elephant in the room"" — something that complicated their relationship but that their male partners didn't want to talk about explicitly.

Sukhy Desangh, a 41-year old management consultant, tells me she was earning more than five times what her ex-fiancé earned. ""I realized I was just bank-rolling him,"" she says. He was humiliated by her being the primary earner in their household, she says. ""When we were out for dinner with friends and family, he would message me to say, 'Give me your credit card and I'll pay with it.'""

Several other women said that their partners felt ""emasculated"" by being out-earned. Two women who asked not to be named said that they felt like their ex-husbands became depressed as a result of not being the primary financial provider. The depression, the women said, turned to bitterness and anger, and ultimately led to the breakdown of the marriages.

""Money wasn't the only reason me and my ex broke up,"" says Ali, a 34-year old who works in financial services, ""but it was a topic of conversation and there were many times he said he wouldn't be able to be with someone long-term who earns more than him. And I was making significantly more than him.""

Why have marriages not caught up to the reality of the labor market? Women now hold more managerial positions than ever, and they bring home the bulk of household income in more families than ever. The US gender pay gap, while still stuck at about 82 cents on the dollar, is close to the narrowest it's ever been. What is holding marriages back?

Dené Logan, a marriage and family therapist based in Los Angeles, says that for one, gender norms are set in childhood. ""Men are handed a very specific template early in life: protect, provide, procreate — and their worth is tied to it,"" she says. With that mindset deeply ingrained, Logan adds, when a woman in a heterosexual marriage is financially and professionally successful, it can ""trigger resentment"" within the man — whether he knows it or not.

Because of these long-standing constructs, men's sense of mission and meaning is still frequently tied up in work and money. ""And without a sense of mission or meaning, many men can feel diminished and even threatened,"" Logan says.

Muriel Wilkins, an executive coach and CEO of a leadership advisory firm, agrees. ""What's really happening here is a clash between progress and old expectations,"" she says. ""Beliefs don't change as fast as paychecks do.""

""Cultural norms are very sticky,"" says Ramit Sethi, a bestselling author and podcast host. ""We see stickiness,"" he says, in the ""amount of time spent on household chores, emotional labor, and money in relationships."" For example, he notes, even though women in urban cities out-earn men in their 20s, dating norms about who picks up the check have been glacially slow to change.

Many of the women I spoke to also said that fault lines in marriages and relationships that were initially caused by money were exacerbated by the fact that men who weren't getting paid as much were also not shouldering as much of the unpaid labor in the home. A Pew study from 2023 found that women in the US still consistently pick up more household chores and caregiving responsibilities. That's true in marriages in which the man outearns the woman, but also in those in which both spouses earn roughly the same amount, and even when the wife is the primary earner. The only marriages in which husbands devoted more time to caregiving than their wives were those in which the wife was the sole household earner. In those situations, wives and husbands spent roughly the same amount of time per week on household chores.

""It felt like a double whammy,"" one woman says of her husband, who was laid off shortly after they got married. ""He wasn't working, which made him angry and resentful, but then he refused to do almost anything around the house while I was earning for the both of us. And that made me angry and resentful,"" she says. ""If that's not a recipe for disaster, then I don't know what is.""

There are, of course, exceptions to the female breadwinner trend.

Brian Tan and his wife, who live in New York, have been married for two years and in a relationship for eight. They started their careers earning the same salary at the same financial services firm. After that, he switched employers and took a job which paid about double her salary. But since then, he's started working for a children's hospital and she's moved into tech. She now earns between 70 and 80% more than him, Tan says, and it's not an issue in their marriage.

He says there are several reasons her outearning him doesn't bother him. ""The first is that I view it as one big pool of money. The second is that this is a pendulum that swings both ways — there was a period where I made more, then we made the same amount, then she makes more now,"" says Tan. ""A third reason is that I'm truly proud of her, and to be genuinely proud of someone, all feelings of jealousy disappear from one's mindset; I want her to feel fulfilled and intellectually stimulated, and the fact that she gets paid a lot while doing her job is a win-win for me.""

One woman based in the UK who asked not to be named tells me that she has four sisters. ""We all earn more than our husbands — all six figures,"" she says. ""Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but we are all married."" The key to success, she said, is being open and communicating, especially when conflicts arise.

Natasha, a 37-year old marketing executive, says that her family is very traditional in terms of gender norms. By earning double what her husband earns, she sometimes feels like she's simultaneously living both outside of traditional gender norms and inside of them — ""a sort of double existence that can feel stressful,"" she says. But crucially, she's been happily married to her husband for seven years — they just had a baby. The pay differential doesn't bother him, she says. ""I think that's evidence of his maturity and confidence.""

Another woman told me that when she first met the man who became her husband, she was earning ""a thousand times"" more than him. They've now been together for a decade, and she's still earning about 40 percent more than him. ""It's never ever been a problem,"" she said. And he agrees: ""Unless it's a problem for my wife, I'm secure enough in myself and in our relationship for it to not even be a consideration.""

William Conrad and his girlfriend Levi Coralynn, who are both in their 20s, have garnered an enormous social media following — he has about 1.3 million TikTok followers, she about 2.3 million— for publicly and performatively living out an atypical heterosexual relationship. Coralynn, a content creator, is the primary earner, while Conrad seemingly takes care of the bulk of the domestic work.

Muriel Wilkins said that she does think things will eventually change, especially as Gen Zers like Conrad and Coralynn are questioning and pushing back against outdated norms. But it will take time, she said, and progress will only materialize if individual couples are prepared to confront these outdated norms head-on.

""Couples have to talk openly about expectations — who does what, what success means, what partnership really looks like — rather than just falling back on the old scripts,"" she says. ""They need to redefine what success looks like in their marriage. Together, they can stop asking, 'Who's the breadwinner?' and start asking, 'How do we win together?'""

Dené Logan put it more bluntly: ""Your husband is not the patriarchy."" In other words, frustration over inequality in marriage often has roots beyond the individual relationship. And recognizing that distinction is key to avoiding misplaced resentment.

Progress won't come from paychecks alone. It will come, says Wilkins, ""when we stop treating money as the measure of power in a marriage, and start seeing partnership as a balance of respect, care, and shared responsibility."" Equality doesn't necessarily mean sameness, says Logan, it means rewriting the story of marriage for a new era.

To build brand loyalty, get 'em while they're young.

Harvey, a startup building artificial intelligence tools for lawyers, is taking that creed to college campuses.

The company, last valued at $5 billion, says it now works with half of the country's 100 largest law firms and is extending its reach to the classroom.

In August, Harvey said it would give six law schools access to the platform as part of a new ""alliance."" The next month, it onboarded 11 more law schools. Now, Harvey has added Duke Law and Northwestern Pritzker Law to the roster, the company tells Business Insider. Participation in the program is available to the law schools free of charge.

""What we're trying to do is make it so they can start integrating that into their training as early as possible,"" Winston Weinberg, Harvey's cofounder and chief executive, said from a conference room in the company's Manhattan office.

He imagines a not-so-distant future where a private-equity class conducts a mock leveraged buyout inside Harvey; students draft and refine arguments with its tools before a moot court. The simulations he describes aren't live yet.

Harvey's program borrows from the ""Wexis"" playbook. For decades, LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters, which both supply case law to legal professionals, blanketed law schools with free or nearly free access. Students spend years getting fluent in one system and then carry that muscle memory into practice.

Harvey is betting that prompting and directing virtual agents will be the next habits that stick.

Inside firms, Weinberg says Harvey is stripping the drudgery from legal work, and clients are starting to notice. Faster is becoming the expectation. He compares it to the advent of email. ""The biggest change it made,"" he said, is that ""you've got to respond way faster.""

That's the incentive problem at the heart of legal tech: many lawyers are paid by the hour, and saving time can result in a loss of revenue. Weinberg thinks that Harvey's efficiency gains will prompt firms to move more work off the billable hour and onto flat-fee menus to protect their profits. The price of services depends on the specific legal matter, and doesn't decrease even as labor costs fall.

Weinberg said law firms could also pass along the cost of using Harvey and other tools to their clients, a familiar move in the legal world. Many firms already include a line item on their invoices for research databases, such as LexisNexis or Westlaw, showing how many queries a matter requires. Asked if Harvey might one day appear the same way, Weinberg said the company is ""exploring that right now.""

The caveat is that uptake today skews towards the big corporates and law firms, and even there, Harvey is still seen as an efficiency booster, not a requirement for practice.

Law schools aren't entirely analog. They've long run on enterprise tools like Lexis and Westlaw. Where they diverge is on policies around generative artificial intelligence. Some prohibit it. Others allow it with disclosure. A few are weaving it into clinics and practice labs.

Notably, the list of Harvey's launch partners was missing a few giants, Yale and Harvard among them. Company lore says the name ""Harvey"" is partly a nod to Harvard.

Asked what he would change about legal education if he were rewriting the first-year curriculum today, Weinberg, a trained lawyer who graduated from the USC Gould School of Law, said his answer would have been the same, even before the arrival of ChatGPT. He argues law schools can do far more to prepare students for the realities of practice.

He has no quarrel with the traditional first-year curriculum. ""I think where things actually break down,"" he said, ""is that there is almost no hands-on stuff in the second and third year."" Summer jobs help. But, in his view, a three-year legal education should more closely resemble the workplace.

Harvey aims to help fix that, though its law school partnership remains light on details. To land on campus, it has to navigate a live debate inside faculties, where purists who want to prohibit the tech to protect core skills are squaring off against pragmatists who want supervised use.

If Harvey can get a foothold in law schools now, the payoff could arrive when today's second-year lawyers become tomorrow's associates and in-house counsel.

Former Ford CEO Mark Fields said on Tuesday that US automakers overestimated consumer demand when they started ramping up production of electric vehicles.

""Over the last couple of years, the automakers really went full bore in putting in capacity for EVs,"" Fields, 64, told CNBC's ""Power Lunch.""

""They really didn't have a good discussion on the consumer, in terms of what it was going to take to get the consumer to buy these EV products,"" Fields said.

Representatives for Fields did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Fields started his career at Ford in 1989 after graduating with an MBA from Harvard Business School. He held a variety of senior leadership positions at Ford, and was the company's chief operating officer from 2012 to 2014 and its CEO from 2014 to 2017.

Some of the big bets automakers made on EVs have come undone ""over the last 18 months or so,"" Fields told CNBC.

General Motors said in an exchange filing on Tuesday that it was taking a $1.6 billion charge ""based on a planned strategic realignment of our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint to consumer demand.""

The company said it expected the ""adoption rate of EVs to slow"" after the Trump administration eliminated federal EV incentives.

Under the Biden administration, EV buyers were entitled to a $7,500 consumer tax credit if they bought a new EV and a $4,000 consumer tax credit for a used EV. Both schemes expired on September 30.

""This is clearly an issue where the market didn't develop the way automakers thought. A lot of them, particularly in GM's case, boasted that they had the full lineup of EVs,"" Fields said on Tuesday.

""And what was an advantage, at least they thought at the time, has now probably turned into a bit of an albatross as the market take-up of EVs is going to be lower, at least in the near to medium term, than they plan for,"" he continued.

Auto chiefs have expressed mixed views on whether the rollback of federal EV incentives would hurt the US EV market.

Ford's current CEO, Jim Farley, said last month that the expiry of federal EV incentives could halve US EV sales.

""I think it's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought,"" Farley said on September 30.

Former Tesla president Jon McNeill, however, thought otherwise. McNeill said in an interview with CNBC on October 2 that the market can continue to ""grow without subsidies.""

""In Europe, France and Germany in particular rolled subsidies off a couple of years ago, and what happened after that, surprisingly, was the market continued to grow,"" McNeill said.

""That's largely because the models continue to roll out from other OEMs, much like they have here,"" McNeill added, using the acronym for original equipment manufacturers.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nian Yang-yi, 34, a barista turned quality control specialist at a coffee trading firm in Taiwan. The following has been translated and edited for length and clarity.

I chose to study computer science and information engineering in college because I didn't like interacting with people.

Programming seemed perfect: I could spend all day on a computer, coding and debugging. At the time, I was happy with this choice and imagined my future would follow that path.

But life is unexpected. In my third year of college, I had a sports accident that caused a retinal detachment. I went through surgery, and afterward, the doctor told me to rest and not overuse my eyes.

If I became an engineer right away, the pressure on my eyes would be even greater. So my plan was simple: work somewhere else for two or three years, let my eyes recover, and then return to writing code.

That's how I ended up at a café. At first, I didn't drink coffee at all, and I didn't like it. But my boss and coworkers encouraged me to try it. They brewed me a cup every day.

At first, I refused, but eventually I tried a cup — and something clicked. It felt like coding: Could I make this more precise, more efficient? Could I describe what I tasted so others could understand?

So, I started studying sensory skills and how to communicate flavors. That was how I became absorbed in coffee.

I worked as a barista at that café for 10 years.

Outside of work, I was still involved in coffee — going to tastings, events, and classes.

At first, I thought coffee was straightforward — as long as I could brew drinks that customers enjoyed and my coworkers liked, it felt like I had already learned everything there was to learn.

But once I started going out and experiencing more, I realized coffee is something you can never fully master. People often say the more you study a subject, the more you realize how little you understand — and that was exactly how I felt about coffee.

It was partly why I left the café to join a coffee trading firm. I had met the boss in a coffee course, and he asked years later if I wanted to try working there.

I felt I had to do it because coffee is not just about making drinks. It is a whole supply chain — farmers, importers, roasters — and I wanted to learn more.

I'm now in my third year as a quality control specialist.

In the café, my skills were in brewing and serving customers. But upstream, the needs are different: evaluating beans, checking consistency, and thinking about market demand.

When I moved, my salary dropped from nearly 50,000 Taiwan dollars a month, about $1,600, to about 35,000 Taiwan dollars. Now, I earn about 42,000 Taiwan dollars.

This job has broadened my perspective on the coffee supply chain. In my fourth month, I earned the internationally recognized Arabica Q Grader certification.

Coffee changed me as a person. I used to avoid human interaction, but being a barista meant I had to understand customers, chat, and connect with them.

At first, it was a big challenge. Conversations often dropped awkwardly. But over time, I developed ways to interact more comfortably, learned to listen, and sense how people were feeling.

In 2022, I started volunteering at a community café for Believe in Next Generation, a nonprofit, where I regularly serve as a barista when the café offers coffee for a donation.

The nonprofit is located in a military village, and some elderly residents would come early, wait for me, and smile when I arrived. They didn't directly say they needed companionship, but I could feel it.

Sometimes, they stayed in the café and told me their life stories and memories, many from Taiwan's martial law years or the Japanese colonial era.

This is one of coffee's meanings: It gives people a chance to gather and share their stories.

Some of my engineering friends have told me they envy me for turning my interest into a job — until the topic of salary comes up, because their salaries can be two to three times mine.

I have wondered whether I should continue doing what I want to do or return to a more practical job.

At this stage of life — from your twenties into your early thirties — many people are buying cars and houses. But coffee is the industry that makes me feel the happiest and most at ease.

Now, I live with my parents in New Taipei City and share a mortgage with my sister for our family home. I pay about 15,000 Taiwan dollars a month toward it.

To manage, I spend less on recreation, like traveling once every three or four years. Since coffee is also my hobby, most of my discretionary spending goes to coffee courses or activities.

I can usually save 10,000 to 15,000 Taiwan dollars a month.

I also look for ways to increase my income through side hustles, such as judging coffee competitions and teaching courses. These can add about 5% to 10% to my monthly income.

Some people choose high-paying jobs and use their salaries to fund hobbies. Others, like me, turned their passion into work, even with less money.

The first step is to imagine the kind of life you want, and then decide if your passion is strong enough to carry you there.

If I could start over, my choice probably wouldn't change — it would still be coffee.

Marc Benioff doesn't think enough companies have figured out how to adopt AI.

""Customers are getting their head around how to deploy AI,"" Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, told CNBC host Jim Cramer on Tuesday.

Earlier on Tuesday, Benoiff kicked off the Dreamforce conference at San Francisco's Moscone Center with a keynote, where he touted how clients such as Williams-Sonoma and Dutch jewelry maker Pandora have adopted Salesforce's AI products.

""The speed of innovation is far exceeding the speed of customer adoption,"" said Benioff to Cramer. ""These customers have to go back and modify massive architectures they have and systems they're running.""

The comments on AI adoption come as Salesforce shares are down more than 28% compared to the same time last year and around 34% compared to their peak in December 2024. The company said in August that it cut its support staff from 9,000 to 5,000 employees, thanks to the adoption of AI agents.

When asked about the stock decline, Benioff said that the Agentforce platform has rapidly grown since the company first introduced it a little over a year ago, but there is little understanding of how the company is using autonomous bots to drive efficiency.

""People don't understand that Agentforce is part and parcel of Salesforce,"" said Benioff. ""It is the core of every product we make now, it is the platform.""

The Dreamforce conference is set to bring tens of thousands of guests to San Francisco this week as Benoiff attempts to sell software like Tableau and Slack, powered by AI. Tickets typically run from $999 to $2,299. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Dario Amodei, CEO of AI lab Anthropic, are both scheduled to have chat sessions with Benoiff throughout the week, topped off with music performances from Metallica and Benson Boone.

As South Korea's beauty giant Olive Young gears up to land on US shores, American retailers are jostling for a share of the K-beauty pie.

US beauty retailers like Sephora and Ulta Beauty are snapping up South Korean beauty brands and inking exclusive sales partnerships to capitalize on the K-beauty trend.

Skincare brand Hanyul announced in May that it was exclusively launching in the US via Sephora. Aestura, a sensitive skincare brand, said the same in February.

And Ulta Beauty is the only major US retailer selling products from Medicube, a beauty tech company whose skincare devices have been touted by celebrities like Kylie Jenner and Hailey Bieber.

This turf war over K-beauty in the US is unfolding before Olive Young, South Korea's answer to Ulta Beauty, makes its much-awaited US debut in 2026. The retailer, which has over 1,300 stores in South Korea, is known for stocking top-ranking K-beauty brands and focusing on trendy and affordable products.

K-beauty, known for its innovative formulations, gentle ingredients, and multi-step routines, means big money. According to data from marketing research firm NielsenIQ, it was a $2 billion industry in the US in the year leading up to July 2025 — up 37% from the same period the year before.

Sephora stocks many big-name Korean brands, such as Beauty of Joseon, Dr. Jart+, Laneige, Aestura, Hanyul, and others.

Ulta Beauty execs said on an earnings call in August that the company is expanding its K-beauty assortment, with new additions like Anua and Peach & Lily joining its existing portfolio of Korean brands like Medicube, Belif, COSRX, and others.

Ashley Kang, the global beauty director of Chicago-based market research company Worldpanel, said K-beauty is still a niche product category. Its core audience consists of Asian consumers and younger demographics, ranging from Gen Alpha to millennials.

""Until the rise of K-culture, Asian beauty outside of Japan had little global recognition,"" Kang said. ""The growing influence of Korean pop culture and dramas allowed people to see the flawless skin of Korean celebrities, building trust and belief in K-beauty products.""

K-beauty differs from clean skincare brands from the US, like Hailey Bieber's Rhode, in several ways.

Larissa Jensen, the global beauty industry advisor of Chicago-based market research firm Circana, said brands like Rhode home in on ethical ingredient sourcing. In contrast, K-beauty brands have carved out a niche in preventive care and long-term skin health.

Anna Keller, a principal analyst from London-based market research firm Mintel, told Business Insider that K-beauty has a price advantage over US brands.

""They're super affordable, so you're getting high-quality, effective products without breaking the bank,"" Keller said.

Sephora and Ulta Beauty are choosing K-beauty brands that have already proven themselves to US consumers, she said. These brands, like Beauty of Joseon and Medicube, have been popular on online platforms like Amazon.

""A lot of this success comes from social media buzz — think TikTok trends like 'glass skin' and the hype around ingredients like snail mucin,"" Keller said. ""Sephora and Ulta are essentially riding the wave of this existing demand, bringing in brands that are already popular and have a strong following in the US.""

With US retailers snapping up K-beauty brands before Olive Young's debut next year, the Korean company is set to enter a competitive landscape.

""Unlike Sephora and Ulta, which focus on a handful of big-name brands, Olive Young is more about discovery,"" Keller said. ""They're known for curating a mix of well-known and up-and-coming Korean brands, which makes them a go-to for people who want to explore beyond the mainstream.""

Kang from Worldpanel said Olive Young needs to ""position itself as a K-beauty specialist, ensuring that its competition does not directly overlap with Sephora or Ulta.""

She said that the retailer can take advantage of the tariff turmoil. Olive Young can provide US consumers easy access to a broad range of K-beauty brands now that there are fewer ways to obtain them.

Kang said that K-beauty is a trend that is set to get even stronger in the US market.

She added, ""This trend is not limited to skincare — it is expected to extend into hair care, makeup, fragrance, beauty devices, and beyond.""

In a world glued to screens, Aziz Ansari is choosing the analog life.

During an appearance on Tuesday's episode of the ""Good Hang with Amy Poehler"" podcast, the comedian spoke about his Luddite ways and why he isn't a fan of ChatGPT.

""I don't have email. I haven't had email for, like, 10 years. But I have an assistant,"" Ansari told podcast host Amy Poehler.

And it's not just his inbox that he's abandoned.

""I have a flip phone. If I get really lost, I've got to either ask people or just call my wife and be like 'Hey.' I've had to do that before, like, call my wife, and to the point where she's kind of used to it,"" Ansari said.

Instead of using an app to call for an Uber, Ansari says he hails a taxi. If there isn't one, he'll call, he added.

Living a low-tech lifestyle has its benefits, Ansari said.

""It just gives me more space to think. I mean, I heard something about, like, Tarantino doesn't even have a phone. Chris Nolan doesn't have a phone. I was like, 'Whoa, those guys are able to get a lot of stuff done. Maybe there's something to it,'"" he said.

The comedian says he is also wary of ChatGPT.

""It's outsourcing critical thinking. It's making everyone's opinions kind of the same,"" Ansari said.

Not only is AI prone to making mistakes, it reinforces what people already think, he added.

The comedian said he once saw a commercial in which someone asked ChatGPT how to make dinner for a date.

""I would rather call someone and ask someone, or maybe have some sort of conversation, a human thing. It just seems like it's like outsourcing thinking, and it's like killing some bit of humanity,"" Ansari said.

Speaking to People in September, Ansari said he knows that his ability to live offline comes with a certain level of privilege and isn't realistic for everyone.

""But for me, it helps me keep a clear head to help me write and do what's more important for my job,"" he said.

A representative for Ansari did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.

Ansari isn't the only celebrity who has spoken about preferring an analog lifestyle.

In July 2023, Christopher Nolan said he doesn't carry a smartphone or use email. The filmmaker said he writes scripts on a computer without the internet.

""If I'm generating my material and writing my own scripts, being on a smartphone all day wouldn't be very useful for me,"" Nolan told The Hollywood Reporter.

Dolly Parton said during an October 2023 appearance on ""The View"" that she still prefers communicating via fax because otherwise, she'd be overwhelmed by all the messages she gets.

""So I never did get into getting involved in all that because it'll take up too much of my time if I talked to everybody who is trying to get in touch with me,"" Parton said.

In January, Christopher Walken told The Wall Street Journal that his relationship with technology is nearly nonexistent.

""I only have a satellite dish on my house. So I've seen 'Severance' on DVDs that they're good enough to send me. I don't have a cellphone. I've never emailed or, what do you call it, Twittered,"" Walken said.

It's not just Hollywood: In a May story, regular people told Business Insider that they swapped smartphones for dumb phones to wean themselves off their screens and social media.

Some Gen Zs are even chaining their smartphones to a wall — creating a makeshift landline —and freeing themselves from the urge to scroll.

Six AI startups are part of Jensen Huang's vision for human-digital workforces.

""Future workforces in enterprise will be a combination of humans and digital humans. Some of them will be OpenAI-based, and some of it would be Harvey-based or Open Evidence or Cursor or Replit or Lovable,"" the Nvidia CEO said in an interview with Citadel Securities published on Tuesday.

Huang's wide-ranging list included OpenAI, which makes large language models, legal tech darling Harvey, and AI healthcare tool OpenEvidence. Replit, Cursor, and Lovable offer AI-powered coding or ""vibe coding"" tools.

Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI to build data centers running the chipmaker's systems, the companies said last month.

In his Citadel talk, Huang specifically highlighted Anysphere-owned Cursor. He said that 100% of Nvidia's software engineers and chip designers use Cursor.

""We now have AIs for all of our engineers,"" he said. ""Productivity gains, the work that we do is so much better.""

Nvidia declined to comment further.

In June, Business Insider reported that Amazon was in talks with Cursor to adopt the AI coding tool internally after employees demanded it.

Huang has long said that AI and ""biological"" employees will work together in the future. AI agents break down a task into multiple smaller steps, each tackling a specific part to achieve a broader objective.

In Huang's January keynote at CES, one of the world's largest tech trade shows, he proclaimed, ""The age of agentic AI is here.""

In a podcast last October, Huang explained how the human and AI employees would work together. He described a future where the technology giant would mass-deploy AI assistants, also called agents, across every division to improve output.

""I'm hoping that Nvidia someday will be a 50,000-employee company with a 100 million, you know, AI assistants, in every single group,"" Huang said.

Human-AI integration is gaining venture capital attention, too.

Late last month, General Catalyst's CEO Hemant Taneja said that true AI integration has four non-negotiables, and one of them is planning for how humans and AI will work together.

""Some humans are going to manage AI agents. Some AI agents are going to manage humans,"" he said on a podcast appearance. ""Imagine how the org charts have to change.""

Cathie Wood says Wall Street is overlooking AI's biggest payoff.

The CEO of Ark Invest said at the All-In Summit 2025 in September that the real AI revolution is happening in hospitals and labs — and investors are barely paying attention.

""The most profound application of AI is in healthcare,"" Wood said in a discussion posted Tuesday.

She added that combining AI with advances in gene sequencing and CRISPR technology — a technology scientists use to selectively modify the DNA of living organisms — could spark a medical transformation.

""This is the sleeper. It's the most inefficiently priced part of the market,"" Wood said.

Wood said that five major technologies — AI, robotics, energy storage, blockchain, and genomics — are each entering their steep growth phase. When one advances, it accelerates the others.

That convergence is why healthcare could deliver massive gains for investors willing to bet early, Wood said. Smarter algorithms make gene sequencing faster; cheaper sequencing gives AI more data to learn from; and breakthroughs in gene editing can open the door to new treatments.

It's not the first time Wood has gone against the grain — her funds became famous for early bets on Tesla and Roku.

Wood also said some of the so-called ""MAG 6"" tech giants — Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet — could see slower growth in the next five years. These giants tripled in valuation in market cap from 2019 to 2024 ""because investors were playing it safe, and they were investing only in the largest, most cash-rich stocks.""

""That was a very difficult time for innovation for venture capital generally,"" Wood said, referring to the years when investors stuck with Big Tech. ""Now we think it is truly disruptive innovation's time to shine in the market,"" she added.

Wood did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Her firm managed over $13 billion in May, according to its most recent filing.

AI is quickly reshaping the healthcare industry, and tech's biggest players are racing to stake their claims.

Microsoft has been integrating AI into its cloud solutions to automate hospital operations. Earlier this year, Microsoft said its medical AI system diagnosed cases more accurately than human doctors by a wide margin in a study.

Nvidia is also pushing deeper into the sector. Its VP of healthcare, Kimberly Powell, told Business Insider in April that medical imaging was one of Nvidia's entry points into healthcare. The company has notched a number of medical imaging partnerships powered by its AI platforms, most recently with GE Healthcare in March.

Healthcare startups are rushing in, too. Founders told Business Insider in July that AI could be the breakthrough that helps clinicians multiply their caseloads and earn extra cash without sacrificing care quality.

A federal jury is set to hear opening statements in Manhattan on Tuesday in the fraud and conspiracy trial of two MIT-educated brothers accused in a lightning-fast, $25 million cryptocurrency heist.

The defendants — Anton Peraire-Bueno, 25, of Boston, and James Peraire-Bueno, 29, of New York City — will face a jury of their peers in the complicated case, at least in terms of education.

The daylong jury selection on Monday resulted in a four-woman, eight-man panel consisting entirely of individuals with college degrees.

Half of the jurors hold master's degrees, including in finance, the sciences, medicine, and education.

The jurors, almost all of whom are middle- or retirement-aged, will return to court on Tuesday morning, when they'll be sworn in, listen to opening statements, and hear the first government witnesses by the end of the day.

The openings promise to describe a complex, multi-step transaction on the Ethereum blockchain that left the brothers $25 million richer, while a trio of traders were left holding a pile of worthless, illiquid junk crypto.

Prosecutors say the ""first-of-its-kind"" fraud scheme took months of meticulous planning and was executed in just 12 seconds on a day in April 2023.

Before and after the alleged exploit, prosecutors say, the brothers typed in internet searches that included: ""how to wash crypto,"" ""top crypto lawyers,"" ""fraudulent Ethereum addresses database,"" and ""money laundering statue [sic] of limitations.""

Prosecutors allege that the brothers studied the trading behaviors of the victim traders before the heist, then took steps afterward to hide their identities and the location of the pilfered cryptocurrency. They've promised to reveal a web of shell companies, private cryptocurrency addresses, and foreign cryptocurrency exchanges.

""Using the specialized skills developed during their education, as well as their expertise in cryptocurrency trading,"" the brothers ""exploited the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain,"" prosecutors said in a 19-page indictment last year.

The brothers, who remain free on $250,000 bail each, have strongly contested the prosecution's accusations.

Their defense attorneys have argued that there was no fraud at all and that they merely outsmarted some ""predatory"" automated trading bots.

The alleged victims lost their cryptocurrency ""through pre-programmed trades without ever interacting with the Peraire-Buenos, directly or indirectly,"" the defense lawyers argued earlier this year, in a failed motion to dismiss the indictment.

In a blow to the defense last week, US District Judge Jessica G. L. Clarke barred the Peraire-Bueno's lawyers from arguing, as she put it, ""that the victims deserved this.""

The judge also barred defense experts from testifying about the lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency market.

The trial is expected to last into early November.

In this article

Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock and Elon Musk's xAI are part of a consortium of investors that has agreed to purchase Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion, the companies announced Wednesday.

Aligned designs and operates data centers and data campuses across North and South America, and is owned by Macquarie Asset Management.

MGX of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners and members of Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership, or AIP, will acquire 100% of the company's equity, in what will be the largest global data center deal to date, according to a release.

AIP was created by BlackRock, MGX, Microsoft and Nvidia in September 2024 to accelerate investment in AI infrastructure. The Kuwait Investment Authority, xAI and Temasek have joined as additional participants.

The Aligned deal marks AIP's first investment and is a step toward the group's goal of deploying $30 billion of equity capital.

""With this investment in Aligned Data Centers, we further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI, while offering our clients attractive opportunities to participate in its growth,"" Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock and Chairman of AIP, said in a statement.

AI companies have been racing to build out the infrastructure they believe they will need to meet growing demand for the technology.

Companies including OpenAI, Nvidia, CoreWeave and Oracle are striking ambitious data center and computing deals that will require unprecedented amounts of funding and power.

Data centers are the large facilities that house the hardware and equipment needed to run big AI workloads and train models. Aligned currently operates 50 campuses and has more than 5 gigawatts of operational and planned capacity.

The Aligned transaction is expected to close late next year, and it is still subject to regulatory approvals and other standard closing conditions.

In this article

The Trump administration will set price floors across a range of industries to combat market manipulation by China, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC in an exclusive interview Wednesday.

China has driven foreign competitors in the rare earth industry out of business over the past two decades by using its global dominance in refining and processing to slash prices, Bessent said.

""When you are facing a nonmarket economy like China, then you have to exercise industrial policy,"" Bessent told Sara Eisen at CNBC's Invest in America Forum in Washington, D.C.

""So we're going to set price floors and the forward buying to make sure that this doesn't happen again and we're going to do it across a range of industries,"" the Treasury secretary said, without naming specific industries the administration was looking at beyond rare earths. 

The U.S. also needs to set up a strategic mineral reserve, Bessent said. JPMorgan Chase is interested in working with the Trump administration to create such a reserve, he said.

Rare earths are used to produce magnets that are crucial inputs in U.S. weapons systems like the F-35 warplane and Tomahawk cruise missiles. Rare earth magnets are also essential for civilian commercial applications like electric vehicles.

The Trump administration has been working to stand up a domestic rare earth supply chain. The Department of Defense struck an unprecedented deal in July with MP Materials, the largest U.S. rare earth miner, that included an equity stake, a price floor and offtake agreement.

China last week announced sweeping new restrictions on rare earth exports ahead of an expected meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump in South Korea later this month. Trump has threatened to slap China with additional 100% tariffs in response.

The U.S. could take equity stakes in other companies in the wake of Beijing's rare earth restrictions, Bessent told CNBC.

""I wouldn't be surprised,"" the Treasury secretary said when asked about additional equity stakes. ""When we get an announcement like this week with China on the rare earths, you realize we have to be self-sufficient, or we have to be sufficient with our allies.""

The Trump administration will not take stakes in nonstrategic industries, Bessent said. ""We do have to be very careful not to overreach,"" he said.

Shares of rare earth and critical mineral miners have rallied over the past several sessions as investors speculate on which companies might be future targets for Trump administration industrial policy.

In this article

Apple announced new MacBook Pro, iPad Pro and Vision Pro models on Wednesday with an updated M5 chip that allows them to run faster than their predecessors.

The new MacBook Pro models start at $1,599. The 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $999. The latest Apple Vision Pro, which includes a Dual Knit Band, starts at $3,499.

The new devices are available to preorder now in most markets and go on sale Oct. 22. They are Apple's latest additions to its fall catalog of products.

The company released the iPhone 17 and Apple Watch Series 11 models in September.

Apple's December quarter is its largest by sales, driven by holiday and Christmas shopping. That is why the company usually updates its bestselling products in the fall. This year, it's the first full quarter of iPhone 17 sales as well.

The new device lineup is powered by Apple's M5 chip, which the company said has four times the peak compute performance compared with the previous M4.

Johny Srouji, Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Technologies, said in a release that the ""M5 delivers a huge boost to AI workloads.""

Wednesday's announcement comes as Wall Street analysts are closely watching Apple's new releases to see if the company is raising prices or eating costs related to President Donald Trump's announced and threatened tariffs, especially on semiconductors and China.

Starting prices for the latest M5 models are the same as the previous versions.

While iPads and MacBooks aren't as critical for Apple as iPhone sales, they are still massive businesses.

Apple reported $6.58 billion in iPad sales in the June quarter, an 8% decrease on an annual basis that the company attributed to difficult comparisons to the year-ago quarter when new iPad Pros were released.

Mac sales in the June quarter came in at $8.05 billion, a 15% increase on a year-over-year basis. Apple released a new version of what it calls its bestselling laptop, the MacBook Air, earlier this year.

Apple has never broken out figures for the Vision Pro headset but they are included alongside Apple Watch and AirPods sales in the company's wearables, or other products, line item. Analysts believe the company's Vision Pro revenue is negligible.

MacBook, iPads and Vision Pro put together are significantly less than Apple's iPhone revenue, which accounted for more than 47% of revenue in the company's June quarter at just under $45 billion.

Wall Street analysts tend to focus on iPhone sales and growth over the company's secondary product lines.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent insisted Wednesday that the U.S. won't change its trade negotiating stance on China due to stock market volatility.

""We won't negotiate because the stock market is going down"" or shy away from taking strong measures against Beijing for that reason, Bessent said in an exclusive interview at CNBC's Invest in America Forum.

""We will negotiate because we are doing what is best economically for the U.S.,"" he said.

Bessent pushed back on a report in The Wall Street Journal overnight that China ""expects that the prospect of another market meltdown ultimately will force [President Donald Trump] to negotiate.""

Chinese President Xi Jinping is ""betting that the U.S. economy can't absorb a prolonged trade conflict"" with China, the Journal reported, citing people close to Beijing's decision-making. 

The Cabinet secretary called that report ""terrible,"" accusing the newspaper of taking ""CCP dictation.""

A spokesperson for the Journal, asked for comment on Bessent's remarks, said the newspaper stands by its reporting.

""We hold ourselves to the highest journalistic standards and any insinuation otherwise is baseless and false,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

Bessent's comments came as markets have whipsawed in recent days, as the status of ongoing trade talks between the world's largest economies appeared to teeter.

Stocks tanked on Friday after Trump threatened to hike tariffs on Chinese imports in retaliation for new export controls that China imposed on rare earth minerals.

Trump appeared to soften his tone over the weekend, spurring a market rebound on Monday. Major stock indexes bounced around in volatile trading Tuesday; the S&P 500 took a dive before the session close after Trump issued yet another trade threat against China, this one accusing Beijing of economic hostility for not buying U.S. soybeans.

Bessent added Wednesday that while Trump ""likes a high stock market,"" he ""believes that the high stock market is a result of good policies.""

""It's the policies that we're talking about here today, in terms of this capex boom,"" Bessent said, highlighting increased investment in artificial intelligence.

To join the CNBC Technology Executive Council, go to cnbccouncils.com/tec

Walmart is deploying millions of ambient Internet of Things battery-free sensors throughout its massive supply chain in the U.S.

The retail giant is using technology from Wiliot in what the IoT vendor is calling the first large-scale deployment of ambient IoT in the retail sector and one of the largest such implementations to date.

Ambient IoT is a class of IoT devices mainly powered by harvesting ambient energy from radio waves, light, motion, heat, or other viable ambient energy sources. It's an evolution of legacy IoT and radio frequency identification technologies that promise lower costs and high scalability.

Walmart will be using the IoT sensors to track pallets nationwide by the end of 2026. ""Expansion to other global markets is under consideration, but the immediate focus is the U.S. rollout,"" Cathey said.

The company will now have real-time insights into inventory management, knowing exactly where merchandise is located and whether it's owned by the retailer, at any moment, and covering an estimated 90 million pallets of inventory when at full scale.

The ambient IoT sensors Walmart uses capture signals about temperature, location, humidity, and dwell time. These signals are linked with the company's advanced artificial intelligence systems, enabling the company to dramatically improve supply chain efficiency, inventory accuracy, and cold chain compliance.

""We expect to be active in about 500 Walmart locations by the end of the year, with plans for national expansion in 2026,"" said Greg Cathey, senior vice president of transformation and innovation at Walmart. The rollout will cover 4,600 Walmart Supercenters, Neighborhood Markets, and more than 40 distribution centers, generating high-resolution supply chain data that feeds into Walmart's AI systems, he said.

""This data provides proof of delivery, improves replenishment decisions, and lets us know where our items are in real time,"" Cathey said. ""By combining continuous sensing with AI, we're moving from probabilistic predictions to precision decision-making.""

What makes the addition of ambient IoT sensors significant is it provides a new stream of data into AI systems, enabling them to be even more effective in giving Walmart greater visibility into supply chain operations.

The technology initiative is already making a significant impact by eliminating some manual tasks and providing automated alerts, Cathey said. ""Associates no longer need to perform time-consuming checks to locate items,"" he said. ""Automated alerts now flag this information in real time, allowing associates to act faster and dedicate more time to serving customers.""

The enhanced visibility into the supply chain is also helping to resolve inventory discrepancies, allowing improved customer experiences.

While Cathey did not disclose specific figures such as cost savings, Walmart is anticipating gains from higher supply chain efficiency, improved inventory accuracy, reduced manual tasks for associates, and the ability to get items on shelves more quickly. ""Customers [will] benefit from better product availability and consistency,"" he said.

""AI system performance is predicated on its training data. The better the data, the better the AI performance,"" said Julien Bellanger, president of Wiliot. ""Supply chain AI has long been fueled by inherently out-of-date data — or forecasted data that represents projections rather than reality.""

Ambient IoT is changing this model, Bellanger said, by fueling AI with data that reflects what's actually happening throughout the supply chain.

""We have been here before; Walmart was an early adopter of RFID back in 2004 when it was supposed to provide much the same functionality,"" said Bill Ray, distinguished vice president, analyst and chief of research at research firm Gartner. ""However, this time the cost of the tags is much lower, and that will be a tipping point.""

Ray says it's important to note that the value of such IoT systems is already known. ""The business models have been well studied and evaluated, when RFID was first touted as the solution to supply chain problems,"" he said. ""RFID has had an enormous impact, but the cost of the tags prevented the transformation it had promised. The industry has been able to integrate the new, lower-cost tags into the same value models, and come up with positive answers.""

Gartner has been tracking Wiliot for a long time. ""The question was never if the technology could deliver on its promise. The question was if Wiliot could reliably scale production without compromising tag performance or price, and if it could integrate with existing supply chain systems. This announcement tells us that Walmart is convinced it can, now Wiliot will have to prove it,"" Ray said.

""Ambient IoT just works,"" Cathey said. ""It doesn't require wanding or scanning. It lets our associates do what they do, and they can focus on doing their jobs safely and efficiently while providing continuous, real-time visibility into our supply chain.""

Ambient IoT got a boost earlier this year when a new business alliance was created to develop and promote an open, multi-standard ecosystem for ambient IoT manufacturers, suppliers, integrators, operators, users, and customers, based on next-generation, battery-free ambient IoT standards.

By focusing on advanced communication technologies, the alliance is seeking to overcome the limitations of traditional battery-powered IoT devices, promoting more sustainable and efficient products.

AI cloud company Nscale is eyeing an initial public offering, the company confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday as it announced a $14 billion deal with U.S. tech giant Microsoft.

The London-based company, which provides technology infrastructure to help artificial intelligence scale, has ""public market ambitions"" which could be realized in the ""back end of next year,"" Chief Executive Josh Payne told the Financial Times on Wednesday.

A company spokesperson declined to comment on where Nscale is considering listing.

On Wednesday Nscale announced an ""expanded partnership"" with Microsoft, netting the younger company $14 billion, a figure first reported by the FT and verified by CNBC.

Microsoft will purchase around 200,000 Nvidia GB300 graphics processing units from Nscale, inclusive of 75,000 GPUs for projects in Norway and the U.K. that were previously announced, putting the total deal worth at around $23 billion, according to CNBC calculations based on previous announcements.

A company spokesperson declined to comment on the value of the deals.

It comes less than a month after Nscale announced a $433 million funding around, which itself came hot on the heels of a $1.1 billion financing that is considered to be the largest Series B in Europe. Its investors include other technology heavyweights such as Dell, Nvidia and Nokia, as well as asset manager Blue Owl Managed Funds.

Founded in 2018, Nscale's pace of development speaks to the wider fervor around AI and the race to build out infrastructure that can support it. In both the public and private markets, fears of a bubble have emerged as investors pile in on AI-related stocks and startups.

Nscale, however, shows no signs of slowing down. ""We're always in touch with investors about future opportunities,"" a company spokesperson said.

BEIJING — Chinese smartphone company Honor on Wednesday announced it is developing a smartphone with a camera that folds out of the device using a robotic arm.

The company said it plans to share more details at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona early next year.

The new device would be the latest Chinese consumer electronics product to shake up a decades-old hardware design in an attempt to integrate AI. Earlier this year, Beijing-based Roborock started selling a robot vacuum cleaner with an arm that folds out from the top, and combines AI with sensors to detect obstructions for the arm to remove.

Honor is calling the product a ""robot phone"" and said it will incorporate artificial intelligence, but did not provide specific details.

The company said it is rolling out AI tools that help its smartphone users scan Chinese e-commerce sites for personalized shopping deals, quickly hail a taxi or get tips on how to better position the camera for a photo. The move is part of Honor's plan to spend $10 billion over the next five years for a transformation into an AI device company.

In this article

Many predict that the artificial intelligence boom will dramatically change how people live and work, and the scale and pace of recent AI deals seems to reflect this. At the center are a handful of companies that are increasingly turning to each other to finance and build out the necessary infrastructure.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI alone has racked up around $1 trillion in deals this year, according to a report from the Financial Times. In September, OpenAI confirmed that it would pay Oracle $300 billion for computer infrastructure over the course of five years. This deal is part of a $500 billion data center buildout project called Stargate, to which Japan's SoftBank Group is also contributing. OpenAI has also inked a $22 billion deal with CoreWeave for use of its data centers, which are packed with Nvidia graphics processing units. Most recently, OpenAI announced a partnership with Broadcom to develop and deploy racks of chips designed by the AI startup. That deal amount is undisclosed. OpenAI has been able to go on this shopping spree because of a $100 billion investment from Nvidia, though a large portion of that money likely be used for leasing Nvidia's GPUs. Microsoft has also invested about $14 billion in OpenAI since 2019.

Nvidia has also spun a similar web of intertwining AI deals. Nvidia in September agreed to pay up to $6.3 billion for any of CoreWeave's unsold cloud-computing capacity through 2032. CoreWeave gets most of its GPUs that it then rents out to customers from Nvidia, which is also an investor in the AI cloud infrastructure company. Meanwhile, Oracle has purchased about $40 billion worth of Nvidia chips to build a data center for OpenAI, which is part of the Stargate project. Softbank has a $3 billion stake in Nvidia.

Some experts are worried that these inflated AI company valuations ""are at a bubble."" A recent report by Bain & Company found that AI companies will need $2 trillion of annual revenue to fund the infrastructure needed to meet projected demand for AI by 2030. That's an $800 billion shortfall.

But AI leaders are pushing back against concerns, saying that this is simply what it takes to make AI a reality.

""The largest tech companies in the world are purchasing this infrastructure because they have demand,"" CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator said on Mad Money on Oct. 8. ""There's nothing circular about that. It's a fundamental infrastructure buildout that's taking place, and when you have such a massive-scale investment in infrastructure, it is not unusual to see partnerships as people try to serve infrastructure to the consumer. It happens in other markets, it's happening in this one.""Watch the video for a visual representation of this entangled web of AI deals.

If you believe money causes tension in your relationship, you're not alone.

I've spent the past two years interviewing and studying more than 60 couples and the ways they come into these conflicts. I've learned that love has little to do with it. You can love each other deeply and still allow money to erode your relationship if you're talking about the wrong issues, or not talking about them at all.

People often focus on the problems right in front of them: missing a bill payment or spending over the monthly budget. But these smaller transgressions can be a symptom of a bigger issue you and your partner haven't identified yet.

The happiest couples don't let these money mistakes ruin their relationship:

Long ago, you and your partner may have decided to do something one way, and you've been doing it that way ever since. 

A good example is splitting your expenses down the middle and having separate bank accounts. At the time, you were earning similar incomes and were just starting your lives together. It made sense. But circumstances have changed, and maybe one of you earns more money, or you're having kids, and the logistics of this setup are more complicated than helpful.

My advice is don't approach your partner about making big changes during a heated conflict. Raise the subject when stress is low and attention is high. You don't need to make a dramatic change overnight. Instead, use incremental steps to work toward a positive shared goal.

We all have things we wish could've gone differently. But the story you tell yourself about a situation might be completely different from someone else's. You might see your student loan debt as a challenge to overcome, while I see mine as my biggest financial regret.

The stories we tell ourselves about money matter. 

Shame, whether from the past or present, can trap someone into a cycle of fear and guilt. It clouds judgment and stalls progress, especially in a partnership. It might even convince someone they don't deserve a good life. 

As a partner, you can't wipe their shame away. They may need professional support. But you do need to understand the weight they're carrying in order to have honest, vulnerable conversations. Only then can you tailor your support to help them heal. 

Not every poor financial outcome is the result of a mistake. Sometimes, you take a step in the wrong direction. When that happens, you both need to be able to move on.  

For example, holding credit card debt, even for a short time, is a frequent source of regret, even if it was necessary in the moment. Failing to let go of your partner's setbacks can damage their self-worth and confidence. The result can cause them to believe they aren't good with money, or even worse, that they don't deserve to have a say in financial decisions. 

Letting go of regrets can be as simple as writing them down, or as complex as working through them with a professional. But above all, never be the one to make your partner feel shame over money. Be their support and let them grow from it.

Having a ""never enough"" mindset goes beyond money or careers. It's fueled by constant comparison, especially on social media. When you fixate on what you don't have, you keep trying to fill a bigger glass without ever feeling full.

Those expectations aren't always realistic or aligned with your goals as a couple, which is a slippery slope that can turn your partner into a moving target. They could begin to feel like they aren't enough for you, either.

""Enough"" doesn't mean ""everything."" Set aside time to talk about your real priorities and set those as your benchmarks of contentment, not the idealized version of success you see on social media. 

Financial infidelity can break trust in ways that are as harmful as adultery, because the betrayal directly impacts your livelihood as a family.

For example, hiding income from your partner, making a massive purchase your partner wouldn't agree with, or even taking on debt in one or both of your names. Healing from patterns of lies requires radical transparency from that partner, along with a willingness to listen, evolve, and improve.

And if you really don't feel free to spend money in your relationship, that's a conversation worth having. Rather than setting rigid spending rules (or even worse, ""allowances"") that fail to account for each person's household responsibilities, set a check-in number that you're both comfortable with. Anything below that amount is fair game.

Strong couples know that handling money together is about values, trust, and communication. If you commit to facing the real issues together, even tough times can become building blocks for a better relationship.

Heather Boneparth is the co-author of the upcoming book, ""Money Together,"" and the director of business and legal affairs for Bone Fide Wealth in New York City. With her husband, she co-writes The Joint Account, a weekly newsletter helping couples talk about money.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

The volatile U.S.-China relationship hit another bump yesterday when President Donald Trump said he is considering placing a cooking oil embargo on Beijing in retaliation for it's refusal to buy U.S. soybeans. The ongoing feud has led to choppy stock market trading over recent days.

Here's the latest:

Bank investors got more upbeat news this morning.

Bank of America said its investment banking revenue soared in the third quarter as it beat earnings forecasts for the period, leading shares to rally more than 5% in premarket trading. Morgan Stanley also outperformed Wall Street's expectations, pushing its stock up more than 3% before the bell.

Following JPMorgan Chase's earnings beat yesterday, CEO Jamie Dimon said auto market bankruptcies are a sign that lending standards have gotten too loose. Elsewhere on the economic front, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank could soon stop reducing its bond holdings.

While Trump has repeatedly said that his administration's mass layoffs are targeting ""Democrat Agencies"" amid the shutdown, the cuts also appear to be affecting bipartisan efforts. At the Treasury Department — where nearly 1,450 federal employees have received reduction-in-force notices — the entire 83-person staff of the bipartisan-supported Community Development Financial Institutions Fund was cut.

As the shutdown enters its third week, air traffic controllers have handed out leaflets at some airports urging the public to pressure Congress to reopen the government. Some airports meanwhile are refusing to play a video from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats for the shutdown. 

With September's figures now in the books, Boeing is on track for its highest annual plane delivery count since 2018. The company said yesterday that it delivered 55 aircraft last month, bringing its total to 440 airplanes in the first nine months of 2025.

As CNBC's Leslie Josephs notes, Boeing has been able to stabilize its production following several safety and production crises. Executives are aiming to increase production of Boeing's pricey 737 Max planes.

Boeing on Tuesday also received approval from European Union antitrust regulators for its $4.7 billion acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems. The plane maker agreed to sell some of Spirit's businesses to remedy competition concerns.

Automotive industry groups have raised the alarm over the ramifications of China's latest move to restrict critical rare earth exports, saying the measures could pave the way to a period of supply chain chaos.

China's Commerce Ministry last week announced expanded curbs on the export of rare earths and related technologies, seeking to prevent the ""misuse"" of minerals in the military and other sensitive sectors.

Beijing has since defended the policy, saying it was ""not afraid"" of a U.S. trade war after President Donald Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports.

Despite an agreement in July designed to fast-track shipments to the region, Europe's auto industry has been experiencing significant disruption after China imposed rare earth export curbs in early April.

The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), the country's main car industry lobby, said China's new regulations were expected to have ""far-reaching consequences for deliveries of the affected products to Germany and Europe,"" as well as for their onward transport.

China's latest export restrictions will hit the battery and semiconductor industries ""particularly hard, and thus also the automotive industry,"" the VDA spokesperson told CNBC by email on Tuesday.

The German car industry lobby called on policymakers in both Brussels and Berlin to tackle the issue ""forcefully"" with China to quickly find a viable solution.

""The fact is that the Chinese export restrictions on rare earths and permanent magnets implemented in April this year have already significantly exacerbated the supply situation for rare earths and strategic materials. The new measures now go even further,"" the VDA spokesperson said.

Rare earth metals are vital components to the production of electric vehicles, as well as various high-tech applications, including electronics and renewable energy applications.

Demand for rare earths and critical minerals is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years as the clean energy transition picks up pace.

China is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, accounting for roughly 60% of the world's production of rare earth minerals and materials. U.S. officials have previously warned that this poses a strategic challenge amid the pivot to more sustainable energy sources.

Roberto Vavassori, chairman of the Italian auto part maker lobby ANFIA, reportedly said Tuesday that while manufacturers had been able to maintain production when China restricted supplies over the summer, reserves of rare earth metals were now at risk of being depleted.

This buffer ""is not there anymore,"" Vavassori said at a conference in Milan, according to Reuters. ANFIA did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.

Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, said China's new crackdown on exports is pressing from a supply chain perspective.

""China dominates 90% of global refinery capacity and therefore it's a real bottleneck,"" Luman told CNBC by email.

""Across the supply chain there are still inventories, such as at Tradium's major storage facility near Frankfurt, so I don't expect immediate large fallouts already,"" Luman said.

""But rare earths include a range of elements, some could run short in delivery. And going forward relaxation of supplies is highly dependent on upcoming talks between China,"" he added.

In this article

Drugmaker Novo Nordisk has begun a round of layoffs in its most important market, the United States, with affected staff set to be notified between this week and next, according to an email and two sources familiar with the matter.

The time-frame for the layoffs has not previously been reported. The move comes as the Danish company behind popular weight-loss drug Wegovy looks to cut jobs globally and reduce costs in a battle with U.S. rival Eli Lilly.

U.S. layoffs began on Tuesday and will continue until late next week, according to a schedule in the email. They come after an acceleration of job cuts in Novo's home market, Denmark, where it plans to eliminate 5,000 positions.

Departments expected to be informed of cuts include human resources, clinical development, rare diseases, medical and regulatory, legal, ethics and compliance, marketing and sales, finance, public affairs and others, the schedule showed.

Reuters was unable to confirm how many people would be affected. Novo is looking to shed 9,000 roles globally in a restructuring drive under new CEO Mike Doustdar, who took office in August.

Novo did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but has said previously that the global process would take time and its ""highest priority is to support our employees"".

The sources asked not to be named in order to share confidential company information.

The layoffs come as Doustdar tries to restore investor confidence with what he calls a tighter focus on commercial execution and on the obesity and diabetes therapeutic areas.

Doustdar took the helm after a sliding share price and slowing Wegovy sales growth led to the ouster of long-time CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen.

Novo's shares are up around 6% since the restructuring was announced on September 10.

by RAY LEWIS | The National News Desk

TOPICS:

HUNT VALLEY, Md. (TNND) — The Department of Justice (DOJ) sued Tuesday to confiscate about $15 billion worth of bitcoin, the largest forfeiture action in the DOJ's history.

New York federal prosecutors and the DOJ's National Security Division filed a civil forfeiture complaint against the funds, which are the alleged proceeds and instruments of fraud and money laundering schemes directed by a Cambodian businessman.

The bitcoin, which total over 127,000, are now in the federal government's custody, the DOJ said. 

They were allegedly accessed through private crypto “wallets” with keys in the possession of the businessman, Chen Zhi. He is a Cambodian conglomerate chairman whom U.S. prosecutors accuse of laundering crypto to hide its source. Chen directed associates of the conglomerate, Prince Holding Group, to conceal the sources of its profits, which the DOJ claims are victims in New York City and other places across the world, according to prosecutors.

“As alleged, the defendant directed one of the largest investment fraud operations in history, fueling an illicit industry that is reaching epidemic proportions,” U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr. for the Eastern District of New York said in a statement. 



Chen allegedly orchestrated Prince Holding Group's profits through Cambodian compounds that carried out crypto investment schemes. The DOJ said that hundreds of workers, who were trafficked into the facilities against their will, executed the scams by convincing victims to transfer crypto to accounts controlled by the conglomerate. The workers promised the victims their funds would be invested and would generate profits, but the crypto was actually stolen and laundered, prosecutors claimed.

“This is an individual who allegedly operated a vast criminal network across multiple continents involving forced labor, money laundering, investment schemes, and stolen assets – targeting millions of innocent victims in the process,” FBI Director Kash Patel said, referring to Chen. “Justice will be done and I'm proud of the men and women of the FBI who executed this mission faithfully.”

The alleged scam workers in the compounds often developed relationships with victims through messaging or social media apps. 

The DOJ claimed they operated under violent threats while in the facilities, which were surrounded by high walls and barbed wire. Some of the scammers were subjected to torture and were beat, which Chen knew of, according to prosecutors. He allegedly kept records of each compound, including photos of violence committed against the workers.

“Today's action represents one of the most significant strikes ever against the global scourge of human trafficking and cyber-enabled financial fraud,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a joint statement. 



The DOJ noted that Chen and other Prince Holding Group executives used their political influence in multiple foreign countries to protect their scheme, bribing public officials to avoid law enforcement. 

Chen also used some profits for luxury travel and entertainment and to buy private jets, yachts, vacation homes, watches, collectables and a Pablo Picasso painting. The chairman, who is facing conspiracy charges for wire fraud and money laundering, would face at most 40 years in prison if he is convicted. He was at large as of Tuesday.



The Department of the Treasury has also sanctioned Chen and designated Prince Holding Group as a transnational criminal organization.

“Just buy an ETF.” That blunt advice from Strive Asset Management CEO Matt Cole during a panel at Hong Kong's Bitcoin Asia in August summed up the growing frustration with Digital Asset Treasuries (DAT), the corporate vehicles that promise to outperform bitcoin BTC$110,347.97 through clever financing and balance-sheet engineering but, so far, struggle to make good on that pledge.

Bitcoin itself is up about 23% this year. Yet, most Digital Asset Treasuries, including MicroStrategy, Semler Scientific, GameStop, and Trump Media, have badly trailed both BTC and the ETFs tracking it. Only a few outliers, like Twenty One Capital and Japan's Metaplanet, which has been prone to volatility, have managed to beat the benchmark.

That gap exposes the core weakness of the DAT trade. These companies were built to outperform BTC through leverage, financing, or operational alpha, but most are lagging the simplest possible exposure. 

The pitch of levered beta with balance-sheet discipline only works when equity premiums, convertibles, and debt markets stay friendly. Think about how toxic Strategy's $8 billion in debt would look if there were a rate hike. With an average coupon of just 0.42% and maturities stretching over four years, those bonds look manageable today, but that comfort vanishes in a higher-rate world.

Even though the headlines come through daily about crypto entrepreneurs taking over a shell company and pumping its balance sheet full of BTC, the warnings are growing louder and louder.

Galaxy Digital has warned that the entire structure depends on a persistent premium to net asset value, a reflexive setup reminiscent of the 1920s investment-trust boom. NYDIG has been just as critical, arguing that the industry's favored “mNAV” metric masks liabilities and inflates per-share exposure by assuming debt conversions that never happen.

None of this means corporate bitcoin adoption is a mirage; it's growing faster than ever. There are almost 40% more public companies holding bitcoin today than there were three months ago, according to data compiled by Bitwise.

Some of these companies are real firms that have BTC on the balance sheet because of the nature of their industry, like Coinbase, Bullish (Bullish is the parent company of CoinDesk), or BTC miners like MARA. Others have it as a hedge against fiat instability.

But, so many companies on Bitwise's list are BTC DATs, and it's important to differentiate these from other DATs that list proof-of-stake altcoins like ETH or Solana. This is a different offering.

By staking native assets and operating validators, these DATs earn yield not from leverage but from network activity itself. For instance, owning an ETH or TRX DAT would get exposure to Ethereum or Tron – the networks that the stablecoin revolution live on. In theory, this exposure turns treasuries into miniature ecosystems, compounding value as the network scales.

Tron's listco, SRM, now Tron Inc after a rocky start, is showing how this is done. Nearly half of USDT activity lives on Tron, so if investors want a 'Visa moment' for USDT – especially in the most exciting markets for stablecoins like Latin America – Tron Inc is a DAT that fits this bill.

Still, that kind of on-chain exposure remains the exception, not the rule. Most DATs haven't figured out how to translate balance-sheet size into operational yield or network participation. They were supposed to be smarter than ETFs, capital-efficient, yield-bearing, and tied to the real economic flow of blockchains, but many remain little more than leveraged proxies for bitcoin beta.

Until more treasury firms can prove they can compound capital faster than a passive ETF, the simplest takeaway from the Hong Kong stage might remain the best one: just buy the ETF.

Oops, something went wrong

Two MIT-educated brothers went on trial Tuesday in Manhattan federal court for allegedly stealing $25 million in crypto in just 12 seconds. However, their defense claims it wasn't illegal for them to have outmaneuvered ""predatory"" trading bots.

Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno are alleged to have committed conspiracy, wire fraud, and money laundering. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years.

Federal prosecutors call their April 2023 maximal extractable value (MEV) exploit on the Ethereum blockchain a ""first-of-its-kind"" fraud scheme, while defense attorneys insist it was simply a smart strategy in an unregulated marketplace.

The trial may run into the first week of November as the brothers have rejected the plea deal.

Prosecutors allege the brothers ""meticulously planned"" the heist over at least three months, even Googling ""how to wash crypto"" and ""top crypto lawyers.""

The brothers have sought to exclude their Google search history, arguing the searches occurred during privileged attorney consultations after being ""threatened by anonymous sandwich attackers.""

The duo allegedly exploited a software flaw during the 12-second gap before trades were finalized, turning the victims' $25 million into “effectively worthless, illiquid junk crypto,” prosecutors said.

But defense attorney Patrick Looby, who represents the elder brother James, argues there's ""no central authority"" governing Ethereum and ""no government regulations.""

Brothers Seek to Block Google Search History in $25M Crypto Heist Case

""Instead, economic incentives guide parties' behavior,"" Looby told U.S. District Court Judge Jessica G.L. Clarke during oral arguments in June.

For fraud charges to stick, ""there needs to be a promise to the victim,"" he said. ""Here, there is no alleged communication at all between the Peraire-Buenos and the traders.""

The alleged victims lost their crypto ""through pre-programmed trades without ever interacting with the Peraire-Buenos, directly or indirectly,"" defense attorneys argued in a failed motion to dismiss the indictment.

""I think that deception is legally possible through code alone,"" Slava Demchuk, CEO of compliance firm AMLBot, told Decrypt. ""Plainly speaking, fraud does not require a direct victim contact or false statements, if the code is written or designed to mislead.""

Feds Arrest Crypto Bros for 'Attacking Ethereum' With MEV Exploit

""It is rather a gray area and it will be for the jury to assess,"" Demchuk added, acknowledging the unregulated crypto space complicates matters.

Niko Demchuk, head of legal at AMLBot, told Decrypt the search terms ""how to wash crypto"" and ""top crypto lawyers"" are ""circumstantial evidence of mens rea, suggesting the brothers knew their actions were illegal and planned to conceal proceeds.""

“The defense argues that the unregulated crypto context and lack of direct victim interaction undermine mens rea. Hence, the ball is in the jury's court,” he added.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

The Ethereum Foundation is expanding its DeFi-focused treasury management strategy with a fresh deployment of 2,400 ETH, worth some $9.6 million, and about $6 million worth of stablecoins, in a yield-bearing Morpho vault, according to an announcement on Wednesday.

""Morpho is a pioneer in permissionless DeFi protocols and consistently demonstrates a commitment to Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) principles,"" the foundation wrote on X, explaining that both Morpho Vault v2 and Morpho Blue v1 were released under an open GPL2.0 license.

Facing criticism earlier this year over its routine sales of ETH to fund its operations, the non-profit Ethereum Foundation announced a plan to move a portion of its treasury into DeFi protocols, beginning with 50,000 ETH.

The foundation has since moved millions worth of funds onto platforms like Compound, an OG lending protocol, and Spark, part of the Sky (formerly MakerDAO) ecosystem. That said, it also continues to sell crypto assets for fiat on centralized exchanges to fund blockchain research and development.

According to Arkham Intelligence, the Ethereum Foundation holds over $820 million worth of crypto assets, including $735 million worth of ETH, at current prices, according to The Block's ETH price page.

Founded in 2022, Morpho is a decentralized lending protocol on Ethereum that has become a popular institutional option. For instance, Coinbase recently surpassed $1 billion worth of bitcoin-backed onchain loan originations using Morpho, just eight months after the service launched.

Some $4.6 billion has been locked on Morpho Blue v1, a small fraction of the total Ethereum lending market, but in line with rivals like Compound, Spark, and older versions of Aave, according to The Block's data.

 Fantasy sports crypto platform Sorare is migrating from Ethereum to Solana, with its CEO saying it is a better fit for Sorare due to its scalability and focus on consumer applications. 

Nicolas Julia, CEO of fantasy sports crypto platform Sorare, said he remains confident in Ethereum even as the company prepares to migrate to Solana — a transition he has called an “upgrade.”

Last Thursday, Sorare announced that it would migrate from Ethereum after six years, capitalizing on Solana's scalability and consumer-focused user base. The company will move over 10 sports games and their trading cards to Solana. 

“It's not a replacement, it's an upgrade,” Sorare said at the time. Julia later explained to Cointelegraph that Solana is the most viable chain, as it leads the fantasy sports crypto vertical in revenue, daily active addresses, active developers and total value locked. While it is more centralized than Ethereum, the blockchain has prioritized scalability and security. 

“[Solana's] growing adoption shows that this bet was the right one,” Julia said, noting that it has covered a lot of ground on Ethereum, given it launched five years later.

The migration is expected to be complete by the end of this month.

Despite the migration, Julia said Sorare hasn't lost confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem.

“We remain very bullish on it,” Julia said, noting that it would continue supporting Ethereum users through an integration on the Base network and that it would still allow Ether (ETH) deposits.

Sorare, which has amassed 5 million users and was valued at $4.3 billion in October 2021, is one of several blue-chip crypto protocols that have made tough calls to migrate from the chain they launched on to keep growing.

Decentralized exchange aggregator 1inch and crypto indexing protocol The Graph are two other notable crypto applications that have transitioned from Ethereum to Solana in recent years.

Sorare is a fantasy sports platform primarily focused on football, but also features basketball and baseball, where users buy, sell, and trade officially licensed digital player cards as non-fungible tokens. They can create teams with these cards and compete in weekly tournaments, earning rewards based on real-world player performance.

Other competitors in the space include Flow, Chiliz and the Dapper Labs-backed NBA Top Shot. The DraftKings Marketplace was also prominent before it shut down in July 2024. 

The market cap for sports crypto tokens currently sits at $1.17 billion, a considerable fall from the 2021-2021 bull cycle, CoinGecko data shows.

Sorare NFTs have also struggled amid the broader NFT market downturn, with their floor price plunging from a peak of $91.25 in early April 2022 to $2.21 as of Oct. 12, DappRadar data shows.

Daily Sorare NFT sales have remained steady, with anywhere between 5,000 and 30,000 sales on most days — a similar level to that seen in 2022. 

Despite the migration, Julia said he is considering other high-speed chains that can help it scale Sorare's sports trading cards as far as possible.

Related: Investors target ‘fun-first' crypto games as funding jumps 94% in July

It is also integrating Layer0 to operate marketplace payments seamlessly across Solana and Base as part of its plan to become chain-agnostic and leverage the strengths of multiple ecosystems.

Julia said he isn't overly concerned about Sorare falling victim to a Solana network outage, noting that over the years, his team has become “well accustomed to working through the inevitable imperfections that come with blockchain infrastructure.”

“We've been more than reassured by the quality of Solana's technology, the team behind it, and the network's recent track record of stability,” Julia said.

He noted the network outages have become less frequent over time and are addressed swiftly, showing the Solana ecosystem's ability to improve at “remarkable speed.”

Quick Facts:

1️⃣ The TOTAL3 chart is mirroring the same bullish setup seen before the 2020-2021 altcoin boom.

2️⃣ The formation of an inverted head and shoulders pattern followed by a key liquidation candle signals that a major altcoin breakout could be imminent.

3️⃣ With the market primed for a strong run-up, some of the best altcoins to buy now include $SNORT, $MAXI, and $TROLL – all poised to benefit from the coming altcoin wave.

In the world of cryptocurrency, historical performance is a vital signal of what may lie ahead. Considering this, now is an excellent opportunity to invest in promising altcoins that could yield significant returns in the near future.

That's because the market is setting up perfectly for a generational bull run.

@el_crypto_prof, a crypto analyst with over 160K X followers, recently shared his analysis of the TOTAL3 chart, which tracks the combined market capitalization of all altcoins except Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins.

All we have to do is look back at what happened in 2020-2021, right before that massive 1,000% rally.

At that time, the TOTAL3 chart developed a perfect inverted head-and-shoulders pattern. It broke out of this pattern with significant momentum (indicated in yellow), then moved sideways for a couple of months (shown in orange). After that period, it printed a pivotal liquidation candle, which was followed by several large green candles over the next few months.

Everything is happening almost identically right now: we've got the break of the inverted head and shoulders pattern, we've got the post-breakout consolidation, and now, we've also got the liquidation candle.

A liquidation candle, simply put, is a candle with a long wick below – meaning it has eaten up all the short orders in the market. These could be stop losses of long positions or direct sell orders.

As for the TOTAL3 chart, we can arrive at the next potential target by measuring the distance from the head of the inverted head and shoulders pattern to its neckline.

This measurement provides a target of around $3.2T in total altcoin market cap, representing a massive 200% rally from current levels.

With a strong run-up on the cards, here are three top low-cap coins that could absolutely rip through the skies in the coming weeks.

Snorter Token ($SNORT) isn't just well-positioned to ride the upcoming altcoin boom – it could actually help fuel it.

That's because it powers a new Telegram-based trading bot designed to simplify sniping for meme coins by everyday traders.

Currently, retail participants find it incredibly challenging to capitalize on those initial meme coin pumps due to the unfair dominance of institutional players, who enjoy access to advanced trading tools and algorithms.

Snorter Bot, however, makes those same cutting-edge trading features accessible to everyone. It lets you place buy, sell, limit, or stop orders directly through simple Telegram chat commands.

Next, it automatically executes those orders the moment liquidity kicks in – all the while protecting you from common on-chain threats like front-running, rug pulls, honeypots, and sandwich attacks.



According to our $SNORT price prediction, the token could go absolutely bonkers after listing, potentially reaching $0.94 – a massive 750% upside – by the end of this year.

⚠️ Time's running out! The presale ends in less than 5 days. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to buy Snorter Token for just $0.1079.

What's more, holding $SNORT unlocks a range of exclusive benefits, including:

Join the $SNORT revolution today – and snipe meme coin pumps before the whales even blink.

Pure hype-driven meme coins like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) often turn out to be the biggest gainers during an altcoin boom.

With an outrageous mission and over $3.6M already raised in its presale, Maxi Doge has all the ingredients to become the next 1,000x crypto.

Don't mistake it for a wannabe Doge superstar – it's Dogecoin's actual cousin who's now out for revenge.

What's Maxi Doge's gripe with Dogecoin, you ask? Well, Maxi believes Dogecoin's popularity and fun-loving vibe hogged all the limelight growing up, leaving Maxi all by himself.

But instead of sulking over this unfairness, $MAXI decided to take matters into his own paws.

He hit the gym, bulked up on protein shakes and caffeine shots, and stared at the charts until he devised the perfect plan to overthrow Dogecoin.



Maxi's master plan? To become a top-trending crypto.

To achieve this, he has allocated a massive 40% of the total token supply for marketing, including influencer collaborations, PR campaigns, and aggressive social media promotion.

Right now, you can buy $MAXI for just $0.000263 each, and this might be the lowest price you'll ever find it at – our $MAXI price prediction suggests the token could soar 800% by the end of 2025.

Hop in on the next Dogecoin before it explodes – grab your $MAXI tokens today.

TROLL (SOL) ($TROLL) is one of the few Solana meme coins that not only didn't dump significantly on Friday but has also recouped whatever little it did lose that day.

The token is currently up nearly 40% over the past four days, trading around $0.1185.

Most notably, it's now challenging the upper resistance line of a major falling wedge pattern – a breakout from which could trigger a massive rally.



For the next potential price target, we can look at $TROLL's historical performance. Its breakout from a descending triangle pattern in July 2025 resulted in a massive 1,100% rally.

If something similar plays out this time – which it very well could for a strong, community-backed token like $TROLL – we could see it rise to new all-time highs around $1.75.

Sure, $TROLL has no underlying utility, mission, or intrinsic value – but its hilarious embodiment of the internet's wild ‘trolling' culture is precisely why it has gained so much traction since its launch.

Don't miss the madness – buy $TROLL on MEXC before the next big breakout!

The best altcoins to buy now are drawing new capital as Bitcoin reclaims momentum and market optimism returns. BTC is holding above $108,000 with bullish technicals, and traders are watching closely for a breakout that could trigger widespread altcoin inflows. 

In this climate, two altcoins are standing out. Bitcoin Hyper is rapidly gaining traction as a Layer 2 solution on Bitcoin's base layer, leveraging Solana's speed to introduce smart contract capabilities. 

At the same time, Maxi Doge is dominating the meme coin conversation with a bold 1000x leverage narrative and aggressive presale strategy. Both projects are surging ahead of their next pricing milestones.

Bitcoin's technical indicators suggest growing support for a bullish breakout. The price has held firm above $108,000, while the 200-day moving average and on-chain support at $104,772 form a strong base. RSI sits at 40.6, indicating mild oversold conditions. 

At the same time, the MACD histogram has begun flattening, signaling a possible end to recent bearish momentum. If BTC can breach the $117,000 level, analysts expect a swift move toward the $124,000 to $126,000 zone – a range that marked June's high.



Still, macro conditions support upside. Inflation is below 3%, the labor market is weakening, and productivity reforms are expected in 2026. These factors are leading investors to anticipate a dovish pivot by the Fed, which has historically supported crypto rallies. 

On-chain metrics back this sentiment. Bitcoin's Trader's Realized Price is now near $116,000. Holding above this level would historically place BTC in the “bull phase” of its cycle, potentially pushing the asset toward the $160,000 to $200,000 band by year-end.

As the Bitcoin ecosystem looks to scale, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as one of the best altcoins to buy now. It introduces Layer 2 functionality using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) – bringing fast payments, smart contracts, and dApp capabilities to Bitcoin's base chain. 

With BTC lacking native programmability and scalability, Hyper offers a modular solution that bridges two dominant networks: Bitcoin and Solana.



So far, Bitcoin Hyper has raised over $23.6 million in its presale. The current token price is $0.013115, and nearly all of this phase's allocation is filled. Its roadmap includes audited security, a decentralized app layer, and long-term treasury funding. 

Analysts at Cryptonews have projected a launch value of $0.0583, marking a potential 345% increase post-launch. If the project achieves wider adoption as a Bitcoin Layer 2 hub, more aggressive models place its value closer to $0.1557 – over 12x from the current presale price.

As altcoin attention shifts toward real infrastructure plays, Hyper continues to rise on shortlists of the best altcoins to buy now.

 Buy Bitcoin Hyper Here

While Hyper focuses on speed and utility, Maxi Doge is approaching the market from a very different angle. 

The project is framed around a buffed-up doge mascot that lifts weights and trades with 1000x leverage, targeting high-risk meme investors who previously drove coins like Dogecoin and Pepe to billion-dollar valuations.



The presale currently sits at $0.000263, just above its launch price of $0.00025. More than $3.6 million has been raised so far. Maxi Doge's tokenomics are structured across 50 pricing stages, with the final presale stage reaching $0.0002745. 

It joins Bitcoin Hyper as one of the few presale coins currently listed among the best altcoins to buy now, especially as the meme sector gains renewed attention.

 Buy MaxiDoge Here

Beyond price action, broader market sentiment is turning. With inflation cooling and the Fed likely to ease, risk assets are again in favor. At the same time, the 21Shares DOGE ETF has appeared on the DTCC list, signaling growing institutional acceptance of meme coins and altcoin assets.

Dogecoin has bounced back from $0.14, returning to a $0.20+ range. The MACD histogram is turning positive, and RSI is still under 45, suggesting upside remains. 



In that context, Bitcoin Hyper and Maxi Doge represent two distinct but timely opportunities. One brings real scalability to the Bitcoin network. The other captures attention in the meme sector with a sharp brand and structured roadmap. 

With BTC's price pushing toward a breakout and capital flowing back into smaller caps, these are the projects now leading the conversation around the best altcoins to buy now.

Indian telecom giant Reliance Jio is partnering with Aptos Foundation and Aptos Labs to bring blockchain-based rewards to its more than 500 million customers.

Jio, the country's largest mobile network operator, plans to integrate Aptos' layer-1 blockchain to distribute digital rewards through its telecom services. The move was announced by the company's general manager and business head, Pawas Chandra, at the “Aptos Experience” event.

Aptos is known for its high-speed, low-cost infrastructure, which is designed to handle heavy transaction loads, a necessary feature for operating at Jio's massive scale. Per Chandra, the blockchain-based rewards are now in a beta testing phase, and “about” 9.4 million users are experimenting with them.

The companies said the system will focus on real-world utility, not speculation. The goal, according to the announcement, is to integrate blockchain into the practical aspects of daily digital life.

Aptos Labs will provide the technical support needed to build and manage the platform.

Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ:BITF) is now causing ripples both in the blockchain and AI sectors. 

Following a 500% surge in five weeks, the firm refinanced a debt facility with Macquarie Group into $300 million project financing for its Panther Creek data center in Pennsylvania, marking a strategic shift from crypto mining to high-performance computing (HPC) and AI infrastructure. 

The initiative is an attention grabber among ETF investors as thematic funds following blockchain and AI experience a rare overlap in one firm.

For ETF investors, Bitfarms — previously best known as a Bitcoin miner cashing in on the cryptocurrency bubble — is now a compelling case study. Historically, the company fits into blockchain-themed ETFs which aim at crypto miners and digital ledger innovators. However, BITF's recent actions place these funds at crossroads, as the company is no longer simply mining Bitcoin.

On the contrary, AI-related ETFs such as the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ) and Roundhill Generative AI ETF (NYSE:CHAT) can now indirectly invest in Bitfarms' changing business. Investors in these ETFs can ride the upside of a company utilizing existing data center infrastructure to get into the red-hot AI business.

CEO Ben Gagnon said this $300 million worth of project finance provides the company with quicker access to capital as it transitioned to HPC and AI workloads.

Joshua Stevens, Macquarie's managing director, emphasized the state of Pennsylvania's strong energy and fiber base, describing it as an emerging AI hub, while a change of leadership in the finance department indicates the company's intent on this new direction.

Bitfarms' makeover spotlights an ETF manager's peculiar dilemma. Blockchain ETFs may need to reconsider their definition of inclusion, striking a balance between exposure to legacy crypto mining and hybrid approaches that combine mining and AI infrastructure. By contrast, AI ETFs could benefit from this indirect exposure, establishing a foothold in a company that combines compute-intensive workloads with blockchain expertise.

For investors, this would mean exposure to the growth of AI unintentionally through holding a blockchain ETF, while holders of AI ETFs would receive the reward of digital infrastructure initially developed for mining, a cross-over that is very unusual among thematic funds.

Bitfarms' turn is a trial run for thematic ETF agility. As companies balance multiple edges of innovation, ETFs with the capacity to modify screening and sector definitions could ride the next wave of cross-industry expansion.

ByJeff Kauflin,

Forbes Staff.

Ascrypto receives a warm embrace in Washington and token prices rise to new levels, some once-hot digital asset sectors like NFTs continue to languish. Few firms have suffered the brunt of NFTs' collapse more than NFT specialist OpenSea.

Starting in mid-2022, the market for digital art represented by these unique, nonfungible tokens–from CryptoPunks to Bored Apes—experienced a spectacular fall, declining by more than 80%. By October 2023, OpenSea, the once-dominant venue for buying and selling NFTs, was bringing in just $3 million in monthly revenue, down from a peak of $125 million in January 2022, the same month the startup was valued at $13.3 billion, briefly turning its cofounders into billionaires.

It wasn't just that people had lost interest in NFTs. OpenSea had also been abruptly overtaken by an upstart competitor, Blur, which charged zero trading fees and didn't require buyers to pay royalties to NFT creators. When OpenSea responded by loosening its own royalty policy, it drew the ire of its customers on Twitter, who said everything from “you people are foul” to characterizing it as “evil” and “a joke of a company.”

As OpenSea was hemorrhaging cash and struggling for market share, cofounder and CEO Devin Finzer rented an Airbnb in Los Angeles and held a company meeting for 175 staffers on payroll. He told employees that the company needed a reset and that he would be firing more than half of them. His goal: to emerge again as a smaller, nimbler startup. Finzer then offered severance packages to anyone who hadn't been laid off but also wanted out.

“What was really tough was that a lot more people than I expected–some really good people–took that package,” he says today, looking downward, voice groggy, likely from his seven-day-a-week work schedule. CEO Finzer now operates often from a WeWork-like co-working space in downtown Manhattan. About six other New York area employees are office regulars, but nearly all of OpenSea's 60 employees and 10 contractors today work remotely.

After trudging through a three-year bear market for digital art NFTs that may never bounce back, OpenSea is pivoting hard. Taking advantage of its customer base, which had swelled to millions of monthly website visitors, the battle-worn startup has expanded from NFTs to become a one-stop shop for trading all cryptocurrencies across 22 different blockchains. This shift means OpenSea can cash in on the memecoin craze, too.

Finzer, 34, credits his wife Yu-Chi Lyra Kuo with having the idea to turn OpenSea into a trade-any-crypto application. Kuo is an early cryptocurrency investor who pursued a PhD in philosophy and politics at Princeton, earned a Harvard Law degree and in 2016 left academia to run a crypto trading fund. In 2021, Kuo met Finzer and gave up running the trading fund. “I really consider her a silent cofounder of OpenSea 2.0,” says Finzer. Kuo doesn't have an official role at the company, but like many CEOs' partners, she has had an outsize impact on its direction.

OpenSea's new focus is already showing real traction. In the first two weeks of October 2025, it facilitated $1.6 billion in cryptocurrency trades and $230 million in NFT transactions, up from $142 million in total volume in all of May. The surge will make October 2025 its biggest month in over three years. Under OpenSea's new gameplan, it aggregates buy and sell orders from decentralized crypto exchanges like Uniswap and Meteora. In terms of fees, OpenSea takes about 0.9% for every transaction, accounting for $16 million in revenue over the last two weeks.

Have a story tip? Contact Jeff Kauflin at jkauflin@forbes.com or on Signal at jeff.273.

Finzer's new focus for OpenSea employs an age-old trader axiom, “Don't fight the tape.” As the soaring price of bitcoin makes headlines, crypto goes mainstream and prediction markets gain in popularity, “risk on” is the new mantra for investors. One only needs to look at Robinhood's 400% one-year stock return and exploding volume at prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket as evidence. Even though slumping market values for NFTs like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, whose average floor price has fallen from around $400,000 at its peak to $32,000 today, have burned many investors, a new crop of speculators remains undeterred. For the past two years, memecoins have been the industry's biggest obsession. “You can't fight the macro trend,” Finzer says, so you might as well embrace it.

Finzer thinks letting people trade any and all cryptocurrencies is the “right one for crypto right now” due to high demand. In this respect, he has taken a lesson from his biggest rival Blur, a company that burst onto the NFT scene three years ago with a trader-centric approach that helped it gobble up most of the NFT trading market.

His run-in with Blur also taught him something about leadership. After Blur made trading fee-free and royalty-free, Finzer responded with a series of flip-flopping fee changes that wavered between minimizing and maximizing royalties for digital creators. He was trying to please too many people, and his reactive, consensus-driven approach wasn't working. Finzer learned to stop giving in to pressure from others and trust his own instincts. “For some of these things, the only way you get better is by having the thing happen and failing your way through it,” Finzer says.

Looking back on the past two years, Finzer and former OpenSea chief technology officer Nadav Hollander say the deep layoffs were essential. They flattened the startup's structure and removed all technical managers so that every engineer wrote code. Finzer has also come to reject the conventional Silicon Valley wisdom of hiring rapidly to keep pace with soaring customer demand. He now tries to keep the company as small as possible, an approach that has become in vogue in the AI era.

Meanwhile, Blur seems to be missing in action. Its trading volume has dwindled to $92 million over the past month, down from more than $1 billion in early 2023, according to DappRadar. Its corporate X account and that of cofounder and CEO Tieshun Roquerre have been mysteriously quiet since last spring. Roquerre didn't respond to Forbes' emails or Telegram messages requesting an interview. “In crypto, some people are there to get in and get out,” says Finzer.

Crypto trading applications are everywhere–thousands already exist. Yet even though today's most popular blockchains have been around for over a decade, no company has cracked the code on making it easy to trade the millions of tokens that reside on different blockchains and store the assets yourself (or in crypto parlance, self-custody).

While Coinbase makes 300 tokens available to trade through its centralized exchange primary service, that selection represents a tiny fraction of all the tokens in existence. And like a traditional bank, Coinbase stores customers' assets for them. Everyday Americans typically don't think twice about that since they're accustomed to using banks, but it's deeply troubling to cryptocurrency die-hards who believe in completely owning and controlling their crypto at all times. Just ask anyone who had money on crypto exchange FTX when it collapsed. (More recently, Coinbase has started making many more tokens available to trade through its Base service, which lets people self-custody their assets and trade on decentralized exchanges.)

Finzer says OpenSea's bridging feature of letting people trade across 22 blockchains is its most attractive, since there are still few places where that's easy to do. The challenges of achieving this are manifold–to do it well, a company needs to: index an ever-expanding list of tokens across an ever-expanding set of blockchain operating systems; get customers the best possible price for any given trade; make the application easy to use; create a user interface where people can discover new assets; prevent customers from getting scammed.

OpenSea built a booming business years ago by making NFTs simple for anyone to purchase, and it's trying to do the same with all token trading. Finzer's goal is to make the user's experience as intuitive as it is on an app like Coinbase or Robinhood, while under the hood, aggregating people's buy and sell orders from the places where more sophisticated, tech-savvy crypto traders congregate like Uniswap.

One way he tries to do this is by opting not to do know-your-customer (KYC) checks to verify a user's identity. These checks are an important step required for banks and financial institutions to prevent money laundering and transfers from people in sanctioned countries. Finzer says OpenSea, which has moved its corporate headquarters to Miami, isn't legally required to do KYC checks, since it's not considered a U.S. money transmitter and never takes custody of customers' assets. He adds that OpenSea uses blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs to check digital wallets against lists of sanctioned addresses and flag any suspicious transactions for money laundering.

But this compliance-light approach could easily present future risks, not only of money launderers and sanctioned-country senders slipping through the cracks, but also of future U.S. administrations bringing regulatory enforcement actions against OpenSea. Under President Biden, the Securities and Exchange Commission opened investigations into whether OpenSea and decentralized exchange Uniswap were running unlicensed securities exchanges. Both companies denied that they were violating the law, and the Trump Administration dropped those investigations this past February.

OpenSea's new trade-everything strategy also means Finzer is trying to straddle the distant worlds of art and pure financial speculation, a balance that seems impossible. He says he doesn't want to build a “soulless financial app,” but when you visit the “Tokens” section of the site, it feels like a gambling-centric financial app.

The CEO thinks the art-focused NFT market, memecoins and all other crypto tokens can “harmoniously live together” in one place on OpenSea. He says the company is only “a fraction of the way” to its vision of a venue for trading all tokens and notes that it hasn't even launched a new mobile app yet. OpenSea is expected to release its own cryptocurrency soon, following in the footsteps of rival crypto trading apps, though Finzer declined to give details.

Outside of potential regulatory issues, OpenSea may face significant competitive challenges since the barriers to entry in crypto trading are low. In fact, globally there are hundreds of crypto exchanges. “We've found there's a lot of moat in just consistently delivering on a quality product experience–building out a brand that's trusted and works as users want it to work,” says Finzer. The history of crypto, and the eight-year history of his own startup, tells a different story.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

MegaETH, an Ethereum-compatible ‘real-time' blockchain, appears to be planning an initial coin offering (ICO). 

This potential public token sale would take place on Sonar, a self-hosted token launch platform created by crypto investor Jordan “Cobie” Fish, who is also a co-founder of Lido. “The First Real-Time Blockchain. Built for you. Owned by you. Register now,” MegaETH's team shared on X earlier today. 

ICOs – which are a way for crypto projects to raise funds – are making a comeback in 2025, with MegaETH's move showing a shift toward community-focused, transparent sales to drive user engagement and ecosystem growth.

According to the project's website, the registration window is open from today to Oct. 27. While MegaETH says details of a “potential crypto-asset offering” will be announced soon, it emphasized that registration does not guarantee allocation or constitute a sale. No terms of the potential deal have been disclosed.

Registration is open to anyone who completes identity verification on the Sonar platform, excluding MegaETH employees and users from prohibited areas. Individuals from the U.S. must also meet accredited investor requirements and will be subject to a 12-month lockup, MegaETH's website notes. 

Earlier this year, MegaETH announced plans to distribute its tokens through a new ICO model built around a soulbound NFT mint for its pioneer collection, The Fluffle. MegaETH said the NFT model was chosen to reward genuine community participation rather than speculative farming, The Defiant previously reported. 

“A simple points program tied to an airdrop often creates perverse incentives—especially when deployed by a blockchain—driving inauthentic behavior and ‘farming,' which raises questions about real value creation and leaves everyone dissatisfied,” the announcement noted.

This latest announcement also follows MegaETH Labs' recent launch of MegaUSD (USDm), a native stablecoin developed in collaboration with Ethena Labs using its Stablecoin-as-a-Service stack.

“$USDM aligns incentives across stakeholders, letting users and apps enjoy the lowest fees possible while routing scalable value back to MegaETH,” MegaETH said in a post on X on Sept. 8.

MegaETH initially raised $10 million through Echo in December 2024.

Capita has been fined £14m for its failure to secure personal data, which led to millions of people's information being stolen after a Black Basta ransomware cyber attack in March 2023.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which imposed the fine, said six million people had been affected by the data breach, with the information stolen including pension and staff records and details of Capita's customers.

The cost of the breach to Capita could rise because thousands of affected individuals are involved in legal action against the outsourcing services provider.

The cyber attack was subsequently claimed by the Black Basta ransomware crew, which listed Capita on its dark web leak site and published documents that appeared to have been stolen from its systems, including client information.

The incident caused major IT outages and had a significant impact on customer-facing services at many public sector bodies and some operators of critical national infrastructure across the UK, with staff left unable to take calls from members of the public and others falling back on traditional pen and paper. A total of 325 organisations, which are customers of Capita, were impacted by the data breach, said the ICO.

The ICO fined Capita plc £8m and Capita Pension Solutions £6m for failing to ensure the security of processing of personal data, which left it at significant risk. It added that the company did not have the “appropriate technical and organisational measures” to respond effectively.

UK information commissioner John Edwards said: “Capita failed in its duty to protect the data entrusted to it by millions of people. The scale of this breach and its impact could have been prevented had sufficient security measures been in place.

“When a company of Capita's size falls short, the consequences can be significant. Not only for those whose data is compromised – many of whom have told us of the anxiety and stress they have suffered – but for wider trust amongst the public and for our future prosperity. As our fine shows, no organisation is too big to ignore its responsibilities.”

The ICO initially planned to fine Capita £45m, but the fine was reduced after the business submitted representations and mitigating factors, including improvements it made following the attack, support offered to affected individuals and engagement with other regulators.

The attack began when a malicious file was unintentionally downloaded onto an employee's device. Capita's failure to quarantine the device for 58 hours meant the attacker was able to exploit its systems.

Adolfo Hernandez, CEO at Capita said: “When I joined as CEO the year after the attack I accelerated our cyber security transformation, with new digital and technology leadership and significant investment. As a result, we have hugely strengthened our cybersecurity posture, built in advanced protections and embedded a culture of continuous vigilance.""

“Following an extended period of dialogue with the ICO over the last two years, we are pleased to have concluded this matter and reach today's settlement.”

Adnan Malik, head of data protection at Barings Law, which is undertaking legal action on behalf of thousands of affected individuals against Capita, said the ICO fine represents less than 1% of Capita's annual revenue, which last year exceeded £2bn.

“It does little to set right the harms caused by the firm's inadequate cyber security procedures, which led to the loss of highly sensitive data, including benefits and pension records,” added Malik.

The ICO fine is separate to Barings Law's legal action against Capita, and changes nothing about its ongoing claim,” added Malik. “If anything, we would expect that this will mean our case progresses more quickly.”

He said there are increasing data breaches against major firms, which are incredibly damaging to people's finances, privacy and trust. “This fine, and mounting legal proceedings, should be a wake-up call to any firm still playing fast and loose with its customers' data.”

 Capita, the United Kingdom's largest outsourcing company, was on Wednesday fined £14 million ($18.7 million) over security failings that saw attackers compromise the personal information of 6.6 million people in a ransomware attack in 2023. 

 The voluntary settlement is for less than a third of the £45 million ($60 million) Britain's data protection regulator had initially intended to impose, but remains the largest fine the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has ever issued in a ransomware case. 

 Despite Capita initially stating there was “no evidence of customer, supplier or colleague data having been compromised,” the company and its pensions subsidiary were found to have exposed data about the  pensions it handles, Capita's own staff and customers from other organizations Capita supports. 

 The compromised data included names, addresses and dates of birth, as well as financial information such as credit and debit card numbers and CVVs. The ICO said it received complaints from people who were concerned money had been stolen from their accounts as the result of the data breach. 

 “Capita failed in its duty to protect the data entrusted to it by millions of people. The scale of this breach and its impact could have been prevented had sufficient security measures been in place,” stated John Edwards, the Information Commissioner. 

 Following media reports that staff were locked out of their accounts, Capita confirmed a cyberattack had taken place on April 3, 2023. It issued a statement to the governmental Regulatory News Service stating that “immediate steps were taken to successfully isolate and contain the issue.”  

 This claim appears to contrast with the ICO's findings. According to the regulator's monetary penalty notice, after a malicious JavaScript file was downloaded onto an employee device on March 22, 2023 the compromised device was not quarantined for 58 hours, ultimately allowing the attackers to further access the company's network and deploy ransomware. 

 The ICO said Capita had provided contradictory information about how quickly it had responded to the initial access. It is a crime under British financial laws, in particular Section 89 of the Financial Services and Markets Act, to publish misleading statements to the market. No regulators have made such a finding in Capita's case. 

 A spokesperson for Capita told Recorded Future News: “We did take some immediate steps to contain the issue, as has been acknowledged by the ICO. We do not believe we are in breach of Section 89 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.” 

 After the initial compromise, the threat actor downloaded the Qakbot malware and the Cobalt Strike intrusion tool onto Capita's systems. Around 29 hours after the initial access, Capita's security platform McAfee/Trellix identified Qakbot recovering and decrypting usernames and passwords from compromised devices' browsers.  

 The malicious JavaScript file had generated a “Priority 2” alert in Capita's endpoint detection and response (EDR) software. The ICO found that a properly configured EDR tool should have upgraded the threat to “Priority 1” after detecting the Qakbot and Cobalt Strike infection. 

 Capita then manually took three separate devices offline on March 28 after noticing suspicious activity. The ICO listed a range of security failings, including an understaffed Security Operations Centre (SOC), which usually only had only one analyst on per shift; and the lack of automated response and decent escalation protocols. 

 Over the next two days, the attackers exfiltrated nearly a terabyte of data before deploying ransomware onto Capita's systems and resetting all user passwords in the early hours of March 31. 

 The ICO noted that Capita claimed both that the exfiltrated data was “an in an unstructured and unusable format,” meaning the attacker would not have been able to exploit it, and that the company had been “the target of a state sponsored attack” which the ICO noted would, if correct, have meant the perpetrator had “significant resources at their disposal to examine and extract usable data.” 

 The attack was ultimately claimed by the Black Basta ransomware group, which posted what it alleged were documents stolen from Capita's internal systems. The listing subsequently disappeared from Black Basta's extortion site, a move that often indicates an extortion fee has been paid or is being negotiated. Capita has not commented on whether it made such a payment. 

 “When a company of Capita's size falls short, the consequences can be significant,” said Edwards. “Not only for those whose data is compromised — many of whom have told us of the anxiety and stress they have suffered — but for wider trust amongst the public and for our future prosperity. As our fine shows, no organisation is too big to ignore its responsibilities.” 

 In a statement on Wednesday, Capita's chief executive said: “Following an extended period of dialogue with the ICO over the last two years, we are pleased to have concluded this matter and reach today's settlement.”

 perspective

It's always all about the money, and never more so than when talking about cryptocurrencies. They're touted as being about liberation, but really they're about taking our revenues and redistributing them to billionaires.

Governments have sought to control money distribution ever since there have been governments. There are entire Anglo-Saxon kings (shout out to King Æthelweard) whose names we know only because of coins dug up centuries later by metal detectorists.

The Sunday Read



It would be nice to think this was because rulers were concerned about spreading prosperity by ensuring a reliable currency, and I'm sure that's partly true. But the underlying reason has always been that coining/printing money is incredibly profitable. In very crude (and slightly misleading) terms: printing a $100 bill costs around 10 cents; it sells for $100; so that's $99.90 in profit for the government right there.

Anyway, this was always one of the (if not the only?) interesting things about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin: by taking the power to issue money away from countries, governments would lose the ability to profit from our need for a means of distribution and exchange, and citizens would gain it for themselves. So it's not surprising that governments want to stop that happening.

Last week, Uganda became the latest country to launch a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), which will use the same kind of blockchain technology that underpins Bitcoin to create a mobile-first version of the country's shilling, and thus attempt to negate the appeal of crypto. Perhaps more importantly India, which leads the world in crypto adoption according to some measures, plans to do the same. 

“This will only make it easier to transact. It will also reduce paper consumption and will be faster to transact than the banking system. But it will also have traceability,” said the Indian Commerce and Industry Minister.

For most people in Western countries, the replacement of cash money by CBDCs would make very little difference because the vast majority of transactions are done electronically already; but for criminals, it would be disastrous. Accustomed to being able to use cash in huge quantities to hide their transactions, cartels, traffickers and others would have to invent new ways to find anonymity. (Inevitably, they'll find it, but it will be more expensive, thus making their crimes less profitable.)

The European Central Bank is moving forward with its own plans to introduce a digital euro, and Piero Cipollone, a member of the ECB's executive board, gave this fascinating interview last week about what that would look like (I think what he's describing looks really good, for what it's worth). A key insight is that, as electronic payment methods have spread, Europeans have become ever-more reliant on foreigners for processing transactions. “It … makes us vulnerable: we depend on others for our money and this can be weaponised against us. Ten years ago we weren't facing this problem, because cash was king,” he said.

He called the payment processors that dominate transactions “international”, but in reality they're American. Which brings us to a really interesting exception to the general global movement towards CBDCs: in the U.S., President Donald Trump has ruled the idea out completely, because it would “threaten the stability of the financial system, individual privacy, and the sovereignty of the United States”.

I think concerns about CBDCs' impact on privacy are very overstated, considering most of us are already giving away ample data about our financial lives to banks, Apple, Paypal, and whomever, for them to do with what they wish, and it is particularly odd that the White House is stopping the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar on privacy grounds while encouraging private companies to do so in the form of stablecoins like Tether's USDT.

“The difference between a CBDC and a stablecoin like USDT is simple,” said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino last week. “One belongs to the people. The other belongs to the state.”

That is obviously nonsense. Leaving aside the facile distinction between “people” and “state”, the idea that a digital dollar run by a democratically-overseen Central Bank like the Federal Reserve would somehow be less of the people than one run by a private company based in a foreign country whose president boasts of being a dictator (as El Salvador's Nayib Bukele has done) is so idiotic it makes my brain hurt.

As so often with Donald Trump's White House, this is all about the money and who gets it. The profits from issuing currency are called seigniorage, an old French term meaning that which belongs to the seignior or lord. By getting the Fed out of the CBDC business, and instead encouraging private companies to issue stablecoins, the White House is just redirecting seigniorage from the budget towards political allies, such as Trump's own children. To be honest, I'm sure good old King Æthelweard did the same thing back in ninth century England, but you would have hoped that, 1,200 years later, we might have moved on a bit.

How much money are we talking about? Well, at the end of the month we'll learn how much Tether made in profit in the third quarter. My money is on it exceeding its already record-breaking $4.9 billion haul from Q2. Its smaller rival Circle meanwhile is predicted to make revenues of more than $6 billion a year by 2028. Any Americans reading this: if the Federal Reserve had issued a CBDC instead of letting private companies do it, that money would be yours for spending on public services. Instead it's being routed into right-wing media, political donations and the pockets of well-connected billionaires.

Nigel Farage, the leader of political party Reform UK – currently riding high in opinion polls – has told an event audience that he wants to “bring crypto in from the cold” and put an immediate halt to work on a potential UK central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Farage – a former Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1999 until the UK's withdrawal from the European Union (EU) in 2020, a move he campaigned for – is one of the best-known figures in British politics. Reform UK has just five members of Parliament but has recently consistently polled above the ruling Labour Party and opposition Conservatives, leading to growing talk of Farage as a potential prime minister.

Farage took part in a fireside chat on the opening day of the ‘Digital Asset Summit 2025', an event organised in London on 13-15 October by US-based financial media, research and events firm Blockworks. During a 30-minute conversation he highlighted some the promises made in a ‘Cryptoassets and Digital Finance Bill' (or, in its own words, ‘statement of intent') published by Reform in May that set out a ‘post-Brexit roadmap to make the United Kingdom the world's premier hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation.'

“I was in the European Parliament for over 20 years but I don't regard myself as a politician,” he told the audience, ahead of positively answering the opening question as to whether he believed he was the UK's next prime minister. Farage began his career as a commodities trader in the City. “I still regard myself much more as a businessman who's in politics because things need fixing,” he said.

Duirng the discussion he went on to slam “over-regulation” in the City and tell digital asset industry representatives in the audience that “I am your champion.”

Reform's seven-page ‘bill' included a plan for HM Treasury to create and manage a ‘Bitcoin Reserve Fund' as part of the UK's official reserves. This is following the example of the US, where president Donald Trump signed an executive order in March to create a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve' and ‘Digital Asset Stockpile'.

The document also specified ‘Rapid Policy-Making Timelines', stating that ‘any government taskforce or commission on crypto is limited to 90 days (extendable by 30 days only with parliamentary approval) to prevent bureaucratic drift and keep the UK well ahead of slow EU processes.'

“We're [the UK] losing reinsurance businesses off to Bermuda, etc, and this whole area of digital assets and crypto just isn't being talked about at all,” Farage said at the Blockworks event.  

“I was the first prominent person in British politics to adopt crypto, to talk about crypto, to try and legitimise crypto, which was in 2020,” he said. “One of the reasons I'm here today [at the conference] is my deep frustration that despite one speech by [former Conservative PM] Rishi Sunak in this space, the Conservatives [and] the Labour Party have done nothing in this area.”

Referring to Reform's stated plans, he said: “If we win the next general election, will put [it] into law very, very quickly, and we will effectively bring crypto in from the cold.”

The Labour government was elected in July 2024 in a landslide win that ended 14 years of Conservative rule. In March this year PM Sir Keir Starmer in spoke of planned ‘fundamental reform of the British state', saying that politicians had for years “hid[den] behind a vast array of quangos, arms-length bodies and regulators… a sort of cottage industry of checkers and blockers.”

Farage wants “appropriate” regulation.

“When I started [working in the City], you could put a brass plaque outside your front door and say ‘commodity broker' and there were a few cowboys around,” he said. “I think a degree of regulation that gives consumers confidence is what you need. By the time I left the City in 2004, I saw compliance departments getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger, and, effectively, their job was to stop you doing business, to stop you innovating. So over-regulation is a curse.”

“I saw it [regulation] go massively over the top,” he continued. “A lot of that was because we were in the globalist European Union, which is the most heavily regulated marketplace on Earth – which is why it's going down the tubes, frankly. “

“So, yes, I'm all for appropriate regulation,” he said. “But the next British government needs to deregulate: deregulate financial services, deregulate small business, deregulate entrepreneurship. And we have to get the tax burden right because, at the moment, the flight of capital, the flight of brains from this country is frankly disastrous.”

Farage was talking on stage to Blockworks co-founder Michael Ippolito in a session titled ‘The Future of Digital Assets in the UK'.

He criticised his fellow parliamentarians for a perceived lack of knowledge and interest in digital finance-related topics.

“If you had this conversation with 95 per cent of current regulators in the House of Commons or the House of Lords, you may as well be speaking Swahili to them. They don't know anything about the space – they don't want to know anything about the space,” he said.

He also aimed his fire at the Bank of England (BoE), criticising the central bank for a cautious stance over cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins.

“I remember when I came out publicly saying that, actually, people should hold crypto as part of their portfolio – and that was in 2020, when I said ‘look, this [crypto] is here to stay, it's a fascinating space',” he said. “I liked it because whilst I'd campaigned for national sovereignty [from the EU] for all those years, here is personal sovereignty… you've got your own money, you're in charge.”

The BoE is currently researching the possibilities for a potential British CBDC through a digital pound ‘design phase.'

Like Trump, who slammed a potential digital US dollar as a “dangerous threat to freedom”, Farage describing CBDCs as “the ultimate authoritarian nightmare.”

“If and when we win the next election, we will automatically shut down the CBDC project, make all those working on it say ‘very sorry, chaps – you're of work'. We will stop it overnight,” he said.

Last month the UK government announced plans to launch a digital ID scheme and make having digital ID mandatory for anyone for working in the UK.

Farage was similarly critical of this public sector initiative. “I'd rather go to prison that have digital ID and total state control over my life and over my money…. I'm going to fight this and we are going to win,” he said.

Cryptocurrencies are widely seen as having made it easier for criminals to launder money due to their high degree of anonymity.

The government is attempting to ramp up anti-money laundering (AML) through updated legislation such as the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023.

“We have excessive anti-money laundering rules,” Farage said. “The AML regs are a ‘sledgehammer to miss the nut'. For every 100 quid we're spending on regulation to seek money laundering, we're only getting a pound back the other way.”

Reform's cryptoassets and digital finance bill included an intention to allow taxes to be paid in cryptocurrencies. HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) ‘must build systems to accept Bitcoin (and other approved crypto) for tax liabilities, using HMRC-published GBP exchange rates at the time of payment,' the document stated, adding that ‘crypto collected can be converted into sterling or added to the Bitcoin Reserve Fund.'

The document also stated that the party had become the first UK political party ‘to be able to accept donations in Bitcoin, Ethereum, as well as other cryptocurrencies.'

BDC and Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC join forces to expand access to financing and advice, unlocking growth where it's often overlooked

PRINCE GEORGE, British Columbia and QUEBEC CITY and MONTREAL, Oct. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC and the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) today announced a $100M initiative to reach more business owners living in rural and remote areas. Leaders in their communities, rural entrepreneurs are an exceptionally active demographic, with an entrepreneurship rate standing at 17% in 2024, compared to 12% in urban areas. The financing envelope created by this new initiative is expected to generate up to $250 million in GDP over five years.

With their respective business centres and offices throughout the country, Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC and BDC have a complimentary footprint. A federal program administered by regional development agencies and Canada Economic Development, Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC operates 267 non-profit offices across Canada delivering small business loans, tools, training and events. BDC supports entrepreneurs with financing, advisory services and capital from 109 business centres across Canada and online at bdc.ca.

""This initiative aims to increase the support provided to the 520,000 entrepreneurs living in rural and remote areas who grow our economy”, said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions. ""It leverages the complementary strengths of both organizations-BDC's financing and advisory expertise and Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC's deep local presence across the country.”

""At BDC, we believe that every entrepreneur, no matter where they live, deserves a fair chance to grow their business. Rural and remote communities are full of bold, resilient business owners who often face more barriers and fewer resources”, said Isabelle Hudon, President and Chief Executive Officer of BDC. ""This initiative with Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC allows us to do what a development bank should: go where others don't, and build bridges where gaps exist. We're unlocking potential that's been overlooked for too long. We believe that's what our economy needs right now.”

""Joining forces with BDC to supercharge the opportunities and resources available to rural and remote entrepreneurs from coast-to-coast-to-coast is a powerful combination that will result in significant impact throughout the country for decades to come,"" said Troy Dungate, President of Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC. ""BDC is committing to investing $100M to bolster businesses that often face strong headwinds simply due to geography and the vast nature of our country. This commitment, combined with our boots-on-the-ground, grassroots knowledge is an intelligent way to ensure that this capital infusion is dispersed through loans to new and existing entrepreneurs that are ready to bring their business to the next level. Additionally, we know that many entrepreneurs in rural Canada are attracted to the work because of the desirable lifestyle it creates for their families. Working together, we expect this to make positive, meaningful change in the lives of individual Canadians and our country as a whole.”

This initiative with Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC builds on BDC's broader commitment to develop entrepreneurial potential in all its forms and to help grow the Canadian economy. Since launching our Community Banking initiative in November 2024, BDC teamed up with financial institutions and community lending partners that support underserved groups. By joining this network of trusted partners, Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC should help us reach even more business owners in rural and remote areas. It's about meeting entrepreneurs where they are and helping them grow.

This announcement comes just before Small Business Week, a national celebration of Canadian entrepreneurship that BDC has organized for more than 45 years. This year's theme is The economic revolution is here - get your business ready.

BDC and Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC are stepping up to help entrepreneurs in rural and remote communities-who are vital contributors to Canada's economy-have the resources they need to thrive.

A federal jury is set to hear opening statements in the case of two MIT-educated brothers accused of swiping $25 million in a 12-second cryptocurrency heist.

Anton Peraire-Bueno, 25, and James Peraire-Bueno, 29, will face a jury composed of college-educated individuals in Manhattan on Tuesday, Business Insider reported.

The opening statements on Tuesday are expected to describe how the Peraire-Bueno brothers carried out a complicated, multi-step transaction on the Ethereum blockchain to fraudulently obtain approximately $25 million worth of cryptocurrency from victim cryptocurrency traders.

The heist took months to plan and just 12 seconds to complete, the US Department of Justice said in a 2024 press release.

Prosecutors say that before the heist, the brothers Googled ""how to wash crypto,"" ""top crypto lawyers,"" ""fraudulent Ethereum addresses database,"" and ""money laundering statue [sic] of limitations.""

“These brothers allegedly committed a first-of-its-kind manipulation of the Ethereum blockchain by fraudulently gaining access to pending transactions, altering the movement of the electronic currency, and ultimately stealing $25 million in cryptocurrency from their victims,” said Special Agent in Charge Thomas Fattorusso of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) New York Field Office.

Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno are brothers who studied mathematics and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) – one of the world's most prestigious universities.

""Using the specialized skills developed during their education, as well as their expertise in cryptocurrency trading,"" the brothers ""exploited the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain,"" prosecutors said in a 19-page indictment last year, as reported by Business Insider.

They stand accused of wire fraud and money laundering, but have “strongly contested” the accusations.

Their attorney claims that they did not defraud crypto traders but merely outsmarted automated trading bots.

The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has granted conditional national bank status to Erebor Bank, a new tech-oriented bank seeking to rise into the gap left by the collapse of several such lenders in 2023, including Silicon Valley Bank.OCC chief Jonathan Gould said the Wednesday approval — the first new-bank charter in his tenure at the regulator — offers ""proof that the OCC under my leadership does not impose blanket barriers to banks that want to engage in digital asset activities.""Permissible digital asset activities, like any other legally permissible banking activity, have a place in the federal banking system if conducted in a safe and sound manner,"" Gould said in a statement.The firm, leaning into the tech world's love for names associated with the fiction of J.R.R. Tolkien, described itself in its charter application as a national bank that will ""operate as a banking organization providing traditional banking products, as well as virtual currency-related products and services."" The banking regulator's ""preliminary conditional approval"" is dependent on the new institution meeting ongoing requirements in a kind of probationary period. The agency's approval letter noted that Erebor will ""target its products and services to technology companies and ultra-high-net-worth individuals that utilize virtual currencies.""This year, as regulators appointed by crypto-boosting President Donald Trump reversed earlier government resistance to crypto-tied businesses, the U.S. banking agencies, which also includes the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., have sought to issue friendlier policy guidance for the industry. In 2021, Anchorage Digital had opened the movement of crypto-oriented banks into OCC chartering, and it stood alone in that category for years, but a number of digital assets firms have recently moved to seek federal banking charters in the U.S. The OCC is the only regulator who grants such charters at the national level.

A Digital Payment System for European Monetary Autonomy


Letter from America

                      Nicholas Creel


Nicholas Creel, Georgia College and State University, Milledgeville, GA, USA.

The European Union faces a critical juncture in monetary policy autonomy. As the United States weaponizes dollar dominance through sanctions and monetary policy decisions that prioritize domestic over global stability, European policymakers must consider alternatives that preserve monetary sovereignty while maintaining international financial integration. Moreover, the US fiscal position continues to deteriorate, increasing the possibility of a crisis-induced de-dollarization that would leave European economies vulnerable to financial instability and capital flight. The IMF's Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), combined with emerging payment technology, offer a pathway towards reduced dollar dependence without abandoning multilateral cooperation.

The EU's experience with sanctions demonstrates how US financial dominance constrains European policy autonomy. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the EU participated in removing major Russian banks from SWIFT, revealing both the power and limitations of dollar-centric payment systems. The Treasury Department's 2025 sanctions on the Iranian shadow banking networks that process large volumes of transactions through international financial systems highlight how alternative payment mechanisms are proliferating outside of Western oversight.

While Europe's inflation surge stemmed primarily from energy disruptions and structural factors following the invasion, the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary tightening in 2022-2023 compounded pressures on European economies despite divergent economic conditions, highlighting the costs of monetary subordination. European central banks also maintain substantial dollar reserve holdings, making them vulnerable to US policy decisions while limiting European monetary policy effectiveness. This concentration risk has prompted increased interest in monetary diversification among European policymakers, yet few concrete alternatives have emerged.

The European Union's digital euro project, currently in advanced preparation phases, provides unique infrastructure for implementing SDR-based international payments. Unlike national central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects focused solely on domestic objectives, the digital euro could serve as a cornerstone for broader international monetary innovation. The technical architecture already under development could accommodate SDR integration with minimal additional complexity. Digital euro smart contracts could automatically execute SDR-denominated international transactions while preserving familiar euro-denominated domestic operations. European businesses would continue operating in euros while benefiting from more stable international exchange rates through automatic SDR conversion mechanisms.

This approach builds on existing European digital finance initiatives. The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) creates comprehensive regulatory frameworks for digital currencies that could readily accommodate SDR-denominated stablecoins, demonstrating Europe's commitment to financial innovation and autonomy. The technological foundation exists through current CBDC development programs. Project mBridge, involving central banks from China, Hong Kong, Thailand, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, demonstrates multi-CBDC platform feasibility for cross-border transactions. The project successfully settled transactions worth over US $22 million, proving that central banks can establish direct payment corridors that bypass traditional dollar-dominated settlement systems.

European participation in SDR-based digital payment systems could leverage the Eurosystem's TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) infrastructure alongside emerging CBDC capabilities. Smart contracts would automate the conversion process: calculating real-time SDR exchange rates, converting payments via the SDR basket and executing instant settlement through participating CBDC networks. The IMF could provide real-time SDR valuations. Participating European central banks could establish digital currency interoperability protocols, building on frameworks already under consideration for international digital euro usage.

An SDR-based payment system addresses several European priorities simultaneously. First, it reduces vulnerability to US monetary policy. Second, it strengthens European financial autonomy without requiring a confrontational departure from existing institutions. Third, it provides European businesses with more predictable international exchange rates through basket-currency pricing.

SDR-based systems could provide more equitable access to efficient payment networks for smaller enterprises that are often disadvantaged by high international payment costs. Current international payments require multiple intermediaries, each imposing fees and delays. Direct CBDC-to-CBDC exchanges via SDR conversion could eliminate most intermediation costs while settling transactions instantly. The system would be invisible to most users, who would continue operating in euros while benefiting from enhanced exchange rate stability in international transactions.

European institutions are uniquely positioned to lead SDR-based payment system development. The ECB's technical capabilities, the European Investment Bank's project financing expertise and the European Commission's regulatory authority could coordinate implementation.

Initial participation might include European allies already concerned about dollar concentration risks. Additionally, the EU's Global Gateway infrastructure initiative could incorporate SDR-based payment mechanisms, demonstrating practical benefits while building network effects. Regulatory frameworks could build on existing MiCA provisions and proposed digital euro legislation. European countries would maintain supervisory authority over domestic CBDC systems while coordinating on international interoperability standards.

Critics might argue that such systems threaten existing transatlantic monetary cooperation or create new systemic risks. However, the proposed framework enhances stability by reducing dangerous concentration in any single currency. A SDR-based system offers neutral ground accommodating multiple monetary authorities. Technical risks are manageable through existing European regulatory frameworks and gradual implementation. The digital euro already addresses cybersecurity, operational resilience and regulatory compliance challenges.

Traditional monetary arrangements face unprecedented pressures while new technologies create opportunities for stability-enhancing innovations. European policymakers can either proactively shape this transition or react to changes imposed by others. An SDR-based digital payment system offers Europeans a pathway towards greater monetary autonomy while still preserving multilateral cooperation principles.

A gradual rollout alongside digital euro development would provide a practical timeline that allows for iterative refinement and growing political consensus. What remains is the political will to move from concept to implementation before external pressures ultimately force a less orderly transition. European leadership in international monetary innovation represents not just sound economic policy, but strategic preparation for an inevitably multipolar monetary future. In an era of mounting geopolitical tensions and technological disruption, proactive preparation for monetary system evolution provides essential foundations for continued European autonomy and prosperity.

Andrew Nusca is the editorial director of Brainstorm, Fortune's innovation-obsessed community and event series. He also authors Fortune Tech, Fortune's flagship tech newsletter.

Good morning. My old newsroom colleague Jack Clark, now a co-founder of high-flying AI startup Anthropic, recently shared some thoughts on artificial intelligence that I found enlightening.

“What we are dealing with is a real and mysterious creature, not a simple and predictable machine,” he wrote in an essay published Monday. “And like all the best fairytales, the creature is of our own creation.”





With AI showing ever more capability—and crucially, agency—Clark says he's both optimistic and “deeply afraid” of what that means for the future. But we humans have some work to do, too.





“We need to spend a bit less time talking about the specifics of the technology and trying to convince people of our particular views of how it might go wrong … and more time listening to people and understanding their concerns,” he wrote, adding: “The rest of the world, which will surely want—and deserves—a vote over this.” 





Hear, hear. Today's tech news below. —Andrew Nusca

The U.S. Department of Justice said Monday that it had made its largest forfeiture seizure in its history.

The take: About $15 billion worth of Bitcoin.

Prosecutors say the man who once held the crypto allegedly oversaw a massive fraud operation based in Cambodia.



(What kind of scam? “Pig butchering,” as it's known, wherein the perpetrators build trust with victims to convince them to “invest” and ultimately hand over their hard-earned crypto.)

The alleged pig butcher, Chen Zhi, is the founder and chairman of the Prince Group. He has been formally charged with wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy. 

His conglomerate has been labeled by the Treasury Department as “one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organizations” for allegedly trafficking hundreds of people and forcing them to work in its facilities.

The 37-year-old remains at large and faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted. —AN

Gather round, children, to remember a time when large language models were warm, upbeat…even funny.



It was a generation ago—18 whole months in the land of AI. But widespread concerns (read: lawsuits) about AI chatbots taking advantage of the mental health of some users led to a more defensive (read: boring) personality posture.

That will change in a few weeks, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says, when its ChatGPT will be updated to allow for more, well, spirited interactions.

“Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases,” he wrote in a social media post. “If you want your ChatGPT to respond in a very human-like way, or use a ton of emoji, or act like a friend, ChatGPT should do it.”

And what's more human than sex? Altman added that once OpenAI rolls out age-gating “more fully,” it will loosen its chatbot restrictions enough (in a rather Meta-like move) to allow for “erotica for verified adults.”

Oh, ChatGPT. You're making me blush. —AN



Use a Google Android device? Best listen up.

A new attack promises to quietly steal your sensitive data in under a minute.

Dubbed “Pixnapping,” the threat requires first downloading a malicious app. But that wayward app doesn't require system permissions to read the data that any other installed app displays on the screen, according to Ars Technica.

(Why the name? Because the attack involves capturing pixels on your display and mapping them to letters, numbers, or shapes.)

It's not hard to imagine what else can be stolen with such an attack: Text messages, emails, passwords, proprietary financial information. And because of Pixnapping's relative speed, even your two-factor authentication codes are at risk.



Though the vulnerability is certain, Google says it has yet to see it occur in the wild. The company partially fixed the issue with a September patch, but another, scheduled for December, is necessary to cover its full extent. —AN

—Walmart, OpenAI partner. Browse and purchase products from within ChatGPT. 

—Intel debuts AI chip. Its “Crescent Island” GPU is tailored for inference.

—Oura is now worth $11 billion, according to the smart ringmaker's latest fundraise.

—Microsoft ends Windows 10 support. Forty percent of Windows PCs still run on it.



—Spotify and Netflix partner. Select Spotify vodcasts come to the Hollywood streamer next year.

—Meta overhauls Instagram teen accounts. They now align with PG-13 movie ratings, it says.

—“Custom shoppable TV screensavers,” coming soon to a DirecTV near you.

Appoints Tyler Whitaker, Ethereum Ecosystem Contributor, to Advisory Board to Accelerate Decentralized AI Growth","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intellistake-technologies-corp-appoints-tyler-070100875.html","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 07:01:00 GMT","

Oops, something went wrong

VANCOUVER, BC, Oct. 15, 2025 /CNW/ - Intellistake Technologies Corp. (CSE: ISTK) (OTC: ISTKF) (FSE: E41) (""ISTK"" or the ""Company""), a technology company focused on decentralized artificial intelligence and digital currencies, is pleased to announce the appointment of Tyler Whitaker to its Advisory Board. With nearly a decade of experience spanning blockchain infrastructure development and institutional automation systems, Mr. Whitaker brings technical expertise to support the Company's validator operations and digital asset infrastructure.

Mr. Whitaker has been active in digital asset markets since 2016, beginning his career as an analyst focused on identifying and analyzing promising early-stage blockchain projects and emerging ecosystems. Over time, his expertise evolved to encompass technical development, where he built sophisticated automation tools that enabled institutional funds to set on-chain triggers and extract real-time insights across networks. As a contributor to the Ethereum ecosystem—the world's second-largest blockchain network and leading smart contract platform—Tyler also played an early role in supporting the incubation of Fantom, now known as Sonic.

His technical contributions demonstrate a rare blend of analytical insight and hands-on development capabilities, positioning him uniquely to identify infrastructure opportunities in the rapidly evolving intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Mr. Whitaker's specialized knowledge in creating systems that institutional investors can utilize aligns directly with Intellistake's mission to provide sophisticated digital asset access through regulated investment mechanisms.

""We are excited to welcome Tyler to Intellistake's Advisory Board, where his proven technical expertise and deep understanding of blockchain infrastructure will enhance our operational capabilities,"" said Jason Dussault, CEO of Intellistake Technologies Corp. ""Tyler's nearly decade-long experience in digital asset markets, combined with his hands-on development of automation tools that institutional funds actually deploy, provides guidance as we scale our validator operations and expand our AI-driven digital asset infrastructure. His early involvement with major blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum and Fantom demonstrates his ability to identify and support transformative technologies before they achieve mainstream adoption, which is exactly the strategic insight we need as we build the bridge between traditional finance and decentralized AI networks.""

The appointment of Mr. Whitaker reinforces Intellistake's commitment to assembling technical expertise as the Company advances its operations in the growing decentralized AI sector. His experience developing institutional-grade automation systems will be great in guiding the Company's technology development and validator operations as traditional investors increasingly seek regulated exposure to blockchain-based artificial intelligence infrastructure.

175-year-old French banking giant ODDO BHF, which manages over €150 billion ($173 billion) in assets, is entering the crypto space with the launch of a euro-backed stablecoin dubbed EUROD.

The token is set to be listed on Madrid-based crypto platform Bit2Me, one of the largest exchanges in the Spanish-speaking world that's backed by telecom giant Telefonica and other major institutions including banking giants Unicaja and BBVA.

EUROD, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk, is designed to be a compliant, low-volatility digital version of the euro. The firms said it meets requirements under the EU's new MiCA regulation and is aimed at both retail and institutional users.

Bit2Me, which saw Tether lead a €30 million ($35 million) investment round in it earlier this year, is positioning the listing as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto.

“The listing of ODDO BHF's euro stablecoin is another important step in Bit2Me's mission to offer trusted, regulated digital assets,” said Leif Ferreira, Bit2Me's CEO.

By pairing a euro-pegged digital asset with a regulated banking institution, ODDO BHF is betting on a growing demand for payment solutions that combine the stability of fiat with the convenience of blockchain rails.

While the stablecoin market is heavily dominated by U.S. dollar-backed tokens, major institutions have been venturing into EUR-backed stablecoins. Société Générale-FORGE (SG-FORGE) is one of those institutions, having issued a euro-backed stablecoin called EURCV$1.1626.

Last month, nine European banks including ING, Banca Sella, Dankse Bank, DekaBank, and CaixaBank joined forces to issue a MiCA-Compliant euro-backed stablecoin.

While the recent wave of tokenized stocks has mostly targeted offshore users, a new platform called SoloTex aims to bring equity tokens to U.S. retail traders in a compliant way.

Texture Capital, a U.S.-based broker-dealer registered with the SEC and FINRA, said it has received regulatory approval to launch SoloTex, a retail trading venue that lets investors buy tokenized versions of U.S. equities with stablecoins like USDC$1.0000. The platform, built in partnership with tokenization firm Sologenic, is expected to go live by the end of 2025.

In an interview with CoinDesk, Texture Capital CEO Richard Johnson and Sologenic CEO Mike McCluskey said that SoloTex aims to distinguish itself from competitors by offering real share ownership with the tokens. The platform issues the tokens only when the underlying stock is purchased and holds real shares in regulated custody under U.S. legal frameworks, in contrast to offshore, synthetic structures or exposure through special purpose vehicles (SPV).

""We believe this is a first for the U.S. market and it sets the stage for a new era of asset ownership through tokenization,"" McCluskey said.

Tokenization of traditional assets has drawn growing interest from major financial firms and startups alike. Institutions like JPMorgan and Franklin Templeton have experimented with tokenizing assets like treasuries and money market funds. The process promises faster settlement, lower fees and broader market access and it could mushroom to a multitrillion-dollar market over the next decade, according to projections.

Tokenized stocks gained steam earlier this year as a roster of trading platforms and crypto exchanges rolled out tokenized equities including Gemini, Kraken, Bybit and Robinhood. But existing offerings have remained largely inaccessible to U.S. retail investors due to regulatory complexity. Meanwhile, synthetic stock tokens or exposure through special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that often don't provide actual share ownership. These products can lack regulatory oversight, introduce additional counterparty risks and trade at prices that drift from the real market due to limited liquidity.

These products can lack regulatory oversight, introduce additional counterparty risks and trade at prices that drift from the real market due to limited liquidity, according to McCluskey and Johnson.

On SoloTex, each trade mints a stock token on demand, representing a one-to-one claim on the actual share held in custody by the platform's clearing broker, they said. These tokens will provide full shareholder rights, including dividends and voting, and can be viewed alongside other crypto holdings in a self-custodied wallet.

""Offering actual tokenized U.S. equities to the U.S. market has always been the holy grail,"" said Ashley Ebersole, legal advisor for SoloTex, in a statement. ""SoloTex represents the leading edge of innovation within established regulatory architecture, and we will continue to innovate towards fully tokenized capital markets as regulations permit.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Bearish BTC Sentiment Persists Despite Powell's Signal That 'QT' May Be Nearing End","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/15/bearish-bitcoin-sentiment-persists-despite-powell-s-signal-that-qt-may-be-nearing-end","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 14:08:24 GMT","

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday said that the central bank could soon reach a point where its long-running program to reduce the balance sheet size would need to end. Yet, BTC continues to trade in the red with derivatives pointing to persistent bearish sentiment.

“Our long-stated plan is to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions,” Powell said in prepared remarks for his speech at the National Association for Business Economics conference in Philadelphia.

“We may approach that point in coming months, and we are closely monitoring a wide range of indicators to inform this decision,"" he added.

The so-called quantitative tightening (QT) began in 2022 to remove the extraordinary liquidity that the Fed added to the financial system via balance sheet expansion during the coronavirus crisis. Since then, the total size of the Fed's balance sheet has declined to $6.6 trillion from around $9 trillion.

Powell's comments indicate that the Fed does not want to shrink its balance sheet so much that bank reserves — the funds banks hold at the Federal Reserve — fall below a level the Fed considers ""ample."" Staying above this threshold is crucial to avoid disruptions in short-term funding markets and ensure financial stability.

According to the chairman, that point may be nearing as the central bank carefully evaluates market conditions, including recent increases in various overnight funding rates.

The comments come as markets anticipate two 25-basis-point Fed rate cuts by the year-end, following a similar-sized reduction in September and have raised bullish sentiment on crypto social media.

BTC, however, is not impressed, and neither is the broader crypto market. As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency by market value traded near $112,600, largely flat on a 24-hour basis.

Deribit-listed options tied to BTC showed one-week puts, offering downside protection, continuing to trade at a premium to calls or bullish bets. Options out to the March 2026 expiry showed a similar bearish pricing.

Perhaps it's the market's way of reminding the crypto bulls that a potential end to quantitative tightening doesn't necessarily mean a quick start to a new balance sheet expansion program, like the one during COVID that greased the crypto bull market.

Moreover, the pace of QT slowed notably from mid-2024. Since April this year, the central bank has limited monthly redemptions of Treasuries to $5 billion, while maintaining the cap for mortgage-backed securities at $35 billion. So, the approaching end of QT does not necessarily signal a significant bullish or dovish surprise.

""The big takeaway from Powell's talk today was that the QT program is likely to end soon. That is to say, the Fed is likely to stop shrinking its balance sheet in the coming months. The run rate on this balance sheet reduction was already very small, so it's not a huge change,"" pseudonymous observer Markets and Mayhem pointed out on X.

Powell' dovish remarks, however, pushed bond yields lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4%, extending the two-day decline. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, fell to 98.75, but remained well within last week's trading range. Meanwhile, gold continued to march higher, hitting new highs above $4,200 per ounce and futures tied to Nasdaq rose 0.7%.

 Crypto analysts say the weekend's market volatility is temporary and are predicting an upward trend to emerge in the coming weeks. 

Bitcoin could reclaim its all-time high of $125,100 in the coming week, but not without one more major correction, according to veteran trader Peter Brandt.

“Either a huge shakeout, which would be confirmed by an ATH quickly within the next week or so,” he said, though he acknowledged there could also be a much more bearish outcome. 

The crypto market crashed on Friday after US President Donald Trump's announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, resulting in over $19 billion in liquidations across the market.

After dropping from around $121,000 to as low as $102,000 on Friday, Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded to approximately $112,400 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap.

“If anything, this weekend was a reminder you have to be so careful with leverage, and even multiples above 1.5x are dangerous,” Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards told Cointelegraph.

“They do, and you need to always consider multi-year, long-term risk,” he said. He said the weekend's volatility is temporary, and described his outlook for the coming weeks as simply “up.” 

Other analysts remain optimistic, citing broader macroeconomic signals as indications that fresh capital could flow into the cryptocurrency market in the coming weeks.

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said in an X post on Tuesday that a buying opportunity may be presenting itself in the crypto market after US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that quantitative tightening “is over.” 

“Back up the … truck and buy everything,” Hayes said. 

Quantitative easing is bullish for crypto as it encourages banks to lend more and makes borrowing cheaper for consumers and businesses through lower interest rates.

Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph on Tuesday that “the fundamental economic data is the big story for Bitcoin right now.”

“Inflation is facing a double whammy at the moment from lower oil prices and demand, and at the same time, the US labor market is showing signs of distress,” Hundal said, as US inflation reached 2.90% in August, the highest level since January.

“The Fed has a mandate to target full employment, and it all just feels inevitable that we'll see further rate cuts this month. This is a goldilocks zone for Bitcoin,” he said.

Meanwhile, macroeconomist Lyn Alden recently said on a podcast that she is leaning “toward this next quarter being probably pretty favorable” for Bitcoin.

Spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs saw $102.58 million in net inflows, rebounding from a $326 million outflow a day earlier, according to data from SoSoValue. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) led gains with $132.67 million in inflows, while BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) posted a modest outflow of $30.79 million. 

Total net assets across all spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $153.55 billion, representing 6.82% of Bitcoin's market cap, while cumulative inflows stood at $62.55 billion.

Ether (ETH) ETFs mirrored the turnaround, recording $236.22 million in net inflows following Monday's steep $428 million outflow. Fidelity's Ethereum Fund (FETH) topped the list with $154.62 million, followed by Grayscale's Ethereum Fund (ETH) and Bitwise's Ethereum ETF (ETHW) with $34.78 million and $13.27 million, respectively.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled Tuesday that the US central bank is nearing the end of its balance sheet reduction program and is preparing for potential rate cuts as the labor market weakens.

Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics conference, Powell said the Fed may soon stop its “quantitative tightening” process, noting that reserves are “somewhat above the level” consistent with ample liquidity. 

“An October rate cut will have markets taking flight, with crypto and ETFs seeing liquidity flow and sharper moves,” Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of the Taiwan-based company Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph.

“Expect digital assets to feel the lift as capital seeks efficiency in a softer rate environment,” he added.

As Cointelegraph reported, crypto investment products showed strong resilience during last week's market turbulence, recording $3.17 billion in inflows despite a major flash crash triggered by renewed US-China tariff tensions, according to CoinShares.

CoinShares said Monday that last Friday's panic led to only $159 million in outflows, even as $20 billion in positions were liquidated across exchanges. The resilience helped push total inflows for 2025 to $48.7 billion, already surpassing last year's total.

“Easing US-China tariff tensions and a renewed debasement trade echoed in gold's strength are fueling fresh demand for digital assets,” Liu noted.

 Crypto markets rebounded to $4 trillion after the largest liquidation event in history as analysts maintained bullish October forecasts, citing structural factors. 

The crypto markets are still on track for a bullish October despite a major liquidation event last week, according to analysts and experts, who have compared it to other crypto black swan events. 

“After the largest liquidation in crypto history, I expected October to be deep in the red,” crypto podcaster Scott Melker said on Wednesday.

However, Melker said the markets are still holding on, “which honestly feels like a small miracle,” adding that “I don't think we're entering a bear market.”

The crypto market capitalization rebounded quickly to reclaim $4 trillion after the weekend rout, but has since cooled off slightly as Bitcoin (BTC) failed to build on its momentum and retreated below $111,000 again on Tuesday. 

Melker added that this wasn't 2017 or 2021 when there were major external influences on markets such as “ICO mania, China mining ban or FTX.”

The path to the cycle top is likely to be volatile, HashKey Group senior researcher Tim Sun told Cointelegraph. 

“Near-term volatility is to be expected, but excessive pessimism is unwarranted,” he said, adding that from a medium-to-long-term perspective, “policy easing, de-escalation of tensions, and liquidity repair should remain the dominant themes.”

October gained the moniker “Uptober” as Bitcoin has clocked gains in October in ten of the past 12 years. It is currently down 0.6% since the start of this month, but historical trends suggest it could still turn positive by the end of the month.

Bitcoin has seen the most upside in the second half of the month historically. In October 2024, it gained 16% after Oct. 15, and in 2023 it climbed 29%, while in 2020 it rose 18% in the second half of the month. 

Melker also pointed to gold's epic rally to an all-time high last week, noting that there is usually rotation into Bitcoin that follows. 

The trade tariff scare that contributed to the weekend crash appears to be waning as a White House official confirmed that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet to discuss trade.

“Trade conflict is not a zero-sum game; both parties ultimately seek larger shares of the gains, suggesting the eventual outcome is likely to be more moderate than current sentiment implies,” said Sun. 

Other narratives, such as further Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, and the debasement trade, are also fuelling the sentiment that Uptober is still on track.

A natural sweetener derived from the Stevia plant could have a previously unknown superpower.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Few people like going bald—there's a reason why hair growth is a multi-billion industry. One of the leading causes of hair loss is androgenetic alopecia, otherwise known as pattern hair loss, which impacts up to 50 percent of both men and women. One of the most widespread medications for baldness, which is the active ingredient in products like Rogaine, is minoxidil (originally developed to treat high blood pressure).

While this treatment has helped many people grow hair, it does come with a few downsides. Standard treatments typically have poor water solubility and skin permeability, so some hair growth experts resort to applying minoxidil with microneedling, a technique that punctures small holes in the top layer of the skin to stimulate growth factors and increase the medication's absorption. 

As described in a new study, scientists from China and Australia have developed a dissolving patch that can perform this microneedling work while also delivering a dose of minoxidil to the scalp, and it's derived from a somewhat unlikely ingredient: Stevioside (STV), the natural sweetener derived from the Stevia plant. The results of the study were published in the journal Advanced Healthcare Materials.

“Using STV as a novel solubilizing agent, we incorporated minoxidil into a dissolving microneedle patch, which was used to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of minoxidil and overcome the limitations of traditional carrier single-function approaches,” the authors wrote in the study. “This method not only enhances drug penetration into skin but also eliminates other issues associated with traditional topical formulations, such as slow onset of action and/or inaccurate dosing.”

As the authors note, while testosterone doesn't directly cause baldness, the enzyme 5α-reductase converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone, which triggers the apoptosis (or death) of keratin-producing cells in the epidermis. Minoxidil, however, suppresses certain enzymes and inhibits androgen receptors, which has the net effect of decreasing the formation and binding of dihydrotestosterone. It also boosts aromatase, which converts testosterone into estradiol—a kind of estrogen that further stimulates hair growth.

To test their new idea, researchers used mouse models with androgenetic alopecia and tested their new patch against standard treatments. In 35 days, scientists saw hair regrowth in 67 percent of the target area, compared to only 25 percent from the control group—a promising start for this Stevia-based hair loss treatment. Of course, mice are one thing, and humans are another.

“While the mouse model results are promising, human hair growth cycles differ, and androgenetic alopecia is influenced by multiple factors,” Lifeng Kang, a co-author of the study from the University of Sydney, told Gizmodo. “Therefore, clinical trials are essential to confirm efficacy and safety in humans.”

Unwanted hair loss isn't a thing of the past (at least, not yet), but science has it in its crosshairs—no pun intended.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Two of the Biggest Fault Lines in the World Are Synched Together. That Could Be Disastrous.","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a69001262/fault-lines-synched-together/","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 13:30:00 GMT","

The relationship between the sites means an earthquake in one zone can trigger an earthquake in the other in a phenomenon called “stress triggering.”

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Researchers hoping to unravel the dance of earthquake movement in North America's West Coast discovered a disturbing fact: Two of the world's largest fault lines sometimes work in conjunction. History, as it turns out, shows that an earthquake in either the Cascadia Subduction Zone or the San Andreas Fault can trigger an earthquake in the other. 

In a new study published in the journal Geosphere, researchers from Oregon State University—led by Chris Goldfinger, a marine geologist and geophysicist—show evidence of what's called “partial synchronization” of the northern San Andreas Fault and Cascadia Subduction Zone. Partial synchronization basically means that an earthquake event in one zone has a history of triggering events in the other, and the historical evidence of “significant interaction” between the two (and the potential for more in the future) should be taken as a warning. 

The core piece of evidence of this relationship comes from the seabed. The team mined 130 sediment cores (dating back 3,100 years) from the Mendocino Triple Junction—where the Cascadia Subduction Zone's Juan de Fuca plate and Gorda plate (under the North American Plate) rendezvous with the San Andreas Fault off the coast of northern California. There, the sediment layers showed unusual turbidite (the layers formed by marine landslides moving the ocean floor) action, which is often a telltale sign of an earthquake. 

A typical turbidite features coarse sediment at the bottom with the finer silt settling at the top. At the Mendocino Triple Junction, however, that structure was flipped and “seem[ed] to be upside down with all the sand at the top,” Goldfinger told Scientific American. “And as far as we know, gravity hasn't changed.”

That likely implies those unique turbidite formations were stacked by two earthquakes, one from each zone, in quick succession—a matter of years or even minutes apart. The study shows that eight of the turbidite bends have “substantial temporal overlap” between the Cascadia Subduction Zone and the San Andreas Fault, and that the last major synchronization earthquake event occurred around 1700.

Goldfinger compared the situation to tuning a radio to convert incoming signals. “When you tune an old radio, you're essentially causing one oscillator to vibrate at the same frequency as the other one,” he said. “When these faults synchronize, one fault could tune up the other and cause earthquakes in pairs.” 

Just because it's been over 300 years since the last paired quake, however, it doesn't eliminate future possibilities. “We could expect that an earthquake on one of the faults alone would draw down the resources of the whole country to respond to it,” Goldfinger told The Guardian. “If they both went off together, then you've got potentially San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver [B.C.] all in an emergency situation in a compressed timeframe.”

While there were only eight major events, the evidence showed the two areas were so closely linked that near-simultaneous quakes weren't so much a rarity as a rule. 

“In the paper we stuck to the geology instead of dwelling on the potential doom and gloom,” Goldfinger said. “But it's pretty clear that if something like this happened—and we think the evidence for it is strong—we need to be prepared.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","It actually rains on the Sun. Here's the stunning reason","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251015032312.htm","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 13:18:32 GMT","

It rains on the Sun, and scientists at the University of Hawaiʻi Institute for Astronomy (IfA) have finally uncovered the reason why.

Unlike the water that falls from clouds on Earth, solar rain takes place in the Sun's corona, the outermost layer made of intensely hot plasma. This phenomenon involves cooler, heavier blobs of plasma that condense high above the Sun's surface and then plunge back down. For years, researchers couldn't understand how this ""rain"" formed so rapidly during solar flares.

New explanation

That puzzle has now been solved by Luke Benavitz, a first-year graduate student at IfA, working with IfA astronomer Jeffrey Reep. Their findings, published in the Astrophysical Journal, fill a critical gap in long-standing solar models.

""At present, models assume that the distribution of various elements in the corona is constant throughout space and time, which clearly isn't the case,"" said Benavitz. ""It's exciting to see that when we allow elements like iron to change with time, the models finally match what we actually observe on the Sun. It makes the physics come alive in a way that feels real.""

Why it matters

The discovery gives solar scientists new tools to better simulate how the Sun behaves during energetic flares -- knowledge that could eventually improve forecasts of space weather events that influence technology and communications on Earth.

Earlier models suggested the heating that causes coronal rain should take hours or even days, yet solar flares occur within minutes. The IfA team's new approach shows that changes in the relative amounts of elements, or elemental abundances, can account for the rapid formation of solar rain.

""This discovery matters because it helps us understand how the Sun really works,"" said Reep. ""We can't directly see the heating process, so we use cooling as a proxy. But if our models haven't treated abundances properly, the cooling time has likely been overestimated. We might need to go back to the drawing board on coronal heating, so there's a lot of new and exciting work to be done.""

Fresh insights

Their findings also open up a broader range of questions. Scientists now realize that the composition of the Sun's atmosphere changes over time, overturning decades of assumptions that it stayed constant. This insight extends far beyond coronal rain, prompting a reexamination of how the Sun's outer layers evolve and how energy circulates through its atmosphere.

Pulsars may be revealing that extremely low-frequency gravitational waves are moving through the universe. Observations reported in 2023 by international pulsar timing array collaborations could be caused by either a background of overlapping gravitational waves from countless distant sources or a single pair of nearby supermassive black holes orbiting each other. To determine which explanation fits, Hideki Asada, a theoretical physicist and Professor at Hirosaki University, and Shun Yamamoto, a researcher at the Graduate School of Science and Technology, Hirosaki University, have proposed a new approach. Their method takes advantage of ""beat"" effects that occur when two gravitational waves have nearly the same frequency, searching for their subtle influence on the arrival times of pulsars' radio signals.

Their findings were recently published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (JCAP).

The night sky contains remarkably precise ""cosmic clocks"": pulsars, which are dense neutron stars that emit radio pulses at steady intervals, ticking like perfectly timed metronomes. On Earth, radio telescopes track these pulses not only to learn about the pulsars themselves, but also to use them as tools for studying the structure and behavior of the wider universe.

If something unseen -- almost a ""cosmic ghost"" -- distorts spacetime between a pulsar and Earth, the timing of its pulses shifts slightly. These changes are not random; several pulsars in certain parts of the sky can show matching variations, as if a slow, invisible wave were passing through space.

""In 2023 several pulsar timing array collaborations -- NANOGrav in the US, and European teams -- announced strong evidence for nanohertz gravitational waves,"" Asada notes. Nanohertz means wave periods of months to years, with wavelengths of several light-years. To probe such scales, we rely on distant, stable pulsars hundreds to thousands of light-years away. ""The signal was statistically reliable but below the 5-sigma threshold that particle physicists usually require,"" he continues. ""It's 'strong evidence' but not yet a confirmed detection, but the cosmology and astrophysics community believes we are approaching the first detection of nanohertz gravitational waves.""

Although the evidence is promising, it still falls short of absolute confirmation. Asada notes that if future data strengthen the result, the next step will be to pinpoint the origin. ""There are two main candidate sources for nanohertz gravitational waves,"" he explains. ""One is cosmic inflation, which would have created spacetime fluctuations in the very early universe, later stretched to cosmic scales. The other is supermassive black hole binaries, which form when galaxies merge. Both scenarios could generate nanohertz gravitational waves.""

Distinguishing between these possibilities has been difficult because the correlation patterns seen in pulsar data -- the way timing differences between pulsars relate to each other -- were once thought to appear similar in both cases. ""In our paper, we explored the situation where a nearby pair of supermassive black holes produces a particularly strong signal,"" Asada says. ""If two such systems have very similar frequencies, their waves can interfere and create a beat pattern, like in acoustics. That feature could, in principle, allow us to distinguish them from the stochastic background of inflation.""

Asada and Yamamoto therefore leverage a familiar acoustic effect: beats. When two waves have almost -- but not exactly -- the same frequency, their superposition produces periodic strengthening and weakening. Applied to gravitational waves, two supermassive-black-hole binaries with similar frequencies would imprint a characteristic modulation in the pulsar-timing signal. The method is to look for this modulation -- the ""beat"" -- in the pulsar correlation patterns. If it's present, that strongly suggests the signal is not a diffuse background but arises from specific, relatively nearby binaries.

We now await stronger confirmation of the pulsar signal's nature. ""I think once a confirmed detection at 5-sigma is achieved, maybe within a few years, the next step will be to ask: what is the origin of the waves? At that point, our method could be useful to distinguish whether they come from inflation or from nearby supermassive black hole binaries,"" Asada concludes.

A new study examined how muscles respond to weight training when people eat different types of pork afterward. Researchers compared high-fat and lean ground pork burgers that contained the same amount of protein to see how each affected short-term muscle growth. The results surprised the team and added to growing evidence that the body's muscle-building process after exercise depends not just on how much protein is consumed, but on the type of protein as well.

The research was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

""What we're finding is that not all high-quality animal protein foods are created equal,"" said Nicholas Burd, a professor of health and kinesiology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, who led the research with graduate student Žan Zupančič.

Burd's previous work revealed similar patterns. One earlier experiment showed that eating whole eggs after weight training led to greater muscle-protein synthesis than eating the same amount of protein from egg whites alone. Another study found that eating salmon produced a stronger muscle-building response than consuming a processed blend with the same nutrients in identical proportions.

Together, these findings suggest that whole foods stimulate muscle growth more effectively after exercise than processed versions do. Burd noted that in some cases, the natural fat content of whole foods might actually enhance muscle-building activity.

In this latest study, the research team used advanced techniques to measure and track muscle-protein synthesis in 16 young, physically active adults. To prepare the test meals, they collaborated with the University of Illinois Meat Science Laboratory to create pork patties with precisely defined fat levels.

""That took us a year because it was so hard to get those fat ratios correct,"" Burd said. All of the meat came from a single pig, and the patties were sent to an external lab for detailed nutrient analysis. Once the fat-to-lean ratios and other nutritional values were verified, the burgers were frozen until used during the experiment's feeding phase.

Before participants began the workout and meal trials, they received an infusion of isotope-labeled amino acids. This technique allowed the scientists to monitor how quickly those amino acids were integrated into muscle tissue. Blood samples were also collected throughout the process to measure circulating amino acid levels.

Muscle biopsies were taken both before and after the two-hour infusion to establish a baseline for muscle-protein synthesis.

""And then we took them to the gym,"" Burd said. ""And they were wheeling that infusion pump and everything else with them.""

At the gym, participants performed leg presses and leg extensions, then returned to the lab to eat one of three test meals: a high-fat pork burger, a lean pork burger, or a carbohydrate drink. Five hours later, the researchers took another muscle biopsy to measure how the meal and exercise together affected protein synthesis.

After several days of recovery, 14 of the 16 volunteers repeated the process but switched meal types to ensure that individual differences did not skew the results.

As expected, amino acid levels in the blood rose sharply after eating pork compared with the carbohydrate drink. However, those who consumed the lean pork burger showed the largest increases in amino acids -- both total and essential.

""When you see an increased concentration of amino acids in the blood after you eat, you get a pretty good idea that that is coming from the food that you just ate,"" Burd said.

Those who consumed the lean pork burger after a bout of weight training also had a greater rate of muscle-protein synthesis than those who ate the high-fat pork burger. This was a surprise to Burd, as ""the previous studies using fattier foods, such as whole eggs or salmon, generally showed enhanced post-exercise muscle-protein synthesis compared with lower fat food such as egg whites or nutritional supplements,"" he said.

Although weight training boosted muscle-protein synthesis in the groups eating pork, the protein in the high-fat burger seemed to have no added benefit in the hours after participants consumed it, while the protein in the lean pork gave muscle-protein synthesis a boost.

""For some reason, the high-fat pork truly blunted the response,"" Burd said. ""In fact, the people who ate the high-fat pork only had slightly better muscle-building potential than those who drank a carbohydrate sports beverage after exercise.""

Interpreting the results of this study for people who want to optimize muscle gains from weight-training is tricky, Burd said. It could be that processing the ground pork patties, which involved grinding the meat and adding the fattier meat to the lean, affected the kinetics of digestion.

""There was a little larger rise in the amino acids available from eating lean pork, so it could have been a bigger trigger for muscle-protein synthesis,"" Burd said. ""But that seems to be specific to the ground pork. If you're eating other foods, like eggs or salmon, the whole foods appear to be better despite not eliciting a large rise in blood amino acids.""

Burd stresses that exercise is the strongest stimulus for muscle-protein synthesis.

""Most of the muscle response is to weight-training, and we use nutrition to try to squeeze out the remaining potential,"" he said. ""When it comes to eating after weight-training, what we're finding is that some foods, particularly whole, unprocessed foods seem to be a better stimulus.""

Burd also is a professor of nutritional sciences and is affiliated with the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at the U. of I.

The National Pork Board's Pork Checkoff program supported this research. The funder had no involvement in study design, data collection or analysis.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","MIT scientists find metals hold secret atomic patterns","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251014014427.htm","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 03:54:31 GMT","

For years, scientists have known that tiny chemical patterns can form inside metal alloys, but most assumed these patterns were insignificant or disappeared during manufacturing. Recent experiments have shown that in controlled lab conditions, such patterns can actually influence how metals behave -- affecting their strength, durability, heat resistance, and even how well they withstand radiation.

Researchers at MIT have now discovered that these subtle chemical arrangements also persist in metals made through standard industrial processes. The unexpected finding points to a new physical principle that explains why these patterns remain.

In a study published in Nature Communications, the MIT team detailed how they identified and analyzed the patterns, uncovering the physics that drives them. They also developed a model that predicts how these patterns form, allowing engineers to potentially adjust them to fine-tune a metal's properties for use in aerospace, semiconductor, or nuclear applications.

""The conclusion is: You can never completely randomize the atoms in a metal. It doesn't matter how you process it,"" explains Rodrigo Freitas, the TDK Assistant Professor in the MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering. ""This is the first paper showing these non-equilibrium states that are retained in the metal. Right now, this chemical order is not something we're controlling for or paying attention to when we manufacture metals.""

For Freitas, an early-career researcher, the discovery validates his decision to pursue a problem many others thought was already settled. He credits support from the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research's Young Investigator Program and the collaborative effort of his team, which includes three MIT PhD students -- Mahmudul Islam, Yifan Cao, and Killian Sheriff -- as co-first authors.

""There was the question of whether I should even be tackling this specific problem because people have been working on it for a long time,"" Freitas says. ""But the more I learned about it, the more I saw researchers were thinking about this in idealized laboratory scenarios. We wanted to perform simulations that were as realistic as possible to reproduce these manufacturing processes with high fidelity. My favorite part of this project is how non-intuitive the findings are. The fact that you cannot completely mix something together, people didn't see that coming.""

From surprises to theories

Freitas and his team began with a simple question: how quickly do elements mix during the processing of metals? Conventional thinking suggested that there comes a point where metals become completely uniform at the atomic level during manufacturing. Finding that point, they believed, could help design alloys with varying levels of short-range atomic order.

Using advanced machine-learning tools, the researchers simulated how millions of atoms moved and rearranged during metal processing.

""The first thing we did was to deform a piece of metal,"" Freitas explains. ""That's a common step during manufacturing: You roll the metal and deform it and heat it up again and deform it a little more, so it develops the structure you want. We did that and we tracked chemical order. The thought was as you deform the material, its chemical bonds are broken and that randomizes the system. These violent manufacturing processes essentially shuffle the atoms.""

Yet the metals didn't behave as expected. Despite extreme processing, the alloys never reached a completely random state. The result puzzled the team since no existing theory could account for it.

""It pointed to a new piece of physics in metals,"" the researchers write in the paper. ""It was one of those cases where applied research led to a fundamental discovery.""

To explore further, they built high-precision computational models to capture how atoms interact and statistical methods to measure how order evolves over time. Through large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, they watched how atoms reorganized during deformation and heating.

The team observed that certain atomic arrangements appeared at unexpectedly high temperatures, and even more remarkably, entirely new patterns emerged that had never been seen outside of real-world manufacturing. They described these patterns as ""far-from-equilibrium states.""

They then developed a simplified model to reproduce the main features of the simulations. The model revealed that these patterns originate from defects in metals known as dislocations -- irregular, three-dimensional distortions in the atomic lattice. When the metal is deformed, dislocations twist and shift, nudging nearby atoms into preferred positions. Previously, researchers thought this process destroyed all atomic order, but the MIT team found the opposite: dislocations actually favor certain atomic exchanges, creating subtle but stable patterns.

""These defects have chemical preferences that guide how they move,"" Freitas says. ""They look for low energy pathways, so given a choice between breaking chemical bonds, they tend to break the weakest bonds, and it's not completely random. This is very exciting because it's a non-equilibrium state: It's not something you'd see naturally occurring in materials. It's the same way our bodies live in non-equilibrium. The temperature outside is always hotter or colder than our bodies, and we're maintaining that steady state equilibrium to stay alive. That's why these states exist in metal: the balance between an internal push toward disorder plus this ordering tendency of breaking certain bonds that are always weaker than others.""

Applying a new theory

The researchers are now exploring how these chemical patterns develop across a wide range of manufacturing conditions. The result is a map that links various metal processing steps to different chemical patterns in metal.

To date, this chemical order and the properties they tune have been largely considered an academic subject. With this map, the researchers hope engineers can begin thinking of these patterns as levers in design that can be pulled during production to get new properties.

""Researchers have been looking at the ways these atomic arrangements change metallic properties -- a big one is catalysis,"" Freitas says of the process that drives chemical reactions. ""Electrochemistry happens at the surface of the metal, and it's very sensitive to local atomic arrangements. And there have been other properties that you wouldn't think would be influenced by these factors. Radiation damage is another big one. That affects these materials' performance in nuclear reactors.""

Researchers have already told Freitas the paper could help explain other surprise findings about metallic properties, and he's excited for the field to move from fundamental research into chemical order to more applied work.

""You can think of areas where you need very optimized alloys like aerospace,"" Freitas says. ""They care about very specific compositions. Advanced manufacturing now makes it possible to combine metals that normally wouldn't mix through deformation. Understanding how atoms actually shuffle and mix in those processes is crucial, because it's the key to gaining strength while still keeping the low density. So, this could be a huge deal for them.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A little stress could be the secret to healthy aging","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251015032314.htm","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 14:29:55 GMT","

Researchers at the University of Basel in Switzerland have found that certain nutrients can cause a mild stress reaction in nematodes. Surprisingly, this reaction doesn't harm the worms -- it actually helps them remain healthier as they grow older.

Human lifespans are longer than ever, but longevity alone doesn't guarantee good health. Many people are now asking not only ""How long can I live?"" but ""How well can I live?"" While lifespan refers to the total number of years from birth to death, healthspan is the portion of those years spent in good health.

Diet plays a major role in determining how well we age. Scientists have long known that both the amount and the type of nutrients we consume influence aging. Using the microscopic worm Caenorhabditis elegans, Professor Spang's team showed that specific RNA molecules found in food can improve the worms' health in later life. ""These molecules prevent the formation of harmful protein aggregates that are typically linked with aging and disease,"" says Spang. The results of their study were published in Nature Communications.

How diet shapes aging

As organisms age, their ability to remove damaged or altered proteins declines. These proteins can accumulate and form toxic clumps within cells, which are thought to drive the aging process and contribute to diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and various muscle disorders.

The researchers discovered that a balanced diet supports longer healthspan and that certain dietary components offer protective effects. The worms mainly consume bacteria that contain double-stranded RNA molecules. ""These dietary RNAs are absorbed in the gut and activate quality-control mechanisms to protect from cellular stress,"" explains Emmanouil Kyriakakis, the study's first author."" This low-level stress essentially trains the body to cope with protein damage more effectively.""

Diet-dependent mechanisms slow cellular aging

Diet activates autophagy -- a cellular ""clean-up"" process that degrades and recycles damaged proteins. This mechanism reduces harmful protein aggregation and thus slows down cell aging. ""We were surprised to find that the gut communicates with other organs,"" says Kyriakakis. ""We observed protective effects not only locally, but also in muscles and throughout the whole organism.""

Healthier aging -- even in worms

Overall, the worms exposed to a balanced diet were more active and healthier in old age. ""The dietary-RNA species elicit a systemic stress response that protects the worms from protein aggregation during aging,"" says Kyriakakis. ""thereby extending their healthspan.""

The findings confirm that diet strongly influences health in old age. ""Specific food components can stimulate the body's own protective mechanisms,"" adds Spang. ""So, a little stress can be good for you."" Whether individual nutrients can also spark beneficial effects in humans -- and potentially help prevent age-related diseases -- remains to be investigated. But it's certainly conceivable. What is clear already: What we eat can shape the way we age.

The closure of the US government has shuttered the Smithsonian Institution's museums and zoo and some of its research facilities. Credit: Anna Moneymaker/Getty

The shutdown of the US government, about to enter its third week, is starting to take a toll on US science. Since the shutdown began, the administration of US President Donald Trump has cancelled funding for clean-energy research projects and laid off public-health workers. The activities of some federally funded museums and laboratories have been suspended, along with the processing of grant applications by agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Funding to run the US government expired on 1 October after members of the US Congress failed to pass a spending bill. Negotiations to end the impasse have made little progress. Lawmakers from the opposition Democratic party say that they will only pass the spending bill if it extends popular health-care subsidies, a condition that Republicans do not want to negotiate. “The longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be,” Vice President JD Vance said Sunday.

The Trump administration said in a court filing Friday that it will lay off 4,100- 4,200 federal employees, an action officially termed a reduction in force (RIF). The Trump administration invoked the absence of a spending bill as justification for the layoffs, which are an unprecedented measure during a shutdown. Unions representing federal workers have filed suit over the layoffs.

Starting Friday night, some 1,300 staff members of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) received RIF notices, although the notices for 700 were quickly rescinded, according to Local 2883 of the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing CDC employees. The layoffs would “undermine the nation's ability to respond to public health emergencies,” a CDC staff member affected by the layoff said Tuesday at a news conference organized by Local 2883.

Word of layoffs at the CDC's influential National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) sparked particular concern among epidemiologists. The programme has been collecting US health data since the early 1960s, and has helped researchers to understand critical public-health issues such as the health effects of lead in petrol.

Former CDC staff member Asher Rosinger, an epidemiologist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, says CDC staffers told him that the layoffs have decimated the NHANES planning branch, a team he says is critical to the operation of the programme. “This gold standard survey may no longer be able to operate in the future,” he says.

Some CDC employees have now been laid off twice in the span of half a year, says mathematical statistician Isaac Michael. At the CDC, Michael and his colleagues ran a survey and database that track the experience of new mothers in the United States — until the entire team was laid off in April. Several court orders have preserved their employment status for now, though they are still not allowed to work even when the government reopens. But some of his colleagues received a second layoff notice within the last few days, making it unlikely they will ever be reinstated.

If a state experiences a future uptick in maternal or infant deaths, “we won't even know there's a problem, because we're not collecting any reliable data, and we won't be able to do anything to help”, Michael says.

Andrew Nixon, communications director at the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the CDC, said that all HHS employees receiving reduction-in-force notices were designated as non-essential by their respective divisions, and that the department will continue to close “wasteful and duplicative entities”.

The administration's court filing said that the US Environmental Protection Agency would lose 20-30 people. Staff members at US Department of Energy (DoE) offices overseeing renewable energy, energy efficiency and other areas have also received RIF notcies, a DoE spokesperson said. “These offices are being realigned to reflect the Trump administration's commitment to advancing affordable, reliable, and secure energy for the American people,” the spokesperson said.

Coinciding with the shutdown, the administration has also announced a fresh round of cuts to research projects, adding to billions of dollars in federal research grants revoked since Trump took office in January.

On the second day of the shutdown, the DoE announced that it was cutting almost US$7.6 billion in funding from 223 energy projects, many of them supporting renewable energy. An analysis by Nature found that the list includes grants to 33 academic institutions, which have a combined value of $620 million.

Off a quiet hallway on the top floor of a building at the University of Osaka in Japan, Katsuhiko Hayashi is hatching a revolution.

Human embryo science: can the world's regulators keep pace?

Human embryo science: can the world's regulators keep pace?

He is on a decades-long quest to grow eggs and sperm in the laboratory. Hayashi wants to understand the fundamental biology of these reproductive cells. But, if he succeeds, it could forever alter how humans reproduce.

Even for a scientist known for extreme doggedness, it has been a tortuous road. It has taken Hayashi to some strange places: his lab grows fragments of faux ovaries and testes in dishes and has produced mice with two fathers and no mother1.

Every paper he publishes brings e-mails from people clamouring for help with their fertility. “I tell them, ‘This is still experimental',” Hayashi says. “But sometimes, I can't respond. There are too many.”

The work that Hayashi and others in the field are doing could offer fresh hope to people struggling with infertility, and to same-sex couples who want children who are genetically related to both partners. But despite the dazzling results researchers have achieved in rodents, that future remains distant. “The technology is super cool,” says Christian Kramme, chief scientific officer at Gameto, a fertility-focused biotechnology company in Austin, Texas. “But fundamentally, I don't believe there is a single person in the world that should attempt to enact this clinically in the next decade.”

There are plenty of interim goals for researchers to chase, however. Drug companies and regulators hope that a bountiful supply of human gametes — the collective term for egg and sperm cells — could make it easier to test whether drugs and other compounds could reduce fertility or cause mutations that would be passed on to the next generation, says Ina Dobrinski, a reproductive biologist at the University of Calgary in Canada.

And learning how to recapitulate human development in the laboratory could reveal clues about infertility, says Azim Surani, a developmental biologist at the University of Cambridge, UK. “This will be the greatest outcome from these studies,” he says. “Once you understand what causes infertility, you might find ways of overcoming that.”

But as labs move forwards with these experiments, some researchers are raising concerns about potential future uses of the technology. Growing large numbers of gametes in the laboratory could make it easier for parents to select embryos for desirable traits and even facilitate the generation of genetically modified babies.

Although such uses are, by some estimates, at least 15 years away, researchers and some government bodies are calling for regulations to address the potential issues associated with lab-grown eggs and sperm — a process known as in vitro gametogenesis (IVG).

Researchers differ in their estimates of when human IVG will become a reality. Hayashi's laboratory has produced fertile mouse pups from what he calls egg-like cells grown in the lab2. There's a chance that human equivalents of these cells could be made in a lab in the next two years, he says.

But that doesn't mean they'll be ready for use in people, he adds. Only a small proportion of the mouse embryos generated from his egg-like cells give rise to live pups, and Hayashi speculates that it could take five years or more to produce truly functional human eggs with acceptable success rates.

Scientists will also need to develop and test non-human primate gametes. Ideally, the offspring generated from these eggs and sperm would be tracked for multiple generations, adding years to the timeline. “That's a critical point,” says Mitinori Saitou, a developmental biologist at Kyoto University in Japan. “My guess is that probably we will have to rely on our next generation of scientists for this.”

For nearly 20 years, researchers have known how to reprogram cells in the human body into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which can take on nearly any cellular identity. Such cells have been used to make cardiac cells that beat in unison, and nerve cells that conduct electrical signals. But recapitulating the complex and lengthy development of sperm and eggs has proved to be more difficult. “There are so many stages involved,” says Surani. “And each of these is very complex.”

Normally, gametogenesis starts well before birth. Egg development begins in the fetus, in which immature eggs are produced by the millions. Some of these cells then initiate a specialized form of division, called meiosis, in which they lose a set of chromosomes, each cell keeping half the number of an ordinary cell. But this division takes years to complete: the cells pause mid-meiosis and will not resume until years later, after puberty, when they are ovulated. Each immature egg is surrounded by tissue that forms a fluid-filled follicle. These follicles secrete hormones and mature as the egg develops.

Meanwhile, the cells that give rise to sperm also form in the fetus and, after puberty, can produce millions of sperm each day in the winding seminiferous tubules of the testes. Their tubular environment is more complex than the ovary's follicles, and harder for scientists to recapitulate in the laboratory.

In both cases, the milieu of a developing egg or sperm is crucial. The cells communicate with their surroundings through proteins and other molecules, and receive physical cues from their environment that influence their development.

Immature sperm seem to respond to the flow of fluid around them as it moves through the tubules of the testes, says Hayashi. And the stiffness of tissues in an ovary helps to hold a developing egg in a state of arrest, says Evelyn Telfer, a reproductive biologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK.

These signals and scaffolds are difficult to replicate in the lab — especially for human IVG, because it is so hard to obtain tissue to study normal development of the ovaries and testes. Researchers are using techniques that allow them to monitor gene activity and protein expression in individual cells and intact tissue, to pinpoint which molecules and cell types might be important, says Chuva de Sousa Lopes, a developmental biologist at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands.

Some studies incubate human cells with mouse ovarian or testicular cells to encourage them to develop into eggs and sperm3. But this approach cannot not be used to make gametes for use in human reproduction because of possible contamination with animal viruses.

At the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, urologist Ryan Flannigan and his colleagues are 3D printing testicular tubules from human cells for their IVG experiments4. Other approaches include using microfluidic devices designed to mimic the organs. Dobrinski's lab grows 3D cell cultures called organoids, which combine several cell types found in the testes.

There are still kinks to work out. Dobrinski's team, for example, struggles to keep its organoids alive for long enough to grow human gametes. In humans, egg and sperm development takes months3, not counting the years-long wait for puberty, says Kotaro Sasaki, a reproductive biologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. “Many people do not know how difficult it is,” he says.

That lengthy time in culture not only slows research, but can also raise the risk of something going wrong, potentially compromising the health of the final product and any offspring, says Eishi Aizawa, a developmental biologist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Some groups are trying to make the process more efficient. For example, one team recently found three proteins that each seem able to initiate meiosis in both male and female iPS cells5.

But some features of this meiosis are unusual, and the cells don't complete their division, says team member Merrick Pierson Smela, chief scientific officer of Ovelle, a biotechnology company in Boston, Massachusetts.

Meiosis is a key stumbling point for IVG, says Paula Cohen, a cell biologist at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca, New York. She and her collaborators have been trying to coax immature human gametes to undergo normal meiosis for about a decade. “It doesn't work,” she says. Cohen says that many of the teams that have reported success have not fully demonstrated that meiosis is proceeding in their Petri dishes as it would in the body. And proper meiosis is important: errors in the process can lead to gametes with the wrong number of chromosomes.

A different approach, reported last month6, seems to produce functional eggs capable of being fertilized. Researchers replaced the nucleus of an immature egg cell, which has one copy of each chromosome, with the nucleus from a skin cell, which contains two of each. They then triggered a process, which they called mitomeiosis, that discarded one set of chromosomes, mimicking some features of meiosis.

About 9% of these cells led to viable eggs that were fertilized and developed for another six days, generating a precursor to an embryo known as a blastocyst. But all the blastocysts had chromosomal abnormalities, and they did not undergo the genetic shuffling that usually takes place during the development of gametes. This recombination is a source of genetic diversity, and it's unclear how the lack of it would affect offspring, says Cohen, or how the mitomeiosis process affects subsequent cell divisions. “This would need to be studied intensively.”

Another hurdle to achieving human IVG is recreating the complex sequence of DNA alterations that occur at different stages of development. Early in gametogenesis, cells systematically erase certain chemical modifications that can affect gene activity; later, new modifications are added onto certain regions of DNA, some of which are then said to be ‘imprinted'.

This step is crucial: more than a dozen disorders have been linked to improper imprinting, says Surani. “You have to get this right,” he says.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Waymo's Robotaxis Are Coming to London","https://www.wired.com/story/waymos-robotaxis-are-coming-to-london/","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Waymo is expanding to London, the self-driving vehicle developer announced on Wednesday. The Google sister company aims to start service next year, when the UK government plans to allow autonomous vehicles to begin operating on its roads in limited pilot programs. Waymo says it's working with the government to receive the necessary permissions for its launch.

This is only Waymo's second venture outside the United States—though could be its first international robotaxi service. The company has been testing robotaxis in Tokyo since April, where it works with Japanese taxi company Nihon Kotsu, whose drivers are helping Waymo map and collect driving data from the city, and Japanese ride-hail firm GO. However, the company won't say when it plans to launch autonomous taxis in Japan.

London could prove the company's biggest challenge yet. Unlike more car-oriented cities in the US, London's streets are more winding and narrow, the city's layout a legacy of its pre-Roman and medieval history. “We will take the same rigorous approach to testing and deploying in London as we have in other cities before offering rides to the public,” Waymo spokesperson Ethan Teicher wrote in an email. He says Waymo's experience in Tokyo will help its software drive in London.

Waymo operates paid taxi service in five US cities: Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta. (It operates the latter two services through the Uber app.) It has announced plans to launch in Dallas, Miami, Nashville, and Washington, DC, next year. It has also received a permit to test autonomous vehicles in New York City, though it must do so with a safety driver behind the wheel. The company says it has provided more than 10 million paid rides since it picked up its first customers in 2020.

Waymo's move follows the UK government's announcement this spring that it would accelerate by more than a year its plans to allow autonomous vehicle tech on public roads. The government now aims to begin permitting robotaxis to operate in small numbers starting in 2026.

Government officials intend to spend about a year studying the data those vehicles produce before allowing companies to more widely launch driverless taxi services in the second half of 2027. Homegrown British autonomous vehicle developer Wayve has already announced it will work with Uber to operate robotaxis in London.

UK secretary of state for transport Heidi Alexander said in a statement that she was “delighted” about Waymo's plans. “Boosting the [autonomous vehicle] sector will increase accessible transport options alongside bringing jobs, investment, and opportunities to the UK,” she said.

Waymo says it will work with fleet-operations firm Moove to run an eventual London fleet. Moove will help manage and dispatch Waymo's electric ride-hail vehicles, and will maintain and operate the service's maintenance and charging depots. Moove is also working with Waymo in Phoenix, and eventually, Miami.

Autumn Gardiner thought updating her driving license would be straightforward. After getting married last year, she headed to the local Department of Motor Vehicles office in Connecticut to get her name changed on her license. While she was there, Gardiner recalls, officials said she needed to update her photo. That's when things started to go wrong.

Every time staff tried to take her photo, Gardiner says, the system would reject it. “Everyone's watching. They're taking more photos,” she recalls. Gardiner, who works as a grant manager for an environmental conservation charity, is one of a small number of people globally who live with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome. Sometimes known as Whistling Face syndrome, the genetic condition impacts muscles around the face and skull, which can result in an undersized mouth.

As more staff members at the DMV were called to help, Gardiner says she started to believe the rejected photos were being caused by her facial difference. The camera system didn't seem to work for her, she says. “It was humiliating and weird. Here's this machine telling me that I don't have a human face,” Gardiner says.

Gardiner isn't alone. Around half a dozen people living with a variety of facial differences—from birthmarks to craniofacial conditions—tell WIRED they are increasingly struggling to participate in modern life as identity verification software, which often is powered by machine learning, is quickly becoming commonplace.

Some of those living with facial differences tell WIRED they have undergone multiple surgeries and experienced stigma for their entire lives, which is now being echoed by the technology they are forced to interact with. They say they haven't been able to access public services due to facial verification services failing, while others have struggled to access financial services. Social media filters and face-unlocking systems on phones often won't work, they say.

“The facial difference community is constantly overlooked,” says Phyllida Swift, the CEO of Face Equality International (FEI), an umbrella group representing other facial difference and disfigurement charities and organizations. There are more than 100 million people worldwide who live with facial disfigurements, FEI estimates. People with facial differences have experienced problems with airport passport gates, photo apps, social media video filters, background blurring on video calls, and more, according to FEI's research. “In many countries, facial recognition is increasingly a part of everyday life, but this technology is failing our community,” Nikki Lilly, a patron for FEI, told a United Nations meeting in March.

From phones to hotel rooms, your face increasingly acts as a digital key. Over the past decade, rapid machine learning and AI advancements have led to the creation of a range of face recognition technologies—meaning that more than ever before, your appearance can be used as a digital identifier. Police have widely deployed face recognition systems, which have frequently been found to be inaccurate and biased against Asian and Black people, while the wider world of face checking has seen government services, anti-fraud systems, and financial institutions using AI to complete identity checks. Most recently, social media and porn websites have adopted face scanning as part of age verification measures.

These “authentication” face checks can take multiple forms. Selfies can be automatically compared to existing ID documents; while liveness tests can require you to take a short video to show you are real—not a fraudster holding a printed photo to the camera. Broadly speaking, these biometric systems often measure your facial features—such as the distance between your eyes, or the size of your jaw—to create “faceprints.” While these kinds of surveillance technologies may be effective for a lot of people, they may not be able to detect people with facial differences. The underlying machine learning technology may not be trained on datasets with a variety of faces, for example.

“The case of Face Equality International—of people who have different faces—is a really important canary in the coal mine of what can go wrong when these systems don't work,” says Greta Byrum, the founder of technology consultancy firm Present Moment Enterprises, which focuses on the social impact of technologic systems and has provided some pro bono work to FEI. “We're seeing facial recognition technologies becoming one of those hammers to which everything looks like a nail,” Byrum says.

“I would like to see people realize that not everyone looks the same, from basic skin tone to facial features to the standard facial appearance,” says Crystal Hodges, a speaker and writer who lives with Sturge-Weber syndrome and has a purple “port wine stain” across part of her face. “People's facial symmetry may not be the same. Other people have different facial features that you don't always see every day, but they exist.”

Hodges, who lives in Arizona, says that last year she and her husband were trying to get their credit scores from a large credit reporting agency when its face verification service wouldn't work for her. “​​I tried five to eight times,” she says. Towards winter, Hodges says, the birthmark will become darker. “We were trying a different ring light, we were trying calmer lighting, and it would not accept. My husband had a beard, and it accepted his.” Hodges says she recently tried the same system again, and while it worked this time, she still never got her credit score.

“If you don't include people with disabilities or people with facial differences in the development of these processes, no one's going to think of these issues,” says Kathleen Bogart, a psychology professor at Oregon State University who specializes in disability research and lives with a facial difference. “AI has amplified these issues, but it's rooted in long-standing underrepresentation and prejudice towards people with facial differences that occurred long before AI was a thing.”

When face verification systems fail, it's often hard to find help—piling more pressure on a stressful situation. For months, Maryland resident Noor Al-Khaled has struggled to create an online account with the Social Security Administration. Al-Khaled, who lives with the rare cranio-facial condition Ablepheron Macrostomia, says having an online account would allow her to easily access SSA records and quickly send documents to the agency.

“I don't drive because of my vision; I should be able to rely on the site,” Al-Khaled says. “You have to take a selfie, and the pictures have to match,” Al-Khaled says. “Because of the facial difference, I don't know if it's not recognizing the ID or the selfie, but it's always saying images don't match.”

Not having that access makes life harder. “On an emotional level, it just makes me feel shut out from society,” she explains. Al-Khaled says that all services should provide alternative ways for people to access online systems. “The lack of other fallback options means that sometimes people get trapped in these labyrinths of technological systems,” says Byrum from Present Moment Enterprises.

An SSA spokesperson says alternative options to face verification are available, and it is “committed” to making its services accessible to everyone. The agency, the spokesperson says, does not run facial recognition systems itself but uses Login.gov and ID.me for verification services. The General Services Administration, which runs Login.gov, did not respond to WIRED's request for comment. “Accessibility is a core priority for ID.me,” a spokesperson for ID.me says, adding it has previously helped people with facial differences and offered to directly help Al-Khaled after WIRED was in touch.

“There are few things more dehumanizing than being told by a machine that you're not real because of your face,” says Corey R. Taylor, a New York–based actor and motivational speaker who lives with a craniofacial anomaly. Last year, Taylor says, he was using a financial app to access a small amount of money; as he tried to complete the payment processes, he found that the face verification system could not match his selfie to the image on his ID. To get the system to work, he had to move into different positions. “I had to literally raise my eyes and contort my face,” Taylor says. When he emailed the company, he got what appeared to be a boilerplate response.

“One of the main things that we are advocating for is alternative methods,” says Hannah Saunders, the head of policy and education at FEI. “There's possibly a long-term fix in terms of changing the technology, but at the moment, we're most concerned that people can apply for jobs, they can access their money, they can get through passport control with their family, and that negotiating those kinds of systems isn't as stressful as it is.”

Swift, the CEO at FEI, says the organization has been “approached” multiple times to work with businesses to address some of the issues but has not yet been able to sort out any formal arrangements. Swift says FEI wants to put the “right systems and safeguards in place” to protect its members. Also, Swift adds, “we get the sense that this is quite low down on the list of priorities [of tech companies], and therefore progress is seemingly slow.”

However, the problems extend beyond emerging technologies. Many of the people WIRED spoke to explained that they often face appearance-based bullying online, and the internet's wider pivot to short-form video content like TikTok and Instagram Reels leaves them feeling isolated. “The internet, for so long, was a safe haven for me,” Al-Khaled says. “I found my home and solace online because it was the only place where I could meet people and actually be myself without being stared at or gawked at.” Hodges says people have previously said to her that they are shocked that she can leave her house. “I feel like that's kind of transferred now to: ‘I can't believe you leave your house, and I can't believe you go online,'” she says.

At the DMV in Connecticut last year, Gardiner says that staff were able to manually override the photography system, although she did explain her facial difference to them in the process. She received her replacement temporary license that day and full license later in the mail. “I've dealt with a lot of shit when it comes to my face, but after I left, I just cried,” Gardiner recalls. “It was kind of like a reminder that yes, I'm different and I don't fit in.”

After leaving, Gardiner messaged a state representative she knew and told her about the experience, according to messages shared with WIRED. The official got in touch with the local DMV commissioner and discussed the issue plus staff training, they say.

“While we adhere to stringent guidelines to guarantee photo compliance, our employees approach their roles with empathy, ensuring they understand and address the needs of those they serve,” a DMV CT spokesperson says. “We want our residents to have professional interactions with the DMV.” A spokesperson for Idemia, which provides the DMV with technology, says it regularly offers staff training, and its algorithms have been ranked highly in external evaluations.

Gardiner says that while there was ultimately a positive response, she has heard stories of people with facial differences running into problems at the DMV in other states. “I really want to try to pressure for better protocols: What do humans do when the AI doesn't work?” she says. But with face recognition systems being used so broadly, the problem can seem insurmountable. “After that whole DMV experience, I then had to get my passport done,” Gardiner says, “and I ran into the same problem with my passport photo.”

Prepaid phone plans are for more than just setting up a burner phone. Instead of getting locked into a contract and indefinitely paying for a phone you may never actually own, prepaid phone plans promise lower prices while delivering the same coverage and speed as the major networks like AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. What's not to love?

Although prepaid phones sometimes get a bad rap, they make a lot of sense for some customers, particularly if you're partial to buying unlocked phones and owning them outright. By cutting out contracts that stipulate several lines, financing on phones like the iPhone 17 that can climb well over $1,000, and extras you may not need, like mobile hot spot coverage, prepaid phone services end up much cheaper than major carriers without big performance losses. Still, they aren't made equally. Most prepaid phone providers tap into an existing cellular network, but they have different limitations on how much access you have to that network. Here's everything you need to know.

Check out our other mobile guides, including the Best iPhones, Best Android Phones, Best Cheap Phones, Best Samsung Phones, Best Motorola Phones, and Best Google Pixel Phones.

Prepaid phone plans used to be easy to sort out, but after decades of mergers and acquisitions, the lines have gotten a little messy. The best place to start is the difference between mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) and mobile network operators (MNOs). MNOs own and operate a mobile network, and they include T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon. MVNOs use an existing network. For example, Cricket Wireless uses AT&T's network, while Google Fi relies on T-Mobile.

The lines between MNOs and MVNOs have blurred in recent years. Previously independent MVNOs like TracFone have been gobbled up by larger carriers (in this case, Verizon). Other brands used to operate mobile networks but now serve as MVNOs. A good example of that is MetroPCS, which merged with T-Mobile in 2012 and eventually became Metro by T-Mobile in 2018.

With how intertwined MVNOs and MNOs are these days, it's hard to separate them based purely on infrastructure. The more important distinction is whether your phone plan is prepaid or postpaid: With a prepaid plan, you pay for your data and time up front. With a postpaid plan, you're billed for the data you've used after you've already used it.

Beyond when you pay, there are a few other aspects that separate MVNOs from traditional MNOs:

Those are the broad differences, but you'll find smaller distinctions within MVNOs themselves. For instance, Tello Mobile is what you'd call a “full MVNO,” managing everything from marketing to billing and customer service. Boost by T-Mobile is a lighter MVNO, where aspects of service like support are more closely tied to a major carrier (in this case, T-Mobile).

It'd be great if prepaid MVNOs were cheaper than major carriers without any downsides, but that's not the case. For MVNOs, the devil's in the details. MVNOs are treated somewhat as second-class citizens on the network, at least when push comes to shove. That means you might experience slower or even throttled speeds in some cases.

MVNOs aren't forthcoming about these limitations, but you can find them spelled out in policy documentation. Let's look at Mint Mobile's network management policy as an example.

The first hurdle is deprioritization. “Other brands may be prioritized higher on the T-Mobile network,” reads Mint's network management policy. “For all Service plans, T-Mobile may also reduce speeds during times of network congestion.” These policies aren't clear about how severe the slowdown is, but generally, if a network has a lot of congestion, MVNOs will see slower speeds before those on major carriers.

In most parts of the country, this isn't a problem. However, you'll likely experience slower speeds in major cities and at large events. If you're at a concert and everyone is trying to post Instagram stories and TikToks, you'll probably notice a significant slowdown.

Another downside with most MVNOs is throttling. You'll be able to purchase an “unlimited” data plan, but there are usually soft caps to the amount of data you can use before speeds slow. Again using Mint as an example, it classifies “heavy data users” as those who use more than 35 GB of data in a month, and it says these users will “have their data usage prioritized below the data usage (including tethering) of other customers at times and at locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources, which may result in slower data speeds.”

Those are the two big drawbacks, but some smaller limitations pop up depending on the provider you look at. Mint, for instance, uses “video optimization,” which basically means video streams are capped at standard definition when using mobile data (480p). This happens automatically on the network, even if you're trying to stream a higher resolution.

I'm using Mint as a touchstone here, but these practices are common among most MVNOs. Cricket has similar data restrictions and video limitations as does Optimum Mobile. Major carriers that have direct prepaid plans, like T-Mobile, generally have higher data limits before reducing speeds.

Outside of those limitations, some MVNOs don't offer additional cellular features like roaming or a mobile hot spot. Those limitations aren't universal, but they're some good things to look out for when you're looking at providers and plans.

The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) determined decades ago that phone providers don't own phone numbers. Broadly, you're allowed to keep your number when transferring to a new carrier, regardless of whether that's a prepaid or postpaid carrier. In fact, since 2009, the FCC requires carriers to transfer—or, more properly, “port”—your number within one business day.

Under the FCC's rules, a carrier can't deny porting your number, even if you refuse to pay a porting fee. However, porting fees are allowed. Some carriers, such as T-Mobile, don't have any fees for porting your number. Others charge anywhere from a few dollars to $20.

There are situations where you can't port your number—for instance, if you're moving to a different region. Most MVNOs allow you to check if you can bring your own number over. Visible by Verizon, for example, features a portability checker on its website, along with a detailed guide on transferring your number.

Is T-Mobile an MVNO?

T-Mobile is a mobile network operator, or MNO, so it wouldn't fall under the category of an MVNO. However, T-Mobile owns several MVNOs, including Metro by T-Mobile and Mint Mobile.

Do Prepaid Phone Plans Need a Credit Check?

You generally don't need a credit check with prepaid phone plans. Virtual carriers like Metro by T-Mobile use prepaid service instead of postpaid service. You pay for your calls, texts, and data up front, while traditional carriers use a postpaid model where you're billed at the end of your billing cycle.

Although prepaid phone services don't need a credit check for the service itself, you may need a credit check if you want to finance or lease a phone. Many prepaid phone services allow you to bring your own device if you're unable to finance or lease a new phone.

Can I Bring My Own Phone to an MVNO?

Nearly all MVNOs allow you to bring your own phone. That's one of the big advantages of using an MVNO over a major carrier, in fact. You'll need an unlocked phone, however.

T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T all allow you to unlock devices that are locked to their networks, with some stipulations. For instance, Verizon keeps your device locked for 60 days from the purchase date. Regardless of the particular policy, you'll need to own the device outright before you can unlock it.

There are a ton of MVNOs, and I don't use “a ton” lightly. There are dozens and dozens of prepaid providers, absolutely, but also smaller, niche MVNOs. For instance, Secure Phone is an MVNO largely focused on selling its own GPS-tracking phone and app; the cellular service isn't the main draw. There are also plenty of MVNOs that aren't really around anymore. GoSmart Mobile, for example, still allows you to sign up for a plan on its website, but it doesn't offer anything beyond 3G speeds. I've excluded those providers.

Here's a list of MVNOs mainly focused on providing prepaid cellular service, separated by network. Most MVNOs only use a single network, but some tap into multiple networks. You'll see those names listed multiple times. I haven't included providers that use other networks for roaming. Boost Mobile, for example, uses its own network, but it taps into the T-Mobile and Verizon networks when roaming.

MVNOs on the AT&T Network

There's nothing wrong with a prepaid phone, especially today. Although prepaid plans sprang up as an alternative for customers who couldn't pass the credit checks to lease or finance a phone, that's not the case today. There are budget phones that carriers will (almost literally) give away for free, and most carriers own a handful of prepaid services for customers who don't want a contract.

You should be careful when browsing MVNOs, though. It takes little more than some startup money, a graphic designer, and a bit of promotion to spin up an MVNO—just look at Trump Mobile. MVNOs are all using existing infrastructure, so performance actually isn't as important as it seems. It's more important to pay attention to the limitations of service and customer service. That's what MVNOs provide.

Landing a new job starts with a slam-dunk CV, but Word or Google Docs will only take you so far. In an era of AI-assisted Application Tracking Systems (ATS) where applicants are rejected before a human ever lays eyes on their work experience, the best résumé builders could help you stand out from the crowd.

Yes, they'll give your résumé a pretty face with unique templates and attention-grabbing fonts, but résumé builders shouldn't just give you a PDF and send you on your way. A good online résumé builder will give tips and insights into how you can bolster your CV, as well as tools for managing your documents when applying to multiple jobs. I'm (thankfully) not in the job market right now, but it wasn't long ago that I was searching. I dusted off the résumé I used to land a job here at WIRED as a starting point to see how various online résumé builders thought I could improve.

Check out more of our web guides, like the Best Website Builders, Best VPNs, and Best Password Managers.

Is It Worth Paying for a Résumé Builder?

You don't need to pay for a résumé builder. There are loads of free templates online, and for a lot of roles, even a cleanly formatted Google Doc or Word file will get the job done. However, résumé builders are a helpful tool if you want your résumé to really stand out, particularly for highly competitive and senior roles where highlighting your skills and work experience are paramount.

The real reason to pay for a résumé builder, however, is to access additional tools that can help you land a job. From writing suggestions to cover letter templates, the best online résumé services don't just give you a template and send you on your way. They provide tools to help with searching for a job.

Should You Use ChatGPT (or any AI) to Write a Résumé?

AI tools like ChatGPT have a lot of practical applications when it comes to making a résumé, and all of the best résumé builders have AI tools built in (some of them powered by models similar to ChatGPT). Although generative AI is helpful in creating a résumé, you shouldn't use ChatGPT or other AI tools to create a résumé from scratch. There are two reasons for that.

First, many employers use Application Tracking Systems (ATS) that can pick up on AI-written résumés. Although it's not a guarantee, leaning too heavily on AI might cause your résumé to end up in a rejected pile before anyone has ever seen it. Additionally, AI still struggles with hallucinations. It may dream up skills or qualifications you don't actually have, or worse, sell your work experience short.

The best use of ChatGPT and other AI tools in creating a résumé is refinement. Generative AI can help change your tone so it's more consistent across your résumé, as well as punch up your accomplishments so they stand out. Use AI to make your résumé shine, not as a workaround for spending time to build a proper résumé.

How We Tested

For my testing, I used a real résumé that I've carried and updated through three roles over the past seven years. Rather than starting from scratch, I mainly evaluated what a résumé builder could bring to the table to enhance the CV of a professional who's already deep in their career. Putting together your work history, although nerve-wracking, isn't exactly difficult, so if you're going to pay for a résumé builder, it better bring something to the table.

Beyond offering extra value, there were a few key areas I focused on:

Design and formatting: You're here to build a résumé, not to learn graphic design. A good résumé builder should not only make design simple with a broad list of templates, but also give you easy tools to format your résumé. Splitting the résumé across different pages, cutting words short, and adding strange spacing between words doesn't cut it.

Recommendations and rewriting: It doesn't matter if a résumé builder is using AI or not, it should provide suggestions to punch up your CV. There are enough free résumé templates online, and although they may not look as nice, they get the job done. A résumé builder should give you suggestions to stand out from the crowd, not just a few templates to play with.

Additional tools: Your résumé is only one part of finding a new job. You need a cover letter, interview prep, and plenty of organization to track the status of the roles you're interested in. A good résumé builder doesn't stop at your CV; it gives you tools to use it right.

Resume.io

Resume.io (7-day Trial)

Resume.io (Quarterly)

Resume.io can help you build a great résumé; there's no doubt about that. More importantly, it provides tools to help throughout your job search. It trades blows with FlowCV (my next pick) point-for-point, and I had a hard time deciding which would rank first. Resume.io wins out with its robust list of features that go far beyond just building a CV.

It starts with your résumé. You can upload a résumé or start from scratch, and regardless of the route you take, you'll see all the details of your résumé spelled out in sections. You can add or remove sections or swap them around. All of this happens off the résumé itself, so you don't need to worry about grouping text fields together or lining everything up perfectly. Once you're done, you can easily swap between the small list of templates Resume.io offers. There aren't a ton of templates, but they aren't redundant. Each feels unique and useful, and none of them are filled with loud designs you'll probably never use.

Resume.io comes into its own after your résumé is done. Its main claim to fame is an auto-tailor feature. You enter a job listing and it will automatically update your CV for that specific role. More than anything, the auto-tailor feature weaves in keywords from the job you're looking at, highlighting how your experience may tie into certain job responsibilities. You could easily do it on your own, but the fact that Resume.io can do it with a click—and balance the keywords against the rest of your résumé—is valuable enough.

Once you have your résumé, you can back out to the Resume.io dashboard and take advantage of cover letter templates, a Kanban board where you'll see recommended jobs, a salary analyzer, and even practice interview questions. Resume.io is a résumé builder, but even after you're done putting together your CV, there are tools to help you along with your job search.

You can design a résumé and cover letter for free, but you'll only be able to download them as a text file. You'll need to upgrade to a paid plan for a PDF, which also unlocks additional features like the job board and recruiter matching, where Resume.io will shoot out your CV to recruiters based on the type of job you're looking for. You can pay quarterly or monthly, with the former offering a much better rate, but Resume.io also offers a week of access for just $3.

FlowCV

Shop at
        

FlowCV (Free)

FlowCV (Basic, Annually)

FlowCV (Pro+, Annually)

I knew almost immediately after I started using FlowCV that it'd earn a spot on this list. It's everything you want out of a résumé builder. It has excellent templates, plenty of customization, tools for tracking and modifying existing CVs, and a web application that doesn't chug or sputter out when you're working on a design. And, unlike a lot of résumé builders, FlowCV lets you design, download, and print a résumé and cover letter for free.

You can start from scratch or upload an existing résumé (either PDF or raw text), and from there, FlowCV will walk you through each section of your CV. These sections are customizable, and they don't lock you into a particular template. Some résumés may want a section for languages, while others want you to list awards. You can add or remove sections as needed, and you won't break the formatting on the template (it happens more often than you think).

Managing everything from sections makes customizing your résumé much easier. Instead of sliding around disparate text boxes and trying to line everything up perfectly, FlowCV will automatically update the layout as you change sections. For instance, I was using a two-column template for my résumé, but there was way too much information in the right column, causing my résumé to sprawl out across two pages. I was able to drag some sections over to the left column to balance the layout, and FlowCV automatically ensured everything was lined up and spaced properly.

It's this high-level customization that makes FlowCV so great. You can easily make broad changes without getting into specific text boxes or design elements. For example, there's an option to automatically flip your job title and employer based on what you want to list first.

FlowCV is my favorite résumé builder, but customizing a CV is only scratching the surface of what it can do. There are also templates for cover letters, email signatures, and online résumé websites. My favorite addition is a Kanban board. It's like Trello, but built directly into FlowCV, and it allows you to track jobs and their status as you move through the process.

You get one résumé and one cover letter for free, no strings attached. However, I recommend the Basic plan for most people, which includes three résumés, 20 cover letters, along with the online résumé feature and Kanban board. FlowCV doesn't focus on AI writing as much as other résumé builders, but if that's something you're after, you can unlock AI features with the Pro+ plan, which also includes unlimited résumé and cover letters.

Zety

Shop at
        

Zety (Free)

Zety (Pro, 14 days)

Zety (Pro, Annually)

Zety doesn't have any nonsense, which could work for or against it depending on what you're after. You don't get the Kanban board of FlowCV or the automatic optimization of Resume.io. What you do get is a straightforward builder that allows you to quickly throw together a CV and easily change it for different applications.

Like most other builders, you can start from scratch or upload your résumé. Regardless of the route you go, Zety starts with a résumé review before walking you through each section of your résumé. As you move along, Zety provides small tips to optimize your CV. For instance, I had an “experience” section listing my previous employers, and Zety recommended changing the section to “work history.” A résumé review isn't unique to Zety, but I appreciate that it happens automatically, so you can apply the suggestions while putting your résumé together.

As you move through each step, Zety uses AI recommendations for skills, work history bullet points, and more. The suggestions are surprisingly good, likely because they're based on a job title you can enter. That allows you to mock up a template and then easily swap out skills or bullet points when applying for specific roles. Make sure to read the AI suggestions first, though. Some of them play fast and loose with their claims. One suggested I highlight my “award-winning reporting,” even though there was nothing on my résumé about awards.

Once you've entered all your information, you can swap out templates and colors with a click. Zety doesn't have a ton of templates, but they're all useful. You get fewer of the loud designs you see with a tool like Canva. All of the templates in Zety are professional, and when there is a flare, it's always done with a light touch. Because the templates are so straightforward, it's easy to swap between them; I cycled through a dozen without changing a single word, and they all looked great.

You can download a text version of your résumé for free, but you'll need to pay to download a PDF or Word version. I recommend going for the annual plan if you can. There's a 14-day trial of Zety's monthly Pro Package for $2, but it renews at $26 per month after that period. The annual plan is 79 percent cheaper.

Resume Genius

Shop at
        

Resume Genius (Free)

Resume Genius (Pro, 14 days)

Resume Genius (Pro, Annually)

Resume Genius follows a similar template to the other résumé builders I looked at. You start from scratch or import your résumé, fill out the sections step-by-step, and once you're done, you can apply one of a few dozen templates, change your colors, and format your text. Resume Genius has a good variety of templates available, but they're inconsistent. Formatting will often push text to a second page if you need to print your résumé out, even if everything fits properly on another template.

The draw with Resume Genius is AI. All the résumé builders I looked at have AI features in one form or another, but the suggestions from Resume Genius were excellent. AI enhancements on other services can punch up your copy and help refine your tone. But Resume Genius provided suggestions I didn't even think of, from what skills I should list to what I should highlight from my work experience.

Each of the suggestions is based on a specific role, so it's easy to quickly spruce up your résumé for different job listings without starting from scratch. It's not quite as easy as the auto-tailor feature available from Resume.io, but then again, the final product ends up much better.

Where Resume Genius loses a few points is in features. You can put together résumés and cover letters, but the service lacks the additional job search tools available elsewhere. You don't get a Kanban board like you do with Resume.io or FlowCV, for instance.

Thankfully, you can access a lot of what Resume Genius has to offer for free. Like the other options on this list, you can only download your résumé as a text file, but Resume Genius gives away templates for Word and Google Docs for free, along with its AI summary generator. You can unlock paid features for $3 for 14 days, which adds a résumé review, digital résumé, and the full résumé builder, fit with PDF or Word downloads.

Canva: Online design suite Canva has a résumé builder, and while you can throw together a CV, it's just not built for job searching in quite the same way as the rest of our picks. Canva is ultimately a design tool, and its résumé builder fits into that mold. You'll have to individually drag all the elements of your CV around to line them up properly, and play a game of whack-a-mole between free and paid assets available through the web interface. There are some striking résumé designs, but I don't know how well they'd translate when actually applying for jobs. If you already have a Canva subscription, you can accomplish a lot if you're diligent with formatting everything correctly. For everyone else, a proper résumé builder is not only simpler, but it'll also spit out a better result once you're done.

Indeed Resume Builder: Indeed has a résumé builder that came highly recommended as I started researching, but I'm not sure why. It's serviceable and easy to use, with step-by-step instructions for filling out your work history, education, and skills. But it's less of a résumé builder and more of a tool to build your Indeed profile. That's a perfectly fine purpose, but you can't take your résumé outside the Indeed ecosystem. You don't design a résumé on Indeed. Instead, if you haven't already uploaded a résumé and added it to your account, you can add all of the information you'd normally have on a résumé to your profile. Then, you can use that to easily apply to jobs on Indeed. It works, and Indeed is certainly a massive platform for finding a job. For most folks, however, I'd recommend building a résumé with another tool and uploading it to Indeed instead.

Adobe Express: Adobe Express is powerful, with a ton of customization options and easily the boldest, most unique résumé designs I've seen. Shame it doesn't work. The résumé builder crashed for me five times when trying to design my CV in Chrome—on one of the most high-end PCs money can buy, mind you—and I eventually gave up and moved to Firefox. I was able to get my résumé built on Mozilla's browser, but I still had to slog through the most clunky interface of any of the résumé builders I tested. Adobe Express isn't just for building résumés. It's a complete online design tool, not dissimilar from Canva, but that level of power in your browser (combined with an onslaught of pop-ups asking you to pay) slows everything down considerably. Adobe Express is a good alternative to Canva, and in many ways, it's even better. But that doesn't matter much if the web app struggles to stay afloat.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.                                


by Kurt Schlosser on Oct 15, 2025 at 7:50 amOctober 15, 2025 at 8:22 am

There's no better time to check the social media accounts of your favorite sports team than when that team is winning and you want to bask in the shared experience with other fans.

The vibes are especially good right now for the Seattle Mariners, who less than a week ago dispatched the Detroit Tigers in an earth-shaking 15-inning thriller, and this week jumped to a 2-0 series lead against the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League Championship Series. 

Game 3 is at T-Mobile Park Wednesday, and a team behind the scenes will be ready to react to the next big play on the field or fan moment in the stands in hopes of transferring the energy in the ballpark across the city and region and as far as the internet will take it.

“This home stretch of the season and then into the postseason has been a really fun time for us,” said Tim Walsh, senior director of digital marketing and social media for the Mariners. “It's cool because we have a lot more eyeballs on our content now, and it allows us to really showcase what we've been doing this whole season, and even more so over the last few years.”

Walsh joined the Mariners in 2020 after managing social media for more than four years with the New York Mets. A Long Island, N.Y., native, he said it's become evident during his five years that Seattle is a baseball and sports city. And he thinks the Mariners' unique collection of players and personalities, combined with an energized fan base, make his job especially enjoyable.

Walsh works with teams across the Mariners organization, managing social accounts for everything from the Mariner Moose to T-Mobile Park to the farm system. Content creators, videographers, graphic designers and others all funnel their work to the social team for use on channels including Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and more, in search of a coveted young demographic.

“Instagram in particular for us this year has been awesome,” Walsh said, adding that the Mariners passed 1 million followers this season. “I feel like the team playing well, combined with a really good strategy and a really good group of people producing the content leads to tremendous success from a social standpoint, in terms of engagement growth and the numbers that we measure ourselves by.”

The goal is to provide a mix of content to reach many different types of fans and to serve a variety of purposes for the organization. As the only team to never reach a World Series, there's a lot of emotion around what the Mariners are trying to accomplish, and the social feeds capitalize on that to engage fans. The hype video below is a good example.

Walsh also enjoys pushing a casual “group chat mentality” that can be a relatable tone to strike, leaning heavily on memes, pop culture references and trending content. Here's a strange and simple example that drew 26,000 likes and elicited this comment: “Mariners social media manager is my hero.”

The late season and playoffs have been filled with a number of viral fan moments, spotlighted by the social team and other media organizations. There was the fan who caught Cal Raleigh's historic 60th home run ball and unselfishly handed it to a little kid, or the fan in Detroit wearing a “Dump 61 Here” shirt when he caught another Raleigh smash and got himself a meeting with Raleigh and a trip to Seattle.

“One of the things we try and do is weave our fans into all of the content that we're sharing, because they are so important. They create an incredible home field advantage, unlike anything else in baseball,” Walsh said.

Taking fans behind the scenes is also important. The Mariners have experimented with GoPro cameras in the announcer's booth to catch personalities such as Rick Rizzs calling the action. But a video last Friday night (below), captured from the perspective of pitcher Luis Castillo exiting the dugout to join his team's celebration on the field, drew national applause.

Best vibes on the planet. #SeizeTheMoment pic.twitter.com/eD5dnvmjQS

Walsh credits the players for letting the social team get close to the stories that matter to fans, like when a “hidden camera” captured Julio Rodriguez getting called up to the big leagues or when rookie Cole Young got his news and made an emotional call to his family.

“Some things are going to do better than others, but I think we're not afraid to fail,” Walsh said. “I think that's really important in the social space — trying new things and not being afraid to do things that might not click or resonate in the way that you were hoping for.”

As much as the social team prides itself on reacting to key plays or viral moments of each individual game, Walsh is equally proud of the preparation his team puts in to be able to move quickly. Captions, scripts, graphics and videos that are prepared in advance enable the team to be ready for the unpredictable. 

“We don't want to get too far ahead or jinx, but we have to prep, to be ready for what's next and to tell those stories in a fun, unique way,” Walsh said. “So that when a crazy moment happens in a game, or fans start wearing shoes on their head, we're able to jump on it.”

Seattle startup Electric Era today unveiled a sleek, interactive EV charging device that uses artificial intelligence to converse with drivers as they're juicing up their vehicles. 

The company builds electric vehicle charging systems that are typically deployed at convenience stores and other businesses. The modern-looking new unit — dubbed RetailEdge — can provide information on a vehicle's charging status, suggest how much power is required to reach the next destination, give information on loyalty points earned at a partnering business, and even tell jokes.

“This is a next generation charging dispenser that does more than just charge cars. It can talk to drivers, it can answer their questions. It can provide them an intelligent and immersive interface while they stop to charge and shop,” said CEO and co-founder Quincy Lee. 

RetailEdge incorporates in-house-designed hardware and software, including bilingual AI technology that can integrate with business partners' existing systems. The chargers also include payment interfaces. While some competitors cut costs by using off-the-shelf components, Lee said his startup achieves efficiency by developing custom solutions.

“We are a uniquely capable team of designing very low cost products that have heightened product capabilities,” he said. 

Electric Era launched in 2019 and distinguished itself by pairing its DC fast-charging systems with giant batteries to help deliver and store power needed by recharging EVs. The company has served 72,000 drivers in the past year and has 130 charging stalls deployed in roughly a dozen states. Lee said he expects those numbers to at least double by the end of next year.

The company has 40 employees and has raised $20.5 million in equity funding plus $8.9 million in debt financing.

Today's announcement comes as EV charging infrastructure continues expanding despite policy headwinds. Republican leaders recently canceled tax credits for EV purchases, but charging stations are proliferating.

Bloomberg reported that the number of public charging stations in the U.S. increased by 19% in the first nine months of this year, with 780 high-speed stations added in the third quarter alone.

“The charging map is also being filled in by restaurants and retail stores, which increasingly see [charging] cords as a way to attract customers,” Bloomberg reported — which is the sector targeted by Electric Era.

The startup will keep selling its original charging units alongside RetailEdge. Lee described his products as “cost competitive” but didn't share specifics.

Electric Era has so far avoided the charging cable thefts that plague many installations, as thieves sever the cables for the copper and other metals they contain. Lee suspects the company's units are going into locations with more activity and employee oversight, but he recognizes the vulnerability.

The issue is particularly acute in the Seattle area, where Electric Era will be installing 32 ports over roughly the next eight months. The region has been hard hit by thieves targeting not only charging sites but also utility and telecommunications infrastructure.

Lee said his team is “constantly lobbying” state leaders to pass laws that protect this sort of essential infrastructure.

Seattle entrepreneur Connor Folley has teamed up with his brother Maxwell Folley to build out Alkemi, an AI platform that aims to let employees query their organization's data in plain English — without technical skills or risk to proprietary information.

Connor Folley previously co-founded Downstream, an Amazon advertising analytics startup acquired by Jungle Scout in 2021.

He spent two years at Jungle Scout, which offers tools for Amazon sellers, and said he saw “how the world's most valuable knowledge remained trapped, out of reach for the frontline workers who needed it most.”

Alkemi's technology is designed to help non-technical employees make decisions directly from company data. The company's product, DataLab, connects directly to platforms like Snowflake, Databricks, and Looker, and can also be integrated into AI agents and apps through MCP-compatible endpoints. 

The company said it aims to offer the speed and usability of tools like ChatGPT without the privacy tradeoffs that come from uploading proprietary files to public models.

DataLab does not upload or train on customer data, and its answers include traceable logic and sources.

Alkemi enters a crowded and fast-moving market. A growing wave of startups and enterprise vendors are pitching “AI copilots for data,” promising to democratize analytics while keeping information secure. 

The 7-person company has raised $1.65 million in pre-seed funding, led by Tuesday Capital with participation from DNX, MGV, and other angel investors — all of whom previously backed Folley at Downstream.

Before launching Downstream in 2018, Folley was a marketing manager at Amazon. Maxwell Folley sold his last startup Caravel, a conversational intelligence platform, to Commsor.

Cybersecurity and networking company F5 disclosed that a “highly sophisticated” nation-state threat actor infiltrated its internal systems this summer, stealing portions of the company's BIG-IP source code and details about software vulnerabilities.

The Seattle-based company disclosed the incident Wednesday in an SEC filing and a customer memo, saying the attacker maintained “long-term, persistent access” to some of its product development and engineering systems before the breach was contained.

F5 said it learned of the intrusion on Aug. 9, and that the U.S. Department of Justice authorized a delay in public disclosure. The company said it believes its containment efforts have been successful and that it has seen no new unauthorized activity.

F5 shares were down more than 3% in early trading Wednesday.

Some of the breached files contained configuration details for a small percentage of customers, the company said, and those customers are being notified directly.

F5 said it has no evidence that the attackers accessed CRM or financial data, or tampered with its software supply chain. Independent reviews by NCC Group and IOActive confirmed that the company's build and release systems were not modified.

The company also said the attackers did not reach its other major product lines, including NGINX, F5 Distributed Cloud Services, or Silverline.

F5 released software updates for several products, including BIG-IP, F5OS, and BIG-IP Next, urging customers to patch immediately. F5 is providing a threat-hunting guide and new tools to help users harden systems and monitor for suspicious activity.

F5 is one of Seattle's largest public tech companies, with a market capitalization around $19 billion and thousands of enterprise customers worldwide, including 80% of the Fortune Global 500. Its hardware and software sit in the middle of much of the world's internet traffic, providing load-balancing, application delivery, and security services for major corporations and government agencies.

While F5 products themselves have been targeted in the past — including a vulnerability in 2020 and the “Velvet Ant” malware campaign uncovered in 2024 — this appears to be the first publicly disclosed breach of F5's internal systems.

Separately, F5 announced Wednesday that Michael Montoya resigned from the company's board and became its chief technology operations officer. Montoya was most recently COO at New York-based cybersecurity company BlueVoyant. 

F5 reported revenue growth of 12% to $780 million in its most recently fiscal earnings, with GAAP net income of $190 million, up from $144 million in the year-ago period.

Apple on Wednesday announced its new M5 chip along with the new iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and Vision Pro, all powered by the new chip.

These devices are now available for preorder, with shipping and in-store availability expected on October 22.

The M5 chip will allow the new devices to run faster than their predecessors. Apple says the chip has over four times the peak GPU compute performance compared to the M4. Johny Srouji, Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Technologies, added in a statement that it “ushers in the next big leap in AI performance for Apple silicon.” 

For the new iPad Pro, Apple touts that the chip brings “up to 3.5x the AI performance” of last year's Pro and up to 5.6x faster than the iPad Pro with M1.

Other upgrades include Apple's C1X cellular modem with up to 50% faster cellular data performance and the N1 chip for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Thread connectivity. Additionally, the new iPad Pro has faster storage read and write speeds and faster charging of up to 50% in around 30 minutes.

Adding more power to the iPad Pro seems like a logical step for Apple to take, as the tech giant is pushing it to feel more like a laptop. With iPadOS 26, the tablet is getting more intuitive window displays, the Preview app, and the ability to create folders for better organization. 

The pricing starts at $999 for the 11-inch model and $1,299 for the 13-inch, with color options in black and silver.

The new 14-inch MacBook Pro is expected to be even faster than its predecessor, featuring upgraded graphics performance (up to 1.6 times better), a higher memory bandwidth of 153Gbps (increased from M4's 120Gbps), and improved storage speeds.

It also boasts a battery life of up to 24 hours.

The price starts at $1,599, and it is available in space black and silver.

Vision Pro is also set to receive the M5 chip, replacing the current M2.

The M5 chip enhances display rendering by 10%, supports refresh rates up to 120Hz (up from 100Hz), and accelerates AI-powered features, making them 50% faster. Additionally, battery life improves by 30 minutes, providing up to 2.5 hours of general use and three hours of video playback.

The upgraded Vision Pro also comes with a Dual Knit Band to give users a more comfortable fit. It's available in small, medium, and large. The price remains at $3,499.

The announcement of the new Vision Pro follows reports that Apple is shifting its focus toward developing smart glasses instead of overhauling its VR headset.

Semiconductor design company Arm is partnering up with Meta to enhance the social media giant's AI systems amid an unprecedented infrastructure buildout. Under the partnership, Meta's ranking and recommendation systems will move to Arm's Neoverse platform, which was recently optimized for AI systems in the cloud, among other implementations.

“AI is transforming how people connect and create,” Santosh Janardhan, Meta's head of infrastructure, said in a statement. “Partnering with Arm enables us to efficiently scale that innovation to the more than 3 billion people who use Meta's apps and technologies.”

Best known for its mobile CPU architecture, Arm's GPU offerings have often been overshadowed by competitors like Nvidia. But Arm is now emphasizing its advantage in low-power deployments.

“AI's next era will be defined by delivering efficiency at scale,” Rene Haas, Arm's CEO, said in a statement. “Partnering with Meta, we're uniting Arm's performance-per-watt leadership with Meta's AI innovation.”

The multi-year partnership comes as Meta invests in vastly expanding its data center network to keep pace with anticipated demand for AI services. One project, code-named “Prometheus,” is expected to come online with multiple gigawatts of power in 2027. Construction is currently underway in New Albany, Ohio, and a 200-megawatt natural gas project is being constructed to directly serve the project's power needs.

Meta is also building a data center campus, code-named “Hyperion,” across 2,250 acres in northwest Louisiana that's meant to deliver 5 gigawatts of computational power when complete. Construction is expected to continue through 2030, although some portions may come online before then.

Crucially, Arm and Meta are not exchanging ownership stakes or significant physical infrastructure, setting this partnership apart from a number of recent AI infrastructure deals. Nvidia has been particularly aggressive with its investments — it recently committed to a $100 billion phased investment into OpenAI, as well as billion-dollar investments into Elon Musk's xAI, Mira Murati's Thinking Machines Lab, and French AI lab Mistral.

A rival to both Nvidia and Arm, AMD recently committed to supplying OpenAI with 6 gigawatts worth of compute capacity. As part of the deal, OpenAI will receive AMD stock options worth as much as 10% of the company.

Video editing app VSCO is adding a set of new AI image editing tools, support for high-resolution RAW files, non-destructive edits, and content-aware region detection.

The AI tools will be housed in a new tab called “AI Labs,” which also brings AI-powered object removal chops, similar to Google and Apple's homegrown offerings.

You can highlight or draw a circle around an object in a picture, and VSCO will replace it with what it thinks matches the background. The company said it uses “intelligent area detection” to blend the background in after an object is removed without affecting the resolution or color.

Unlike most AI-powered removal tools that leave artifacts at times, VSCO claims its tool is more precise and preserves details, and is therefore better suited for professional photographers.

The company said that it will soon launch another AI-powered feature called Upscale, which claims to increase the resolution of images and sharpen details without compromising on details or composition.

VSCO is using Black Forest Labs' FLUX.1 Kontext model to power these features.

The AI Labs features are available on VSCO's Pro tier, which costs $12.99 a month, or $60 a year, on the VSCO Studio app on iOS. The company is not setting a limit on the number of times users can use AI Labs features.

“Since our inception, VSCO has supported authentic creative expression and has provided photographers with many ways to achieve their desired success . We see how much AI is impacting photography, and are focused on bringing AI tools to our community that are designed specifically to support photographers in achieving creative excellence while respecting the art of their photography,” Eric Wittman, VSCO's CEO, said in a statement.

The company has been bolstering its toolset to better compete with editing tools. In May, it launched an AI-powered whiteboard to let photographers and their potential clients collaborate on projects, and last year launched a marketplace to match photographers with clients. Earlier this year, it launched Workspace to help them manage bookings and schedules.

Spotify on Wednesday upgraded its AI DJ feature — available to Premium subscribers — with a handful of new features, including the ability to send in your requests by typing, not just using voice commands. 

The feature works with both English and Spanish requests, as Spotify's Spanish-language DJ, called DJ Livi, now accepts music requests. 

The AI DJ feature was updated earlier this year to accept voice requests, instead of only playing tunes Spotify thinks that you'll like. However, that feature was only available to the English-language AI DJ until today.

Texting with an AI assistant is now a common behavior, thanks to the rising popularity of AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini. These services allow for multi-modal inputs, meaning you can either talk, text, or upload images and files as part of your request. As more people have gotten used to shifting back and forth between input methods, Apple rolled out a version of its Siri assistant that can also be reached by text.

It's a natural next step for Spotify's AI feature to accept text input, as well, given that users are often engaged with the streaming service when out and about, commuting, or in a quiet space where they don't want to disturb others by issuing voice commands. 

In addition to the new texting feature, Spotify says that the AI DJ will also now offer personalized prompt suggestions to help inspire you if you're not sure what you want to listen to next. 

To access the DJ, you simply search for the term “DJ” on Spotify and then press play to start your curated selection of music. If you want to change the music, you can tap the DJ button in the bottom-right of the screen, then offer your suggestion via voice or text. 

Spotify notes the DJ can handle requests that combine genre, mood, artist, or activity. The feature is currently live in English and Spanish in over 60 markets worldwide.

At the moment, the only legitimate uses of `pull_request_target` are for things like labeling and auto-commenting on third-party PRs. But there's no reason for these actions to have default write access to the repository; GitHub can and should be able to grant fine-grained or (even better) single-use tokens  that enable those exact operations.(This is why zizmor blanket-flags all use of `pull_request_target` and other dangerous triggers[1]).[1]: https://docs.zizmor.sh/audits/#dangerous-triggers

However, it's worth noting that you don't (necessarily) need `pull_request_target` for the OIDC credential in a private repo: all first-party PRs will get it with the `pull_request` event. You can configure the subject for that credential with whatever components you want to make it deterministic.

reply

The best move would be for github to have a setting for allowing the automation to run on PRs that don't have clean merges, off by default and intended for use with linters only really. Until that happens though pull_request_target is the only game in town to get around that limitation. Much to my and other SecDevOps engineers sadness.NOTE: with these external tools you absolutely cannot do the merge manually in github unless you want to break the entire thing. It's a whole heap of not fun.

GitHub has written a series of blog posts[1] over the years about ""pwn requests,"" which do a great job of explaining the problem. But the misleading documentation persists, and has led to a lot of user confusion where maintainers mistakenly believe that any use of `pull_request_target` is somehow more secure than `pull_request`, when the exact opposite is true.[1]: https://securitylab.github.com/resources/github-actions-prev...

But then in a pull request, the CI/CD pipeline actually runs untrusted code.Getting this distinction correct 100% of the time in your mental model is pretty hard.For the base case, where you maybe run a test suite and a linter, it's not too bad. But then you run into edge cases where you have to integrate with your own infrastructure (either for end2end tests, or for checking if contributors have CLAs submitted, or anything else that requires a bit more privs), and then it's very easy byte you.

To make things worse, GitHub has made certain operations on PRs (like auto-labeling and leaving automatic comments) completely impossible unless the extremely dangerous version (`pull_request_target`) is used. So this is a case of incentive-driven insecurity: people want to perform reasonable operations on third-party PRs, but the only mechanism GitHub Actions offers is a foot-cannon.

reply

>> It is not possible for xargs to be used securelyHowever, the security issue this warning relates to is not the one that's applicable here. The one here is possible to avoid by using -- at the end of the command.

Eh...  That is taken out of context quite a bit, that sentence does continue.  Just do `cat ""$HOME/changed_files"" | xargs -r editorconfig-checker --` and this specific problem is fixed.

If you have to opt in to safe usage at every turn, then it's an unsafe way of doing things.

(This is traditionally a non-issue, since the whole point is to execute code. So this isn't xargs' fault so much as it's the undying problem of tools being reused across privilege contexts.)

reply

For sure though, this can get tricky, but I am not really aware of an alternative. :/  Since the calling convention is just an array of strings, there is no generic way to handle this without knowing what program you are calling and how it handles command line.  This is not specific to xargs...Well, I guess FFI would be a way, but it seems like a major PITA to have to figure out how to call a golang function from bash shell just to ""call"" a program.

Right, it's just that xargs surfaces it easily. I suspect most people don't realize that they're fanning arbitrary arguments into programs when they use xargs to fan input files.

Instead you need:

So, just hire one of those ""account aging"" services?Because if you expect people to go there keeping everything up to date, posting new stuff, tracking interactions for 3 years and only after that they can hope to get any gain from the account... That's not reasonable.

It is a little wild how many things expect to communicate with the internet, even if you tell them not to.Example: the Cline plugin for vscode has an option to turn off telemetry, but even then it tries to talk to a server on every prompt, even when using local ollama.

It became clear that it was a scam when I started asking about the project. He said they were a software consulting company mostly based out of China and Malaysia that was looking to expand into the US and that they focused on ""backend, frontend, and AI development"" which made no sense as I have no experience in any of those (my who wants to be hired post was about ML and scientific computing stuff). He said as part of my evaluation they were going to have me work on something for a client and that I would have to install some software so that one of their senior engineers could pair with me. At this point he also sent me their website and very pointedly showed me that his name was on there and this was real.After that I left. I'll look for the site they sent me but I'd imagine it's probably down. It just looked like a generic corporate website.

As with OP's case, do not accept take home assignments unless they are FANG famous or very close to that.In addition, opacity about opportunities should be #1 flag. There is no reason for someone serious to be opaque about filling a role and then increasing the amount of vetting. Also there is no reason to not telling you salary (this alone will help you filter out low paying jobs) for the same reason.Usually hiring managers will look to always filter down list of candidates not increase them (unless they were lazy or looking to waste time).

I remember replying to a ""recruiter"" that I thought was legit.  I told him my salary requirements and my skill set and even gave him a copy of my resume.  I think that was the ""scam"" though.  I gave a pretty highball salary and was told that there was totally a job that would fit.  I think he just wanted my info and sharing my resume (with my email & phone) was probably want he wanted.  I'm not sure if that lead to more spam calls/emails, but it certainly didn't lead to a job.The worst is I get emails from people asking to use my Upwork account.  They ask because their account ""got blocked"" and they need to use mine or they are in a ""different country"" and thus can't get jobs (or get paid less).  Usually they say that they'll do the work, but they need to use my PC and Upwork account, and I'll get a cut.Obviously, those are fake.  There's no way I'm letting someone use my account or remote into my PC for any reason.

Embedded into this story about being attacked is (hopefully) a serious lesson for all programmers (not just OP) about pulling down random dependencies/code and just yolo'ing them into their own codebases. How do you know your real project's dependencies also don't have subtle malware in them? Have you looked at all of them? Do you regularly audit them after you update? Do you know what other SDKs they are using? Do you know the full list of endpoints they hit?How long do we have until the first serious AI coding agent poisoning attack, where someone finds a way to trick coding assistants into inserting malware while a vibe-coder who doesn't review the code is oblivious?

reply

Supply side attacks are real, and they're here. Attackers attack core developers, then get their code into repositories. As happened this year to the npm package eslint-config-prettier, and last year to the Cyberhaven Chrome extension. Attackers use social engineering to get developers to hand over control of lesser used packages, which they then compromise. As happened in 2021 with the npm package ua-parser-js, and separately with the Chrome extension The Great Suspender. (I'm picking on Chrome because I wanted examples that impact non-developers. I'm only picking on npm because it turned up quickly when I looked for examples.)The exact social engineering attack described by the OP is also not new. https://www.csoonline.com/article/3479795/north-korean-cyber... was published last year, and describes this being used at scale by North Korea. Remember, even if you don't have direct access to anything important, a sophisticated attacker may still find you useful as part of a spearphishing campaign aimed at someone else. Because a phishing attack that actually comes from a legitimate friend's account may succeed, where a faked message would not. And a company whose LinkedIn shows real developers, is more compelling than one without.

I have no ""hard rules"" on how to appraise a dependency. In addition to the above, I also like to skim the issue tracker, skim code for a moment to get a feel for quality, skim the docs, etc.  I think that being able to quickly skim a project and get a feel for quality, as well as knowing when to dig deeper and how deep to dig are what makes someone a seasoned developer.And beware of anyone who has opinions on right vs. wrong without knowing anything about your project and it's risk appetite. There's a whole range between ""I'm making a microwave website"" and ""I'm making software that operates MRIs.""

If each developer can audit some portion of their dep tree and reuse prior cached audits, maybe it's tractable to actually get “eyeballs” on every bit of code?Not as good as human audit of course, but could improve the Pareto-frontier for cost/effectiveness (ie make the average web dev no-friction usecase safer).

You can't, end of story. ChatGPT is nothing more than an unreliable sniff test even if there were no other problems with this idea.Secondly, if you re-analyzed the same malicious script over and over again it would eventually pass inspection, and it only needs to pass once.

It will have to involve identity (public key), reputation (white list?), and signing their commits and releases (private key).

https://github.com/skorokithakis/doxYou could have a command like ""python3.14"" that will run that version of Python in a Docker container, mounting the current directory, and exposing whatever ports you want.This way you can specify the version of the OS you want, which should let you run things a bit more easily. I think these attacks rely largely on how much friction it is to sandbox something (even remembering the cli flags for Docker, for example) over just running one command that will sandbox by default.

I forked the project for future reference and was later contacted by a French cybersecurity researcher who found my repo, and deobfuscated code that they had obfuscated. He figured out that it pointed to North Korean servers and notified me that those types of attacks were getting very common.The group responsible for this activity is known as CL-STA-0240. When it works, the attack installs BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, and OtterCookie as backdoors.Here is some more info on these types of attacks:

Docker is not a sandbox. How many times does this needs to be repeated? If you are lazy, I would highly suggest to use incus for spinning up headless VMs in a matter of seconds

But it's best to just run a dev environment in a VM. Keep in mind that sophisticated attacks may seek to compromise the built binary.

Lol jk. The Mykola Yanchii profile checked out, as a sibling comment notes, and it was indeed super sketch. And this is the reason why if someone asks that I install spyware on my computer as part of their standard anticheat measures during the screening process (actually happened to me) my response is no, and fuck you.But it was written largely by LLM, and I feel the seriousness with which I take it being lowered. It's plausible that the guy behind this blog post is real, and just proompted his AI assistant ""write me a blog post about how I almost got hacked during a job interview, and cover this, this, this, and this""... but are there mistakes in the account that slipped through? Or maybe there's a hidden primrose path of belief that I'm being led down? I dunno, I just have an easier time taking things at face value if I believe that an actual human hand wrote them. Call it a form of the uncanny valley effect.

Okay, I stopped reading here. This is a notorious vector in the web3 space for years.Another way this occurs if you are in that space is you'll get DMs on X about testing out a game because of your experience in the space, or being eligible for an airdrop by being an earliest contributor, and its all about running some alpha code base.

If only there were some way to release the source code for your userland programs so that the computing public could look at the code, then offer a fix for a bug such as this.Unfortunately, so far as I'm aware, there is no way to do this and having a few people who are working against what has to be a large number of deadlines look at extremely low-level code for very sophisticated software is the only way forward for these things.

At the lower price points you have the AMD machines which are significantly cheaper, even though they're slower and with worse support. Then there's apple's with higher memory bandwidth and even the nvidia agx Thor is faster in GPU compute at the cost of worse CPU and networking, and at the 3-4K price point even a threadripper system becomes viable that can get significantly more memory

Apple isn't quite ready to release its top-end MacBooks yet. But as a pity prize for getting through the awful year of 2025, the engineers on Apple's campus in Cupertino, California, have a new MacBook Pro with M5 to tide you over. Better yet, Apple claims this new 14-inch MacBook Pro offers better battery life than before.

The new MacBook Pro looks very, very similar to last year's MacBook Pro with M4. It's still using the same Liquid Retina XDR mini LED display as previous iterations did. Of course, that means it still has the notch hanging over the screen, like a guillotine blade on the edge of a terrible descent, not to mention the same Magic Keyboard design that's become standard across Mac products. If you were hoping we would finally receive the windfall of OLED on Mac, you'll probably have to wait until next year at the earliest.

Apple claims the new M5 chip is built specifically for AI and graphics performance. The new version of the M-series silicon includes new GPU cores, and each is packed with a neural accelerator. This is supposed to offer 3.5 times better AI performance than the previous generation—but let's be honest, you really care about how it will perform on graphics-intensive tasks. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M5's 10-core GPU promises 1.6 times faster graphics performance in some creative apps compared to the M4 chip. It should have better multi-thread performance for longer workloads, which may benefit code compiling or video editing. As for the 10-core CPU, it's propped up by four performance cores and six efficiency cores, promising 15% better multi-thread performance over M4. That could mean slightly faster performance in some video editing apps. The new iPad Pro and Vision Pro both sport a new M5 chip.

Apple promised the new MacBooks with M5 will run graphics workflows better with an enhanced ray tracing engine for more realistic lighting effects in 3D applications and games. The GPU also features enhanced shader cores to hopefully optimize games for the laptop. Many of these upgrades may not seem like big deals to everybody but the most hardcore Mac users. Apple made a big deal about upgrading the system's SSD storage speeds. This may make importing or exporting large RAW image files and videos faster. Buyers can now opt for up a 4TB SSD, as well.

As for battery life, Apple promised a 24-hour battery life, though that number is likely based on video playback tests, which normally support higher battery benchmarks. Still, even an 18-hour battery life would be a big benefit for regular users. The device will otherwise support fast charging through the MagSafe port—promising 0 to 50% in 30 minutes.

This will be the first MacBook to ship with macOS 26 Tahoe, which means you'll have to get used to Liquid Glass and changes to the Spotlight function sooner rather than later. The new MacBook Pro starts at $1,600 with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage. You'll need to spend $1,800 for a version with 1TB of storage and a whopping $2,000 for a model with 24GB of RAM. The device is up for preorder now, and units should start shipping Oct. 22, according to Apple. The MacBook is available in the usual Space Black and Silver colors.

Apple is effectively replacing the base M4 MacBook Pro with the M5 version. The M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBooks remain for the time being. Reliable leakers have suggested that a new MacBook Pro, powered by the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, could come next year, potentially with an upgraded chip design. Intel recently debuted its Panther Lake mobile chips with a unique design that expands the size of the GPU, or graphics processing unit. Panther Lake uses a die-to-die bridge to connect its GPU and CPU, meaning the former can be larger than it could be if the two were housed on the same die. Perhaps Apple is taking a similar approach with its upcoming chips. An upgraded GPU would make sense, considering that the company is pushing gaming on Mac far more than it has in previous years.

Whatever delights may be in store for Mac fans in 2026, at least Apple is signifying that it's not going to raise the prices of its lower-end models, even as it sits in the eye of President Donald Trump's tariff storm. Next year, however, could bring even more hardship to big tech's supply chains. We'll have to see if the company's current pricing scheme can survive.

Apple's Vision Pro is getting its first big upgrade since its release, and just like all the products Apple announced today, everything centers on the M5 chip. According to Apple, the introduction of the M5 brings quite a few benefits to the Vision Pro experience, including “10% more pixels on the custom micro-OLED displays,” which should equate to a sharper, better-defined viewing experience. A new 10-core GPU architecture will also enable ray tracing and very likely make gaming feel even more immersive, particularly when it comes to rendering light and shadow.

On top of that, the M5 will bump the Vision Pro's refresh rate to 120Hz, helping to reduce ghosting and make watching pretty much any experience involving lots of motion look even smoother. If you're worried about AI performance, the M5 will also perform better on that front. Apple says native AI experiences like Personas and spatial video run 50% faster, which may not be the most important metrics in the world, but they will be a boon to those who don't like waiting around for things to load. As you might expect from Apple silicon, the M5 sounds like a step up generation-to-generation, but it's not just about performance; the chip is also bringing much-needed battery improvements.

Apple says the M5 Vision Pro is rated for 2.5 hours of general use and three hours of video playback. That last one is especially important considering that the Vision Pro is still positioned as the best headset for long-form content thanks to its premium display. Speaking of wearing the Vision Pro for hours at a time, Apple is also introducing a new Dual Knit Band that has both upper and lower straps. That might not sound like the most mind-blowing upgrade, but having used the previous Vision Pro myself, I predict that extra support will go a long way, especially since the headset weighs between 600 and 650 grams. The band will also be sold separately for $99.

One thing you won't be getting in this generation is a discount. With the M5 and upgraded head strap, the price this generation will remain the same—which is to say, $3,500. That's a heck of a lot of money for a headset, but if you're in the market for a very expensive toy and have the cash to spare, this Vision Pro is shaping up to be the best, most performant one you can buy.

You can preorder the M5 Apple Vision Pro starting today, and the headset hits shelves on Oct. 22.

Apple's top-end iPad models will be first in line to showcase Apple's more powerful silicon, just as the iPad Pro with M4 did last generation. The new M5 iPad Pro is thin—even slimmer than the latest iPad Air—and it packs the same tandem OLED display and 11- and 13-inch flavors. It may essentially be a spec bump over last year's Pro model, but if you were planning on running endless tiled windows with iPadOS 26, that still makes it your best bet.

The new M5 chip is the highlight. It promises faster AI performance than its M4 predecessor thanks to new neural engines built into each of the 10 GPU cores. That could lead to 3.5 times better performance when using apps that leverage AI. The new iPad Pro also includes what appears to be the same 10-core CPU—with four performance and six efficiency cores—as the new MacBook Pro 14 with M5. This means an enhanced ray-tracing engine is coming to Apple's tablets, and that the new iPad Pro could be slightly better than the M4 silicon at 3D rendering.

Beyond the chip bump, the new iPads now support options for Apple's own optional C1X cellular modem and N1 wireless chip that debuted in the iPhone 17. Apple also promoted similar memory write and read speeds to the M5 MacBook Pro 14. Memory bandwidth has jumped to 150GB per second, which should make multitasking slightly faster on the new version than it was on the 2024 iPad Pro. Otherwise, the 11- and 13-inch models both support WiFi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread connectivity.

Why do you need a more powerful Apple tablet? Well, beyond the creative apps that require more horsepower, Apple promoted that the latest updates to iPadOS would enable users to have multiple apps on their screens at once. You'll still find your workspace constrained—even if you opt for the larger screen—but if you were planning on using your tablet for multitasking with several intensive programs running in the background, you may be better off with the more expensive iPad.

The 11-inch model of the new M5 iPad Pro starts at $1,000; you'll need to shell out $1,300 for the 13-inch version. Each comes with 256GB of storage at base, and if you jump for the 2TB options, prepare to spend $2,000 or more. That's without opting for 5G connectivity, the $130 Apple Pencil Pro, and the $300 Magic Keyboard. All options start shipping Oct. 22

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has greatly reshaped the country's public health infrastructure since taking over as U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary during the renewed Trump administration—and not for the better.

Still, from RFK Jr.'s pledge to take on fictional chemtrails to his recent fearmongering about circumcisions and autism, it might be hard for the average person to keep track of Kennedy's many inane beliefs related to health and wellness. So here's a handy guide to the supplements and alternative treatments that RFK Jr. has either advocated for or may personally be taking right this moment, and why they're probably not worth the hype.

Earlier this February, a viral video showed RFK Jr. dropping doses of a blue liquid into a glass of water during a flight. Though the exact nature of this concoction remains unconfirmed, internet sleuths concluded that he was likely taking methylene blue, a synthetic dye that's become a popular remedy among the alternative medicine community.

Methylene blue is commonly used as a diagnostic dye for some medical tests. It's also the primary treatment for methemoglobinemia, a rare blood disorder caused by the overproduction of methemoglobin, a form of hemoglobin. Online, however, the dye has taken on a second life as an advertised cure-all for everything under the Sun, from cancer to Alzheimer's disease.

Methylene blue has a long history in medicine, and it's certainly possible that scientists will find new uses for the versatile substance. But the most boisterous claims made by its adherents are often based on preliminary studies that still need more follow-up. The cancer studies on methylene blue, for instance, have largely involved animal or lab experiments. Some research has also suggested that methylene blue's anti-cancer effects would likely work best in combination with light therapy, not taken alone. And some studies have failed to support the supposed brain-boosting abilities of the dye.

All of which is to say: it's probably not time yet for all of us to start dosing our morning coffee with methylene blue.

The well-built Kennedy has admitted numerous times to taking testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) as a part of an anti-aging regimen prescribed by his doctors. He's also taken pains to deny that he uses steroids—a distinction without much difference (testosterone is a steroid, and many people use synthetic versions of it to build up muscle).

Men typically experience a gradual decline of testosterone as they age. And doctors commonly do prescribe TRT to men with lower than usual levels of testosterone, a condition that can be caused by various factors but is more common in men over 60. For these patients, TRT is generally safe and can provide numerous health benefits, including restored sex drive and improved mental health and energy. But many men continue to have normal testosterone levels long into their later years, and it's not at all clear whether TRT should be used to prolong healthy aging for the average man.

In the past, the Food and Drug Administration has warned the public about taking TRT solely to address “low testosterone levels due to aging,” noting that the benefits and safety of this use are not firmly established. Though research has suggested that typical TRT doesn't raise the risk of conditions like prostate cancer or heart attacks, it may be more dangerous for people who have normal levels of testosterone to begin with.

During a 2023 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, RFK Jr. stated that he was on an extensive regimen of vitamin supplements—adding that he couldn't even remember the entire list of them because he took so many.

Vitamin and mineral supplements can absolutely benefit people who are deficient in specific nutrients. Certain supplements are also an important preventative treatment at times, such as the recommended use of prenatal folic acid among pregnant women to prevent birth defects.

Today, people typically get these needed nutrients from food. By and large, studies haven't backed the idea that supplements are a cure-all for a wide range of health problems, as many in Kennedy's corner tend to profess. A 2018 review failed to find evidence that nutritional supplements generally improve heart health, for instance, as did a 2019 review the following year. Another review in 2021 found that supplements provide little help for losing weight.

These products aren't just worthless for most—they carry their own unique health risks. Compared to FDA-approved drugs, the supplement industry is much less regulated. These products can often contain toxic contaminants like fungi and bacteria, or even actual hidden drugs. And the supplements themselves can cause serious harm if taken in large or chronic enough doses.

In an interview on Gary Brecka's Ultimate Human Podcast earlier this June, RFK Jr. made clear his intentions to open up the floodgates of alternative medicine. He announced that he would expand people's access to experimental and off-label treatments, specifically referencing two treatments in particular: stem cell therapy and chelation.

Chelation drugs bind to heavy metals in the body, which then allows them to be excreted out through urine. Doctors routinely use chelation to treat certain kinds of acute poisoning or other toxic exposures. But in the alt med/MAHA world, chelation is instead used to “cleanse” people of supposed toxins blamed for a bevy of chronic illnesses, including autism. People have gotten seriously hurt or even died after taking improper chelation, and the FDA has warned the public to stay away from chelation therapy for autism.

These dangers might be an acceptable risk for RFK Jr. During the same interview, Kennedy admitted that expanded access to these treatments would likely come with a cost. “And of course you're going to get a lot of charlatans, and you're going to get people who have bad results,” he said. “And ultimately, you can't prevent that either way. Leaving the whole thing in the hands of pharma is not working for us.”

Kennedy is perhaps most well known for his fervent opposition to vaccination, complete with a long track record of misrepresenting the safety and effectiveness of many vaccines, including the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine.

During the height of a large-scale measles outbreak in Texas earlier this year—the largest seen in the state in three decades—RFK Jr. begrudgingly endorsed the use of the MMR vaccine. But he also tried to prop up several alternative treatments, namely cod liver oil, a supplement known for having high levels of vitamin A.

People deficient in vitamin A are at greater risk for a severe measles infection, and the World Health Organization does recommend that doctors provide vitamin A to measles-infected children living in areas where deficiency is common. But that doesn't describe the U.S. at all, since only around 0.3% of the general population may have a vitamin A deficiency. What's more, Kennedy's advice likely actually endangered children. At least one hospital in the state reported treating several children who had both measles and vitamin A toxicity.

RFK Jr. is an avid fan of unpasteurized, raw milk. He's said that he drinks it regularly, and earlier this May, he celebrated the release of his “Make America Healthy Again” report by doing raw milk shooters as part of a podcast interview with wellness influencer Paul Saladino.

Advocates commonly claim that raw milk tastes better than milk that's gone through pasteurization. Some will take it a step further and argue that raw milk has numerous added health benefits, from better nutrition to even helping prevent lactose intolerance.

The taste difference might come from raw milk having slightly more fat than your typical store-brand carton, experts have said. But the process of pasteurization, which simply heats and then cools milk to kill off dangerous germs and extend shelf life, doesn't dramatically change milk at all. You get the same important nutrients from pasteurized milk as you do from raw milk, and raw milk contains the same kind of lactose, so your tummy will hurt just the same if you're already intolerant to lactose in general.

Raw milk is significantly more likely to carry dangerous, or at least misery-inducing, foodborne germs like Salmonella, Listeria, and Campylobacter. The ongoing threat of bird flu and its recent spread to dairy cows has also made raw milk a potential vector for these infections as well. Unfortunately, many right-wingers and RFK Jr. supporters appear to have only become more enamored with raw milk as of late.

Apple's 3nm M5 is here


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Cupertino just launched its 5th-generation Apple silicon, the M5 chip, with the company saying that it has embedded a neural accelerator in each GPU core, allowing it to run AI workloads much faster. Aside from that, Apple says that the base M5 chip now has a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU, giving the newer processor two extra cores in both the graphics and general compute departments compared to the previous generation's entry-level SoC.

“M5 ushers in the next big leap in AI performance for Apple silicon. With the introduction of Neural Accelerators in the GPU, M5 delivers a huge boost to AI workloads,” Apple Senior Vice President of Hardware Technologies Johny Srouji said. “Combined with a big increase in graphics performance, the world's fastest CPU core, a faster Neural Engine, and even higher unified memory bandwidth, M5 brings far more performance and capabilities to MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Apple Vision Pro.”

Although it still uses 3nm technology from TSMC, the N3P process node used on the M5 (versus N3E on the M4) delivers improved capability through slightly higher transistor density. The company says that it has four times the peak GPU performance when it comes to AI processing over the M4, and that it offers up to 45% better graphics quality, plus third-generation ray tracing capability. There's also a 30% bump in memory bandwidth, with the speed going from 120GB/sec to 153GB/sec in the M5, and, of course, a 15% improvement in multithreaded performance.

Apple's press release mostly focuses on the chip's better performance in artificial intelligence workloads, but we're also hopeful that these numbers will translate to a better gaming experience on the Mac. Unfortunately, we don't know how the chip will perform compared to its competitors from AMD and Nvidia in the 14-inch MacBook Pro, as we haven't seen benchmarks yet. However, a leaked Geekbench result of an M5-powered iPad Pro showed the base M5 matching the M4 Max and beating every other competitor in the single-core test.

Those who want to be on the latest, cutting-edge Apple hardware can now pre-order the Apple M5 chip inside the MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Apple Vision Pro. The company expects these devices to ship on the 22nd, with in-store availability arriving on the same day.

Those who are already on Apple M3 or newer should wait for third-party benchmarks to appear, just so they know if the M5 is worth upgrading to or if they should wait a couple more years. We also don't have the Pro and Max versions of the M5 (or the M4 Ultra) just yet, but the company typically waits a few months before releasing them to the public.

The Asus ROG Xbox Ally X has excellent ergonomics thanks to controller-style grips, and Microsoft's handheld-focused Xbox experience is far better than using the Windows 11 desktop. The AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme delivers improved performance, but it may not be worth upgrading if you have an existing Ally.

Comfortable with controller grips and balanced weight

Xbox Full Screen Experience is way easier to use than standard Windows 11

Improved performance, especially at 720p

Finally, an Xbox button

More expensive than last-gen ROG Ally X

Screen isn't as vivid as OLED-based competition

No included carrying case

Some features are promised down the line, so this isn't finished yet

Outside of Valve's Steam Deck, the weakest link in PC gaming handhelds has been Windows 11. Time after time after time, Windows 11's lack of a true gaming-first mode has made it just short of a dealbreaker even on some of the best PC gaming handhelds.

But when Asus teamed up with Xbox on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X ($999.99 as tested), it didn't just mean new hardware with the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme chip and comfortable grips; it also meant a full-screen Xbox mode that is easy to navigate with a controller and even hides some of the components from Windows 11 that can slow down gaming. It doesn't have Steam Deck levels of polish, but it's a revelation compared to the standard Windows desktop.

But that Xbox menu hides PC levels of customization and complexity. Me? I loved having my Steam and Epic libraries next to games from my Xbox collection. (Or at least, the ones that support Xbox Play Anywhere.) But to Xbox purists or those who haven't dipped a toe into PC gaming before, I think this might be frustrating, and will raise questions about what an Xbox is and what the future of Xbox looks like.

All in all, the ROG Xbox Ally X feels far more like an Asus gaming handheld than an Xbox one. But outside of tremendously comfortable ergonomics, it's Microsoft's software engineering that makes the Xbox Ally X one of the best PC gaming handhelds around. That is, at least until Microsoft makes the updated operating system available on all Windows 11-based gaming handhelds.

Reviewer's note: Our ROG Xbox Ally X came without a final build of the Xbox Full Screen Experience. My first hours with the device were spent setting it up through my Xbox Insider account and installing the latest drivers and BIOS updates, which customers won't have to do. Still, that means there could be a few changes in the final software, including what should be an improved device setup experience. If we learn of any major changes, I'll amend this review.

The Xbox controller is effectively the default controller in PC gaming (other than a mouse and keyboard). So it's honestly a bit surprising it's taken this long for a major PC company to copy that gamepad's comfortable prongs and adapt them to a gaming handheld. It worked for the PlayStation Portal!

Otherwise, though, this Ally looks much like the 2024 Ally X that came before it, with an angular design, plenty of ROG branding, and dedicated buttons for Asus' Armory Crate. Other than an Xbox button, which Windows 11 handhelds have desperately needed for a while now, there is nothing that makes this feel like an Xbox based on Microsoft's current console designs (although there is a repeating ROG XBOX pattern in tiny print on the device). If Asus had released this design without calling it an Xbox, I'd be none the wiser. It has a blacked-out color scheme with hints of red on the buttons. I would've liked to see the Xbox-colored buttons on the vanilla ROG Xbox Ally.

The prongs feel great. This is the most natural a handheld has felt in my hand so far since the Steam Deck. These grips do make the system wider than some other systems, however, which makes it a bit bulky for travel. I was surprised at how good the system felt in my hands. It's wide in a way that makes it look like it would be awkward, but the weight is distributed very evenly, and I was comfortable even for long play sessions. It really does feel like you're using a controller.

Other than that, the general look of the system is almost identical to the ROG Ally X from 2024. You get a very classic Xbox layout here, with ABXY buttons, offset joysticks, and a D-pad sitting on a disk. These are not, however, identical to what you see on an Xbox wireless controller, with all of the Asus ROG styling. I love the rubberized coating around the edges of the joysticks' caps (that reminded me of an Xbox controller), and the buttons are clicky and tactile, if a bit loud. Each joystick is surrounded by a moat of RGB light, which you can customize in Asus's Armoury Crate software. Unlike the Lenovo Legion Go 2, there's no sign of Hall Effect joysticks here.

There are standard bumpers and triggers, though the new Xbox-branded Ally systems use what Xbox calls ""impulse"" triggers with motors for vibration. Asus notes that these are Hall Effect triggers, so at least they're using that tech somewhere! The bumpers feel a bit cheap for my liking, with clicky plastic, and the trigger vibration, though kind of fun in racing titles like the Forza Horizon series, isn't terribly powerful.

There are just two macro buttons, one on each side of the rear of the device. That's fine for me, but some people may prefer the Legion Go 2's three buttons or the four on the back of the Steam Deck.

The Xbox button is to the right of the left thumb stick. This is as good a place for it as any, and never got in my way. On the left side of the screen are buttons for Armoury Crate and the View button, while the right side features a button to bring you to your library (or, with a long press, call up Copilot) and the standard Menu button.

What there isn't is a touchpad. If you want one, you're better off looking at the Steam Deck. I like touchpads, but their absence here is far from a dealbreaker for me, and I didn't really miss them.

On top of the system, there are two USB Type-C ports: one with USB4 and the other using USB 3.2 Gen 2. The USB4 port is Thunderbolt 4 compatible, and I had no issue plugging it into a Thunderbolt dock to play games on my monitor. There is also a microSD card slot, a 3.5 mm headphone jack, and a fingerprint reader built into the power button. All of the ports are on top.

Like the previous Ally, there are vents in the back of the system between the macro buttons. That brings cool air in to chill the processor, which is then ejected out of the top of the system.

The Xbox Ally X weighs 1.58 pounds, which feels substantially lighter than the Lenovo Legion Go 2's 2.03 pounds. It's a slight bump over the original Ally X (1.49 pounds), while the Steam Deck OLED is lighter than its Windows-based counterparts (1.41 pounds).

If you include the prongs (and the prongs are permanently attached, so you have to), the Ally X measures 11.42 x 4.76 x 2.00 inches, though it's 1.08 inches deep at its thinnest point. That means that it's technically thicker than the Lenovo Legion Go 2 (11.64 x 5.38 x 1.66 inches), though it doesn't feel as hefty.

The original Ally X measured 11.02 x 4.37 x 1.45 inches, so this iteration is larger all around, while the Steam Deck OLED is still the widest option at 11.73 x 4.6 x 1.97 inches.

The system comes with a small cardboard stand in the box. I'd rather it come with a carrying case, like the Steam Deck and Lenovo Legion Go 2. Instead, you have to pay an extra $70 if you want an official case for this handheld.

Asus is using the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme. This chip is almost identical to the regular Ryzen Z2 Extreme we saw in the Legion Go 2, except that it has a 50 TOPS NPU on board, as well as three Zen 5 cores and five Zen 5c cores. The Z2 Extreme has a max boost clock of 5 GHz on the Zen 5 cores, (3.3 GHz on the Zen 5c cores) and a base clock of 2 GHz. That max boost is actually 0.1 GHz slower than the Z1 Extreme.

The Z2 Extreme goes up to 35 watts with its configurable TDP. Here's how Asus uses that with its performance modes, with comparisons to previous models:

Whether you need an NPU in a gaming handheld is debatable. I tried it with Microsoft's Gaming Copilot, but considering it was often wrong and unhelpful about what to do in games, the NPU is more for upcoming features regarding AI-powered upscaling.

There's a 16-core GPU using integrated Radeon RDNA 3.5 graphics. Asus has opted for 24GB of RAM, the same as in the original Ally X but less than the 32GB in the Legion Go 2. The 1TB M.2 SSD is in a standard M.2 2280 form factor. And the 80 WHr battery is identical in size to the cell used in the original Ally X.

The Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme has a 16-core integrated GPU with RDNA 3.5 graphics. The CPU and GPU have a shared memory pool, which defaults to 8GB of memory assigned to the GPU in Asus's Armoury Crate SE software. You can customize this, but we ran it at the out of the box settings.

By default, the system runs in a 25W performance mode while unplugged and a 35W turbo mode while plugged in. Again, we stuck to these values in our testing. We ran games at both 720p and 1080p. In our comparisons, the Legion Go 2 and Steam Deck were tested at 1280 x 800 and 1920 x 1200 to fit their 16:10 screens.

Using the Xbox Full Screen Experience should free up some memory and provide performance advantages, as it doesn't load some Windows components. We benchmarked games through the FSE, with the exception of our stress test, which requires additional logging software.

In my spare time with the Xbox Ally X, I played Marvel's Midnight Suns, mostly on battery power. At 720p and medium settings, the game ran between 75 and 111 FPS in missions, though when exploring the Abbey, it was sometimes closer to 60 FPS.

I also tried Alan Wake 2, which I couldn't run on handhelds with the Z1 Extreme. Here, it worked, albeit with some serious caveats. With the screen at 720p and using a 640 x 360 performance render resolution with FSR2 upscaling, the game ran between 32 and 53 FPS is a nightmare version of New York. Down in the subways, away from the open world level, the game hit the 60 FPS cap I had invoked to save the battery. But the game generally looked terrible and blurry from the low resolution.

On the Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark (medium settings, DX12), the Xbox Ally X hit 64 FPS at 720p plugged in and 79 FPS unplugged. At 1080, those boosted to 45 and 52 FPS, respectively. Those results are similar to the Legion Go 2, and show a nice but not extraordinary bump over the Asus ROG Ally X.

Cyberpunk 2077's Steam Deck preset showed off the system's power when plugged in, where it hit 63 FPS at 720p and 40 FPS at 1080p. Those both beat the Legion Go 2, though that had the disadvantage of having to push a few more pixels to power its 800p screen.

Red Dead Redemption 2 (favor performance, Vulkan), the Xbox Ally X showed off gains at 720p while unplugged, hitting 66 FPS. It scored almost identically to the Legion Go 2, but showed upticks over the original Ally X all around.

Borderlands 3 (medium, DX11) was the only misstep. At 59 FPS at 720p unplugged and 68 FPS plugged in, it came in behind the Legion Go 2 at 800p. 1080p performance, however, was comparable. In fact, at 720p, the Xbox Ally X had effectively no gains over the original Ally X in this game, though 1080p performance was improved.

Now that we've seen handhelds getting slightly more power, we've upped our stress test. It's still Metro Exodus running 15 times at 720p to simulate about half an hour of gameplay, but we've moved from low to medium settings. The Xbox Ally X achieved an average frame rate of 63.44 FPS on the benchmark.The consistency across the 15 runs suggests the cooling is adequate for the chip.

The Xbox Ally X's three Zen 5 cores ran at an average of 3.24 GHz during the stress test, while the Zen 5c cores hit 2.15 GHz.

The Xbox Full Screen Experience is significantly better for handhelds than standard Windows 11.

You boot straight into a version of the Xbox app featuring a home screen with recently played games, though like a standard Xbox, the app also advertises game deals, Game Pass, and has curated lists of games. The most important part is your library (there's even a hardware button for it), which brings everything together from Xbox and launchers like Steam, Epic Games, Battle.net, GOG Galaxy, and Ubisoft Connect.

Wherever you are in the system, you can see a miniaturized version of this experience by hitting the Xbox button, which shows recently played games, launchers, quick settings, your friends list, and most of the features from Xbox Game Bar on PC.

Most importantly, loading directly into the Full Screen Experience means that Windows doesn't even bother loading certain components of the OS that aren't used for gaming, making it lighter, saving RAM, and putting more resources toward games. The handheld even came with Steam preinstalled, booting right into big picture mode. That's a nice welcome mat for PC gamers, though I later did end up in the traditional Steam interface upon further boot ups.

Launchers, however, don't always work well. For instance, if you go into Steam's Big Picture mode, you'll get a great experience with the Xbox controller. But if you end up in Epic Games, as I did after quitting games like Borderlands 3 and Marvel's Midnight Suns, I found myself in an environment where I had to use this PC-style launcher with touch, as there was no mouse control. Even then, when I had the system at 720p, I'd have a gray box around the launcher, making it even harder to hit the touch targets. I had similar issues launching Cyberpunk 2077 from Steam, which forces you to go through CD Projekt Red's launcher. When you pick a game from the Xbox menu, launchers still have to boot and run in the background, which sometimes leaves you with a minute or so of hangtime. You don't have these problems when playing games from the Xbox Store.

Games from the Xbox Store also get other bonuses, like nicer artwork and, if you buy from the Xbox Store, analysis of how well the game will play on your PC.

You can still boot into the desktop (and load all of those extra Windows components upon doing so). If you want to use this system as a standard Windows 11 PC, there's nothing stopping you. It has all of the flaws of other gaming handhelds running Windows, but I'm glad the option is still there. I'm sure there will be at least some people who use the handheld with a keyboard and mouse or just want to tinker.

There are a number of waypoints in and out of the Full Screen Experience, but they feel bolted on to the Xbox app. But the sheer number of ways to get back into it means most people won't get lost. If you do go to full screen Windows 11, it will load the rest of the OS components, likely affecting gaming performance, so you'll want to restart when switching between the Xbox FSE and Windows (the system encourages you to do so).

 




And there are still aspects of Windows you can't control. Install a game or launcher that Windows runs through User Account Control? UAC doesn't pop up on an Xbox, but it still happens here. Asus also includes some unnecessary software, like MyAsus and GlideX for screen sharing, which feel out of place on a gaming handheld.

One of SteamOS's biggest advantages is a rating system that gives you an idea of how well a game works on the Steam Deck. Microsoft is doing something similar in the Xbox FSE, called the Handheld Compatibility program. Games are labeled as ""Handheld Optimized"" with a green checkmark, or ""Mostly compatible"" with a blue icon, suggesting you need to change some settings to get the game to run well. These badges are buried in the Xbox Store, so you won't see equivalents for other launchers. But Microsoft does keep a list of games it and studio partners have tested for handheld compatibility.

Asus's Armoury Crate SE is still here, both as a full application and as a smaller ""Command Center"" built into the Xbox interface and available through Windows 11. It's important as you switch through performance modes, change wattage to the processor (which can greatly affect battery life), and make other adjustments. (It is nice to have it baked into the Xbox FSE, and accessible easily through the Xbox button). The full Armoury Crate SE software does double up on some features though, including its own unified game library.

All of this leads to one question: Is the new Ally X an Xbox? For almost a year, Microsoft has been pushing a campaign that anything can be an Xbox, from laptops to car entertainment systems to phones – and now, gaming handhelds running Windows.

If you're coming from using an Xbox Series X or Series S, though, this is a fundamentally different experience in many ways. While Xbox Play Anywhere features over 1,000 games and lets you share save states and achievements, it also assumes you bought those games from the Microsoft Store. And plenty of games don't support Play Anywhere, including some of Microsoft's own. (It's nice to see that Doom: The Dark Ages got support after Doom Eternal didn't).

Microsoft needs to get to a point where all Xbox games are playable anywhere with this support to compete with the user experience Valve offers on Steam Deck. It's tough to call something an Xbox when it doesn't play every Xbox game. That will certainly confuse some people. Xbox gamers will also get their choice of using Game Pass or using Remote Play from their console, so there's a lot of flexibility here.

But as a PC handheld, this system also supports Steam, Epic Games, and every other launcher under the sun. All of those launchers, and all of the games within them, have far more settings to tinker with than ever before. Add in the fact that Asus' software gets deep into TDP, and this is a system with far more options than any Xbox owner ever had before. Enthusiasts will love that. But I also think there will be a number of console devotees who wonder how the heck this thing is an Xbox. It sure feels a lot more like an Asus gaming PC.

Microsoft is promising a bunch of upcoming features early next year, but we can only judge the Ally X on what's available today. Promised updates include automatic super resolution to use the AI Z2 Extreme's NPU to upscale games at the system level with no changes needed in game, as well as a game save sync indicator to make sure your save is stored, and improved library management for SD cards, making it easier to store and manage your games from the FSE.

Even without those, though, the Xbox FSE makes the Xbox Ally X the best PC gaming handheld with Windows because it's so much easier to use, despite the fact that Microsoft clearly has work to do to make launchers less janky and make the whole thing more full-featured. None of this is as polished or as easy as Valve's SteamOS, but it's significantly closer than using the regular Windows 11 UI. I can't wait for Microsoft to let every gamer with a handheld get a better experience than they do on the standard Windows 11 desktop.

Asus is using a 7-inch, 1920 x 1080, IPS touchscreen that runs up 120 Hz on the Xbox Ally X. If that sounds familiar, it's because it's probably the same screen on the previous Ally X. The 16:9 aspect ratio differs from what Valve and Lenovo have done, with taller 16:10 screens that also use OLED technology. In fact, this screen doesn't support HDR.

In general, the screen looks good. In Marvel's Midnight Suns, the Abbey is filled with colorful characters. Agatha's altar includes many blue flames (and, oh, yeah, Agatha Harkness's blue ghost), which created a haunting effect that contrasted against greenery at night. It doesn't, however, look anywhere near as vivid as the Lenovo Legion Go 2 I just tested.

 




The ROG Xbox Ally X's screen tested almost identically to the ROG Ally X we tested last year. Given they have the same specs, they're almost certainly same panel. The Xbox Ally X's panel covers 110% of the DCI-P3 color gamut and 77.9% of the more challenging DCI-P3 space by volume. That's easily beaten by the OLED screens on the Legion Go 2 and the Steam Deck OLED.

At 515.8 nits of brightness, this panel is more luminous than the Legion Go 2, though the Steam Deck OLED took the crown at 597.2 nits.

Battery life on a handheld, like its competitors, is largely dependent on your settings and the game you play. I tend to play games in a way to try to preserve battery life as long as possible. If you play low-impact games like Stardew Valley or even Hollow Knight: Silksong, you may experience longer battery life than the effects-heavy games I tested.

One evening when testing the Xbox Ally X, I played some Marvel's Midnight Suns with the system in Performance mode. At medium settings at 720p with the screen locked to 60 Hz and 50% brightness, the battery had dropped to 50% after an hour and 32 minutes.

When I played Alan Wake 2, I kept the same 17W Performance mode, 50% brightness, and 60 Hz refresh rate. At 720p using FSR2 upscaling on a performance-focused 640 x 360 render resolution and low settings preset without ray tracing, the handheld hit 50% in an hour and 35 minutes.

If you extrapolate from these, those suggest about 3 hours on battery, and that's with the limitations I put in place. That seems about standard when compared with the Legion Go 2.

The twin speakers on the Xbox Ally X are front facing, playing the sound right toward you. This is the optimal location, similar to what you find on the Steam Deck OLED. Some other handhelds have the speakers facing out of the top, away from you.

I used some of my time with the ROG Xbox Ally X to play a bit of Tetris Effect, which I had through Xbox Play Anywhere. The game sounds best with headphones, but the speakers did a solid job. The ""Prayer Circle"" level in journey mode features bells and xylophone sounds, which were clear and focused. Some deeper bass sounds, like gongs, were muted at best, however.

In Marvel's Midnight Suns, the speakers swelled with orchestral music during a battle, and kept the dialogue clear even over whirring Hydra helicopter blades. And the game got nice and loud, too, easily filling a whole room.

We measured skin temperatures while running our Metro Exodus stress test. Like other handhelds we've tested, the design ensures your hands don't touch any hotspots. The prongs and controls ran from 84 degrees Fahrenheit at the furthest point to 90 F closer to the screen. On the top, the hottest point was at the exhaust vent, which reached 113.7 F. On the rear, the hottest point was near the intake vent, far enough from the two back buttons that you wouldn't place your hands there.

Internally, the CPU package measured an average of 74.7 degrees Celsius, while the integrated graphics reached 70.59 C.

Here's one way in which the ROG Xbox Ally X is definitively more like a PC than an Xbox: You can crack it open and upgrade it. The back of the system is held on with eight Phillips-head screws. There are five screws on the back and three on the bottom. Of those, the top middle screw on the rear is captive; the rest all come out.

You'll have to pry carefully from the top and all the way around the sides of the controllers to get the back off. It can be nerve-wracking and time-consuming, as there are a lot of plastic clips to disengage. But go slow — there's a ribbon cable connecting the back to the motherboard to control the M1 and M2 buttons. I would love to see a design in the future with a door that leads directly to the SSD (perhaps similar to what Microsoft has done on some Surface designs) so you don't have to deal with so many screws and tabs. For those without any DIY PC experience, adding storage with the microSD card slot may be the way to go.

 




The major component you can upgrade is the standard M.2 2280 SSD, which is right at the center when you open the system. The battery cable runs over the SSD, and while you'd probably want to disconnect that before doing work anyway, you'll have to do so to have room to remove the existing drive.

Like the original Ally X, you can see the modular thumbsticks. Since Asus isn't using Hall Effect joysticks, these will probably, eventually, be prone to drift. Asus didn't sell replacement sticks for the initial Ally X, but I'd love to see them do it for this system.

The Asus ROG Xbox Ally X comes in a single configuration, with a 7-inch, 1080p display, AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor, 24GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. It costs $999.99, up from $799 on the 2024 Ally X with a Z1 Extreme. That's a big jump for the new processor and slightly new design.

There is another model, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, which ditches the Xbox Ally X's blackout color scheme for a white controller and colorful buttons. That system, which costs $599.99, uses an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor, which on paper is similar to what you can find in the Steam Deck OLED. It also has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD.

The Asus ROG Xbox Ally X makes two things very clear:

1. More handhelds need controller-style prongs.

2. Windows 11 on gaming handhelds has a chance.

The Xbox Ally X has superior ergonomics to every other Windows handheld on the market, and will be more comfortable for some than the Steam Deck, which until now has been the best in this area. It looks a little silly, but controllers have those grips for a reason. Add in some great weight-balancing, and you have a comfortable gaming handheld. Too bad it doesn't come with a case to carry it around in.

 




The performance of the Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme is strong, but I'm not sure it's such a jump that if you already have an Asus ROG Ally X with Z1 Extreme, you need to upgrade.

At $999.99, this is a pricey handheld. Still, there are more fully featured options out there. If you're willing to skip the Xbox Full Screen Experience (for now), the Lenovo Legion Go 2 adds detachable controllers with Hall Effect joysticks and a gorgeous OLED screen, along with more RAM. But that device is bigger and heavier, and is even more expensive at $1,349.99. The Steam Deck OLED, which is cheaper at $549 for 512GB and $649 for 1TB, also has an OLED screen, though its chip quite as powerful as the Z2 Extreme.

For now, the Xbox Full Screen Experience is exclusive to the Xbox Ally X. All other things being equal, that's the big reason to buy this system. Using it is simply easier, even if Microsoft has plenty of rough edges to clean up.

If you're just now jumping into the gaming handheld market and want something that just plays games and runs Windows, this is the one to get. It's comfortable and is finally starting to get close to the ease of use that Valve offers with SteamOS. When the Xbox Full Screen Experience becomes available more widely, however, the field may blow open.

A lot of column inches were spent saying goodbye to Windows 10 yesterday. Recently, we have also shared quite a few articles which may help you decide where next on your computing journey – whether that be Windows 11, or an alternative like Ubuntu Linux. Now, the reinvented digital detox tech brand, Commodore, has thrown its hat in the ring, proposing you “Save your PC. Save your sanity” by transitioning to the totally free (Linux-based) Commodore OS Vision 3.0.

Commodore has set up a microsite to help steer you towards its unique vision of a modern operating system. If you head over to commodore.net/closewindows, you will first see a banner image of the Commodore 64X PC with OS Vision. But that is essentially an x86 PC in a C64-style ‘bread bin' chassis, so don't worry about the hardware.

Your Windows 10 era is ending. As of October 14: No more updates, no more security patches, no more support. Ever.Microsoft may be leaving you behind. We won't.Meet #Commodore OS Vision 3.0 – a totally FREE, modern, Linux-based sanctuary from tech gone too far. Calm.… pic.twitter.com/2Y7abUGZWEOctober 14, 2025

As per the official Commodore post above, this OS is being pitched as a fresh start, as Windows 10 rides off into the sunset. Those frustrated with Microsoft's OS, and its assumed direction of travel given what we've seen of Windows 11 so far, are promised “a reset” rather than an upgrade.

Key touted attractions of Commodore OS Vision 3.0 are that it is “a totally FREE, modern, Linux-based sanctuary from tech gone too far. Calm. Creative. Privacy-first. Retro-futuristic. No nags. No noise. No tracking. No toxic social media,” says Commodore. Those sound very much like the words and philosophies of its new CEO, Christian ‘Perifractic' Simpson.

To be clear, Commodore OS Vision 3.0 hasn't just been released to take advantage of Windows users in flux, though. This version of the OS was released back in April.

There is a lot going on in this Linux (Debian)-based OS, which partly explains the humongous download. One of the most striking elements of the Commodore OS Vision 3.0 is its uniquely crafted interface, a love letter to the Commodore legacy, which is a retro-futuristic take on UI design.

Once in the OS, there are lashings of extras. Most notably, the games and demos. This distro includes over 200 free Linux-compatible games, along with a selection of classic Commodore games and demos – thus providing a mix of nostalgia and modernity.

Another key attraction of this OS is its inclusion of Commodore OS BASIC V1. This included BASIC interpreter has been bolstered to support 3D graphics, physics, and more. The original Commodore machines sparked a flood of creativity from bedroom coders, and being able to write computer programs without additional software is very much in the DNA of these influential machines.

Last but not least, as far as highlights go, we must mention the Commodore OS Central. This is a hub for retro-oriented resources and manuals. It is also earmarked for development into a game store, installer, and launcher – with community interaction.

If the idea of moving to the Commodore OS Vision 3.0 intrigues you, we recommend watching the video overview, published by Explaining Computers, below.

Those eager to get stuck in with Commodore OS Vision 3.0 on one of their PCs can find lots of discussion about the operating system on the busy official forums. There, you can also find an extensive installation guide, with walk-throughs for testing (in a VM) or even fully adopting this OS.

ASML has enough. For now.

The chief financial officer of ASML has told Bloomberg that the lithography giant is well prepared for China's export controls regime on rare earth elements and technologies for their mining and refining. The company has long lead times for its advanced tools, so it has plenty of raw materials in stock to support short-term demand from its clients. What happens after the company's reserves deplete is something unclear, though.

""We have long lead times, and therefore, also in our supply chain, we make sure that we have the materials in that we that we need for the next couple of months,"" said Roger Dassen, CFO of ASML, in a conversation with Bloomberg.

Under the new export control rules China imposed last week, companies have to get an export license to ship such rare earth materials as holmium, thulium, or ytterbium, or products based on these materials, from China's Ministry of Commerce. Furthermore, China imposed its export controls beyond its own borders on products containing rare earth materials originating from China if their value content within that product is more than 0.1% starting December 1, 2025.

This decision of the Chinese government could essentially stop all the supplies of all rare earth materials and products containing them across the world, something that could harm ASML, which uses a number of them inside its DUV and EUV lithography systems, metrology tools, and inspection tools.

However, Dassen downplayed the possibility of halting production after December 1, saying that the company's supply planning and long production cycles give it enough flexibility to absorb temporary disruptions. Meanwhile, the company now has over a month to buy rare earth materials or components containing them before the new export controls regime is enacted.

Speaking of China, ASML re-emphasized that it expects demand from its customers in the People's Republic to drop in 2026 due to the revocation of fast-track VEU license exemptions for Micron, Samsung, SK hynix, and TSMC, as well as softening demand from local chipmakers.

""When we look at China, we believe that the demand of our Chinese customers is going to be significantly lower in 2026 than it has been in 2024 and 2025 when we had very strong business there,"" said Christophe Fouquet, chief executive of ASML, during the company's earnings call with investors and analysts.

No word on M5 Pro or Max, yet.

After teasing a new product launch on X earlier today, Apple has just announced the 2025 refresh to its 14-inch MacBook Pro lineup, now equipped with the shiny new M5 chip. The press release, accompanied by a separate M5 announcement, was just published on the company's website, unpacking the new laptop in great detail. It's largely an iterative update, with the new chip nicely slotting in for yesteryear's M4 in an otherwise largely unchanged package.

There are no design tweaks or exciting features to speak of. The chassis, including the 14-inch Mini LED display, is identical to previous models — just like all the other core features such as ports, speakers, keyboard, trackpad, and even the 12 MP webcam. The battery is once again quoted to last 24 hours in video playback, and you still only get Wi-Fi 6E. However, the SSD is 2x faster compared to last gen, and you can now spec it up to 4 TB, twice as much as previous gen.

 




It's clear that Apple is entirely focused on what's inside, the latest generation of its homegrown M-series silicon — M5. This swap is what likely enables the memory bandwidth to be upgraded from 120 GB/s on the M4 to now ""over 150 GB/s"" on the M5.

The SoC package includes a 10-core CPU, a 10-core GPU with ""a Neural Accelerator in each core,"" and a 16-core NPU for on-device AI. The M5 chip is built on TSMC's N3P node and has a faster GPU that can deliver 1.6x more FPS in games, 20% faster multi-core CPU performance, and 1.7x quicker render times in Blender — all versus the M4. Apple even says it's 86x more powerful than Intel-based Macs in AI applications.

The price for the new 14-inch MacBook Pro remains the same as last year, with the base model starting at $1,599, offering you a 512 GB SSD and 16 GB of RAM. Keep in mind that, just like M4, the base M5 isn't available on the 16-inch models as they start out with a Pro chip (so, presumably M5 Pro). The device is available to pre-order right away, with general availability beginning next week on October 22. Alongside the MacBook Pro, Apple also refreshed the Vision Pro and the iPad Pro with the new M5 chip.

 




The tablet gets Apple's in-house C1X modem and N1 networking chip that brings Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6 support, offering faster connectivity across the board with 30% less power usage compared to the M4 iPad Pro. On the other hand, the mixed reality headset now has a new Dual Knit headband, also available for purchase separately for $99. Therefore, M5's improvements in performance, battery life, and AI-powered workflows are present on the Vision Pro and iPad Pro as well.

Accompanying that is the fresh software for each of these devices, including the MacBook Pro, with the latest OS versions adding newer features and, of course, the Liquid Glass visual overhaul. Prices remain the same as last gen for both the iPad and Vision Pro as well.

MINTernet is the latest in the growing field of home 5G internet services

Several cell providers have hopped on the 5G home internet service bandwagon, with T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon offering service in select areas across the United States. Now, a new player is entering the fray: Mint Mobile. Mint Mobile is a subsidiary of T-Mobile, which is a known quantity in this segment, and its new service is called MINTernet.

Unsurprisingly, MINTernet operates on T-Mobile's nationwide wireless network, offering unlimited 5G service. Now, whenever unlimited data is mentioned in the 5G realm, you should always look at the fine print. In this case, Mint Mobile says that once you consume over 1TB of data within your billing cycle, ""network speeds vary and may be reduced."" This is similar to the T-Mobile Home Internet policy, where the restriction is implemented after exceeding the 1.2TB threshold.

Regarding the speeds you can expect, the ""Broadband Facts"" label for MINTernet indicates that typical download speeds will range from 133 to 415 Mbps, while uploads should reach a maximum of around 55 Mbps. As for latency, expect to see 16 to 28 ms in most situations.

MINTernet costs $40 per month if you opt for the introductory 3-month offer, and this price is contingent upon paying the entire cost upfront ($120). However, if you already have a Mint phone plan (or intend to add one at the time of signup), your monthly cost drops to $30 ($90 upfront).

A 6-month plan is also offered at $45/month ($270 upfront) or $35/month ($210 upfront) with a phone plan. Finally, there's a 12-month plan that drops back down to $40/month ($480 upfront) or $30/month ($360) with a qualifying phone plan. All customers will get a free 5G gateway (modem/Wi-Fi router) with their order, along with a 14-day money-back guarantee.

Considering that MINTernet runs on T-Mobile's 5G network, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that my first run-in with its 5G home internet service ended in disaster in 2022. However, I revisited the service in 2024 with much better results, averaging over 600 Mbps for downloads and over 50 Mbps for uploads. T-Mobile Home Internet costs $50/month with autopay, so if you tick the right boxes, MINTernet will save you up to $20/month.

 October 15, 2025  

Patients with alopecia areata (AA) who do not respond to treatment with one of the three approved JAK inhibitors may get a response by switching to one of the other JAK inhibitors, a small study has shown.

“What dermatologists need to know is that if at first your patient does not successfully grow their hair, then try, try again, of course optimizing treatment from the start,” the corresponding author, Brett King, MD, PhD, dermatologist in Fairfield, Connecticut, told Medscape Medical News. 

The case series, published online as a research letter in JAMA Dermatology, included 13 patients of various ethnicities who did not respond to initial JAK inhibitor therapy, with five moving on to a fourth JAK inhibitor before getting a response. After the second, third, or fourth JAK inhibitor, all patients had a response, measured by achievement of a Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score ≤ 20.

Six patients were started on 5 mg tofacitinib twice daily, two on 10 mg tofacitinib twice daily, three on 50 mg ritlecitinib daily, and two on 4 mg baricitinib daily. For the second round, they were switched to various doses and agents. Two of the patients who started on 5 mg tofacitinib were then given the 10-mg formulation but failed at that, too. Two patients started on 5 mg tofacitinib twice daily switched to 4 mg baricitinib daily for their second JAK inhibitor, with one achieving their treatment goal but the other needing two different doses of upadacitinib — 15 and 30 mg daily — before reaching their SALT goal. None of the patients followed the regimen steps through to treatment response.

The three JAK inhibitors approved by the FDA for AA are baricitinib, ritlecitinib, and deuruxolitinib.

The results may portend the possibility of personalized medicine for aiding treatment decisions in patients with AA, said King, who was previously with the Department of Dermatology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut. 

“This work might anticipate a future of personalized medicine when biomolecular analysis of a scalp biopsy details a patient's response to one or another JAK inhibitor or, hopefully, a list of treatments for alopecia areata,” he added. “At this moment in time, however, we are not there.”

He and the two other authors acknowledged the small sample size but wrote, “our results show successful treatment of AA with several different JAKis [JAK inhibitors] after failure of one, two, or even three other JAKis, which carries important clinical implications: Achieving optimal treatment outcomes will require use of all of the JAKis.”

In treating AA, clinicians must keep in mind two clinical features of the disease that help determine treatment response, King told Medscape Medical News.

The first is whether the patient has scalp hair at the start of treatment or begins treatment with no scalp hair. “Up to 60% or more of patients who have scalphair at the start of treatment will grow hair with a JAKi, whereas about 40% of similar patients with no hair at the start of treatment will grow hair,” he said.

The other key feature is how long the patient has had severe hair loss, not necessarily how long they have had AA, when they start treatment. “People who get treatment in the first four years of a severe episode respond better than those who get treatment later than that,” King said. 

“Putting these two clinical features together, patients with hair and duration of current episode of severe loss less than 4 years respond better and faster to treatment than others,” he noted. 

King added that 6 months “and sometimes even 9 months” is the minimum threshold for determining the effectiveness of treatment with any JAK inhibitor, “looking for 30% or more scalp hair regrowth from baseline during that period or regrowth of eyebrows or eyelashes.”

In the study, 85% of the nonresponders also received 2.5-10 mg concomitant oral minoxidil daily. “There is growing evidence supporting that adding oral minoxidil with JAK inhibitor improves efficacy and may accelerate hair growth, and so combination treatment should always be considered,” he said. He cited two small studies — one in adults and the other in pediatric patients — that support this approach.

King reported having financial relationships with Pfizer, AbbVie, Eli Lilly, Sun Pharmaceuticals, AltruBio, Almirall, Amgen, AnaptysBio, Apogee Therapeutics, Aquestive, BiologicsMD, Bristol Myers Squibb, Equillium, Galderma, GSK, Incyte Corp., Janssen Pharmaceuticals, LEO Pharma, Merck, Novartis, Otsuka/Visterra, Q32 Bio, Regeneron, Sanofi Genzyme, Soterios, Takeda, TWi Biotechnology, and Ventyx Biosciences. One of the other authors reported receiving honoraria and fees from Pfizer; another author reported receiving honoraria and fees from AbbVie, Arcutis, BiologicsMD, Dermavant, Incyte, Eli Lilly, LEO Pharma, GSK, Novartis, Pfizer, Regeneron, Sanofi Genzyme, Takeda, and Sun Pharmaceuticals outside the submitted work.

 October 15, 2025  

Counterfeits sold via fraudulent websites, promotion by influencers on social media, sham prescriptions in teleconsultations — in recent weeks, multiple alerts have emerged concerning illegal online sales of falsified drugs marketed as GLP-1 analogues for weight loss and diabetes. Medscape's French edition spoke with health authorities, patient associations, pharmaceutical companies, and medical regulatory bodies to understand how the fight against this trafficking is being organized.

The runaway success of antiobesity medications has brought an unintended consequence: a surge in illicit online trade of counterfeit products. The global popularity of GLP-1 receptor agonists has fueled a thriving black market on the Internet.

On September 3, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and national health agencies operating under the Heads of Medicines Agencies issued a joint warning about falsified treatments — including Ozempic/Wegovy (semaglutide), Saxenda/Victoza (liraglutide), Trulicity (dulaglutide), and Mounjaro (tirzepatide). These products, the EMA said, “are often sold via fraudulent websites and promoted on social media, are not authorised and do not meet necessary standards of quality, safety, and efficacy.”

The agency reported finding “hundreds of fake Facebook profiles, advertisements, and e-commerce listings, many of which are hosted outside the EU.” Some of these sites even misused official logos to deceive consumers into believing the products were legitimate.

Health authorities are intensifying efforts to dismantle illegal sales networks, remove counterfeit products, and block websites. In France, the problem has reportedly worsened since June 23, 2025, when new regulations allowed all physicians to prescribe antiobesity drugs.

On September 11, the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines (ANSM) warned of a sharp increase in online advertisements and sales offers for products claiming to be GLP-1 analogues. The agency had already referred the issue to the public prosecutor back in April.

Speaking with Medscape's French edition, ANSM said it had filed around 20 reports targeting roughly 10 merchant sites through Pharos, the French Ministry of the Interior's official platform for reporting illegal online content. While declining to name the platforms involved, citing ongoing legal proceedings, ANSM noted that the targeted sites were ordinary consumer goods websites being used to sell counterfeit drugs.

While legitimate GLP-1 analogues, available only by prescription, come exclusively in injector pen form, ANSM investigators recently seized patches containing microneedles designed to be applied to the skin. “These are counterfeit products with no guarantees of quality, efficacy, or safety, and they expose patients to potentially serious risks,” the agency warned.

ANSM added that it plans to introduce “sanitary police measures” in the coming weeks, aimed at banning advertising and all online sales of the products in question.

Patient advocacy groups are also voicing deep concern over the rise in counterfeit GLP-1 drugs. “The trafficking of falsified aGLP-1 [GLP-1 analogues] medicines is extremely worrying,” said Jean-François Thebaut, vice president of the French Federation of Diabetics (FFD), in an interview with Medscape's French edition. He recalled that 3 years ago, black-market sales and resale using forged prescriptions led to a temporary drug shortage. “Now, even more counterfeit products are being sold by fraudsters — often with no way of knowing what they actually contain,” he added.

The FFD is actively involved in efforts to combat the circulation of falsified GLP-1 drugs. “We work with the French Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control, the ANSM, and media-regulation authorities such as Arcom,” said Thebaut. “But our response is mostly reactive. Each time we identify an illegal site, we report it for closure — yet we're always one step behind. When one site is shut down, another appears almost immediately.”

In this ongoing cat-and-mouse game, counterfeiters continue to stay a step ahead of regulators.

Pharmaceutical companies are also helping to monitor and report counterfeit activity online, often through dedicated internal teams. Novo Nordisk, which markets Ozempic and Wegovy, is one such company. “We prioritise external stakeholder engagement, education, and awareness and support law enforcement and health authorities through capacity-building activities and information sharing,” the company stated.

While Novo Nordisk declined to share operational details, it said its global anticounterfeiting strategy follows three principles: Prevent, Detect, and Respond. The company encourages patients to report any suspected fake products by email or by phone. Patients are asked to provide a photo of the suspected product, along with its name and lot number.

The National Orders of Pharmacists and the National Council of the Orders of Physicians (CNOM), France's professional regulatory bodies, are also taking action and issuing warnings. “The CNOM supports the fight against illicit distribution channels,” said Hélène Harmand-Icher, president of the Public Health Section of CNOM. She noted that the organization has received reports of doctors promoting antiobesity treatments on social media and YouTube.

In January 2025, the CNOM signed a charter with YouTube outlining ten core principles for medical content creators. “The document specifies that physicians who present products online must tailor their messaging to their audience and avoid any form of advertising,” Harmand-Icher told Medscape's French edition. If a physician violates the charter, their regional medical council may summon them to justify or correct their statements; in more serious cases, the council can request that the content or channel be shut down.

The CNOM was also alerted following an investigative report by France 2, one of France's main public television channels known for its national news and in-depth current affairs coverage. The broadcast featured a Paris orthopedic surgeon who, during teleconsultations, issued prescriptions as a general practitioner and prescribed GLP-1 drugs outside official guidelines. Current French recommendations limit use to patients with a BMI above 30 or above 27 with a comorbidity.

“Any situation where a physician prescribes without appropriate follow-up during teleconsultation and issues a sham prescription is unethical and subject to disciplinary action by the Order,” said Harmand-Icher. “Fortunately, we've received few such reports, and our stance is zero tolerance.” She added that issuing a false prescription is a criminal offense, punishable by suspension and up to 3 years in prison.

While calling for vigilance, Harmand-Icher cautioned against “witch hunts” targeting these treatments. “The goal is to ensure that patients who genuinely need these medications continue to have safe and legitimate access to them,” she concluded.

Marcia  Frellick

 October 15, 2025  

Nearly half of physicians in Canada report high levels of burnout, according to preliminary data from the 2025 National Physician Health Survey (NPHS). The new data show that 46% of physicians report high levels of burnout, down from 2021 (53%) but still significantly above the level of 2017 (30%), when the first survey was conducted. The full NPHS 2025 Foundational Report will be released later this year.

Other significant findings include the following:

Margot Burnell, MD, president of the Canadian Medical Association (CMA), told Medscape Medical News that she was “disappointed” with the results.

“I hoped that the burnout numbers would decrease more than they have,” she said. “Physicians are still under extreme stress in trying to provide the care for patients that they wish to give.” 

The most distressing finding is that more than one third of physicians (37%) plan to reduce their hours within 24 months — at a time of growing physician shortages — said Burnell.

“The one positive [finding] that stands out is that physicians are taking care of their own health and wellness and report that it's helping,” she said. About 65% of physicians reported having accessed at least one wellness support in the past 5 years, up 11% since 2021.

The NPHS includes responses from about 3300 practicing physicians, medical residents, and fellows who were surveyed from March 14 to April 15.

Among the CMA's top priorities is to reduce the administrative burden because that tops the list of what physicians say would help them with burnout, said Burnell.

“The other area is to provide and encourage team-based care,” she continued. “That provides some relief for physicians.” It also is important to promote the approaches that seem to be helping, such as wellness support and artificial intelligence (AI), she said. In this survey, 59% of respondents who used AI said that it decreased their time spent on administrative tasks. 

Future analyses will examine burnout by specialty, Burnell said. Burnout is particularly high among emergency physicians, regardless of province, according to previous work by Kerstin de Wit, MD, emergency physician and research director for the Department of Emergency Medicine at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, and colleagues.

The NPHS findings are not surprising, she told Medscape Medical News. “We resurveyed all our emergency physicians in January and found similar results, in that the levels of burnout were marginally less than they were in 2022 but still significantly higher than they were in 2020. Still, a majority of [emergency department] physicians qualify as having high burnout levels.” 

A telling finding of her team's research is that emergency physician burnout levels are now higher than they were in December 2020, the first year of the COVID pandemic, said De Wit. “I don't think you can say burnout is because of COVID. It's because of the problems in the medical system.”

Among those problems in hospitals are a shortage of beds, physicians, and nurses and inadequate numbers of physicians in outpatient clinics “so patients are waiting for years” for conditions to be treated,” she added.

“We don't have the resources that we need to maintain the standards that we had even 10, 15 years ago. The whole system is collapsing. Government underfunding is huge. Routinely, our emergency department is 100% full of ward patients, so we don't have a room with a door or a curtain to see patients in. All the emergency patients are seen in corridors or the waiting room in full view of everyone else. We have people with serious medical conditions who are dying in waiting rooms because we can't get them in.”

The issues are complex, but the overarching problem is chronic underfunding that results in physicians “feeling overworked and powerless to help patients,” said De Wit.

Burnell and de Wit reported having no relevant financial relationships.

For women with overweight/obesity trying to lose weight, perimenopause and menopause bring special challenges. Hormonal changes can wreak havoc physically and emotionally, making it more difficult to stay on track — even women whose weight tends to stay in the normal range may put on extra pounds during this time.

For insights into how menopausal changes affect patients and evidence-based strategies to help them stay motivated and focused on their weight-loss goals, Medscape Medical News interviewed two obesity medicine experts: Courtney Younglove, MD, founder and medical director of Heartland Weight Loss in Overland Park, Kansas, and Sandra Christensen, a nurse practitioner and owner of Integrative Medical Weight Management in Seattle.

Both experts recently presented on this topic at the Obesity Medicine Association meeting.

The key change during perimenopause/menopause is a decline in estrogen. With respect to weight loss, “that's pretty much a triple whammy,” said Younglove.

First, insulin resistance increases, which drives fat storage, especially visceral fat. Second, muscle mass starts to decline more rapidly, which results in worsening insulin resistance and a decreased metabolism, because an individual's metabolic rate is primarily determined by the amount of muscle mass they have. And third, cortisol levels rise directly and indirectly due to sleep disruption, which drives fat storage, she explained.

In this state, calorie restriction results in low energy and increased hunger and food cravings, creating a vicious cycle, she added.

Emotional challenges that can drive overeating are also common. “Almost everything has the potential to create emotional challenges,” Younglove said. Mood is often disrupted around the time of perimenopause due to the drop in estrogen or, indirectly, due to sleep deprivation.

Also at play are “all of the many things that women are coping with around midlife unrelated to estrogen levels, such as redefining their place in the world, navigating relationship shifts that occur as children leave home, taking on caretaking roles for aging parents, navigating glass ceilings and ageism in the workplace, and coping with their aging bodies in a culture where women are valued for being young and thin.”

“It's hard to implement lifestyle improvements when we feel like we are already drowning,” Younglove underlined.

Another recently defined and relevant result of diminished estrogen is called the “musculoskeletal syndrome of menopause,” said Christensen.

A “revolutionary article” by Vonda J. Wright, MD, of the University of Central Florida College of Medicine, Orlando, Florida, and colleagues coined the term and categorized the aches and pains that women get during this period — that is, issues with ligaments, tendons, and cartilage breakdown. Together, they can make it more difficult to engage in physical activity, a key to weight loss with or without anti-obesity medications.

About 70% of women will experience the syndrome, and 25% will be disabled by it through the transition from peri- to postmenopause, according to the research. In addition to musculoskeletal inflammation and arthralgias, the syndrome includes loss of muscle mass and bone density, which may already be affecting women taking weight-loss medications or following restricted diets.

Furthermore, medications prescribed to treat the symptoms and complications of menopause may also be weight-promoting, Christensen noted.

Physicians need to be aware that the symptoms women experience around menopause are “completely legitimate,” Younglove said. “When we dismiss women's complaints, we force them to seek advice elsewhere, and sadly, there are a ton of smarmy companies out there preying upon women's need to be heard and helped through this time of life, and they're promising quick-fixes. It's gross.”

Christensen added, “There's much more interest in these topics these days, and women are coming in and talking to me about menopause and what happens around that time before I even bring it up. Many are more educated and want to learn more.”

Nevertheless, clinicians should be prepared to ask patients who don't volunteer information about their feelings and symptoms and be ready to address those issues, she said.

Younglove and Christensen suggested the following evidence-based treatments:

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). Both experts agreed that MHT is a safe and effective option for many women, after ensuring that the patient is an appropriate candidate (eg, no history of blood clots, stroke, or breast cancer and no high blood pressure or liver dysfunction, among other risks).

MHT is “vastly underused,” Christensen said, despite its demonstrated efficacy in reducing an array of menopausal symptoms, including depression, insulin resistance, hot flashes, and vaginal dryness. In addition, in postmenopausal women, when combined with semaglutide, hormone therapy is associated with greater weight loss.

Anti-obesity medications. All anti-obesity medications, not just GLP-1s, have the potential to help women start and continue on a weight-loss journey, Younglove said. But if they're used inappropriately — that is, without robust nutritional support and strength training — “we run the risk of worsening the loss of muscle mass, thus further lowering metabolism and setting women up for sarcopenia and frailty as they age.”

Nutrition. Getting adequate protein is critical to maintaining and building muscle mass and to maintaining bone mass or reducing its decline, Christensen said. Protein requirements for menopausal women should be around 1.5 g/kg of body weight, and older women might need as much as 2 g/kg. That level of intake is also associated with the “protein leverage effect,” meaning when individuals eat more protein, they eat less unhealthful foods.

Data also suggest that a low-fat diet is associated with an increased risk for weight gain in women who are normal weight or living with overweight/obesity, whereas a reduced carbohydrate diet may decrease the risk for postmenopausal weight gain, she noted.

Physical activity, body composition. Loss of muscle mass is a concern with any kind of weight-reduction program, “so the combination of some strength training and cardio with weight-loss medication is really beneficial,” Christensen said. “It can also help relieve some of the aches and pains that people get when they become more physically active.”

But if women specifically have knee or hip pain, for example, it's important to acknowledge and address the pain by referring the patient for imaging or to a physical therapist or orthopedist to be evaluated. “The important thing is not to dismiss these concerns when a woman brings them up.”

Younglove underscored the importance of tracking body composition instead of focusing solely numbers on the scale. “We track body composition and celebrate loss of fat mass without loss of muscle mass and pivot treatment plans quickly if it appears as though people are losing lean mass,” she said.

Sleep therapy. If a woman is having problems sleeping, Christensen advises talking to her about sleep hygiene, referring her cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, and helping her reduce her stress “because all those things can impact weight,” she said. To reduce stress, help her learn delegate if, for example, she has family responsibilities as well as a professional life. Otherwise, “her own personal needs and health habits can go by the wayside.”

Motivation and focus. To support patients in making changes, dig down to discover what factors are motivating them to lose weight. “Don't lecture them and don't impose your goals on them,” Christensen said. “Ask questions like, ‘how do you want to be functioning in 10 years?' A classic answer is that they want to be able to get on the floor and play with their grandkids. Or they may want to be ballroom dancing or go to Europe — whatever the goal might be. Then say, ‘Let's talk about what you're willing to do to make that happen,' and then break that down into small steps.”

If they haven't been exercising, ask them what physical activity they are most likely to engage in, Christensen suggested. “Once they've picked the thing that they'll most likely do, ask if there's there a way they could do that for 10 minutes, three times a week? If you already know that they couldn't do 10 minutes, then just say could you do it for 5 minutes? Or negotiate with them to get them to do it.”

With regard to eating, “[i]t's too overwhelming to give a patient a diet plan and say, ‘go home and do this,'” she said. Instead, help them choose one thing in their diet they're willing to change, and when they reach that small step or milestone, move on to the next. “I will often say, ‘what's one change you could make between now and when I see you next?'”

It's important to be encouraging and complimentary when patients make changes because usually they're so hard on themselves, she said. “I'll often tell a new patient, ‘I can give you expertise on treating overweight and obesity, but really, my job is to help you stay on your own side.'”

If they fall back on old habits, Christensen tries to help patients get back on track. “I ask them to think about their goal and regain their focus, understanding that when they veer off course, it's because they lost focus and that's normal. It's all part of the process.”

Christensen reported being a speaker on obesity for Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk and being on an advisory board for Novo Nordisk. Younglove declared having no conflicts of interest.

The first full-length structures of two heat shock chaperone proteins in a complex reveal the key structural region regulating their function, according to a new study from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The chaperone complex binds misfolded proteins and gives them another chance to fold correctly. This process is essential for cells because improperly folded proteins tend to aggregate, potentially causing a diverse array of diseases. However, the mechanism by which these two major heat shock chaperone proteins, Hsp40 and Hsp70, bind each other and misfolded peptides was unclear. The new structures enabled the scientists to identify how the cellular machinery works. The findings were published today in Molecular Cell.

""Heat shock chaperone proteins form the first line of defense against protein misfolding and aggregation, a precursor to many diseases,"" said corresponding author Charalampos Babis Kalodimos, PhD, St. Jude Department of Structural Biology chair.

We showed how these two particular heat shock chaperone proteins come together, revealing a previously unknown set of mechanisms explaining how they work in tandem, and how they can malfunction.""

Charalampos Babis Kalodimos, Department of Structural Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital

Heat shock chaperone proteins are essential in most organisms, with similar versions present from bacteria to humans. Bacterial Hsp40 and Hsp70 are known to help misfolded proteins correctly refold, with decades of research into their function as chaperone proteins. The human versions of these proteins are also linked to several diseases. However, exactly how Hsp40 and Hsp90 bind a client protein and each other was unknown, because no one had been able to overcome the technical hurdles involved in capturing the massive full-length structure. 

Instead of using a single approach, the St. Jude scientists combined cryogenic electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and X-ray crystallography data to finally solve the bacterial complex's structure. They captured multiple forms of the structure, consisting of dimers (pairs) of Hsp70 interacting with dimers of Hsp40, in several different states of binding client proteins.

""Most importantly, we captured the full-length structures of the active and inhibited states, bound to an incorrectly folded protein,"" Kalodimos said. ""But we also solved multiple smaller pieces. By assembling them together, they've given us a new model of how the Hsp40 and Hsp70 complex really functions.""

Mutations in a specific region of Hsp40 are associated with an array of ailments, including many neurodegenerative diseases, but how those mutations disrupt normal functions was unknown. The region is rich in highly conserved amino acids called glycines and phenylalanines, though their exact functions were unclear. The structures revealed that this region of Hsp40 binds a client protein first, then a particular phenylalanine binds to the substrate binding site on Hsp70. That phenylalanine then pulls the misfolded protein into the substrate binding site, displacing itself, though the rest of Hsp40 remains bound to Hsp70. After the handoff, the misfolded peptide is then unfolded by Hsp70.

""We first uncovered the mechanism of handover, where Hsp40 gives the client to Hsp70 by initially tucking in a phenylalanine into the binding pocket, which subsequently transfers the client into the same site,"" Kalodimos said. ""But then, by having structures of the complex in multiple states, we also saw how the complex releases client proteins.""

The scientists found that when ATP, the energy currency of the cell, binds to Hsp70, Hsp70 changes shape, pushing the phenylalanine back into the binding pocket, which in turn pushes out the client protein and releases it into the cell. Afterward, Hsp40 leaves Hsp70 and is then available to bind another misfolded protein, starting the process again.

""We now understand mechanistically how the chaperones and protein client form this very big complex, how they are released, and how they cycle through these states,"" Kalodimos said. ""Using that knowledge, we have a starting place to look for therapeutic interventions to compensate for disease-causing mutations, to exploit as drug targets in cancers or inspire next-generation antibiotics.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New insights into MDMA therapy for PTSD and beyond","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251014/New-insights-into-MDMA-therapy-for-PTSD-and-beyond.aspx","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 03:45:00 GMT","

A comprehensive peer-reviewed invited review published today in Psychedelics by Dr. Kenji Hashimoto and colleagues (Dr. Mingming Zhao and Dr. Jianjun Yang) synthesizes the evolving landscape of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, examining robust clinical evidence in treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder while identifying promising applications in autism spectrum disorder, eating disorders, and existential distress. The review traces the complex journey from early therapeutic promise through prohibition to current regulatory challenges, providing critical analysis of safety profiles and novel resilience mechanisms mediated by the gut-brain axis.

The review encompasses MDMA research spanning from its 1912 synthesis at Merck through contemporary Phase III clinical trials. Dr. Hashimoto and colleagues systematically analyze how this distinctive entactogen reverses the serotonin transporter to massively increase synaptic serotonin while simultaneously engaging oxytocin and catecholaminergic pathways. The authors examine 126 primary sources to construct a comprehensive narrative of how MDMA produces its unique prosocial and therapeutic effects through multiple neurobiological systems.

This synthesis arrives at a critical juncture following the FDA's August 2024 decision requesting additional Phase III trials despite earlier Breakthrough Therapy designation. The review methodically addresses concerns about functional unblinding and protocol standardization that contributed to regulatory delays while maintaining focus on the substantial therapeutic potential demonstrated across multiple psychiatric conditions.

The authors identify consistent patterns across diverse clinical applications, with PTSD trials showing particularly robust outcomes. Phase II and III studies demonstrated remission rates approaching 80 percent in treatment-resistant cases, with benefits persisting for years following treatment. The synthesis reveals how MDMA-assisted therapy achieved significant symptom reductions where conventional approaches failed, though regulatory approval remains pending due to methodological concerns about blinding integrity and psychotherapeutic protocol standardization.

Beyond PTSD, the review synthesizes emerging evidence in autism spectrum disorder, where controlled trials demonstrated significant reductions in social anxiety. The authors analyze how MDMA's oxytocin-mediated effects may specifically address core social deficits in autism. Similarly promising signals emerge from studies in eating disorders with comorbid PTSD and in patients experiencing existential distress from life-threatening illness.

A particularly innovative contribution involves the authors' synthesis of recent discoveries regarding MDMA-induced resilience through vagus nerve-dependent gut-brain signaling. The review integrates findings from multiple preclinical studies demonstrating that MDMA pretreatment prevents stress-induced behavioral and neurobiological changes through modulation of gut microbiota composition and bile acid metabolism. These mechanisms appear distinct from acute therapeutic effects, suggesting MDMA may confer lasting stress resilience through peripheral as well as central pathways.

Dr. Hashimoto and colleagues analyze how subdiaphragmatic vagotomy abolishes both MDMA-induced oxytocin release and its resilience-enhancing effects, establishing the vagus nerve as critical for therapeutic action. The synthesis connects these findings to epidemiological data associating MDMA use with reduced depression and suicidality at population levels, though the authors carefully note limitations in establishing causality from observational studies.

The review provides comprehensive analysis of acute and chronic safety concerns, synthesizing evidence on hyperthermia, hyponatremia, sympathomimetic overstimulation, and potential neurotoxicity. The authors detail how controlled trials demonstrate an average 3 milliequivalent per liter sodium reduction with unrestricted fluids, with approximately 31 percent developing hyponatremia. They identify oxytocin-mediated antidiuresis as the primary mechanism while noting arginine vasopressin contributions under specific conditions.

Regarding neurotoxicity concerns, the synthesis examines convergent evidence from human neuroimaging, cognitive studies, and animal models demonstrating selective serotonergic terminal injury amplified by hyperthermia and oxidative stress. The authors emphasize how controlled clinical settings with temperature monitoring, fluid restriction, and dosing limits can substantially mitigate these risks while preserving therapeutic benefits.

The review proposes specific strategies for advancing MDMA-assisted therapy toward clinical implementation. The authors advocate for incorporating biomarkers including threat-evoked functional magnetic resonance imaging and oxytocin receptor genotyping to guide patient selection. They emphasize standardizing both pharmacological protocols and psychotherapeutic components while developing consensus on acceptable unblinding thresholds in controlled trials.

Dr. Hashimoto, Professor at Chiba University Center for Forensic Mental Health, brings extensive expertise in neuropharmacology and stress resilience mechanisms. The international team combines clinical psychiatry experience with fundamental neuroscience perspectives, positioning them uniquely to synthesize this complex, multidisciplinary field.

This comprehensive peer-reviewed review article represents a critical synthesis of the current state of knowledge in MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, providing researchers, clinicians, and policymakers with a comprehensive framework for understanding this emerging therapeutic modality. By systematically analyzing and integrating findings from across the literature, the authors offer both a historical perspective on how the field has evolved and a roadmap for future investigations. Such comprehensive reviews are essential for identifying patterns that may not be apparent in individual studies, resolving apparent contradictions in the literature, and highlighting the most promising avenues for advancing the field. The synthesis presented here serves as a valuable resource for both newcomers seeking to understand the field and experienced researchers looking to contextualize their work within the broader scientific landscape.

The brain's mechanisms for repairing injuries caused by trauma or degenerative diseases are not yet known in detail. Now, a study by the University of Barcelona describes a new strategy based on stem cell therapy that could enhance neuronal regeneration and neuroplasticity when this vital organ is damaged. The results reveal that the use of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), combined with stem cell-based cell therapies, could help in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases or brain injuries. 

The study, published in International Journal of Molecular Sciences, is led by Professor Daniel Tornero and researcher Alba Ortega, from the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences and the Institute of Neurosciences of the University of Barcelona (UBneuro). The study involves the decisive participation of a group of UB students who were awarded one of the gold medals in the international synthetic biology competition iGEM 2024, the most important international synthetic biology competition for young researchers. 

BDNF is a protein that is synthesised mainly in the brain and plays a key role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. Several studies have described its potential to promote neuronal survival and growth, findings that are now extended by the new study.

The findings indicate that BDNF can promote the maturation and increase the activity of neurons generated in the laboratory from donor skin cells. The skin cells must first be reprogrammed to become induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and then differentiated to obtain neuronal cultures.""  

Daniel Tornero, UB's Department of Biomedicine and the CIBER Area for the Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED)

In this way, the study combines cell therapy with the production of BDNF in the same cells. This study confirms the beneficial effects of this growth factor in neuronal cultures derived from human stem cells, the same cells that are used in cell therapy to treat, for example, stroke in animal models.

""This strategy is being applied at an experimental level to design cell therapies and to generate laboratory models to help study brain diseases,"" says Tornero. When these neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are modified to continuously overexpress the BDNF protein, ""we obtain more mature and active neuronal cultures, without altering the normal organization of their connections or the functional networks,"" explains researcher Alba Ortega.The study focuses on the more functional aspects of neuronal regeneration, such as neuronal activity and axon generation, which are directly involved in the integration of cells that are transplanted into the brain.

""In addition, cells that produce BDNF are able to attract axons — the extensions that allow communication between neurons — more efficiently. This chemo-attraction effect would be related to the production of this factor,"" says the researcher.

BDNF's ability to attract growing axons has been described previously. Now, the team shows this effect for the first time in neurons derived from human stem cells using a microfluidic chip system. This innovative technology — with two chambers that isolate populations of neurons with or without the ability to produce BDNF — makes it possible to grow populations of neurons communicating through small channels and thus observe precisely how they interact with each other.

""The cells that produce BDNF generate a concentration gradient in these channels, which we believe guides and facilitates the formation of neuronal projections in a specific direction,"" says student Santiago Ramos, representing the group of students who have contributed an innovative perspective to the conceptual and experimental design of the study.

Neurodegenerative diseases and neuronal injuries, which are increasingly frequent in the population, are one of the major challenges for healthcare systems. As the endogenous regenerative capacity of the human brain is very limited, lesions only partially recover and affected patients are often left with motor and cognitive sequelae. In this context, there is an urgent need to design strategies that complement these endogenous brain mechanisms with human stem cell-based therapies to promote neuronal repair, functional integration and more efficient recovery.

In this regard, the team plans to transfer these results to animal models, a line of research developed for some time in this laboratory to improve human stem cell therapy in ischaemic stroke lesions affecting the cerebral cortex.

The application of preclinical advances in patients will mark a turning point in the treatment of many neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are still many obstacles to implementing stem cell-based therapies and avoiding potential side effects (tumour generation, etc.). Some international clinical trials based on stem cell transplantation for the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease (in Japan, Sweden and the United States) are showing promising results.

""Although there are many challenges, progress in Parkinson's clinical trials shows that we are closer than ever to applying these therapies safely in patients with stroke or other neurodegenerative diseases,"" the experts conclude.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study provides new framework for understanding domestic violence","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251015/Study-provides-new-framework-for-understanding-domestic-violence.aspx","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 05:22:00 GMT","

Before going on to commit violence, domestic abusers use a mix of intense affection and emotional cruelty, combined with tales of their own childhood trauma, to generate a deep psychological hold that can feel like an ""addiction"" according to some victims. 

A new study by a University of Cambridge criminologist outlines a tactical playbook deployed by male abusers to engineer a ""trauma bond"": an attachment based in cycles of threat and relief that leaves victims desperate for approval.

While this bond is typically viewed as a response to violent trauma, researcher Mags Lesiak argues it is, in fact, intentionally manufactured by perpetrators using strategic systems of control long before they leave visible marks.

As such, Lesiak says that recovery strategies relying on theories of codependency ""shift blame onto victims"" while ignoring the ""deliberate brainwashing"" by abusers.

For a study published in the journal Violence Against Women, Lesiak conducted extended interviews with eighteen women who had suffered repeated domestic violence during a relationship. 

To investigate the roots of attachment beyond ""captivity"" – the active threat of harm, or control via shared housing, children or finances – women recruited for the study were economically independent and often lived away from abusers during the relationship.

Importantly, the women's relationships had all safely ended. Yet most held a seemingly inexplicable desire – even to themselves – to return to the abuser. Participants included doctors, a dentist, a science teacher and a chef. 

""Patterns of manipulation, grooming and coercion were so consistent it was as if all these women were talking about the same man,"" said Lesiak, who is conducting a PhD at Cambridge's Institute of Criminology.

This is a distinct perpetrator profile. Specific techniques are used to construct and then weaponise love to produce a form of psychological captivity. As with the victims in this study, it can tether women to abusers even without physical or financial coercion.""

Mags Lesiak, Institute of Criminology, University of Cambridge

""Victim attachment to an abuser is not a passive trauma response, but the result of deliberate brainwashing by a perpetrator,"" Lesiak said.

""The abuser's psychological tactics can get obscured by ideas of codependency, which suggest that a victim is partly culpable due to something broken or masochistic within. Domestic abuse isn't about victim pathology but perpetrator strategy.""

Lesiak, who spent a decade in frontline mental health and domestic violence services, identified three core themes running through the interviews. An experience all the women shared is what Lesiak terms the ""two-faced soulmate"".

Abusers displayed an outward charm and often a fierce devotion to their partner, particularly early on. This gave way to cruelty, with verbal and then – months later – often physical abuse randomly juxtaposed with a return to warmth and affection.

""It fits patterns of intermittent reward and punishment, a staple of grooming,"" said Lesiak. ""Many women described classic love-bombing in the early stages. Some spoke of such intense happiness that other non-abusive relationships paled in comparison.""

""These relationships start with enchantment. The coercion and abuse that follows is so disorientating, it leaves victims desperate to preserve the earlier image of their abuser.""

Study participants all reported childhood trauma – from emotionally distant parents to sexual abuse. The perpetrators cultivated a sense of shared pain, coaxing personal histories out of the women by sharing accounts of their own traumatic childhoods.

This information was exploited by abusers as a tool of control, either to generate false intimacy, or through humiliation: belittling their partner over who had it worse, or using it to mock them in front of others.

""All the perpetrators co-opted the healing potential of mutual trauma to justify abuse, foster dependency, and obscure responsibility for their own actions,"" said Lesiak.

Lastly, when asked how they felt about their former partner, most women compared their situation directly to addiction, and admitted retaining a compulsion to see their abuser despite clear cognitive understanding of this impulse as destructive.

""While it is uncomfortable, I must respect the language used by the participants, and it was explicitly that of addiction and craving. Several women related it directly to hard drug use,"" said Lesiak. In fact, three study participants relocated to new cities just to reduce the chances they would reinitiate contact. 

""Abusers make sure their partners experience euphoric highs and desperate lows,"" said Lesiak. ""This creates a powerful psychological reward system that operates on the same logic as a slot machine, with unpredictable wins, sudden losses, and escalating self-blame.""

Lesiak argues that professional training for police and other frontline workers should include recognising non-physical forms of entrapment – such as the ""two-faced soulmate"" profile – as indicators of coercive control.

""All human bonds involve care, endurance, and sometimes pain. By coupling cycles of affection and cruelty with the exploitation of shared trauma, abusers create a bond they can use as a tool of control.""

Peginterferon-α treatment exhibits low rates of the serological conversion rate of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and the negative conversion rate of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, with significant myelosuppression leading to treatment discontinuation in some patients. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may ameliorate liver inflammation and modulate immune responses. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of combining TCM with pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN) α-2b and its impact on myelosuppression adverse effects.

This study included 117 HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients who started initial antiviral therapy at Xiamen Hospital of TCM between June 2018 and January 2023. According to the treatment regimen, patients were divided into the observation group (n = 56, receiving PEG-IFN α-2b combined with Licorice 15 g, Angelica sinensis 20 g, Poria 20 g, Paeonia lactiflora 20 g, Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae 20 g, Radix Bupleurum Chinense 20 g, Mentha piperita 3 g, Ginger three slices for more than six months) and the control group (n = 61, receiving PEG-IFN α-2b alone). This study retrospectively analyzed etiological indicators, liver biochemical indicators, and blood routine tests before and after treatment.

After 24 and 48 weeks of treatment, the observation group demonstrated significantly superior outcomes to the control group in quantitative reduction of hepatitis B surface antigen, the serological conversion rate of HBeAg, and the reduction in HBV DNA quantification (P < 0.05). By week 48, the HBV DNA negative conversion rate in the observation group (46.67%) was significantly higher than that in the control group (26.67%) (P < 0.05). Regarding safety, the incidence of myelosuppression in the observation group was significantly lower than that in the control group at both 24 and 48 weeks of treatment (P < 0.05)

Real-world findings demonstrate that adjunctive TCM significantly enhances the antiviral efficacy of peginterferon α-2b in HBeAg-positive CHB patients while concurrently mitigating treatment-limiting myelosuppression. This combination strategy may represent a clinically valuable approach to optimizing interferon-based therapy for CHB.

With over 350 peer-reviewed publications and an exceptional h-index of 125, Dr. Amin has positioned herself at the vanguard of molecular epidemiology, challenging long-held paradigms about depression pathogenesis through innovative multi-omics approaches that extend far beyond traditional genetic frameworks.

The interview, published as part of the Innovators & Ideas series, reveals how Dr. Amin transformed early career setbacks into scientific breakthroughs that now influence research laboratories from Europe to Asia. Her journey from Pakistan to becoming one of Oxford's leading molecular epidemiologists exemplifies the power of perseverance in advancing global medical knowledge. When traditional genome-wide association studies failed to produce significant results for depression, Dr. Amin pioneered alternative approaches that have since yielded extraordinary discoveries benefiting researchers and patients worldwide.

Dr. Amin's identification of the RCL1 gene mutation represents a watershed moment in depression research, opening entirely new avenues for understanding the disorder's biological mechanisms. This discovery connects primate-specific interlaminar astrocytes to depression pathogenesis, providing researchers worldwide with novel therapeutic targets previously unexplored. Her work challenges the conventional view of depression as primarily a neurotransmitter imbalance, instead revealing it as a systemic disease involving multiple bodily systems.

The scope of her contributions extends beyond single gene discoveries. Leading the most extensive published studies on epigenomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiome in major depression, Dr. Amin has identified 124 metabolites associated with the disorder, with 49 being entirely novel discoveries. These findings, published in prestigious journals including Nature Communications and JAMA Psychiatry, provide the international scientific community with crucial biomarkers that could revolutionize diagnosis and treatment approaches globally.

The interview reveals Dr. Amin's paradigm-shifting perspective on depression as fundamentally a systemic disease rather than purely a brain disorder. This conceptualization transforms how researchers worldwide approach the condition, encouraging investigation of immune system disturbances, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction, oxidative stress, and metabolic perturbations. Her integrative approach, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and single-cell analysis, provides unprecedented molecular insights that benefit laboratories across continents pursuing personalized medicine approaches.

Dr. Amin emphasizes the critical importance of understanding feedback loops among biological, psychological, and social factors in depression development and maintenance. This holistic view influences treatment strategies globally, moving beyond one-size-fits-all models toward personalized interventions tailored to individual biological markers, life histories, and environmental contexts. The implications extend to public health policies worldwide, as her research demonstrates why depression contributes to higher morbidity and mortality through its effects on multiple physiological systems.

The interview provides intimate glimpses into the personal challenges that shaped Dr. Amin's scientific philosophy and resilience. Her transition from electronics enthusiast to world-renowned geneticist began with her own diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome at age 19, sparking curiosity about genetic mechanisms that would define her career. The narrative of overcoming significant personal and professional obstacles, including navigating academia as a brown woman from a developing country, resonates with scientists worldwide facing similar barriers.

Dr. Amin candidly discusses critical moments that nearly derailed her career, including the departure of her supervisor early in her doctoral studies and initial project failures that left her without publications. Her mentor, Professor Cornelia van Duijn, played a pivotal role in transforming these setbacks into opportunities for growth. This relationship exemplifies the importance of mentorship in fostering scientific excellence across cultural and geographic boundaries.

Her advocacy for equality, diversity, and inclusion in scientific grant awards and promotions addresses systemic issues affecting researchers globally. Dr. Amin's observation that she must invest ""at least twice the effort"" of many European counterparts to achieve comparable outcomes highlights persistent inequities requiring international attention and reform.

Looking forward, Dr. Amin outlines ambitious goals for experimentally verifying causal associations between genetic and environmental risk factors for depression. Her vision encompasses developing integrated models spanning the entire chain of causation from risk exposure to molecular perturbation to clinical outcomes. This comprehensive approach promises to benefit healthcare systems worldwide by enabling more effective prevention and intervention strategies.

The research particularly emphasizes understanding how discoveries apply across diverse populations, ensuring that advances in depression genetics benefit people regardless of geographic location or ethnic background. Dr. Amin's work on rare variants demonstrates that population-specific genetic factors require consideration in developing truly global solutions to depression treatment.

Her dedication to open-access publishing through Genomic Press ensures that these groundbreaking discoveries remain accessible to researchers worldwide, particularly those in resource-limited settings who might otherwise lack access to critical scientific literature. This commitment to scientific democratization amplifies the global impact of her research, enabling scientists everywhere to build upon her discoveries.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Ateneo scientists advance toward a vaccine for stomach ulcers","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251014/Ateneo-scientists-advance-toward-a-vaccine-for-stomach-ulcers.aspx","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 03:34:00 GMT","

Since ancient times, it was thought that painful stomach ulcers were caused by eating spicy foods or having an unhealthy diet. But since then, researchers have found that Helicobacter pylori—a common bacterium found in over 60% of the world's population—was the real culprit behind most stomach ulcers and a high risk for stomach cancer.

Now scientists from the Ateneo de Manila University School of Science and Engineering's Department of Biology are on the way to finding a vaccine to fight off the bacterium, possibly preventing stomach ulcers and lowering the risk for stomach cancer.

Ateneo biologists Demy Valerie Chacon, Kiana Alika Co, Daphne Noreen Enriquez, Aubrey Love Labarda, Reanne Eden Manongsong, and Edward Kevin Bragais used a cutting-edge approach called ""immunoinformatics"" that combines computer science with immunology to scan the genetic makeup of pathogens and predict which parts of them can trigger a strong immune response. By running thousands of gene sequences through these computational tools, researchers can narrow down the most promising vaccine targets much faster and at lower cost than through trial-and-error lab work alone.

The Ateneo biologists have identified key proteins produced by H. pylori that help it survive stomach acid, stick to the stomach lining, and evade the body's natural immune system. Their analysis also identified parts of these proteins that are most likely to be safe, non-allergenic, and capable of activating protective immune cells.

While their research findings are still preliminary and based on computer simulations, the next steps include laboratory testing to validate these predictions. To date, there are no approved vaccines against H. pylori despite ongoing tentative research in other laboratories around the world. However, if successful, the Ateneo research could pave the way for the first-ever H. pylori vaccine that could help guard against stomach ulcers and cancer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Predictive models identify high-risk liver cancer recurrence","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251014/Predictive-models-identify-high-risk-liver-cancer-recurrence.aspx","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 03:36:00 GMT","

Liver cancer is one of the world's deadliest malignancies, ranking as the third leading cause of cancer-related death. While advances in surgery have improved safety, recurrence after hepatectomy remains a formidable challenge. Among the various patterns, hyper-progression recurrence (HPR) stands out for its speed and severity—multiple tumor nodules erupt within months, overwhelming the liver's capacity and leaving patients with few curative options. Conventional staging systems fail to capture this risk, leaving clinicians without clear guidance. Because of these challenges, it has become essential to develop predictive models and molecular insights that can help identify high-risk patients and guide more effective strategies.A research team from Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital and partner centers conducted one of the largest studies to date on liver cancer recurrence, following 3,125 patients across eight hospitals. Published (DOI: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2024.0514) online July 11, 2025, in Cancer Biology & Medicine, the work reveals a set of predictive nomogram and inference tree models capable of stratifying patients before and after surgery. By combining clinical predictors with molecular profiling, the study not only delivers practical tools for doctors but also highlights MYCN/HMGA2 as a key molecular signature of aggressive recurrence.Over 16,000 liver cancer patients were initially screened, with 3,125 meeting strict inclusion criteria. Among them, 16.2% experienced HPR, often within the first four months post-surgery. These patients had markedly lower survival rates and were almost entirely limited to palliative or supportive care.Through statistical analysis, nine independent risk factors emerged, including young age, elevated alpha-fetoprotein, large tumors, multiple nodules, vascular invasion, microvascular invasion, high Ki67 index, incomplete tumor capsule, and postoperative complications. A preoperative nomogram built from six of these predictors achieved striking accuracy, with an area under the curve exceeding 94%. When combined with a conditional inference tree, the model effectively distinguished patients at very low, moderate, and very high risk, enabling tailored surgical decisions.To extend this framework, a postoperative model incorporated all nine predictors and further guided the use of early adjuvant therapies. Patients at high postoperative risk who received transcatheter chemoembolization or hepatic artery infusion therapy had improved outcomes compared to those without additional treatment. At the molecular level, nearly 5,000 genes were differentially expressed in HPR tumors. Enrichment of cell cycle pathways, immune exhaustion, and especially co-expression of MYCN and HMGA2 underscored the biological aggressiveness driving this recurrence type.

Our findings move beyond observation to action. We now have reliable tools to predict which patients are likely to face this devastating recurrence and can adapt treatment plans accordingly. For some, surgery may not offer benefit, while others could gain from early adjuvant therapies. Equally important, the discovery of MYCN/HMGA2 co-expression gives us a molecular marker to pursue in future drug development. This dual approach—clinical prediction and biological understanding—brings us closer to precision oncology in liver cancer.""

Dr. Lunan Qi, senior author of the study

The study provides a roadmap for managing one of the toughest challenges in liver cancer care. Preoperative models can help identify patients who may not benefit from surgery, reducing unnecessary risk, while postoperative models guide the timely application of adjuvant therapies. This tiered strategy allows for more personalized treatment, improving the chances of longer survival and better quality of life. At the same time, the identification of MYCN/HMGA2 as a marker of poor prognosis opens doors for new targeted therapies. Together, these insights offer clinicians practical tools and scientists fresh directions to tackle aggressive liver cancer recurrence.

Rapid and urgent action on food is needed if the UK is to reboot its flagging economy, save the NHS billions, ensure national food security, and meet climate commitments, according to a new report.

The Roadmap for Resilience: A UK Food Plan for 2050, calls for radical transformation, at a scale and pace not seen since the Second World War. It says if we do not act now, change will be forced upon us by increasing pressures and the UK will lurch from crisis to crisis, including from food price shocks, climate disasters and weakening economic productivity.

Acting now however, allows the UK to decide its own future, and must include three core transformations: more resilient farming, smarter land use, and healthier diets. Government must take the lead with ""decisive and coordinated action"", says the report, and proposes 10 key recommendations and a timeline to 2050.

The report is published as renewed attention is being given to global food system transformation, including through the EAT-Lancet Commission's latest report released earlier this month.

""Achieving this transformation has the power to deliver a food system where everyone in the UK has access to healthy and sustainable food,"" said Neil Ward, Co-lead of the Agri-Food for Net Zero (AFN) Network+, which coordinated the report, and a professor at the University of East Anglia (UEA).

Through these three transformations we can reduce pressure on the NHS and help people lead healthier and more economically active lives. Nature will flourish, emissions will fall and farming will be more resilient and secure for future generations.""

Neil Ward, Professor, University of East Anglia

""Pressures from climate change, global shocks and poor diets mean significant change to our food system is inevitable over the next 50 years. However, if we act now, we still have time to shape our future, and positively impact national security, national health, economic growth and climate change. Our window to act is narrow though - if we do not, change will be forced on us by crisis,"" added Professor Ward.

The report had input from 150 scientists and industry professionals from across research institutes, farming, charities and the food industry, and is the culmination of three years of work by the AFN Network+, a project funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), with 3,000 members and led by a group of 11 universities and research institutes.

The report highlights that the UK food system is a significant source of national greenhouse gas emissions and will become the largest source of emissions by the 2040s. Meanwhile, poor diets cost the economy £268 billion a year in direct healthcare costs as well as indirect costs such as low economic activity, and 7.2 million people now live in food-insecure households - an increase of 80% in just three years. Adding to these challenges, the UK is vulnerable to supply chain disruptions, since it is dependent on imports for 50% of vegetables and 85% of fruit, despite these being essential to healthy diets.

The Roadmap calls for transformation in three key areas:

 

The authors set out 10 priority actions, urging the government to work in partnership with farmers, food companies and local authorities. These include:

Professor Tim Benton, Co-lead of the AFN Network+, said: ""Every year of delay makes transformation harder and more costly. We call on all parties, public institutions, industry and civil society to unite to drive forwards the transformations highlighted in this Roadmap. Change is coming to our food system, but how we shape it is our choice to make.""

Professor Charlotte Deane, Executive Chair of UKRI's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, said: ""Agri-food remains one of the UK's most stubborn sources of emissions.

""The AFN Network+ has brought together a powerful community of research leaders and stakeholders across UK agri-food, third sector organisations, policymakers and agri-food industry professionals to tackle this challenge and now delivered a clear roadmap for change.

""Our investment has resulted in a legacy of insights which will help shape future land use and food strategy, supporting the UK's path to net zero.""
The Roadmap for Resilience: A UK Food Plan for 2050 was developed by the AFN Network+, drawing on insights from across its community of more than 3,000 members. The AFN Network+ is jointly led by UEA, the University of Leeds, University of York, and the University of the West of England.

Surveys of more than 1,000 Italian patients and clinicians uncover why oral steroid use remains widespread in asthma care, revealing gaps in guideline adherence, patient education, and access to advanced biologic therapies.

Study: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients with asthma: how far is clinical practice from the guidelines? Results from surveys of patients and doctors. Image credit: zlikovec/Shutterstock.com

A recent Frontiers in Allergy study examined usage patterns and barriers to adherence to oral corticosteroid (OCS) treatment guidelines for asthma in Italy. To do so, surveys were conducted with healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients.

Asthma affects an estimated 262 million people worldwide, with the highest incidence seen in children under nine. Globally, its prevalence has increased by about 15% between 1990 and 2019. In Italy alone, around 4 million people live with asthma, including approximately 200,000 with severe asthma (SA), a group that represents a substantial burden on healthcare resources and costs.

The management of SA often requires the use of long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs). Existing guidelines recommend the use of OCS only as a last option due to severe adverse effects, such as growth impairment in children and iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency. Despite this, OCS medications are commonly prescribed in asthma treatment. However, patients have their concerns, and research shows that about 44% of adults report worries about OCS use, sometimes leading them to reduce or discontinue treatment without medical supervision by HCPs. Therefore, a gap exists between clinical practice and guidelines, which needs to be examined.

To address the knowledge gap between guidelines and clinical practice concerning asthma treatment, the Respiriamo Insieme Association in Italy, in collaboration with Sanofi, conducted two surveys among HCPs (survey 1) and patients (survey 2). The current study documents the results of these surveys, which aim to reduce OCS dependence and enhance the quality of life of SA patients.

Survey 1 comprised seven closed-ended questions (six multiple-choice and one rating scale) and gathered insights into the OCS prescribing practices, barriers to proper use, potential overuse patterns, and adherence to current guidelines. Survey 2 explored patients' perspectives on awareness and involvement in treatment decisions, usage patterns, treatment adjustment and monitoring, education provided by HCPs, management of adverse events (AEs), and safety practices concerning OCS use.

A total of 366 HCPs completed the survey, and 82% preferred a 10-day OCS treatment duration. A duration of more than 21 days was preferred by 14% of HCPs, and the remaining opted for longer treatment durations. Ninety-nine percent of HCPs said that either more than 6 months of OCS use per year or 2 or 3 cycles per year was necessary to classify a patient as OCS-dependent. The remaining 1% thought a single cycle was enough. Concerning the annual cumulative corticosteroid use, 28% reported never keeping track of the total OCS dose for their patients, 40% reported doing this, 24% did this occasionally, and the remaining 8% based their calculations on prescribed OCS doses.

Twenty-seven percent of HCPs thought the maximum safe daily dose was 7.5 mg/day, while 43% put this at 5 mg/day. Twelve and 18% thought the safe limits were 2 mg/day and 10 mg/day, respectively. Regarding strategies to minimize the OCS dose in managing SA, 43% responded that changing the ICS/LABA combination was the most effective. This was closely followed by using biologic therapies (37%). More than half of the HCPs thought that a multidisciplinary approach is crucial to prevent adverse effects of OCS, and about 44% recommended monitoring visits for bone densitometry every two years.

Overall, patients and their families/caregivers completed 829 questionnaires, of which 468 belonged to patients with SA. Only two-thirds of patients with non-SA were prescribed OCS, compared with 95% of patients with SA. Around 47% of SA patients used OCS more than once, for at least two cycles per year, compared with 27% of non-SA patients. Overall, 13% of SA and 14% of non-SA patients reported having ceased OCS use. Forty-seven percent of SA patients and 24% of non-SA patients used OCS once a year or more without a valid prescription. Forty percent of SA and 31% of non-SA patients did not taper the dose when stopping, while 52% and 33% of SA and non-SA patients did, respectively.

In about 71% of SA patients, the physician involved them in the decision to take OCS, compared to 43% for non-SA patients. Physicians did not inform 45% of non-SA and 49% of SA patients about the possible alternatives to OCS, respectively. Concerning the long-term strategy, inhaler medications were common in the non-SA group, while biologics were most common in the SA group.

Twenty-two percent of non-SA patients reported being informed about adverse reactions, whereas 35% reported never being informed. Among the SA patients, 41% were informed about potential side effects, while 57% reported not being referred to a specialist. Most patients did not receive a bone health assessment. The study also found that about 40% of patients self-administered OCS at least once per year without a prescription, often due to fear of exacerbations or difficulty accessing healthcare. This reflects the ease of access to OCS without a prescription in Italy. A much higher proportion of SA patients acquired OCS without a valid prescription, relative to non-SA patients.

The findings show a significant discrepancy between guideline recommendations and clinical practice, and OCS use remains very high in Italy. Reducing unnecessary OCS use through biologic therapies could also help lower healthcare costs.

Several unmet needs and proposed systemic reforms: establishing a clearer and pragmatic definition of “OCS dependency,” improving patient education and shared decision-making, increasing access to multidisciplinary care (including psychological support), and using digital or diary-based monitoring tools to track OCS adherence and side effects.

A key limitation of the study was the inability to distinguish between respondents from pediatric and adult care settings. This may have led to misinterpretation of notable differences in OCS use between adults and children. Secondly, the study's cross-sectional nature exposes it to response bias, inaccurate self-reporting, and recall bias. Finally, the results may not be generalizable to other populations as the study was conducted on a selected set of Italian HCPs and patients.

The study underscores the persistence of high OCS use despite guideline recommendations, highlighting the need for coordinated education, standardized monitoring, and integrated psychological and specialist care to reduce unnecessary OCS exposure in severe asthma management.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Positive views on aging linked to greater physical activity in older adults","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251015/Positive-views-on-aging-linked-to-greater-physical-activity-in-older-adults.aspx","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 17:27:00 GMT","

Older adults, especially those living with health conditions, who hold positive views about aging are more likely to engage in vigorous physical activity, according to a study led by the University of Surrey.

Surrey researchers found that how an individual's outlook on aging - whether they see it as a time of growth or decline - is a significant correlate of their physical activity levels.

The research, published on Healthcare, analysed data from 1,699 UK residents aged 50 and over, and found that positive views on aging were linked to a greater likelihood of engaging in vigorous activity. People with a higher number of non-communicable diseases - such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease - were more likely to engage in vigorous physical activity if they had a more positive view of aging.

Our research suggests that a positive outlook on aging could act as a psychological buffer, helping individuals stay active despite health challenges. Addressing people's beliefs about aging may be just as important as addressing their physical health needs, which should be considered when designing public health strategies to promote a healthy and active lifestyle.""

Professor Victoria Tischler, co-author of the study and Professor of Behavioural Science, University of Surrey

The researchers propose that public health campaigns and interventions should support older people to maintain a positive attitude towards physical activity, even if they experience illness or long-term conditions. So, promoting positive views on aging can be important not only to promote health, but also to improve the quality of life in older people who experience one or more health conditions. These efforts could help older adults reframe aging not as a period of inevitable decline, but as a life stage where it is still possible to maintain an active and engaged lifestyle.

Dr Serena Sabatini, lead author of the study and visiting lecturer at the University of Surrey adds:

""The ultimate goal is to create a society where an active and engaged later life is not only possible but expected, even in the presence of health challenges.""

Polyethyleneimines (PEIs) are extensively researched as non-viral vectors for gene and medication delivery because of their capacity to condense nucleic acids into nanoparticles known as polyplexes.1

Compared to viral vectors, PEIs have lower immunogenicity, higher loading capacity, and lower production costs.2

However, their clinical translation has been hampered due to low transfection efficiencies.3

The type of polyplex formation, which regulates cellular absorption and intracellular release, is an important element in managing transfection.

Effective delivery systems require polyplexes that are sturdy enough to avoid premature nucleic acid release, while remaining weak enough to release the payload at the appropriate time and position within the cell.4

Understanding the intermolecular interactions and conformational changes involved in polyplex synthesis and stability is critical for enhancing PEI-based delivery platforms. According to Mustafa et al., attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy is ideal for this application.5

It reveals molecular-level information about DNA structure and binding via vibrational modes of the phosphate backbone and nucleobases. This article shows how ATR-FTIR can be utilized to characterize polyplex production using linear and branching PEI architectures.

Mustafa et al. provide a detailed discussion of their procedures. ATR-FTIR measurements were taken using a commercially available FTIR spectrometer with a Harrick ConcentratIR2™ multiple reflection silicon ATR attachment.5

Two PEI structures were investigated: linear (LPEI, 15 kDa) and branching (BPEI, 10 kDa). Polyplexes were generated at N/P ratios ranging from zero to three in 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).

The final concentrations were three millimolar LPEI, five millimolar BPEI, and one millimolar DNA. Before measurements were taken, the samples were incubated for one hour at room temperature.



Figure 2. Diagrams showing the probability of bound DNA by polymers obtained from the ATR-FTIR spectra of LPEI and BPEI polyplexes in the presence of varying NaCl concentrations (50-250 mM). Image Credit: Specac Ltd

To confirm the spectrum interpretation, additional samples were generated at increasing sodium chloride concentrations (50-250 mM) to test for electrostatic interactions. All spectra were background removed, baseline corrected, and normalized.

Figure 1 shows ATR-FTIR spectra of DNA with increasing N/P ratios for LPEI and BPEI. With LPEI, the asymmetric phosphate stretching band at 1222 cm-1 shows a noticeable frequency shift as N/P rises, showing strong electrostatic binding to the DNA backbone.

This frequency shift also signals a conformational change in the DNA structure, from B to Z. Moderate alterations were found in the nucleobase ring stretching region (1400-1500 cm-1) and carbonyl band (1680 cm-1). These modifications imply that LPEI interacts weakly with DNA nucleobases.

The spectra of BPEI-based polyplexes exhibited no shift at 1222 cm-1, but a considerable intensity decrease and splitting of the 1680 cm-1 band, indicating interactions with nucleobases via intercalation, without major disruption of the phosphate backbone.

Salt screening assays supported these interpretations. Figure 2 shows that increasing NaCl reduced LPEI binding by around 70 %, consistent with electrostatic interactions. At the greatest salt concentrations, BPEI binding decreased by just 20-30 %, indicating that interactions with DNA nucleobases primarily aid binding.

This study shows that ATR-FTIR with the ConcentratIR2 accessory may successfully distinguish between binding modes in PEI-DNA polyplexes.

The 1222 cm-1 phosphate band detects electrostatic interactions between LPEI and DNA, while the 1680 cm-1 band indicates BPEI intercalation with nucleobases. These findings serve as a foundation for developing more successful non-viral gene delivery technologies.

Researchers reveal that continuous monitoring with the STAT-ON™ wearable could transform Parkinson's management, saving millions in care costs while enhancing patients' quality of life.

Study: Improving Parkinson's disease management through wearable technology: A cost-benefit perspective. Image credit: Chinnapong/Shutterstock.com

STAT-ON™, a wearable medical device, may reduce clinical costs related to Parkinson's disease management by continuously monitoring symptoms and optimizing treatment adjustments, as a new study published in PLOS ONE reported.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease, affecting approximately 7 to 10 million people globally. With increasing life expectancy and related rise in aging populations, especially in Western countries, the prevalence of PD is expected to reach 17 million in 2040 and 25 million in 2050.

Such an exponential rise in prevalence, together with a high increase in medical costs, may significantly burden public healthcare systems. According to the Parkinson's Europe Association, the social costs of PD are approximately €11.600 per patient per year.

The diagnosis of PD is a complex process, and no curable treatment is currently available. Existing evidence indicates that about 40% of PD cases are wrongly diagnosed in current clinical practice, which is often frustrating for both patients and physicians.

In this context, many neurologists suggest that wearable medical devices can be helpful in continuously monitoring symptoms and acquiring relevant and reliable information from patients in home environments. However, the cost-effectiveness of introducing wearable devices in clinical practice remains largely unknown.

In the current study, researchers explored the modeled economic impact and potential clinical use of a wearable medical device, STAT-ON™, to reduce overall healthcare costs and improve quality of life in patients with PD.

STAT-ON™ is an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered waist-worn medical device that monitors PD-related motor symptoms during daily activities. It also provides information about patient's medication intake.

PD symptoms are often underestimated in clinical practice due to subjective assessments and limited consultation time. Clinical evaluation is also challenging, as symptoms typically occur every 6 to 9 months and last only about 20 minutes per visit. This lack of diagnosis subsequently leads to delayed treatment adjustments and worsening of clinical outcomes and patients' quality of life. 

STAT-ON™ is an extensively validated device that can accurately detect key motor symptoms related to PD, supporting physicians in treatment decision-making and optimization. The device has shown comparable efficacy in hospital settings with other conventional tools, highlighting its clinical usefulness in assisting hospital neurologists.

The patient's data is securely stored in the device with proper privacy, and data retrieval is managed through a healthcare professional's smartphone app. After retrieval and report generation, the data is deleted for device reuse with other patients.

One major advantage of STAT-ON™ over wrist-worn devices is that its placement on the waist enables more precise monitoring of axial symptoms. On the other hand, wrist-worn devices cannot accurately monitor motor complications affecting the trunk, lower limbs, and neck.

The study used previously published and validated data to conduct a cost-benefit analysis for introducing STAT-ON™ in European healthcare systems for PD management.  

The analysis revealed that continuous monitoring and accurate assessment of PD symptoms using STAT-ON™ helps optimize treatment regimens, reducing hospitalizations and institutional care costs.

Studies in different European countries reported considerable healthcare cost reductions through STAT-ON™ mediated detection of moderate and advanced symptoms in patients with PD. Specifically, the study estimated potential cost reductions of up to €137.8 million in Germany and €19 million in Sweden when STAT-ON™ is used to detect advanced PD symptoms.

These benefits support the inclusion of STAT-ON™ in clinical practice. Although this inclusion may increase medication expenses due to the prescription of highly expensive medicines for advanced disease stages, the improvement in patients' quality of life and reduction in direct healthcare expenses will help offset the costs of medications.  

STAT-ON™ was developed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patients' quality of life. This device can also serve as a telemedicine tool for remote monitoring of PD patients. Telemedicine studies involving STAT-ON™ have reported significant improvement in daily-life activities, physical activity, depression, apathy, movement difficulties, balance, and frailty in PD patients.

Besides clinical benefits, STAT-ON™ can support fundamental research by providing data on PD patients' motor symptoms and daily activities. By ensuring personalized monitoring, the device can also reduce participant drop-out and improve adherence, strengthening the quality of clinical trials.

Regarding treatment optimization, STAT-ON™ can assist physicians in identifying patients suitable for second-line therapies, such as deep brain stimulation, continuous dopaminergic infusions, and other advanced treatments recommended for patients who do not respond to first-line medications.

Overall, the study's model-based cost-benefit analysis supports including STAT-ON™ in clinical practice for PD management. However, the analysis relies on economic data from various European healthcare systems, which differ in structure, reimbursement policies, and medical care costs, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings.

Furthermore, the study addressed direct medical costs related to PD. Still, it did not thoroughly consider indirect costs such as caregiver burden and lost productivity, which may affect the observed cost-effectiveness of STAT-ON™.

Previous validation studies determined the efficacy of STAT-ON™ in detecting PD symptoms. Further large-scale clinical trials are required to confirm the effectiveness across different patient populations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Breakthrough AI method redefines how doctors analyze medical images","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251014/Breakthrough-AI-method-redefines-how-doctors-analyze-medical-images.aspx","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 01:59:00 GMT","

When doctors analyze a medical scan of an organ or area in the body, each part of the image has to be assigned an anatomical label. If the brain is under scrutiny for instance, its different parts have to be labeled as such, pixel by pixel: cerebral cortex, brain stem, cerebellum, etc. The process, called medical image segmentation, guides diagnosis, surgery planning and research.

In the days before artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), clinicians performed this crucial yet painstaking and time-consuming task by hand, but over the past decade, U-nets ⎯ a type of AI architecture specifically designed for medical image segmentation ⎯ have been the go-to instead. However, U-nets require large amounts of data and resources to be trained.

""For large and/or 3D images, these demands are costly,"" said Kushal Vyas, a Rice electrical and computer engineering doctoral student and first author on a paper presented at the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Society, or MICCAI, the leading conference in the field. ""In this study, we proposed MetaSeg, a completely new way of performing image segmentation.""

In experiments using 2D and 3D brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, MetaSeg was shown to achieve the same segmentation performance as U-Nets while needing 90% fewer parameters ⎯ the key variables AI/ML models derive from training data and use to identify patterns and make predictions.

The study, titled ""Fit Pixels, Get Labels: Meta-learned Implicit Networks for Image Segmentation,"" won the best paper award at MICCAI, getting recognized from a pool of over 1,000 accepted submissions.

Instead of U-Nets, MetaSeg leverages implicit neural representations ⎯ a neural network framework that has hitherto not been thought useful or explored for image segmentation.""

Kushal Vyas, a Rice electrical and computer engineering doctoral student and first author

An implicit neural representation (INR) is an AI network that interprets a medical image as a mathematical formula that accounts for the signal value (color, brightness, etc.) of each and every pixel in a 2D image or every voxel in a 3D one.

While INRs offer a very detailed yet compact way to represent information, they are also highly specific, meaning they typically only work well for the single signal/image they trained on: An INR trained on a brain MRI cannot typically generalize rules about what different parts of the brain look like, so if provided with an image of a different brain, the INR would typically falter.

""INRs have been used in the computer vision and medical imaging communities for tasks such as 3D scene reconstruction and signal compression, which only require modeling one signal at a time,"" Vyas said. ""However, it was not obvious before MetaSeg how to use them for tasks such as segmentation, which require learning patterns over many signals.""

To make it useful for medical image segmentation, the researchers taught INRs to predict both the signal values and the specific segmentation labels for a given image. To do so, they used meta-learning, an AI training strategy whose literal translation is ""learning to learn"" that helps models rapidly adapt to new information.

""We prime the INR model parameters in such a way so that they are further optimized on an unseen image at test time, which enables the model to decode the image features into accurate labels,"" Vyas said.

This special training allows the INRs to not only quickly adjust themselves to match the pixels or voxels of a previously unseen medical image but to then also decode its labels, instantly predicting where the outlines for different anatomical regions should go.

""MetaSeg offers a fresh, scalable perspective to the field of medical image segmentation that has been dominated for a decade by U-Nets,"" said Guha Balakrishnan, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Rice and a member of the university's Ken Kennedy Institute. ""Our research results promise to make medical image segmentation far more cost-effective while delivering top performance.""

Balakrishnan, the corresponding author on the study, is part of a thriving ecosystem of Rice researchers at the forefront of digital health innovation, which includes the Digital Health Initiative and the joint Rice-Houston Methodist Digital Health Institute. Ashok Veeraraghavan, chair of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and professor of electrical and computer engineering and computer science at Rice, is also an author on the study.

While MetaSeg can be applied to a range of imaging contexts, its demonstrated potential to enhance brain imaging illustrates the kind of research Proposition 14 ⎯ on the ballot in Texas Nov. 4 ⎯ could help expand statewide.

The research was supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (R01DE032051), the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (D24AC00296) and the National Science Foundation (2107313, 1648449).

Tara McKeown and Trinity Rodman will join USWNT for friendlies against Portugal and New Zealand 

Washington, D.C. (10/15/2025) – Washington Spirit defender Tara McKeown and forward Trinity Rodman have been called up to the U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT) for the side's October friendlies, U.S. Soccer announced today. The U.S. will take on Portugal and New Zealand in three friendly matches later this month. 

McKeown earns her sixth consecutive call-up to the U.S. senior team in just her third season at center back. Making her first appearance and start for the USWNT against Colombia in this year's SheBelieves Cup, McKeown also tallied her first international assist when she connected with Ally Sentnor for a second half goal. In a July friendly against Canada at the Spirit's home ground of Audi Field, McKeown earned her second assist from the back line. The defender has tallied eight total appearances and two assists for the USWNT. 

Rodman returns to the USWNT for the first time since early April after taking time over the spring and summer to rehab her back. In her most recent call-up, the standout scoring threat netted a goal just five minutes into a friendly against Brazil in front of over 32,000 fans at Sofi Stadium in Los Angeles. With the senior team, Rodman has tallied 11 goals and nine assists across 47 appearances. 

USWNT's October Friendly Schedule: 

McKeown moved from forward to defender after the 2022 season and has been a stalwart for the Spirit, appearing in 71 regular season matches since. An NWSL Defender of the Year finalist and Iron Woman in 2024, the standout also earned NWSL Player of the Week honors last month for her performance in the Spirit's away shutout of the Shield-winning Kansas City Current. 

Rodman has had a stellar second half of the regular season with the Spirit, tallying five goals and two assists so far and earning NWSL Player of the Month honors for September. The star forward's play since the start of August has helped Washington clinch the second overall seed and home-field advantage in the NWSL Playoffs for the second consecutive season. 

The Spirit will return to Audi Field for a championship rematch with the Orlando Pride on Saturday, October 18 at 12:30 p.m. EDT. The match will be Washington's final home match before the playoffs. Tickets are available here.

At 36, Press has cemented her legacy as one of U.S. soccer's all-time greats.

Christen Press, one of the most celebrated players in U.S. women's soccer history, is officially hanging up her cleats.

At 36, the two-time World Cup champion and Angel City FC forward announced her retirement from professional soccer, sharing the emotional news in an interview with ""Good Morning America"" that aired Wednesday.

""I'm retiring from professional soccer, and I've decided that this is my last season and my last few games,"" Press said. ""I feel a mix of everything. There's yes, there's relief, there's joy, there's excitement, there's fear, there's so much grief. I have so much grief, a part of me, a piece of me, I'm losing her.""

Over the course of her remarkable career, Press earned 155 caps and scored 64 goals for the U.S. Women's National Team, helping lead the squad to two FIFA Women's World Cup titles.

Known for her speed, technical precision and calm under pressure, Press became a defining figure of the USWNT's golden era.

Her influence extended well beyond the field. As a trailblazer for equity in women's sports and a founding member of Angel City FC, Press helped shape the next generation of women's soccer in Los Angeles.

Three years ago, Press suffered a devastating knee injury that sidelined her for more than a year.

Despite a determined comeback and return to the pitch last season, she said her decision to retire came from wanting to choose her moment, not have it chosen for her.

""I thought I would wait until I didn't want to play anymore,"" she explained. ""But I realized that time's never going to come and I can play, and my body can keep going. And I think it was really important for me to make this decision for myself before that became a different reality.""

Press will play her final Angel City home game this Sunday, fittingly, not far from where her journey first began.

Soccer, Press added, has always been a family affair.

Her father, a former college football player, was the first to spark her love for the game.

""He had three girls, and so this is how he connected to us,"" she shared. ""And I think because of that, it became so important to my mom to have that connection between my dad and I.""

But it was her mother, Stacy, who became her source of strength during the most difficult moments of her career.

In 2018, as her mother battled brain cancer, Press didn't want to leave her side until her mom insisted she rejoin the national team. That same week, she scored a game-winning goal against Spain.

""My dad was upstairs watching the game on his iPad, and he ran downstairs to my mom to show her the goal,"" she recalled. ""And my dad told me that my mom took his hand and she smiled and she actually passed away that night. And I think in some ways it gave her a little peace.""

Press's next chapter will be one of partnership -- both in life and in passion.

Earlier this year, she and former teammate and longtime partner Tobin Heath revealed that they are married, after quietly tying the knot years earlier.

""There was a time where a lot was off limits and Tobin and I's approach was wanting to keep our relationship sacred and out of the public eye,"" she said. ""We actually have been married long before this year. And you know, my manager, my family [were] just as surprised as you were, but everyone knew that I was in [a] committed relationship.""

Together, the couple co-founded a media company and co-host The RE-CAP Show podcast, where they talk candidly about life, love, and the game that brought them together.

""It's authentic, because it is just the same conversations we often are having here at the house,"" she said.

Heath retired from soccer earlier this year, and Press admitted that her wife's decision influenced her own.

""She would absolutely hate me saying this, but a lot,"" she said. ""I think it is time for my family to move on to our next chapter, we're going to be a part of this game forever, but it's time for it to look different for us.""

As she is about to step off the field for the last time, Press said she feels grateful for her career, her family, and the city that raised her.

""I get to leave this game with a family, a dog, a wife, a house in the city that I grew up in that I love, and that feels like a really soft landing,"" she said.

Where do you even begin when talking about a legendary career like the one Angel City FC and USWNT superstar forward Christen Press has had? Today was the day plenty of women's soccer fans likely saw coming, but were absolutely looking to avoid. Even now, if you listen hard enough, you can probably hear a swelling of ‘la-la-la-la-la-‘ with hands over ears, hoping that if they don't hear the words, then it can't make it true. Unfortunately for the game, it is true, as Christen Press has announced her retirement from soccer, with these final two games in the NWSL 2025 season, being her last.

Thank you, Christen 🖤

“It's hard to find the words to say goodbye to a sport that has defined my life for over three decades. Football has given me everything, and I will miss being on the pitch so very much. Thank you to my family, friends, teammates, coaches, and community for this beautiful ride. I promise we will continue to reimagine sports in this next life!!” shared Christen Press as she reflected on her retirement.

In a statement, Angel City FC CEO and Co-Founder Julie Uhrman said “Christen retires as one of the most decorated and respected forwards in U.S. soccer history, a pioneer whose legacy is woven into the very fabric of our club. As Angel City's first signing, Christen's contributions to the club have been unparalleled. From her extraordinary skill and relentless competitiveness on the pitch to her unwavering commitment to making the game and our community more equitable, inclusive, and impactful. On behalf of everyone at Angel City, we thank Christen for everything she has given to the sport, our club, and future generations of athletes and fans.”

Christen Press wraps up her career as not only one of the best players this sport has ever seen, but as one of the most influential off the pitch that this sport has had the honor of knowing. She finishes as one of the leading scorers in USWNT history, netting 64 goals in her 155 International caps. She played a critical role in helping the National Team win back-to-back World Cup titles (2015 and 2019) as well as helping secure Olympic Bronze in the 2021 Olympic Games.

Then there's the domestic list of achievements. Press is a Hermann Trophy winner from her time at Stanford University, where she set multiple scoring records. She has played in four different leagues, WPS, NWSL, FA WSL, and Sweden's Damallsvenskan. She won the Golden Boot in Sweden as a member of Tyresö FF, scoring 25 goals in 26 appearances that season. In the WSL she featured in 14 matches for Manchester United where she scored four goals, but most will know her for her time in the NWSL, where she has played for Chicago Stars, Utah Royals, and most recently her hometown team Angel City FC, where she became the club's first signing back in 2022, acting as an ambassador for the club's mission of equity and inclusion. She has scored 49 regular-season goals across her 122 NWSL appearances.

Beyond her on-field achievements, Press has been a driving force in athlete advocacy and the evolution of women's sports. Through her company RE—INC, she has championed athlete ownership, creative expression, and social progress, continuing to shape the landscape of sport long after the final whistle. Which is what makes this announcement such a bittersweet moment. For so many women's soccer fans, she was the entry point. A creative, technically precise, high work-rate forward who made the game look easy at times. Exuding confident and kindness, Press has been the type of player even the most casual of ball knowers have heard about. Her impact on this sport will last for generations, and she retires as one of the most decorated and respected USWNT players. With just one last home match remaining in the 2025 NWSL season, expect the Los Angeles soccer legend to make it a day to remember, with what will likely be a packed BMO full of fans, family, friends, admirers and those who gained inspiration from Press all showing up to say their goodbyes, and thank her for the honor of being able to watch her approach this game not just with immense talent and ability, but with incredible dignity and strength.

Former USWNT star Christen Press announces on ""Good Morning America"" that she will retire from professional soccer at the end of the NWSL season. (1:24)

Two-time World Cup champion Christen Press announced on Wednesday that she will retire from professional soccer at the end of the 2025 NWSL season, ending a 14-year professional career.

Press will be honored by Angel City FC, her current club, on Sunday at BMO Field in Los Angeles (5 p.m. ET, ESPN). The forward helped the United States win the 2015 and 2019 World Cups and scored 10 minutes into its semifinal victory over England in 2019.

Press retires with 64 international goals -- ninth most in USWNT history. She last played for the U.S. in 2021, helping the team earn a bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics. She was also an alternate for the 2012 Olympic gold-medal winning team.

""I'm retiring from professional soccer, and I've decided that this is my last season and my last few games,"" Press told ABC's ""Good Morning America."" ""I feel a mix of everything. There's yes, there's relief, there's joy, there's excitement, there's fear, there's so much grief. I have so much grief, a part of me, a piece of me, I'm losing her.

""I thought I would wait until I didn't want to play anymore. But I realized that time's never going to come and I can play, and my body can keep going. And I think it was really important for me to make this decision for myself before that became a different reality.""

The Los Angeles native, known for her innate goal-scoring abilities, creative play and versatility across the forward position, finishes her decorated career with her hometown club. She was Angel City's first official signing in 2021 ahead of its expansion season the next year.

Press, who turns 37 in December, has had her time this year largely limited to a reserve role. She has one goal in 399 minutes. She fought her way back onto the field in 2024 after missing more than two full years because of a knee injury and subsequent surgeries.

Prior to joining Angel City, she played for the Chicago Red Stars and Utah Royals in the NWSL, in addition to several stints abroad. Press' announcement follows the retirement of her wife and former U.S. teammate Tobin Heath earlier this year.

Press admitted Heath's retirement had an impact on her own decision to step away from the game.

""She would absolutely hate me saying this, but [it influenced me] a lot,"" Press said. ""I think it is time for my family to move on to our next chapter. We're going to be a part of this game forever, but it's time for it to look different for us.""

Press and Heath signed with Manchester United in 2020 around the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under head coach Casey Stoney, United challenged for the Women's Super League title that year and finished fourth.

Press first played abroad in 2012 in Sweden, when there was no professional league in the United States. In 2013, Press joined Tyresö FF in Sweden's Damallsvenskan alongside superstars like Marta. She became the first American to win the Golden Boot in that league in 2013, when she scored 23 goals.

Tyresö made a run to the UEFA Champions League final in 2014, losing 4-3 to VfL Wolfsburg. The club folded shortly after.

At the demands of U.S. Soccer, who paid the contracts of national team players at the time, Press returned to the U.S. to join the Chicago Red Stars in 2014. She thrived in Chicago through the 2017 NWSL season before the Red Stars traded her rights to the Houston Dash ahead of the 2018 season.

Press declined to report to the Dash and opted to briefly play in Sweden for Göteborg FC, where she featured in 2012. Utah eventually acquired the NWSL rights to Press later that year, and she joined the expansion team in June 2018.

She started her professional career in the U.S. in the now-defunct Women's Professional Soccer (WPS), where she was named Rookie of the Year in 2011 for the magicJack team.

Press had joined that team as the No. 4 draft pick after a standout career at Stanford, where she won the MAC Hermann Trophy in 2010 as college soccer's best player. She is still the career leader for the Cardinal in several categories, including points (183) and goals (71).","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Former USWNT star Christen Press announces on ""Good Morning America"" that she will retire from professional soccer at the end of the NWSL season. (1:24)

Forward Trinity Rodman and midfielder Jaedyn Shaw have each been called up to the United States women's national team for the first time since April.

On Wednesday, USWNT head coach Emma Hayes announced her 26-player roster for a pair of games against Portugal and another against New Zealand, which begin next week.

Rodman missed the last two USWNT training camps and related friendlies due to a recurring back injury.

Her appearance in April, when she scored six minutes into a 2-0 win over Brazil, is her lone international game to date since the 2024 Olympic gold medal.

""I'm super excited to have Trin back with the group -- but a healthy Trin I think is the important thing,"" Hayes told a news conference.

""When she came in in April, she really felt she was in a good place, but the reality was, I think so much adrenaline got her through that game in LA, but afterward that reality hit home that there were some issues in her back that were unresolved.

""Collectively, with club and country, we took the time to say, 'Look, we've got to get it right for long-term.' And I think that club and country collaboration has really put her in the position she is in right now.

""She's one of the best players in the world, and we've had to play without her for more than a year.""

Shaw fell out of form after her trade to the North Carolina Courage in January, and she spent the past two international windows with the USWNT under-23 team.

Shaw was traded again in the summer transfer window to NJ/NY Gotham FC, where she has been thriving.

Hayes had previously said that her roster for October would include the players she believes are most ready to lead the team to the 2027 World Cup.

Hayes spent the last year experimenting with new players. 24 players have debuted since Hayes took over in May 2024.

""This is really the build towards qualification for next year,"" Hayes said. ""That's what the start of this cycle actually means. And that's not to say that this is the pool of players, solely. It was difficult to make roster selections for this camp.""

The USWNT last played over three months ago, in a 3-0 victory over Canada.

Even with the continuity on the roster, there is another first-time call-up: San Diego Wave defender Kennedy Wesley.

The 24-year-old has played for the U.S. at several youth levels, including earlier this year with the U-23 team.

Five European-based players are back on the roster after Hayes gave them time off to rest in the summer: captain Lindsey Heaps, forward Catarina Macario, midfielder Lily Yohannes, defender Emily Fox and goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce.

Forward Alyssa Thompson is also back with the USWNT after a September transfer from Angel City FC to Chelsea.

Midfielder Korbin Shrader (nee Albert), who is teammates with Heaps and Yohannes at OL Lyonnes and was part of the 2024 Olympic gold medal team, was not called up to the senior team for the third consecutive international window.

The U.S. will play Portugal on Oct. 23 in Chester, Pennsylvania, and again on Oct. 26 in East Hartford, Connecticut.

The Americans wrap up the international window against New Zealand on Oct. 29 in Kansas City, Mo.

USWNT vice-captain and Chelsea defender Naomi Girma is still absent from the squad as she returns to fitness from a calf injury that has limited her playing time this year.

""The most important thing for her today is she needs to be back playing for Chelsea on a regular basis,"" Hayes added of Girma. ""We've made that clear to her that she's got to get that right.""

Forward Lynn Biyendolo is also absent due to a knee injury.

Also missing from the USWNT's previous roster are goalkeeper Angelina Anderson; defenders Kerry Abello, Izzy Rodriguez and Gisele Thompson; and midfielder Croix Bethune.

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. (Oct. 14, 2025) – The United States closed out the October window on a high note with a come-from-behind 2-1 win over 25th-ranked Australia in front of 18,218 at DICK'S Sporting Goods Park behind a brace from striker Haji Wright and two assists from midfielder Cristian Roldan.

The United States has now gone unbeaten in three straight matches against World Cup-qualified opponents after rallying to draw Ecuador 1-1 earlier in this window in Austin, Texas and a 2-0 win over Japan on Sept. 9 in Columbus, Ohio. With the win, the U.S. ended a 12-match unbeaten run for Australia dating back to March 21, 2024.

Christian Pulisic captained the side tonight as one of six changes to head coach Mauricio Pochettino's starting lineup from Oct. 10 against Ecuador – Roldan and James Sands, who started as a central midfield duo for the first time, defenders Alex Freeman and Mark McKenzie, and Wright, who's been on a tear with his club Coventry City.

Goalkeeper Matt Freese, center backs Chris Richards and Miles Robinson, forward Tim Weah and midfielder Weston McKenzie earned the start for the second straight match in the window. 

The USMNT controlled the possession early. The center back trio of McKenzie, Richards and Robinson worked the ball from side to side, looking for openings that would allow the United States to break down Australia's condensed middle block. 

Australia absorbed pressure from the United States then capitalized on a single moment to open the scoring in the 19th minute. Following an Australian throw-in, forward Jordan Box handled a loose ball and brought it to his feet inside the box. The forward delivered a left-footed strike on a bounce to give the Socceroos the early 1-0 lead.

For the second straight match, the United States found itself trailing by a first-half goal. The Americans did not hang their heads, and the determined response resulted in the first shot of the night for the United States. Initiated by a quick turn on the ball from Wright, the ball traveled out wide to Weah. The winger drove a right-footed shot on target that required a diving save from Australian goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.

In the 31st minute, Diego Luna replaced Pulisic.

The tantalizing shot from Weah was a harbinger of what was to come for the United States, and in the 33rd minute, the Americans equalized. In the middle of the pitch, McKennie advanced the ball to Roldan. The veteran midfielder slipped a through ball to Wright making a run inside the box. The striker, bringing his terrific club form to tonight's match, hammered home his sixth international goal with a first-time touch with the outside of his right foot.

Roldan, who had the assist on Wright's equalizer, was making things happen all over the pitch, and the Seattle Sounders midfielder nearly got a goal of his own on two occasions in the first half. First, a golden opportunity in the 36th minute when Roldan curled a dangerous shot just inches wide of the frame. Later, after a series of stepover moves from Weah led to a U.S. corner kick, Roldan took another crack at goal that drifted high.

Australia began the second half on the front foot, which led to back-to-back attempts from midfielders Connor Metcalfe and Aiden O'Neill. Then, the United States turned the table and found the go-ahead goal following a dead ball. After a foul was called on Australia near the sideline, Roldan quickly played a long, driven pass forward into the path of Wright. The striker cut the ball smoothly with his right foot to put the ball on his left, then curled a lovely finish to push the United States ahead and secure his brace on the night.

In a triple substitution in the 64th minute, Pochettino sent on striker Folarin Balogun, midfielder Brenden Aaronson, and midfielder Tanner Tessmann to replace Wright, Weah and Sands. Minutes later, Aidan Morris and Max Arfsten subbed on for Roldan and McKennie.

Up a goal, the United States tightened up the defense to shut down an Australia side chasing with some attack-minded reinforcements off the bench like Mo Toure and Nestory Irankunda. In the 88th minute, Freese made a huge stop after Irankunda drove down Australia's attacking third and put a close-range shot on goal.

Still, the U.S. didn't stop attacking, and in the 90th minute, the United States nearly found goal No. 3. Aaronson played a pass in tight quarters inside the box to Luna charging ahead. From close range, Luna took a shot, which Ryan blocked. Moments later, the two U.S. attackers synced up again to give Luna another look on a goal, but his low, driven shot swerved wide.

Tuesday's win closed the October window for the U.S. Men's National Team. Up next, the program will face two South American opponents in November as the competition heats up ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil. The USA will first host Paraguay on Nov. 15 at Subaru Park in Chester, Pennsylvania. Three days later, the team plays Uruguay on Nov. 18 in Tampa, Florida.

AUS – Jordan Bos, 19th minute: An Australian throw-in caught a deflection, and the ball spun high and toward Australia's goal. Jordan Bos collected the loose ball, made a cut, then converted a left-footed strike toward the far post. USA 0, AUS 1

USA – Haji Wright (Cristian Roldan), 33rd minute: Operating in the middle of the pitch, Weston McKennie sent the ball ahead to Cristian Roldan. The midfielder poked a through ball to Haji Wright, and the striker finished with the outside of his right foot to level the match. USA 1, AUS 1

USA – Haji Wright (Cristian Roldan), 51st minute: Alert following a foul around midfield, Roldan played the ball quickly. The midfielder's pass carried into the path of Wright in a 1v1 situation.

Midfielder has two assists in 2-1 win over Australia.

Given a massive opportunity to strengthen his World Cup spot, Cristian Roldan delivered arguably his best-ever performance for the United States men's national team. Roldan started as one of the double-pivots in Maurcio Pochettino's 3-4-3 and registered two assists to help lead the USMNT to a 2-1 win over Australia on Tuesday.

The performance drew rave reviews from Pochettino.

“He's what we need,” the USMNT head coach said. “We need players with confidence, with some belief, with a little bit of competitiveness. 

“Cristian is an example of how if you want to build your perfect player, he has a little bit of everything. Off and on the field, that's what we find.”

The match did not start out quite so well for Roldan, though, after he struggled to clear a ball into the box that allowed Australia to jump out to a 1-0 lead in the 19th minute.

But Roldan didn't let that get him down and just 15 minutes later he slipped in Haji Wright with pass that cut out several defenders. Wright did the rest with a first-time finish.

RIGHT FOOT. WRIGHT FINISH!

Early in the second half, Roldan showed off the trademark combination of smarts and skill that have made him so good with the Seattle Sounders. After a foul in the USMNT's end, Roldan noticed Wright making another run. He immediately played a ball into the channel where Wright controlled, made a move to open some space and then hit a perfect curling shot.

Haji is Wright twice tonight. We've got the lead!

#USMNT x VW

Roldan was eventually pulled in the 76th minute with a stat line that looked like this: 4/4 on duels, five recoveries, two interceptions and 47/52 passing. 

“I'm riding the wave. I've had such a great second half of the year. It's been great to enjoy the moment. I'm continuing in that way and not being satisfied. I know I can reach another level.”

There's obviously a lot of time between now and next summer's World Cup. But considering it was just about a month ago when Roldan had not been called into the USMNT in two years, he's now remarkably close to making that dream a reality.

“I'm not saying he's going to be in the next roster or World Cup,” Pochettino said. “But with what we've seen so far, he's a player we wanted to give an opportunity, and look what's going on.”","{'href': 'https://www.sounderatheart.com', 'title': 'Sounder at Heart'}","soccer"

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. – If there's ever been evidence that the U.S. Men's National Team is growing under head coach Mauricio Pochettino, it might be best encapsulated by the team's last three matches. 

The team is riding a three-match unbeaten streak, dating back to September. The trio of games began when the U.S. put together a resounding 2-0 win over Japan on Sept. 9 led by a technically superb volley from Alex Zendejas and a skillful second-half finish from Folarin Balogun. 

The second was the first match of the October window. When facing a surging Ecuador side that had only given up one goal in its 10 previous matches, the U.S. didn't flinch. The Americans rallied after conceding an early goal and equalized against a very strong defensive side to draw the match in Austin, Texas. 

Finally, the third was the team's latest performance against Australia on Tuesday night. Haji Wright and Cristian Roldan linked up twice to steer a massive come-from-behind win in Commerce City, Colorado and record the first comeback win in Pochettino's tenure with the USA. 

“Any time you can win against these kinds of opponents, it's a big confidence boost,” said James Sands, who started alongside Roldan in the central midfield Tuesday night. 

In all three matches, the United States showed flashes of goal-scoring and a fighting mentality. Twice, the Americans trailed – twice they fought back. And in each match, Pochettino found positives to take away. 

One of those major takeaways was the quality of the competition. 

All three opponents the United States has faced during this unbeaten run are teams that have already secured qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. These nations are among the top in their confederations. Ecuador finished second in CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifying, just after 2022 champion Argentina. Japan was the first team outside of the host nations to qualify for the 2026 tournament. Australia is a top-ranked squad in the AFC. 

Two of these teams, Ecuador and Australia, were riding double-digit unbeaten streaks heading into their matchups with the U.S. 

Given these strong resumes, the U.S. has approached these matches seriously. While the matchups are labeled as international friendlies, the U.S. has adopted a competitive mindset with only so many windows together before next summer's tournament — a message that has come from Pochettino and his coaching staff. 

“It's important to size ourselves up against these nations because we understand that we're going to be competing against these guys at the World Cup,” Roldan said. “It's really important these last two windows, and hopefully our next window, we can show a little progress and confidence after some of these good performances.” 

Pochettino has been reiterating the importance of progress this year in the lead-up to the World Cup. He's still learning things about his team – following both matches in the October window, the manager was positive but expressed that there are details the team needs to iron out. He's still putting different combinations of players on the pitch. For example, against Australia he made six changes to the starting lineup from the Ecuador match. Pochettino is also observing players in different situations and seeing which connections are fruitful – like Wright and Roldan on Tuesday night. 

“It does wonders,” Wright said of the confidence this win gives them. “We're playing against quality opposition now, so we're gearing up for the final test before the World Cup starts, and we're happy with a win today.” 

The U.S. has been progressing in this build-up which is starting to dwindle as the World Cup draws nearer. Even going back to earlier this summer with the USMNT's Concacaf Gold Cup run, which featured 14 players on this October roster, progress was made. Under Pochettino, the team gave up just one goal in the group stage and advanced all the way to the final. Players emerged in that tournament like Matt Freese, who made his debut this summer and has gone on to become a valued piece in the goalkeeping room. The 24-year-old goalkeeper has started 10 straight matches for the USMNT, including Tuesday's win. 

“It's important to start building confidence, but it's also very important to continue to improve and trust in the process,” Freese said. “As each result comes, we want to be putting together results, but we also want to be putting together performances. Over the long run, that leads to more successes. As we lead into the World Cup next summer, these friendlies are not so friendly. It becomes about getting a result and showing that next summer when the whistle blows, we're there to get a win.” 

The October window closed on a high note for the group, and November is just around the corner. The United States will have a chance to extend its current unbeaten run against two more World Cup-bound nations: Paraguay and Uruguay. 

The goal for that window, as center back Chris Richards put it, is to ""keep stacking them up."" 

“It gives us confidence knowing that we are not even close to being 100 percent,” Richards said. “That's probably the biggest takeaway from these two games we've had is that we still have so much more to grow and so much more potential – it's kind of untapped right now. It's a process. It's a journey. I know by the World Cup next summer, we'll be ready for it.”","{'href': 'https://www.ussoccer.com', 'title': 'US Soccer'}","soccer"

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Folarin Balogun is living up to the hype as a long-awaited top striker for the USMNT","https://www.inquirer.com/soccer/folarin-balogun-usmnt-world-cup-mauricio-pochettino-20251016.html","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 16:07:17 GMT","

Along with Haji Wright, who scored both goals Tuesday against Australia, Balogun has given the U.S. soccer team a desperately needed scoring threat.

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — It's one of those things that befuddles soccer's devotees as much as its critics.

The net is big and the field is vast. So why do people in the sport often say that scoring a goal is the hardest thing to do?

It surely can't be that difficult to run forward, have a teammate pass you the ball, and shoot it in.

During the last men's World Cup in 2022, U.S. fans had to spend the Monday after Thanksgiving explaining to their office colleagues why a 0-0 tie — a most un-American result — against England was one of the best games the team has ever played.

The retort was obvious: If it was that good, why didn't they score?

Three years is a long time to wait for answers. But as next year's tournament draws closer, the new American squad may have finally found them.

Haji Wright is one. He carried his strong club form with Coventry City of England's second division into Tuesday's 2-1 win over Australia, scoring both U.S. goals with style.

Ricardo Pepi is another, though he hasn't shown it for a bit. He's just back from a long injury absence that has kept him from the national team since last November. Hopefully he'll return for next month's games, including a matchup vs. Paraguay at Subaru Park.

But the biggest answer is Folarin Balogun. Two-and-a-half years since he joined the senior U.S. national team, he has officially seized the mantle for his country.

The 24-year-old Brooklyn native has scored goals in two of the Americans' four games so far this autumn, taking his career total to seven tallies in 21 national team appearances. Both numbers would likely be bigger if not for shoulder and ankle injuries over the last 12 months.

“It was a fantastic and unique journey for me to begin playing with the men's national team,” Balogun said, a journey that included being recruited to the U.S. program with all the flash of a college football team chasing a quarterback. 

» READ MORE: The USMNT seems on course to do something it hasn't done in nearly a quarter century

He delivered an early payoff with a goal in the 2023 Concacaf Nations League final, and scored twice in last year's Copa América group stage — one of the only U.S. players who wasn't a flop in the tournament.

But then came those injuries, halting his momentum and the national team's. We'll never know how much better things could have gone at this year's Nations League final four had Balogun been there.

“Last year was frustrating, being out for so long with a shoulder injury, but all I can do is just focus on the present and focus on what I can control,” Balogun said. “I've had the game[s], obviously, in the last camp [in September], and that was just important for me to be around the team again and just to reintegrate. And for me it's about building momentum, consistently being a part of the team, and being available — the most important thing for any athlete is to be available.” 

When he said that, no one thought to ask if he knew that phrase was popularized by another former New Yorker years ago. But then again, Balogun was six months from being born when Bill Parcells departed the Jets in January 2001. (Of the current U.S. squad's 26 players, only 38-year-old Tim Ream was alive when Parcells left the Giants in 1990.)

“I want to prove that to myself, prove that to the coaching staff,” Balogun said of hoping to stay healthy. “And yeah, I think once I'm on the pitch, and the longer I'm on the pitch, building confidence, good things are going to happen. It's a process, but I'm definitely happy with how it's going.”

So is manager Mauricio Pochettino.

“Well, what I like the most is that he is scoring,” he said earlier this week, a line that even soccer critics might like. “When they score is what I like the most in a striker. And then I think, his work ethic: available to drop and to play and to connect.”

» READ MORE: Folarin Balogun's goal earns the USMNT a creditable 1-1 tie with Ecuador

As Pochettino spoke, he was interrupted by a banging noise from a nearby wall. Alas, it did not come from a chorus of those critics wishing to thank him. It was just the wind outside, flying down from the Rockies and slamming into a closed door.

“I think [there are] many things about the game, not only to score — that is what I like the most — but also it's the capacity to link with the team,” Pochettino concluded. “He's a player who can drop and play, as you see with our offensive players and midfielders, and going to the [open] space, running. [He] has a little bit of everything that I like.”

Just as significant as Balogun's form and skills are the players around him. Pochettino's 3-4-2-1 formation allows for the striker to get service in multiple ways, from the wingbacks out wide and the attacking midfielders more centrally. The ball might come through the air or on the ground, via a cross or via a threaded ball up the middle — the kind Balogun fizzed home against Japan.

“He's taken his opportunities, and that's all you can ask for [from] a No. 9,” said fellow New Yorker Tim Weah, referring to a striker's traditional jersey number. And he would know, as a former forward who now plays as one of those wingbacks for the U.S. and Italian club Juventus.

» READ MORE: The USMNT is finally back on track, and Mauricio Pochettino has done what he said he'd do

“We all know he's an amazing player and he can help us save a game,” Weah continued. “He's sticking his foot out in actions, he's running behind, fighting the defenders. … Hopefully we can feed him some more and get him some more goals.”

Nor is it a coincidence that the assist for Balogun's goal vs. Japan came from Christian Pulisic, and the one for his goal vs. Ecuador on Friday came from Malik Tillman. Their dynamism and creativity sets up Balogun to be at his best, and that's a big part of why they're now atop the attacking midfield depth chart. 

Weston McKennie can add another element, as can Alejandro Zendejas, Brenden Aaronson, or Gio Reyna if he can regain a place on the squad.

“He's always going off the back shoulder — he's really difficult to deal with, because he's always dribbling, going at players and also going in behind,” the Medford-born Aaronson said. “He's got two different [ways] that he can play: He can hold up the game, and he can also go in behind and create chances by himself. He's a really good player, and he's really good for this squad.”

» READ MORE: After missing last month's USMNT gmaes, Brenden Aaronson hoped to make an impression this time

Balogun appreciates how he fits in with his teammates, and with Pochettino's system.

“I feel like the manager gives us that freedom to just do what we want up there, and I think that shows in the way we play,” he said. “Everything's kind of just freestyle. But we're good enough players to figure it out, and he believes in us.”

As Balogun has grown into the U.S. team on the field, he has grown into the country off it, too. Though he was born in Brooklyn, he moved to London with his Nigerian parents after just a month. He has spent his entire professional career in Europe, only able to visit the United States for national team games and too-rare vacations.

So he makes the most of those moments when he can.

“I love being back here — especially in New York, my favorite city,” he said. “I definitely feel like I get my trips in. I would like more, and after my career I think it's somewhere I would like to live. Being in Europe, balancing that with international football, I'm not going to get as much time as I want, but I definitely feel like I do get enough time there.”

U.S. fans in Philadelphia might have to forgive Balogun next month for his choice of city. But they know as well as his team that right now, he's on the way to the greatest trip home of all.

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — It has certainly been a journey to this point, but coming out of Tuesday night's 2-1 win over Australia, it is beginning to feel like we have an idea of the players U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino trusts.

That's not to say that this roster is set in stone. Not even close. That would be antithetical to everything Pochettino and his staff have tried to build into the ethos of this group. He wants no one to feel as if anything is guaranteed. But if we look at the last two international windows, certain players have started to work themselves into a better position to be a part of the 2026 World Cup team.

And it's not just the stars that we have long expected to be there.

Yes, some of the regulars of the 2022 cycle are still a big part of this pool's best 26 players: Christian Pulisic, Tim Weah, Antonee Robinson, Sergiño Dest, Tim Ream and Chris Richards are unsurprisingly featured players when available. And while Weston McKennie hadn't been in camp since March, the Juventus midfielder clearly showed his quality in this window and brings important elements to the U.S. team.

But Pochettino's top-to-bottom search of the pool has also led to some new — and not so new — names emerging into the picture.

Cristian Roldan, a glue guy on the 2022 World Cup squad, had two assists on Tuesday and Pochettino levied the ultimate compliment to the Seattle Sounders midfielder: “If you want to build your perfect player, he has a little bit of everything,” he said.

Matt Freese got his first cap from Pochettino on June 7. Now he looks to have a path to being the No. 1 next summer, if he can hold off veteran Matt Turner and a swell of goalkeepers trying to break in.

Malik Tillman, one of the final cuts from the 2022 World Cup squad, has evolved into a potential starter next summer.

Max Arfsten, the Columbus Crew wingback, and Alex Freeman, the 21-year-old Orlando City right back, have become regulars (and saw their value increase as the system moved to use wingbacks more regularly), as has Real Salt Lake midfielder Diego Luna.

Lyon midfielder Tanner Tessmann, who last played in March, was back in camp and made a positive impression to force his way into the conversation, too.

This team is by no means a finished product. There was plenty to improve on from the win over Australia. The team lacked energy for the first 30 minutes and gave up a sloppy goal – the second time conceding first and within the opening 25 minutes in a matter of days. But this October window did start to feel like forward momentum toward the World Cup.

Not many would have predicted that after a comprehensive defeat to South Korea last month. But a positive result against a heavily-rotated Japan squad started to give some confidence. The performance against Ecuador last Friday — albeit in a draw — added to it. And Tuesday's win gives the U.S. a chance to lean further into that feeling.

“People say (friendlies) don't mean anything,” U.S. center back Chris Richards said. “But for us, it means everything. Going into a World Cup, we want to win as many games as possible.”

We still have not seen Pochettino's nominal best XI on the field at the same time. Some of that is due to the reality of a national team. You're rarely going to have all of your best players available at the same time.

It's why Pochettino, with no games of consequence on the docket and no World Cup qualification at stake, has insisted that it's more important to see as many players as he can, and to assess chemistry up and down the pool rather than prioritizing on-field chemistry. He conceded that relationships on the field are “really important,” but also insisted that “we still have time to decide” and to build that chemistry.

“We still (have a) long time to the World Cup,” Pochettino said, though there are just four first-choice friendlies left until pre-World Cup camp next June. “And I think we can assess (the group), and it's open. It's open for every single USA player that is playing here or outside of this country. … The thing that is important (is) they need to feel the confidence and trust (from) us. And when they come, it is because we are going to provide the possibility to play and show (their) quality.

“When you need to decide the 26 players next summer, (you want) to be sure that you know which type of profile, of characteristics you need. Because not only do you need good players, but also you need good teammates, good people, people that can put the interest of our national team (higher) than their own interests.”

November will bring two more good tests. World Cup-bound Paraguay and Uruguay both finished CONMEBOL qualifying with 28 points — Uruguay placed fourth, Paraguay sixth. Those games carry a ton of weight now, not just to carry forward the momentum, but to allow for positivity and optimism to be the narrative around the team ahead of a four-month break before friendlies in March.

After a year of trying to decipher where exactly this group was going, and who exactly would be on the team, it would be a welcome opportunity to lean into even a fraction of the excitement that once existed around the potential of this program.

Or, as Pochettino said, to believe that “the seed” his staff planted is starting to blossom.

“Sometimes [it] is difficult to explain how that magic happens,” Pochettino said of a team starting to come together and believe — to have the capacity to come from behind against an Australia team that was unbeaten in its previous 12 games. “But this is about to work every day, every time that we work together, is to put the seed and start to be very consistent in our decision, in the way that we communicate and in how the message arrives to the team, to the staff, to everyone.

“And I think when that starts to grow inside the team, that is why this type of thing starts to happen. And for sure, more positive things will happen.”

As continental qualification for the FIFA World Cup 2026 nears its end, the focus is shifting to the tournament itself.

By Kevin Hand

The picture for the FIFA World Cup 2026 became a lot clearer on Tuesday when a number of top teams across the continents booked their place at football's global showpiece.

The number of confirmed teams has now risen to 28 following the latest round of qualifiers, with another 20 still to be filled by various confederational playoffs, intercontinental playoffs, and – in Europe's case – the main qualifying stage, which still needs to be completed.

England, South Africa and Qatar were among the headline names to book their place at the tournament on Tuesday.

Al Jazeera Sport takes a look at the tournament that the nations around the world are all vying to reach.

The tournament is being staged across the United States, Canada and Mexico. The first match will be played in Mexico City on June 11, while the final will be staged in New Jersey, US, on July 19.

Due to the expansion of the tournament – from 32 teams to 48 – the 39-day event is the longest in its history.

FIFA's intercontinental playoffs will be the last chance saloon for teams around the world to reach next summer's event. The finale of that route will be on March 31, 2026, less than three months before the World Cup kicks off. The European qualification process runs until March, but most of the remaining confederations will have finished their continental qualification processes long before then.

Once the respective confederations finish their qualification process, FIFA offers two final spots to be contested by the best-placed team from each of the six continental routes that have not already qualified.

Although we will not know the full list of teams for the event until the end of March 2026, the draw will take place on December 5, 2025.

The draw will take place in the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. US President Donald Trump confirmed the location while speaking in the Oval Office at the White House, flanked by Vice President JD Vance and FIFA boss Gianni Infantino. He did not rule out overseeing the draw itself.

With the expansion to 48 teams, the World Cup will now feature 12 four-team groups. That in turn will lead to a round of 32, an extra knockout round to previous editions.

Indeed, the tournament has doubled in size since it was staged in the US in 1994, when only 24 teams competed.

Trump has been quite clear and consistent on the staging of games within the US, saying he will move the games from any cities that he deems to be unsafe.

On September 26, when Trump was asked about games being moved, he warned: “Well, that's an interesting question … but we're going to make sure they're safe. [Seattle and San Francisco are] run by radical left lunatics who don't know what they're doing.”

The US will stage games in 11 cities: Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New Jersey/New York (joint host region), Philadelphia, San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle.

Canada will host 13 games in total, split between Toronto and Vancouver. Mexico will also get 13 games, which will be played in Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey.

The US will stage the final, which will be played at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

Argentina won the last edition of the FIFA World Cup, beating France in the final of Qatar 2022.

With the game level at 3-3 after extra time, Argentina won the penalty shootout 4-2.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup was staged in the US, and the heat and resulting thunderstorms proved to be a huge problem for the tournament.

Three stadiums – in Arlington, Atlanta and Houston – have retractable roofs that are expected to be closed due to the summer heat, while Inglewood and Vancouver have fixed roofs.

After the latest round of qualifying matches, here is a breakdown of the confirmed contenders from each of the six regions:

Hosts: Canada, Mexico, USA

Asia: Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Uzbekistan

Africa: Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia

Europe: England

Oceania: New Zealand

South America: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay

Africa: Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon and Nigeria will play off for the final intercontinental spot from the continent. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has announced November 13 for the first matches, followed by a deciding match three days later.

Asia: UAE and Iraq will vie for one intercontinental playoffs spot when they compete over two legs in the final stage of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) qualifiers on November 13 and 18.

Europe: 53 of the 54 European teams vying for 16 qualification spots can still confirm their berths, alongside England, as their first-round matches will run until November 18. European qualification will run until March, just before the intercontinental playoffs begin.

North, Central America and the Caribbean: Three spots remain up for grabs, given the World Cup hosts take up three spots already. Bermuda, Costa Rica, Curacao, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Haiti, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago have all advanced to the third round, with the winners to be decided by November 18. The three second-placed teams from each group will then fight for the intercontinental playoffs spot.

Oceania: New Caledonia have qualified for the intercontinental playoffs.

South America: Bolivia have qualified for the intercontinental playoffs, having missed out on one of the six automatic qualifying positions.

President Trump is again claiming he would move World Cup games from cities he deems unsafe. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds / Getty Images

President Trump has once again suggested relocating World Cup matches from cities that he deems unsafe — this time, threatening to move games from Boston, one of 11 U.S. cities hosting the FIFA games next year.

Speaking from the Oval Office during his meeting with Argentina's president on Tuesday, Trump's remarks came in response to a reporter who asked him about Boston mayor Michelle Wu and the potential of relocating World Cup games from the city.

“We can take them away,” Trump said. “I love the people of Boston. I know the games are sold out, but your mayor is not good.” Referring to Wu, he added, “She's intelligent … but she's radical left.”

Trump then said, “They're taking over parts of Boston,” without further explanation. He continued, “We could get them back in about two seconds. All she has to do is call us.”

It's unclear who or what the president was referring to. The reporter, in their line of questioning, referred to “street takeovers” before asking about Boston.

Protestors last week clashed with police during pro-Palestinian demonstrations that turned violent near Boston Common, leading to multiple arrests. Boston prosecutors have since charged 13 protestors with felonies, suggesting the city is willing to come down hard on civil unrest as federal interventions in other Democrat-led cities continue.

“Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions,” Wu said in a statement.

Gillette Stadium, home of the NFL's New England Patriots, will host seven World Cup matches next year. The stadium sits about 30 miles outside of Boston.

This is the second time Trump suggested he would relocate World Cup games next year from cities he deems unsafe. However, as The Athletic reported last month, the U.S. government had no official role in choosing World Cup host cities and does not have any explicit authority to relocate games.

Regardless, Trump on Tuesday doubled down on his perceived influence over the games, leaning into his close relationship with FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino.

“If I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni — the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal — and I would say, ‘let's move it to another location,' and he would do that.” Trump said. “He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.”

FIFA, soccer's governing body, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Athletic about Trump's latest remarks.

The pair's friendship is well-documented. Infantino was recently Trump's guest at the Summit for Peace in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, and, last week, Infantino said “Trump definitely deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for his decisive actions” in the Middle East.

In Trump's comments about Boston, the president also suggested once again the possibility of relocating the Olympic Games from Los Angeles in 2028. Both Boston and Los Angeles are run by Democratic mayors, Wu in Boston and Karen Bass in L.A. When referring to the Olympics, Trump shared his disdain for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, also a Democrat and an outspoken critic of Trump, saying Newsom “has got to get his act together.”

Trump's comments about relocating games from Boston came during his meeting with Argentina's president, Javier Milei, as his administration moves forward with a 20 billion dollar bailout of the South American country, with apparent strings attached.

Trump's response to the reporter's brief question about Wu and World Cup games in Boston lasted less than four minutes, with a chunk of his response referring to Los Angeles' response to the devastating wildfires that ravaged Southern California earlier this year.

Trump quickly reverted back to Boston, before taking one final question in the Oval Office. “Boston better clean up their act,” he said. “That's all I can say.”

You have come to the ESPN Africa edition, for other ESPN editions, click above.

Colin Udoh reveals the role he played in 'helping' Nigeria secure a World Cup play-off place after their 4-0 win over Benin. (1:47)

South Africa's 3-0 win over Rwanda that booked them a place in the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico was not only a strong footballing performance but also a symbol of the resilience that coach Hugo Broos has instilled in the team.

Bafana Bafana faced a self-made crisis heading into the final game, as they trailed Benin by two points at the top of Group C. After relinquishing top spot by having their March win over Lesotho overturned for fielding the ineligible Teboho Mokoena, they dropped two more points in a 0-0 draw with Zimbabwe on Saturday.

However, Benin 's 4-0 defeat by Nigeria left Bafana with a fighting chance: Victory over Rwanda was all they needed to progress. In the past, this is the sort of opportunity that South Africa had become accustomed to squandering.

When Broos watched Bafana Bafana lose a decisive 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier to Sudan five years ago, when they needed only a draw to make the tournament in Cameroon, he saw a team backed by a relative abundance of resources but foiled by a lack of mental fortitude.

That match led to the departure of his predecessor, Molefi Ntseki, and the Belgian's subsequent appointment as head coach. Almost five years later, he has delivered on his mission to overhaul Bafana Bafana's belief in their own abilities -- with his focus on youth paying off.

""I saw the game against Sudan, and Bafana Bafana needed only one point, and when I see the way they played the game there in Sudan... I couldn't understand it,"" Broos told ESPN in 2021 after making early progress in changing the results and culture of the team. ""You go until the end -- until you die -- but you need that point. This was not the mentality I saw.

""So then I started to see who was playing. There were so many players of 27, 28, 29 years old. Afterwards, there was someone who was telling me: 'Yes, coach, but those players are experienced.'

""I said: 'Yes, that's right, but if you do not play the younger players, then when are they going to have experience?'

""So, therefore, I started also with young players who had quality. This is the first thing they need to have, and that's why we have such good results.""

That process has now paid dividends, with a dominant performance led by young players who were cool, calm and collected from the first whistle to the last. Bafana led 2-0 at halftime, courtesy of a long-range Thalente Mbatha strike and a curling finish by Oswin Appollis, before Evidence Makgopa's 72nd-minute header sealed the win that saw South Africa qualify for their fourth World Cup -- and their first since they hosted the tournament in 2010.

Broos, alone, cannot take credit for the development of players such as Mbatha, Appollis and Makgopa -- Orlando Pirates stars in their mid-20s -- but the former Cameroon head coach, who won the 2017 AFCON against all odds, was a driving force for South Africa's nationwide shift in attitudes towards young players. Makgopa, in particular, was a beneficiary, as he scored a brace on his Bafana Bafana debut in Broos' first match in charge -- a 3-2 win over Uganda in June 2021. Then at Baroka FC, Makgopa had not been fancied to lead the line at international level, but Broos took a chance on him and it paid off.

Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns -- the two dominant clubs in South Africa over the past decade -- also deserve their fair share of credit.

Sundowns have invested heavily under the ownership of Confederation of African Football president Patrice Motsepe, who bought a controlling stake in 2003 and then the remaining shares the following year. However, the culture of the club changed specifically during Pitso Mosimane's tenure as head coach from 2012 to 2020.

Off the back of a disappointing spell in charge of Bafana Bafana, a reinvigorated Mosimane led Sundowns to their first CAF Champions League title in 2016 -- only the second by a South African club; Pirates previously won it in 1995.

That triumph -- and Sundowns' dominance of the South African Premiership under Mosimane and successors Manqoba Mngqithi, Rhulani Mokwena and Miguel Cardoso -- forced their rivals to level up and take continental competitions more seriously.

None could quite match the financial might of Sundowns, but Pirates improved their talent development and recruitment structures -- and their streamlined squad has closed the gap on a Sundowns side now struggling with fatigue and player discontent after the FIFA Club World Cup, a tournament that saw them impress on the global stage but face struggles keeping their players away from prying eyes elsewhere in the world.

Broos has often encouraged Bafana Bafana players to move overseas, but facing an injury crisis heading into a decisive qualifier, he started with an entirely locally-based XI. South Africa started five Sundowns players -- Ronwen Williams, Khuliso Mudau, Aubrey Modiba, Mokoena and Thapelo Morena -- five Pirates players -- Mbatha, Appollis, Makgopa, Nkosinathi Sibisi and Sipho Mbule -- and one from TS Galaxy, Khulumani Ndamane.

That, alone, speaks volumes of the quality in South Africa's club football.

However, this is nothing new.

What is new -- first and foremost -- is the apparent end of the days when South African players were viewed as too comfortable and pampered to win when the going got tough.

Having finished third at AFCON 2023 in Ivory Coast, Bafana are among the favorites for the tournament in Morocco in December and January. At the World Cup, the goal will be to make the knockout rounds for the first time.

The qualification campaign exposed that the South African Football Association still has a long way to go before it can offer Bafana the support they need to reach their full potential; but if the mentality in the upper echelons of the organization still needs to change, the players and coach are now embodiments of the promise of what South African football is capable of being.","{'href': 'https://africa.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Updated B/R Men's International Football Power Rankings for World Cup 2026","https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25260858-updated-br-mens-international-football-power-rankings-world-cup-2026","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 13:56:56 GMT","

The penultimate international break of 2025 may have robbed us all of club football action, but it at least made the 2026 World Cup picture a little clearer.

England, Egypt, Algeria, Ghana, South Africa, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Cape Verde punched their tickets for the showpiece event in North America in October, with the latter set to make its first appearance at the global football tournament. 

That brings the confirmed party guests up to 28 nations, with another set of fixtures in November expected to yield a few more RSVPs.

While FIFA's official world rankings provide a useful gauge of where each country stands in the international game, it doesn't exactly account for nuance. 

That's where we come in. Read on for the latest power ranking of the top 20 men's international football teams. 

20. Ivory Coast

FIFA ranking: 44

B/R September ranking: New entry

After dropping out of B/R's international power ranking in September, having landed in 20th in March's edition, the Ivory Coast is back.

While fellow World Cup qualifiers from Africa might be higher in FIFA's ranking—Algeria (38th), Egypt (35th), Senegal (18th)—the Elephants are the reigning Africa Cup of Nations champions, which gives them an edge in this context. 

Ivory Coast just pipped Gabon to the top of qualifying Group F courtesy of a 7-0 win over Seychelles and a 3-0 victory against Kenya in October. 

With that, the Elephants return to the World Cup after last appearing in 2014. In North America, they will be hoping to progress from the group stages for the first time in their history. 

19. Ecuador 

FIFA ranking: 24

B/R September ranking: 16

After landing as high as 11th in B/R's world football rankings in March, Ecuador has been gradually slipping away.

That high spot was as a result of incredible form in CONMEBOL qualifying, in which La Tri finished second. 

While Ecuador can be proud of that placement, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was helped by the underperformance of other South American nations.

In fact, while La Tri are undefeated in their last seven games, they have only won one, albeit an impressive 1-0 victory over Argentina. 

Momentum seems to be flagging a bit, and that's reflected in their drop in power ranking.

18. USA

FIFA ranking: 16

B/R September ranking: 18

In 10 games since the start of the Gold Cup on June 15, the United States has lost just two matches.

That might be an overly optimistic way of looking at the team's run of results, but it still reads well, and it includes games played in a tournament setting. 

The Stars and Stripes finished the October break with a draw against Ecuador and a victory against Australia, two teams that will also be playing in next summer's tournament. 

With Ecuador finishing second in CONMEBOL qualification ahead of Brazil, Uruguay, and Colombia, that 1-1 stalemate doesn't look as problematic either.

It's not exactly Earth-shaking form, but the Stars and Stripes are starting to look solid while approaching their co-hosting duties.

17. Japan

FIFA ranking: 19

B/R September ranking: 19

Japan has been disappointing since sealing World Cup qualification in March, with just two wins in six matches from June onwards.

However, on Tuesday, the Samurai Blue came back from 2-0 down to secure a 3-2 friendly win over Brazil.

Of course, it's easy to point to that result coming in an essentially meaningless game, but it demonstrates the team's resilience, and Brazil still put out a strong XI. 

For Japan, it's now about fine-tuning ahead of the World Cup in June, and more results like the one against the Seleçao Canarinho will set it up nicely for North America. 

16. Uruguay 

FIFA ranking: 15

B/R September ranking: 15

Uruguay has demonstrated a notable level of consistency in the last two international breaks, going undefeated in four games and winning three.

For a squad that was criticized for being frustrating in September's B/R rankings, that's a notable improvement.

However, with teams surrounding Uruguay performing at a similar level in the last few months, and the level of competition it faced not as strong—Peru (48th), Chile (57th), Dominican Republic (142nd), and Uzbekistan (54th)—it falls a place to 16th.

Friendly matches are an opportunity to rotate and test tactics, so underperforming is to be expected. Still, if La Celeste wants to establish a dark horse reputation for themselves heading into the tournament, like they have in years past, they will need some better results.

15. Norway

FIFA ranking: 31

B/R September ranking: 17

Norway stormed into September's B/R power rankings, and it looks intent on staying there on the way to its first World Cup appearance since 1998.

Largely thanks to the most deadly striker on the planet, Erling Haaland, the Scandinavians are at the top of qualifying Group I with a staggering goal haul of 29, seven more than the next top-scoring team, the Netherlands. The 25-year-old is responsible for 41 percent of them. 

As long as Haaland is around, Norway is a potent threat. Despite having the lowest FIFA ranking of any team listed here, they should not be underestimated. Rather, Norway should be feared. 

However, that reliance on Haaland was demonstrated in his absence on Tuesday. Without the Manchester City striker, Norway could only manage a 1-1 draw with New Zealand. 

Manager Ståle Solbakken will be frantically placing an order for bubble wrap. 

14. Belgium

FIFA ranking: 8

B/R September ranking: 13

Manager Rudi Garcia has brought a spark back to the Belgian men's national team. 

The Frenchman has guided the Red Devils to five wins in eight matches in charge, and they sit on top of World Cup qualifying Group J with a game in hand over North Macedonia.

Now, it looks certain Belgium will be heading to the World Cup, and the squad will be full of confidence after scoring 20 in the last five games

Despite North Macedonia playing at a standard well above their 63rd-place FIFA world ranking, the fact that the Red Devils couldn't crack them over two qualifying games—including a 0-0 draw in October—will be a mild concern. 

13. Italy

FIFA Ranking: 10

B/R September Ranking: 14

With two matches to go, Italy is still trailing Norway in qualification Group I. That means a trip through the playoffs is the most likely scenario to seal their spot in the global soccer showcase.

The Azzurri will surely fancy their chances should it come to that, but it's an extra layer of jeopardy they would undoubtedly rather not have to deal with. 

Italy has not qualified for a World Cup since the 2014 edition in Brazil, and being on the outside looking in once again will surely be too much to bear for the nation's football-mad fans.

Thankfully, Italy is on a good run of form, picking up five consecutive wins and scoring 18 in the process.

12. Mexico

FIFA ranking: 14

B/R September ranking: 10

Mexico is having a serious Gold Cup hangover. No wins in four games since lifting the trophy is a hugely disappointing run, with their co-hosting duties approaching.

Among those results was a crushing 4-0 home loss to Colombia in October. While the friendly fixture provided an opportunity to test potential options before the nation opens its doors in June, the nature of the defeat will dampen what would otherwise be jubilant preparations. 

While still the most promising among the host nations in terms of possible success, Mexico needs to turn things around with a little over six months to go.

11. Colombia

FIFA ranking: 13

B/R September ranking: 11

After no wins in six from November 2024 to the end of August 2025, some alarm bells were sounding for Colombia.

However, World Cup qualification was sealed in September, and Los Cafeteros have now won three of their last four while scoring 13 in the process.

James Rodriguez is still performing international miracles at the age of 34, scoring once and providing four assists in those fixtures. 

Meanwhile, Luis Diaz's hot start to life with Bayern Munich will give the South Americans even more hope for a long stay in the neighboring northern continent.

10. Croatia

FIFA ranking: 9 

B/R September ranking: 12

Croatia keeps plugging away, picking up decent results to keep them top of UEFA qualification Group L.

An away draw with Czechia in their most difficult remaining game of the qualifying stage would have been greeted positively, although the bafflingly brilliant form of the Faroe Islands will at least give the Vatreni cause for concern in their penultimate qualifying fixture.

While only three points separate Croatia from Czechia in second, the former has a game in hand, which at least provides some margin for error on the road to the World Cup.

9. Brazil

FIFA ranking: 6

B/R September ranking: 6

Consistency is an increasing concern for Brazil. Granted, that's difficult to achieve on the international stage, given issues with establishing chemistry and the difficulty of squeezing a raft of talent into XI spots.

However, for a team of Brazil's enviable selection options and a manager of Carlo Ancelotti's caliber, things don't look so promising ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

In six games in charge, the Italian has only managed to guide the Seleçao Canarinho to three wins. That includes a 1-0 loss to 77th-ranked Bolivia and a 3-2 collapse against Japan when they were 2-0 up.

There's a lot of work to do between now and June if Brazil wants to reestablish its previously feared reputation.

8. Morocco

FIFA ranking: 11

B/R September ranking: 9

By rights, Morocco should be much higher in the international power rankings.

Outside of the African Nations Championship—a tournament that European-based players don't participate in—the Atlas Lions have lost just once since January 2024.

However, the strength of opponents has to be factored in, with Morocco not often tested by low-ranked African nations. 

That's still a remarkable streak, though, and one that shouldn't be taken lightly. Victories breed victories, after all. 

With Achraf Hakimi in the form of his life, fresh off being ranked the sixth-best player in the world at the 2025 Ballon d'Or awards, he'll be a driving force as captain in North America.

7. Germany

FIFA ranking: 12

B/R September ranking: 8 

After a woeful run of form that saw Germany go winless in four matches from late March to early September (including three defeats), things are looking up for the Die Nationalelf.

With World Cup qualification looking in peril after a shocking opening-game loss to Slovakia, Germany has rattled off three consecutive wins to top Group A on goal difference.

That sets them up nicely heading into November's crucial qualifying games, where Slovakia will be waiting in the final, likely decisive matchup.

Still, just eight goals scored in four qualifying games will be troubling, especially since half of those came in a 4-0 victory over 96th ranked Luxembourg.

6. Netherlands

FIFA ranking: 7

B/R September ranking: 7

The Netherlands just loves scoring goals.

In the last three games, the Oranje have smashed in 11, conceding just two in the process. Take it back a little further, and the Netherlands has 20 goals in its last five games, with only three conceded. In October, the Dutch defense didn't surrender a goal.

For a nation that always seems to have an enviable collection of stars, the Netherlands has never won a World Cup final, despite reaching the tournament's climactic game three times.

With manager Ronald Koeman finding the secret to international scoring success while maintaining a stingy back line, the Oranje might again manage a deep tournament run.

FIFA ranking: 2

B/R September ranking: 4

France had the chance to seal 2026 World Cup qualification with a win on Monday.

While Ukraine ensured that wouldn't be possible after notching a 2-1 victory over Azerbaijan, France didn't hold up its end of the bargain, either.

Les Bleus stumbled to a 2-2 draw against world No. 74 Iceland, meaning they will have to wait until November to find out if they should buy some plane tickets to North America. 

A 3-0 win over Azerbaijan at least made October's international slate a little less concerning. However, manager Didier Deschamps might come under scrutiny for his tactics and team selection in the subsequent stalemate, when a win could have eased the pressure on his side significantly.

FIFA ranking: 5

B/R September ranking: 3

Portugal has been living a little dangerously, needing a late goal in two of its last three World Cup qualifying games to seal victory and conceding a late equalizer on Tuesday. 

If not for Dominik Szoboszlai's strike, A Seleçao would have confirmed their spot in the 2026 World Cup. However, they will now have to wait until November.

In addition to that disappointment, Portugal slips in the B/R power rankings because its results simply aren't convincing at the moment. 

While Cristiano Ronaldo found the goal (and then another) that took him to the top of the all-time World Cup qualifying top scorer list, his remarkable exploits are not enough on their own for Portugal to rely on.

FIFA ranking: 3

B/R September ranking: 2

After dropping from first to second in September's B/R power ranking, Argentina's descent continues as it lands in third. 

Although qualification for the World Cup had already been secured at that point, it succumbed to a 1-0 defeat against Ecuador in September. The 1-0 victory over 49th-ranked Venezuela that followed in October wasn't entirely convincing.

La Albiceleste did secure a 6-0 win against Puerto Rico on Tuesday, but beating the 155th-ranked team isn't much to be pleased about. 

Following a disappointing defeat in Ecuador and with little else to boast about from their recent outings, Argentina has slipped after more impressive results from another nation. 

FIFA ranking: 4

B/R September ranking: 5

England has steamed into second with the Thomas Tuchel train hitting full speed. 

A 3-0 friendly victory over Wales without Harry Kane was a welcome result for U.K. bragging rights, but the 5-0 win over Latvia was significantly more important.

With that, the Three Lions will have the opportunity to end 60 years of hurt in Canada, Mexico, and the United States, with World Cup 2026 qualification sealed.

England is the only European nation to confirm a berth in the competition so far, doing so with six wins from six in Group K and no goals conceded.

Tuchel's tenure started with a concerning lack of goals, but the German has well and truly opened the attacking floodgates. That's 13 goals in the last three games, with Kane providing just three of them. 

For a team that has been so reliant on its talismanic No. 9 for the better part of a decade, that's a really promising sign. 

Tuchel has been ruthless in his selection, relying on players who are showing their best form rather than counting on reputation, and it's paying off.

FIFA ranking: 1

B/R September ranking: 1

Spain simply looks unshakable at the top of B/R's international football rankings.

FIFA apparently agrees, having put the country at the summit of its own ranking list in September's update. 

If you ignore the penalty-shootout loss to Portugal in the Nations League final, La Furia Roja haven't been defeated since a March 2024 friendly against Colombia, in which usual starters were rested.

In October, Spain brushed aside Georgia and put four past Bulgaria with no reply, putting it comfortably atop Group E and within touching distance of automatic World Cup qualification. 

With inconsistencies from many of the typically favored nations, Spain must be considered the favorite when the action starts in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. ","{'href': 'https://bleacherreport.com', 'title': 'Bleacher Report'}","soccer"

President Donald Trump suggested he will work to have 2026 FIFA World Cup games pulled out of Boston if the city's mayor, Michelle Wu, does not curb crime that recently included a violent street takeover targeting police.

Trump made the suggestion while taking questions from the media during Tuesday's meeting with Argentinian President Javier Milei at the White House, threatening to call FIFA President Gianni Infantino to have the games moved to cities that do cooperate, citing safety concerns.

“We can take them away. I love the people of Boston. And I know the games are sold out, but the mayor is not good. There are worse than her. At least she's intelligent. You know, some are extremely low IQ. Those bother me more. She's intelligent, but she's radical left,” Trump said. 

“The answer is yes, if somebody's doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location,' and he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it, very easily he'd do it. And this is the right time to do it.” 

Trump's comments come after a group of people took over one of the city's streets in a violent incident this week.

The president of a union that represents Boston police officers said that people who took part in a recent street takeover in the city were “hell-bent” on attacking law enforcement officials.

According to the Boston Police Department, over 100 people were involved in the takeover that involved street racing just after 2 a.m. on Oct. 5. 

Officers found people trying to attack police cruisers with fireworks, cones, poles and other items.

One police cruiser was destroyed by flames and needed to be towed away from the area, officials said.

Boston is currently set to host seven matches when the World Cup comes to North America next summer.

The slate includes five group-stage games, one Round of 32 fixture and the first quarterfinal on July 9.

Fox News Digital has reached out to Wu's office for further comment.

Trump added that he would also consider pulling the 2028 Summer Olympics out of Los Angeles for similar reasons. 

“I could say the same thing for the Olympics,” he said. 

“If I thought LA was not going to be prepared properly, I'd move it to another location.”

Wu has accused the Trump administration of being a party that “doesn't follow the law.”

“At a time when this federal administration is already causing so much fear and harm in our communities, these threats are serious and consequential,” Wu said in August. 

The remarks came after the Trump administration warned it could sue or cut federal funds if cities refused to cooperate on immigration enforcement.

Thomas Tuchel has completed his first task as England manager with ease as the Three Lions became the first European side to qualify for the 2026 World Cup on Tuesday.

After a perfect qualifying record of six wins and 18 goals without conceding from six games, the hard work for the German now begins in burdening great expectations in tough conditions next year in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

AFP Sports looks at the challenges ahead for Tuchel and his team if they are to end a 60-year wait to win a major men's tournament.

Tuchel's bold decision to leave out Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden from his squad this month underlined his desire to find the best collective unit rather than a collection of the best players at his disposal.

""We try to collect the guys who in the end have the glue and cohesion to be the best team, because we need to arrive (at the World Cup) with the best team,"" Tuchel said last week.

Elliot Anderson has been the main beneficiary, starting the last four England games.

But if the Nottingham Forest midfielder is to cement his place alongside Declan Rice, it would likely leave only one starting spot available for Bellingham, Foden and Cole Palmer.

It will take a far braver call for Tuchel to leave out some of his star names when it comes to naming his World Cup squad.

Chelsea's Palmer and Real Madrid right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold were also missing this month due to injury and will expect to be on the plane across the Atlantic come June.

Tuchel accepted from his first day in the job that anything other than winning the World Cup will be regarded as a failure.

England came as close as they ever have since 1966 to ending their trophy drought during his predecessor Gareth Southgate's tenure, losing two European Championship finals.

By splashing out on a proven winner in the former Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain boss on a short-term contract, the English Football Association are banking on Tuchel to turn a supremely talented generation from nearly men into winners.

However, the 52-year-old will be stepping into the unknown for his first tournament as an international manager in challenging conditions.

England have rarely thrived in the sweltering heat they can expect in many host cities next summer.

Moreover, a number of Tuchel's key men will head into the tournament on the back of 12 months without a break after their role in the Club World Cup last summer.

Preparations have already begun with the FA reportedly exploring June friendlies in the heat and humidity of Miami to acclimatise to the conditions before the World Cup kicks off.

The appointment of only the third foreign manager to lead the England team was not overwhelmingly popular.

However, that has not prevented the forthright Tuchel from speaking his mind.

He branded the Wembley crowd ""silent"" during Thursday's 3-0 friendly win over Wales and claimed his players deserved more from the fans.

The travelling support for Tuesday's 5-0 win in Riga over Latvia were quick to hit back, telling Tuchel they would ""sing when we want"".

England's rocky road to the Euro 2024 final was beset by an uneasy relationship with fans on the ground in Germany.

Southgate was pelted with beer cups after a 0-0 draw against Slovenia in the group stages.

Tuchel can ill afford such a toxic relationship to add an unwanted distraction to his quest to deliver England's first ever major trophy on foreign soil.

President Donald Trump said he may call FIFA's president to suggest World Cup games be moved out of Boston if he believes there are safety concerns in the city.

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu responded after President Donald Trump threatened to pull FIFA World Cup games out of the city next year. 

""Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions,"" she said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.

Boston is currently set to host seven matches when the World Cup comes to North America next summer. The slate includes five group-stage games, one Round of 32 fixture and the first quarterfinal on July 9.

Trump made the suggestion that he would have games moved out of Boston while speaking to reporters on Tuesday while discussing an incident that happened in the city this week when a group of people took over one of the city's streets in a violent display. 

According to the Boston Police Department, over 100 people were involved in the takeover that involved street racing just after 2 a.m. on Oct. 5. Officers found people trying to attack police cruisers with fireworks, cones, poles and other items. One police cruiser was destroyed by flames and needed to be towed away from the area, officials said.

""I'm committed to doing everything I can to get after this issue,"" Healey said. ""That's my message today: No more.

""Not going to happen here. And if you do it, you're going to be punished. I'm serious.""

As continental qualification for the FIFA World Cup 2026 nears its end, the focus is shifting to the tournament itself.

By Kevin Hand

The picture for the FIFA World Cup 2026 became a lot clearer on Tuesday when a number of top teams across the continents booked their place at football's global showpiece.

The number of confirmed teams has now risen to 28 following the latest round of qualifiers, with another 20 still to be filled by various confederational playoffs, intercontinental playoffs, and – in Europe's case – the main qualifying stage, which still needs to be completed.

England, South Africa and Qatar were among the headline names to book their place at the tournament on Tuesday.

Al Jazeera Sport takes a look at the tournament that the nations around the world are all vying to reach.

The tournament is being staged across the United States, Canada and Mexico. The first match will be played in Mexico City on June 11, while the final will be staged in New Jersey, US, on July 19.

Due to the expansion of the tournament – from 32 teams to 48 – the 39-day event is the longest in its history.

FIFA's intercontinental playoffs will be the last chance saloon for teams around the world to reach next summer's event. The finale of that route will be on March 31, 2026, less than three months before the World Cup kicks off. The European qualification process runs until March, but most of the remaining confederations will have finished their continental qualification processes long before then.

Once the respective confederations finish their qualification process, FIFA offers two final spots to be contested by the best-placed team from each of the six continental routes that have not already qualified.

Although we will not know the full list of teams for the event until the end of March 2026, the draw will take place on December 5, 2025.

— FIFA World Cup (@FIFAWorldCup) October 14, 2025



The draw will take place in the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. US President Donald Trump confirmed the location while speaking in the Oval Office at the White House, flanked by Vice President JD Vance and FIFA boss Gianni Infantino. He did not rule out overseeing the draw itself.

With the expansion to 48 teams, the World Cup will now feature 12 four-team groups. That in turn will lead to a round of 32, an extra knockout round to previous editions.

Indeed, the tournament has doubled in size since it was staged in the US in 1994, when only 24 teams competed.

Trump has been quite clear and consistent on the staging of games within the US, saying he will move the games from any cities that he deems to be unsafe.

On September 26, when Trump was asked about games being moved, he warned: “Well, that's an interesting question … but we're going to make sure they're safe. [Seattle and San Francisco are] run by radical left lunatics who don't know what they're doing.”

The US will stage games in 11 cities: Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New Jersey/New York (joint host region), Philadelphia, San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle.

Canada will host 13 games in total, split between Toronto and Vancouver. Mexico will also get 13 games, which will be played in Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey.

The US will stage the final, which will be played at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

Argentina won the last edition of the FIFA World Cup, beating France in the final of Qatar 2022.

With the game level at 3-3 after extra time, Argentina won the penalty shootout 4-2.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup was staged in the US, and the heat and resulting thunderstorms proved to be a huge problem for the tournament.

Three stadiums – in Arlington, Atlanta and Houston – have retractable roofs that are expected to be closed due to the summer heat, while Inglewood and Vancouver have fixed roofs.

After the latest round of qualifying matches, here is a breakdown of the confirmed contenders from each of the six regions:

Hosts: Canada, Mexico, USA

Asia: Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Uzbekistan

Africa: Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia

Europe: England

Oceania: New Zealand

South America: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay

Africa: Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon and Nigeria will play off for the final intercontinental spot from the continent. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has announced November 13 for the first matches, followed by a deciding match three days later.

Asia: UAE and Iraq will vie for one intercontinental playoffs spot when they compete over two legs in the final stage of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) qualifiers on November 13 and 18.

Europe: 53 of the 54 European teams vying for 16 qualification spots can still confirm their berths, alongside England, as their first-round matches will run until November 18. European qualification will run until March, just before the intercontinental playoffs begin.

North, Central America and the Caribbean: Three spots remain up for grabs, given the World Cup hosts take up three spots already. Bermuda, Costa Rica, Curacao, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Haiti, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago have all advanced to the third round, with the winners to be decided by November 18. The three second-placed teams from each group will then fight for the intercontinental playoffs spot.

Oceania: New Caledonia have qualified for the intercontinental playoffs.

South America: Bolivia have qualified for the intercontinental playoffs, having missed out on one of the six automatic qualifying positions.

World Cup 2026

President Donald Trump's suggestion that he could move 2026 World Cup games out of U.S. cities he deems unsafe rippled through soccer and political circles in late September. Then he doubled down in mid-October, repeating his assertions.

The idea, previously unexplored, was first raised by a reporter at the White House and entertained by Trump. It sparked a wide range of reactions, many tinged with confusion, because the U.S. government had no official role in choosing World Cup host cities; and it does not have any explicit authority to relocate World Cup games.

Nonetheless, Trump's comments elicited responses from host city mayors and World Cup organizers. Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell ripped Trump's “ignorance,” and said in a statement: “We're working every day to make the World Cup a safe, welcoming, and fun experience.”

The following is a rundown of what else has been said and whether games could actually be moved.

Trump did not proactively make the suggestion. In fact, he initially seemed to resist it. During a press session in the Oval Office, when the reporter prefaced his question with “immigration, crime and the World Cup,” Trump interjected with a hint of humor: “That's a lot — that's a lot of questions.”

The reporter continued: “You have a number of cities that are pushing back against your immigration and deportation, as well as your crime initiatives.”

Trump interjected again: “I don't think they're very much pushing back at all.”

The reporter went on: “But some of those cities have World Cup games. Seattle, San Francisco.”

Trump cut him off yet again: “They're gonna be very secure.”

But the reporter continued: “Could those games move if they don't cooperate with your crime initiatives and your immigration initiatives?”

Trump then spoke for two minutes and 45 seconds. He began: “Well, that's an interesting suggestion. I guess. But we're gonna make sure they're safe.”

He continued on a tangent about cities who, he said, are “run by radical left lunatics that don't know what they're doing.” He spoke about Washington, D.C., which is not hosting World Cup games. He spoke about Memphis and Chicago. “It will be safe for the World Cup,” he said, despite both Memphis and Chicago also being uninvolved. (Chicago pulled out of the running for World Cup games during the bid phase, citing “FIFA's inflexibility” and taxpayer risk.)

“If I think it isn't safe, we'll move it into a different city, absolutely,” Trump said. “It's actually a very fair question. If I think it's not safe, we're going to move it out of that city.”

He then went on another tangent about JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, who has accused Trump of deploying National Guard troops to Democrat-controlled cities in an effort to exert “authoritarian” control ahead of next year's midterm elections.

Trump concluded: “If any city we think is gonna be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup … we won't allow it to go to [those cities], we'll move it around a little bit. But I hope that's not going to happen.”

When repeating his remarks in another Oval Office media session, Trump said he would call in a personal favor with FIFA president Gianni Infantino.

“If I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni — the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal — and I would say, ‘let's move it to another location,' and he would do that.” Trump said. “He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.”

The World Cup is owned and operated by FIFA, soccer's global governing body. FIFA, years ago, signed “host city agreements” and “stadium agreements” with entities in various U.S. markets, and chose 11 of them — plus three in Mexico and two in Canada — to host games.

The federal government, meanwhile, signed various declarations and guarantees when the three North American countries were bidding to host the World Cup back in 2018, during the first Trump administration. But it had no role in selecting the cities or negotiating their contracts, which were originally signed in 2017 and updated with addendums in 2022.

“The federal government is not a direct party to these agreements,” Nathan O'Malley, an attorney at Musick, Peeler & Garrett and co-leader of the firm's Olympics & World Cup practice group, told The Athletic.

Trump, therefore, cannot unilaterally cancel those contracts and move games to other cities.

The contracts, some of which have been obtained via public records requests, do require cities to implement robust security and public safety measures. If FIFA deems a city unsafe, it could, potentially, terminate the agreements and relocate matches. Trump, in theory, could pressure FIFA to do so.

But leaders in most or all 11 cities have stated their confidence in the security plans being developed.

“Public safety officials, including our Republican-appointed Police Board, are working daily to ensure the games in Kansas City are safe for all,” Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas told The Athletic in a statement via a spokeswoman. “I am confident in their work. FIFA loves Kansas City and Kansas City loves FIFA. We'll be fine.”

Trump has a direct line to FIFA's president, his “great friend” Infantino, who has publicly supported and praised Trump repeatedly. In December will bring the World Cup Draw to Washington, D.C., largely so that Trump can be involved.

Trump, in theory, could leverage this relationship and push Infantino to pull games out of cities whose mayors resist him, which is what he insinuated in his Oct. 14 remarks. It's unclear how Infantino and FIFA would respond. After the initial suggestion, FIFA did not give a statement, but in responding to a query from Politico following Trump's doubling-down, a FIFA spokesperson said, “Safety and security are of the utmost importance at all FIFA events worldwide and it is ultimately the government's responsibility to decide what's in the best interest of public safety. We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to fulfill all necessary requirements for a successful 2026 World Cup.”

Trump's other potential lever is the $625 million in security funds that Congress allocated to World Cup cities this summer. That money will be split proportionally — not equally — among the 11 U.S. host cities, depending on their needs. The cities will submit their costs and requests for reimbursement, according to Andrew Giuliani, head of the White House's World Cup task force. It's unclear if Trump, who chairs the task force, could potentially politicize and withhold some of that funding.

Trump has clashed with Democratic mayors throughout his second term over immigration policy and other topics. His latest push is on crime. After his federal takeover of D.C., he has threatened to send troops to Chicago and other cities, even as many mayors and governors say that crime is not out of control and federal assistance is not necessary or welcome.

The World Cup host cities in left-leaning states with Democratic mayors that Trump could target would include Seattle, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Boston. Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas and Kansas City are also led by Democrats. The U.S. men's national team is due to play its group games in L.A. and Seattle.

At this stage, eight-and-a-half months out from the World Cup opener, finding new host cities would be unrealistic. The 11 chosen cities have already spent years preparing for matches and adjacent events, plus the thousands of visitors they'll bring. It would be extremely difficult for a 12th city to cram all that planning into eight months. And especially after the Dec. 5 draw, relocation would anger fans and teams who've planned travel to a specific city.

Perhaps some of the 11 cities could take on additional games, if one or two cities were forced out of the rotation. But even that would be a massive disruption. FIFA set the World Cup schedule, complete with dates and locations, in 2024. It has already sold hospitality packages to specific stadiums, and is set to open ticket sales next week.

According to one person briefed on the planning efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose details, FIFA has previously told local organizers that it will not be relocating games.

The 11 U.S. cities and stadiums slated to host the 2026 World Cup are:

In Mexico, Monterrey, Guadalajara and Mexico City are the three hosts. The two in Canada are Toronto and Vancouver.

Most mayoral offices and local World Cup host committees have declined to comment or did not respond to The Athletic's inquiries. Representatives in a few cities, however, have spoken.

Harrell's words were the strongest. Seattle's mayor said in a statement published on his website: “President Trump continues to display his ignorance about our city. We are doing the hard work to prepare for this once-in-a-generation opportunity to welcome the world to Seattle.

“The facts are clear: violent crime is down 20% in Seattle. We are making record-breaking progress on police hiring with nearly 130 officers hired this year. My proposed 2026 budget also makes additional investments in safety preparations for the World Cup, including new removable vehicle barriers at Pike Place Market and Seattle Center campus.

“While we are doing our part to make safety improvements ahead of hosting games, the Trump administration has made our city less safe by withholding critical funding for counterterrorism tools. While the City's lawsuit has successfully released a portion of this funding, President Trump's words about safety don't align with his administration's actions.

“We're working every day to make the World Cup a safe, welcoming, and fun experience for both residents and visitors to our city and will continue to advance plans with local partners to ensure we make the most of this special event.”

A spokesperson for Harrell had previously told KOMO News: “While the president continues to peddle baseless, divisive, and empty threats, our administration is doing the hard work to prepare for this opportunity. We're working every day to make the 2026 World Cup a safe, welcoming, and fun experience for residents and visitors. We're advancing plans with FIFA and local partners to ensure Seattle is a destination and that we make the most of this special event.”

Hana Tadesse, a spokeswoman for the Seattle World Cup host committee, wrote in a statement to The Athletic: “We are committed to ensuring a safe, welcoming, and memorable experience for fans, players, visitors, and residents alike. Since being selected by FIFA as a host city, we've worked closely with them, the White House Task Force for FIFA World Cup 26, community partners, and law enforcement, and are confident in our planning and coordination in advance of next summer's matches. Seattle looks forward to shining on the world stage and hosting an event that is not only spectacular, but safe for all.”

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who has previously said that “Boston will not back down” from the Trump administration amid legal threats over immigration policies, initially said in response to a question about Trump's World Cup comments: “We are very excited for the summer that Boston will have next year. It's going to be an incredible show of what our city's made of as we welcome people from all over the world [for the World Cup and other events]. We are very proud, and hold ourselves to the high standards of being the safest major city in the country. And that takes work every day, but we have the record and the results to prove it.”

With Boston specifically targeted in Trump's latest threat, Wu simply said, “Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions.”

Natalie Hamilton, a spokeswoman for the New York/New Jersey host committee, wrote in a statement to The Athletic: “Formal agreements are in place between each Host City and FIFA, and we continue to work closely with FIFA and our local, state, and federal partners to ensure a safe and secure tournament, which remains our top priority. Planning for World Cup is already underway, and we are fully committed to delivering an unforgettable tournament that this country, and this region, will be proud of well beyond 2026.”

Philadelphia Soccer 2026 said in a statement to The Athletic: “We appreciate President Trump's commitment to safety and security for this global event, and we share that same commitment, as do our colleagues across the nation. Safety is paramount to the City of Philadelphia, and we have every confidence in the significant planning that is ongoing between City, State, and Federal officials as well as the White House Task Force. Just as Philadelphia was for the political conventions, Papal Visit and NFL Draft, we will be ready to welcome the world and deliver a safe, exceptional experience for fans and residents alike.”

Nedum Onuoha reacts to Cristiano Ronaldo's record-breaking night as he becomes the highest goalscorer in World Cup qualifying. (1:34)

It's the quadrennial question. What's more important for a national team: talent or form?

With the third-to-last international break before the FIFA World Cup upon us, I have some good news: we actually don't need to answer that question. Instead, we're going to operate from an alternative premise: What if talent and form are both really important? At least, that's the idea behind the rankings you're about to read through.

We want to get a sense of where every national team stands ahead of next summer, so we've looked at every country that still hasn't been eliminated from World Cup contention, and then ranked them by equal parts performance and results.

As a proxy for talent, this ranking uses the average, estimated transfer value of each player on each team's most recent roster from the site Transfermarkt. And for results, we'll use the World Football Elo Ratings -- a system that awards or subtracts points every time a team plays a game, based on the final scoreline, the location of the match, the quality of the opponent, and the competitiveness of the match. Then we've normalized those numbers to make them equivalent, added them up, and produced what you see below.

There are 87 teams still in contention to compete in the 2026 World Cup, so let's get to ESPN's World Cup field rankings:

- Inside how U.S. Soccer schedules games for USMNT, USWNT
- O'Hanlon: How to fix Man United in four steps 
- Di María shows Neymar triumphant return is possible

It's not only the addition of 16 more teams that's made World Cup qualifying even more convoluted -- it's the existence of the Nations League, which gives some teams multiple paths to qualification, depending on the federation.

For example, Moldova have lost all five of their qualifying matches. They've scored three goals and conceded 25. Yet, somehow, they could still sneak into the UEFA qualification playoff.

The market value of Benin's entire roster is €14.28 million. There are 15 different Nigerian players with higher market values -- by themselves.

Despite that, the two countries had something close to a win-and-you're-in match in Nigeria to wrap up the current stage of qualifying.

And there you have it: Our first qualified team for the 2026 World Cup!

The estimated market value of Wolverhampton midfielder Jean-Ricner Bellegarde is more than the entire squads for 19 countries behind Haiti on this list.

It's their first time qualifying for a World Cup, which is the sort of thing that can happen when expanding the tournament from 32 teams to 48, as will be the case next summer.

While Jordan doesn't have a particularly talented squad beyond Rennes winger Mousa Tamari, you can't qualify for the World Cup as a non-host unless you win a bunch of games. So, Jordan have a significantly higher Elo rating than all of the teams behind them on this list.

How much is Bolivia's home-field advantage at 13,615 feet above sea level worth? They have the 90th-most-valuable squad on this list.

Among teams ranked in the top 50, Iran have the biggest positive gap between the value of their squad and team performance.

Mehdi Taremi is one of the only four players, across all confederations, with at least 10 goals in qualifying. He is 33 years old and left Inter Milan for Olympiacos on a €2 million transfer this past summer.

There are 21 countries, including Paraguay, with an Elo rating of 18400 or better. The average market value of the players on those teams is €22 million. The average market value of Paraguay's current players: €3.6 million.

Colin Udoh reveals the role he played in 'helping' Nigeria secure a World Cup play-off place after their 4-0 win over Benin.

For all of the consternation around El Tri every year, Mexico are tied for 19th in the Elo ratings, and based on the current rosters, they have the 35th-most-valuable squad in the world. Perhaps there are deeper player development issues here, but there's no real argument that this team hasn't been performing at its true talent level.

That could all change pretty quickly, of course. Gilberto Mora has been starting for Tijuana since he was 15, and he doesn't turn 17 until later this month. He plays approximately zero defense, but he's already a quality possession player in a good professional soccer league. He's also one of the most promising young players on the planet.

They would be higher with a full roster -- both Chelsea's Moisés Caicedo and Arsenal's Piero Hincapié missed call-ups because of injuries -- but this is still a team significantly outperforming its talent level.

Ecuador currently rank 9th in the Elo ratings. And over the past year, they've improved their rating by a larger degree than all but one other team inside the top 20.

The U.S. men's national team ranks 19th in estimated player value -- and 40th in the Elo ratings. Put another way: The USMNT has a roster of comparable quality to Croatia, and yet it is performing like Hungary.

Now, as you start to dream about an efficiently managed American team reaching the semifinals in back-to-back World Cups like Croatia did, it's important to remember that we're talking about Croatia right now. Not the one that had Luka Modric playing like a literal Ballon d'Or winner and a number of other stars playing significant minutes for the best teams in the world.

Looking at the market values of these teams is instructive, though. For structural reasons, there are basically eight countries that are going to have more talent than everyone else, at most World Cups. There are the two South American giants (Brazil and Argentina) and the six European powers: France, Spain, England, Portugal, Germany and the Netherlands. We can also throw Italy into that mix if they ever start qualifying for World Cups again.

Argentina have the least valuable squad of those top nine, and their team is still more than twice as valuable as what we can assume is among the most valuable American teams ever assembled. By pure value, the gap between Argentina and the USMNT is bigger than the gap between the USMNT and Moldova.

In other words: It doesn't take a ton of improvement to go from the 70th-best team in the world to the 20th-best team in the world. But to get from 20th to the top 10? It's a massive leap that we haven't really seen anyone be able to sustain.

They were third in the Elo ratings a year ago, and they're sixth today. The question for Colombia ahead of next summer, then: Will the slide continue?

Among the top 30 teams, only Paraguay have an older current squad. Plus, this team only has one true star in Luis Díaz. No one else on the roster plays for a Champions League-qualified squad in a Big Five league. Beyond Diaz, they're especially reliant on the health and consistency of James Rodríguez, who is 34 years old and currently plays in Liga MX.

For most of their history, Colombia have been worse than the sum of their parts. The current iteration the exact opposite, but to what degree? Although the results have been there, it's hard to look at this roster and see this as the sixth-best team in the world.

This is the anti-Colombia: they're 39th in the Elo ratings but have the 12th-most-valuable squad in the world. Part of that discrepancy comes from the randomness of player development and the arbitrariness of national borders.

Sweden's two best players, Liverpool's Alexander Isak and Arsenal's Viktor Gyökeres, play the same position. It's not to say they can't play together, but they don't complement each other in the same way that the top two at another Scandinavian nation do.

With just one point through the first three qualifying matches, it's looking likely they'll be one of the most talented teams watching from the couch next summer.

It seems like it's finally happening. After giving Israel a 90-minute-long noogie and winning 5-0 despite Erling Haaland missing two penalties, Norway have a plus-26 goal differential in qualifying through six matches. Barring a sudden collapse, they're going to their first World Cup since 1998.

There won't be a better one-two combination than Haaland and Martin Ødegaard next summer, either. The former rarely touches the ball and just constantly threatens the defense with runs in behind, while the former might be the best high-volume attacking passer in the world. Put more simply: There's no one better than the Arsenal captain at playing through balls, and there's no one better than the Manchester City forward at running through on goal.

The haphazard structure of international soccer favors simplicity, and things have just happened to work out that Norway's two superstars fit that perfectly. They're lucky they don't have two star goalkeepers you can't play at the same time or a game-breaking creative-passing right back who requires some tactical creativity to get the most out of.

As long as they can get some solidity around Ødegaard and Haaland, this team should be able to beat anyone next summer.

Given how random international tournaments are -- and qualifying, too, to a lesser extent -- it makes sense to buy low (theoretically) on the super-talented sides that haven't yet produced results. Enter: Germany under Julian Nagelsmann.

They took Spain to the brink in the knockout round at the Euros in the summer of 2024, but it's been all downhill ever since then. They've fallen eight spots in the Elo ratings since last year and now sit 15th between Switzerland and Norway. Their qualification hopes even looked at risk at one point, but they're back in first in their group and should be favorites to advance.

The big question is whether or not Jamal Musiala (1) comes back from his ankle injury in time for the World Cup, and (2) how quickly he can get up to speed if he does. The team we saw at the Euros played well enough to win that tournament (and the upcoming World Cup), but it's hard to see them getting back to that level without Musiala.

There are Italians who are old enough to legally drink a glass of wine but have never seen Italy get out of the group stage at the World Cup.

The last time it happened was in 2006, when they ... won the World Cup. And with Italy well behind Norway on points and in a different universe on goal differential in their qualifying group, there's a very real chance that they miss their third-straight World Cup, too.

By building a team around a 38-year-old guy playing in MLS and some of his best friends, Argentina can only rate so highly in an exercise that accounts for estimated transfer values. Yes, Lionel Messi may be the greatest player to ever do it, but re-read the previous sentence.

The Elo ratings have Argentina in second, and how could they not be? They've won the past three major tournaments they've contested and they finished atop the CONMEBOL qualifying table. But their rating has dipped a bit, and it's now closer to Portugal in fourth than it is to Spain in first.

Messi is still absurdly good in MLS. Some player-value metrics, like G+ at American Soccer Analysis, rate him as twice as good as the second-best player in the league. There's no doubt he can still contribute to a top team at the international level. But when you're 38, a year is a really long time.

This team would be awesome if you could just build an entire starting 11 out of only forwards, goalkeepers and center backs. With AC Milan, manager Carlo Ancelotti figured out a way to cram five central midfielders onto the field at the same time and win the Champions League.

He'll have to think up something similarly lopsided if he wants to get all of Brazil's best players onto the field next summer.

Nedum Onuoha addresses reports about Jude Bellingham's temperament within the England squad and its effect on the dressing room.

Thanks to their demotion in the Nations League before he arrived, we haven't seen England under Thomas Tuchel play any competitive games against any of the top teams in Europe. I don't suspect it will be any more exciting than it was under Gareth Southgate, but I doubt we'll see anything as ill-conceived as the what if ""Trent Alexander-Arnold is an 8"" experiment at the Euros. In fact, as of now, I'm not sure we'll even see Trent Alexander-Arnold as anything next summer.

Much like with Mauricio Pochettino and the USMNT, we still have no idea what Tuchel thinks is England's best starting lineup.

Alejandro Moreno describes Spain's Pedri as the best player in the world in his position after their 4-0 win over Bulgaria.

Everyone knows how good this team is. They're first in the Elo ratings. They were first at this time last year, and their rating has gone up since.

Just to give you a sense of where they're at, even without a fully functioning Rodri: Turkey are 14th on this list, and they lost to Spain, 5-0. The game was in Turkey, there were no red cards, and Spain didn't score a goal in the final 30 minutes of the match.

France's front three at the next World Cup will presumably be a combination of Kylian Mbappé, Michael Olise and Ousmane Dembélé. Per Transfermarkt, their average market value is €127 million. Only three players in the history of world soccer have ever moved for that much money.

Their backup forwards will likely come from Liverpool, PSG, Inter Milan, PSG and Manchester City. A starting center back from either Arsenal, Bayern Munich, or Liverpool will be on the bench next summer.

France won the 2018 World Cup, they lost the 2022 World Cup final in a shootout, and the players they take to the 2026 World Cup might have more talent than either of those teams.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Soccer fandom in the U.S. is gaining momentum in anticipation of the 2026 FIFA World Cup™. And with this growing audience, brand sponsors and advertisers need to understand who these fans are and how they're engaging to capitalize on this rising popularity. 

The tournament is set to significantly boost soccer's popularity, with 37% of the general population expecting their interest in the sport to increase over the next 18 months.1 Currently, 74% of dedicated current World Cup fans also foresee their interest growing even further. But most notably, Hispanic communities and younger audiences are leading the way in driving soccer's over popularity and engagement.2

There's a significant opportunity for in-person engagement and localized activations with 25% of World Cup fans planning to attend the games.3 Fans attending games in host cities also intend to engage in a variety of activities beyond just the matches themselves, indicating an interest in a broader festival atmosphere and exploring local culture and attractions.

This data highlights a strong inclination among U.S. World Cup fans to immerse themselves fully in the event, both inside and outside the stadiums. 

And for those not attending the games, 67% of U.S. World Cup fans and 30% of the U.S. general population plan on watching full games, further underscoring significant engagement opportunities outside of the in person action.4

Similarly to in-person attendees for the games, World Cup fans in general demonstrate a strong inclination towards cultural experiences. 

A significant 71% are interested in attending music concerts, compared to just 57% of the general population.5 This interest is even more pronounced among Hispanic World Cup fans, with 76% expressing interest in live music.6 Similarly, 69% of World Cup fans are interested in arts and culture (vs. 52% general population), a figure that jumps to 78% for Hispanic World Cup fans, indicating a strong overall overindex compared to the general population in both areas.7 Hispanic fans also show a strong interest in team merchandise as they are more than two times as likely to have purchased Major League Soccer or team gear in the past 12 months than the total U.S. population.8

It's also important for brands to know perceptions and attitudes of their fans—and U.S. soccer fans are leaning in. Soccer fans overall, compared with NBA, MLB and NFL fans, are more responsive to choosing brand sponsored products, care more about social engagement, stay informed about brand sponsors and buy more sponsored products after watching a game.

There's also several standout areas for what U.S.-based World Cup fans are interested in compared to the general population.

The Coventry City striker took charge when his national team needed him most, scoring once in each half to seal important win

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. - For the first half hour of Tuesday's friendly against Australia, it was doom and gloom for the U.S. men's national team. They'd conceded a goal, and a poor one at that. Christian Pulisic, the team's captain on the day, was forced off with an injury.

Despite dominating the play, the U.S. were down a goal and a star at the half-hour mark. Mauricio Pochettino's side needed a spark. It came from Haji Wright, who brought his scoring boots from England right on over to Colorado. Given the start ahead of the prolific Folarin Balogun, Wright made the difference for the USMNT, making one hell of a statement in his first USMNT appearance since his Gold Cup injury.

Behind Wright's brace, the USMNT went on to win 2-1 on Tuesday night. Following Jordan Bos' scrappy opener, Wright took over, netting one on either side of halftime, and continuing his torrid scoring streak - he now has 11 goals in his last 11 games for club and country.

The first came as he ran onto a line-splitting pass from Cristian Roldan. The second came as he ran onto a long ball from the very same man, and that Roldan-Wright combination effectively decided the game.

“I believe in myself and the players around here make it easy,"" Wright said. ""I've known these guys my whole life, almost my whole soccer career. So getting back on the field with these guys, it feels like home to me. And playing back in the U.S. feels great… I'm not just stuck in the nine as a typical striker. I'm allowed to move and be free-flowing and create chances and score chances.""

Earlier this international break, Pochettino explained what he wants from his strikers: the ball in the back of the net. The rest is all a bonus, he said, and the key unit of measurement in this striker race will always be goals. On Tuesday, Wright got two of them at a crucial time, helping the USMNT turn a poor start into a banner night of momentum building.

“We conceded a goal that we should not concede,"" Pochettino told TNT. ""I was happy the way finished the first half. We controlled the game after 20 minutes. After we conceded, we started to play more natural. It's a new team, the first time they've played together, and they were thinking too much, then started to play more natural.”

Now unbeaten in three games after an up-and-down summer, the U.S. continues to move in the right direction. On this occasion, Wright was the man who made it so.

Roger Federer may have retired from the ATP Tour, but the Swiss maestro's smooth serve is still drawing admiration and a bit of playful critique. On Monday, Federer posted a video on Instagram showcasing his iconic service motion, looking as elegant as ever on the court. But one familiar rival wasn't about to let him off the hook so easily.

Enter Andy Murray.

Never one to miss a chance for some friendly banter, the Scot slid into the comments with a cheeky jab: “If you could have disguised your toss better you would have been some player.”

A post shared by Roger Federer (@rogerfederer)

The comment, dripping with classic Murray dry wit, instantly drew laughs and a flood of fan reactions. While the two legends faced off 25 times on Tour, with Federer leading the Scot 14-11 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, it's clear that even in retirement, the scoreboard of sarcasm might just be tilting in Murray's favour.

Federer has been here, there and everywhere in the past month. The former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings was in attendance as usual at the Laver Cup, which was co-founded by Federer and his management company. He then visited the Rolex Shanghai Masters, where he watched Valentin Vacherot win the title.

Karen Khachanov, Daniil Medvedev, and Flavio Cobolli joined Kazakhstan's Alexander Shevchenko and Beibit Zhukayev on Monday to inaugurate the Kazakhstan Tennis Federation's new Alatau International Tennis Complex in Almaty.

The facility is located in Almaty's growing Alatau district and is designed to support both elite and grassroots tennis. It features 14 courts, including indoor and outdoor hard and clay surfaces, alongside a gym, medical centre, cafe, and conference hall. The centre can host up to 500 athletes daily and meets international standards for ITF and ATF-level tournaments.

The opening drew a large crowd of fans and junior players and featured performances by a local band, along with a symbolic tree-planting ceremony by the players.

Almaty Mayor Darkhan Satybaldy and KTF President Bulat Utemuratov also attended the event.

“The new tennis centre has become an important sports facility for the growing Alatau district of our city,” said Satybaldy. “It will serve as a platform for training young athletes and for hosting national and international competitions. This not only raises Almaty's prestige in the eyes of the global sports community but also contributes to the city's continued development.”



Built with support from the KTF, the Alatau center is the 39th tennis facility constructed in the country since 2007. In total, the Federation has overseen the development of 291 courts nationwide, backed by more than $200 million in private investment over the past 18 years.

Beyond professional training, the complex will offer free programmes for children from low-income families, as well as discounts for large families and pensioners. The site is also fully accessible for people with limited mobility, and all training will be led by certified coaches.

“Investments in infrastructure help make tennis an accessible sport for a wide range of citizens nation,” said KTF President Utemuratov. “The Alatau Tennis Centre is an example of how sports can become a mass movement when world-class conditions are created. Today, more than 30,000 children in Kazakhstan play tennis on a regular basis. One of our key strategic goals is to continue expanding participation and promoting a healthy lifestyle among all citizens.”

The launch of the Alatau Tennis Complex marks another step in Kazakhstan's continued rise in world tennis, with a dual focus on developing top-level talent and expanding participation across all levels of society.

Third seed Flavio Cobolli earned victory on his Almaty Open debut Wednesday, when he moved past Rinky Hijikata 6-4, 7-5 to end his brief losing run on the Tour.

After defeating Andrey Rublev in Beijing, the Italian suffered consecutive defeats, falling to Learner Tien at the ATP 500 and then Jaume Munar in Shanghai. However, he looked close to his best against Hijikata, striking 21 winners and committing just seven unforced errors to advance to the quarter-finals after 79 minutes.

Cobolli has enjoyed a standout year, winning titles in Hamburg and Bucharest. The 23-year-old is currently No. 22 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings but would return to the Top 20 with a title run in Almaty, where he will next face James Duckworth.

Australian qualifier Duckworth upset seventh seed and last year's finalist Gabriel Diallo 7-6(3), 6-7(3), 6-4 for the biggest win of his season. The World No. 138 did not face a break point en route to his win, according to Infosys ATP Stats.



Earlier, Shintaro Mochizuki defeated Arthur Cazaux 6-4, 6-4 to earn his third tour-level win of the season. The 22-year-old is up three spots to No. 99 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and will hope to break the Top 100 for the first time. He will next play fourth seed Luciano Darderi.

Alex Michelsen snapped a five-match losing streak to reach the second round. The American, who had not won a match since Cincinnati in August, downed Beibit Zhukayev 6-2, 6-3 and will next meet Aleksandar Vukic.

""I am pleased with my level,"" Michelsen said. ""He is a dangerous player, has a big serve. I am super happy to get the win and super happy to be in Almaty for the first time.""

Fabian Marozsan sunk fifth seed Brandon Nakashima 7-6(5), 6-1 to reach his second tour-level quarter-final within a month. The 26-year-old is the first Hungarian to reach the last eight in tournament history and will meet second seed Daniil Medvedev or Adam Walton.






Jan-Lennard Struff also advanced, clawing past Mackenzie McDonald 2-6, 6-3, 6-4. The German struck 25 winners to improve to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against the American. Struff will next face top seed and defending champion Karen Khachanov. Frenchman Corentin Moutet eliminated home favourite Alexander Shevchenko 7-5, 6-3. Moutet was a semi-finalist last month in Hangzhou.

Naomi Osaka battled past defending champion Suzan Lamens in three sets to reach the Kinoshita Group Japan Open quarterfinals, but suffered an injury scare in the match's closing stages.

No. 1 seed Naomi Osaka came out on top of a 7-6(6), 3-6, 6-2 battle with defending champion Suzan Lamens to reach the Kinoshita Group Japan Open quarterfinals, but suffered an injury scare in the closing stages of the match that left her limping off court.

Osaka: Scores | Draws | Order of play

A high-quality contest had seen Osaka respond well to Lamens' challenge, raising her level to pull away from the surging Dutchwoman in the third set. But with Lamens serving down 5-0 but up 30-15, Osaka pulled up on her left leg. Lamens sprayed a backhand wide on that point, but won the next, and at 40-30 to Lamens, Osaka requested a medical time-out.

Returning to the court with her left thigh strapped and with her movement significantly hampered, a visibly distressed Osaka attempted to close the match out with first-strike tennis that bypassed extended rallies. She was unable to take two match points on her own serve at 5-1, double faulting on the first and netting a backhand on the second. However, she was able to get over the line on return, summoning up a backhand winner to convert her third match point.

""It was definitely really difficult -- I'm kind of sorry about my attitude,"" Osaka said in an on-court interview that had to be cut short due to her leg pain.

In press, Osaka was hopeful that she could continue in the tournament.

""I took Advils, so I think it feels better than what it is right now, but obviously it doesn't feel good,"" she said. ""I couldn't really move that well. It's not good, but I think I'm a fast healer so it should be OK for my next match.""

Prior to the injury, Osaka had managed to raise her level in key moments to take control of the contest. Both players took their time to fully settle -- Lamens lost the first eight points of the match, including consecutive double faults to open her first service game; Osaka then conceded nine straight points to go down a break. Lamens threw in an error-strewn game when attempting to serve the set out at 5-4, and at 5-5 in the ensuing tiebreak Osaka played her best point of the set to inch ahead.

Lamens swiftly put the disappointment behind her, finding her form with her lethal forehand to take the second set. At the start of the third, the 26-year-old seemed poised to pull away after winning the best point of the match, ending a 19-stroke lung-buster with a thumping forehand winner on the line. Osaka responded immediately. On the very next point, she came up with a hot shot of her own, ending a 12-stroke athletic exchange with a superb backhand angle.

""Emotionally, I was going through a lot in this match,"" Osaka said. ""And then in the third set I tried my best to have no regrets.""

Osaka is scheduled to face Jaqueline Cristian in the quarterfinals on Friday. The Romanian rebounded from a first-set whitewash to defeat No. 8 seed Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 0-6, 6-4, 6-2, avenging a first-round loss to the Spaniard in Beijing three weeks ago.

Hair journey update in Osaka ☺️

“This is a very weird video,” Osaka starts, laughing. “I've been really struggling with my hair for like the past two years. Like, during pregnancy and after pregnancy I lost my edges and stuff.“They're back now,” she adds proudly. “Well, kind of. Kind of! Don't look too closely. I also dyed my hair a lot, so I had to cut it off, blah, blah, blah. But I think it's back now.”According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, postpartum hair loss—known as telogen effluvium—is common after childbirth:“Postpartum hair thinning or hair loss… occurs when hormone levels drop back to their regular levels after childbirth… Postpartum hair loss usually ends about 6–12 months after giving birth. Most women see their hair returning to its normal thickness as their hormone levels stabilize.”Read More: Naomi Osaka opens up about body image struggles, pressure to “snap back” after giving birthOsaka welcomed her daughter Shai on July 7, 2023, after stepping away from tennis in late 2022.

Iconic Carlos Sainz onboards

With a short break between Singapore and Austin, how have the drivers been spending their time away from racing? Take a sneak peek into the life of the drivers off-grid...

As the drivers touch down in Austin ahead of a vibrant and action-packed Sprint weekend at the Circuit of The Americas, the energy is already building. After the heat and intensity of Singapore, the grid took a brief moment to recover, reset, and refill their cups before diving back into the climax of the season.

Some turned tourists, others headed straight to the sim (...or Mario Kart!). There were touching tributes, track time, and a few adventures – all of which helped the drivers to reset before the long run to the season's end in seven weeks time.

Some drivers took advantage of the week off after the Singapore Grand Prix to make the most of their time in Asia. Mercedes duo Kimi Antonelli and George Russell hopped over to Malaysia to swap their racing helmets for hard hats during a visit to the Petronas headquarters, while Lance Stroll headed to India to stop by Cognizant HQ and meet the team behind the scenes at Aston Martin's partner.

Soon-to-be Cadillac driver, and current Mercedes reserve, Valtteri Bottas popped up in South Korea and left with a spot-on caricature to remember his trip by, while Alex Albon squeezed in a whirlwind 24 hours in Thailand, soaking up the home comforts before jetting off to Austin to go racing again.

The love has been pouring in for Lewis Hamilton following the passing of his beloved companion – and superstar in his own right – Roscoe.

During the break, Hamilton received a special gift: a LEGO portrait of Roscoe. It's a fitting tribute, especially for someone who's been looking to grow his art collection – though it's hard to imagine any piece meaning more to him than this one.

A week off from F1 doesn't necessarily mean a week off racing – just ask Fernando Alonso. He spent the weekend karting, going back to one of the things that first got him behind the wheel. Karting is often a staple in the drivers' lives, and is the perfect opportunity to race, test themselves, and just enjoy driving without the pressure of the F1 paddock watching.

It's a trend familiar across the paddock: whether it's sim sessions, GT races, or just a bit of friendly karting with mates, many drivers use even a short break to chase the thrill of racing and keep their skills sharp.

Pierre Gasly ensured his week off was the perfect mix of work and play. He spent time in the gym and on the sim, logging laps and shifting weights to stay sharp before Austin.

But when it came to switching off, unsurprisingly his competitive streak didn't go far – swapping his steering wheel for a smaller controller to take on F1 25, a few rounds of Wii Sports golf, and even some Mario Kart action. After all, it's all about finding those extra gains… even if they come with a Wii remote in hand!

During the break, Liam Lawson and Nico Hulkenberg gave fans a glimpse of what they've been up to – and it was a little bit of everything. Travel shots, training moments, random adventures, and the occasional offbeat snapshot made up their photo dumps, a peek at the lighter and more unpredictable side of life away from the track.

A new pre-race opening show will debut at the upcoming United States Grand Prix in Austin.

The excitement of Formula 1 will begin before lights out thanks to a brand-new pre-race show, F1 Grid Gigs presented by American Express, with the first to take place at this weekend's United States Grand Prix.

A unique blend of music and motorsport, the new feature was inspired by the celebrated F1 75 Live season opener at London's The O2 arena, watched by an incredible 7.5 million viewers across F1's social channels.

Partnering with world renowned and locally relevant artists around the globe, F1 Grid Gigs will elevate the pre-race entertainment spectacle for fans in the stands and at home during the countdown to the cars heading out on track.

At Austin, widely regarded as the live music capital of the world, the inaugural show will embrace Texas' rich music heritage by giving the stage to local country singer and actor Drake Milligan.

Known for his chart-topping album Dallas/Fort Worth and hit songs 'Sounds Like Something I'd Do', 'Honky Tonkin' About' with The Reklaws, and 'I Got a Problem', Drake's distinct traditional country sound blended with his own unique modern flare, makes him one of the rising stars of country music.

In Austin, Drake's performance will mark the start of the race preparations, taking to the grid to entertain fans in the stands and at home, just before the drivers leave their garages to head out onto track.

F1 Grid Gigs presented by American Express will return at the 2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix, with a world-class artist performance in the City of Lights before the racing begins at the iconic Las Vegas Strip Circuit.

“There's nothing like the energy of a Formula 1 grid as the world gets ready for the best drivers to go head-to-head,” said Emily Prazer, Chief Commercial Officer at F1.

“F1 Grid Gigs presented by American Express will elevate one of the most anticipated moments of a Grand Prix weekend.

“This new pre-race show has been designed to capture and celebrate the thrill of the grid and give fans in the stands and at home a taste of adrenaline and exhilaration before we go racing.”

Drake Milligan added: “I'm thrilled to be performing at the Grand Prix in Austin, TX! There's nothing like the energy of this city during race weekend and I'm looking forward to being a part of it.

“It's the perfect stage for live music with the roar of the engines and the passion of the fans! I can't wait to bring some country heat to the Circuit of The Americas!”

Heading to the 2025 United States Grand Prix in Austin? Here's your guide to all things off-track in the Live Music Capital of the World, plus what to see, eat and do while you experience Formula 1 in true Texas style.

Few events capture the American spirit quite like the United States Grand Prix, where horsepower meets hospitality and racing is on a Texas-sized scale. From October 17-19, 2025, Austin will be the place to be as the Circuit of The Americas comes alive with the roar of Formula 1. The grandstands fill, the engines echo across the hills, and the city's live music and laid-back vibe turn race weekend into something unforgettable.

The US Grand Prix isn't just a race – it's a full-blown Austin-style celebration. Between the captivating on-track drama, the abundance of food trucks, fan zones, and concerts, there's always something happening. One minute you're watching cars fly through Turn 1, the next you're catching a band downtown or watching fireworks light up the skyline. It's fast, loud, and full of that easy Texas charm that keeps people coming back year after year.

Here are some relaxed ways to kick off your race weekend before heading to COTA for an action-packed day:

Stroll or paddle at Lady Bird Lake: Enjoy a peaceful walk along the waterfront trails or rent a kayak or paddleboard for a gentle start to the day. The calm water and skyline views make for a refreshing and photogenic morning.

Explore south or east Austin: Wander tree-lined streets, take in colourful murals, and browse local markets. These neighbourhoods offer a taste of Austin's culture and quirky personality, all at a leisurely pace.

Morning in a park or green space: Visit Zilker Park, Barton Creek Greenbelt, or other nearby parks for a nature-filled morning. Stretch your legs, take in some greenery, and enjoy a calm outdoor start before the crowds arrive at the circuit.

If you've arrived a day or two early, there's plenty to see and do in Austin without diving straight into race weekend chaos:

Cultural stops: Austin has a wealth of museums, galleries, and theatres. Explore the city's art, history, and cultural institutions to get a sense of its rich heritage — from fine art to Texan history.

Embrace the quirky side of Austin: For something truly offbeat, wander through some of the city's more unusual attractions such as the Cathedral of Junk, where art and creativity take unexpected forms.

Sports & recreation: Sports fans can soak up American college football culture by visiting the University of Texas campus. Even if you don't catch a game, the atmosphere and massive stadium are worth experiencing.

Outdoor adventures: Austin's parks and green spaces are perfect for low-energy or active pursuits. You can walk, swim, or enjoy water sports at places like Lady Bird Lake, Zilker Park, or Barton Creek Greenbelt. These areas offer a refreshing way to enjoy the outdoors and recharge before the race weekend.

Located about 15 miles southeast of downtown Austin, COTA is best reached with some planning ahead. Traffic can be heavy on race days, so allow extra time for your journey.

Driving and rideshare: Parking is available but must be pre-booked. Expect delays when entering and leaving the venue. Rideshare services drop passengers at designated zones near the track, though you may need to walk a short distance.

Shuttles and public transport: Event shuttles usually run from downtown Austin and other key areas. They are a convenient option and help you avoid the traffic around COTA. Check your ticket information or the official USGP website for shuttle routes and times.

Walking and accessibility: The circuit grounds are large and hilly, so wear comfortable shoes and dress for the weather. Accessible parking and mobility services are available, but should be arranged in advance.

Leaving the circuit: Crowds leaving COTA can cause delays after the race. Stay behind for a concert or enjoy a final lap of the Fanzone to let the traffic clear before heading out.

COTA's dramatic layout, steep elevation and open Texas landscape make it one of the most photogenic tracks on the F1 calendar.

Must-see corners and views: Turn 1 is one of the most iconic sights in Formula 1, with a steep climb and sharp left-hand turn that sets the tone for the lap. The esses between Turns 3 and 6 deliver high-speed action, while Turns 16 to 18 show cars sweeping through a fast triple apex. The Observation Tower provides a panoramic view of the entire circuit and is a must-visit for fans and photographers.

Top photo spots

Fanzone: The Fanzone sits at the heart of the Grand Plaza, with team appearances, driver interviews, interactive simulators, merchandise stalls and local food vendors. It is a great place to explore between sessions and take in the festival vibe.

Top fan hack: Best lighting hits just after 6.30pm when the sun drops low over the Texas hills. Visit the tower or Turn 1 for glowing evening shots. For emptier stands and cleaner photos, go during Friday practice.

Once the racing stops, Austin comes alive. The city's nightlife and live music scene make it one of the most entertaining Grand Prix destinations.

Concerts and entertainment: Major international artists perform on the Germania Insurance Amphitheater stage inside COTA, with access included in your ticket. Around town, smaller venues on Sixth Street, South Congress and the Red River District keep the energy going well into the night.

Downtown Austin: Explore the city's creative side with its murals, record shops, rooftop bars and craft breweries. South Congress Avenue is perfect for shopping and street food, while Rainey Street offers converted bungalows turned into buzzing bars.

Party down 6th Street: A vibrant array of bars, restaurants and entertainment venues, 6th Street is a sure bet for a captivating dining experience! There are a number of walking food tours and bar crawls available here so you can really get a taste of Austin!

Food trucks and BBQ: When the race is over, follow the smell of barbecue into town. Austin's food trucks serve everything from smoked brisket and tacos to fusion bites and craft desserts. Locals will tell you no visit is complete without trying Texas barbecue at least once.

Austin's culinary scene is as bold as its racing weekend.

Brisket and barbecue: Tender, slow-cooked meat with a rich smoky flavour and spicy sauce. Whether it's sliced brisket, ribs or pulled pork, barbecue is a must-try part of the Austin experience.

Tacos and Tex-Mex: Breakfast tacos are an Austin essential. Try them with eggs, cheese and jalapenos to start your race day right.

Craft beer: Local breweries like Austin Beerworks and Live Oak Brewing offer refreshing options after a day at the track.

Frozen margaritas: The city's unofficial drink. Perfect for cooling down after hours in the Texas sun.

Sweet treats: Cool off with homemade ice cream or a classic slice of pecan pie.

Experience live music: Austin is famous for its vibrant live music scene, featuring world renowned artists and independent artists alike. If you're staying in the city for a little longer before the Grand Prix weekend, be sure to check out the Austin City Limits music festival and experience the Austin live music scene at its best!

Bring a reusable water bottle: Temperatures in Austin can get hot (yes, even in October) and it's important to keep hydrated. There are plenty of places to refill around the city.

Embrace the unofficial siesta: Although Austin doesn't have an official siesta hour like in some parts of South America, residents implement their own unofficial one to keep out of the midday sun's scorching heat. You can still make the most out of your days in Austin by waking up and starting your day earlier, meaning you can explore the city in more comfortable temperatures.

Outwit the traffic: Like most major cities, Austin has the occasional traffic jam... Satellite navigation devices don't always accurately predict the correct arrival time, so ensure you leave 15/30 minutes earlier than you think you'll need to. If you don't want to rely on driving, join Austin's large cycling community and hop on a bike!

Barbecue is king: Austin is synonymous with barbecue, and with countless BBQ joints in town you will be spoiled for choice. You can even take food tours focused on this cultural staple. The famous eateries La Barbecue and Franklin Barbecue are fan favourites for this, but make sure to get there early to avoid a long wait in line!

From its iconic replica circuit sectors to the electric atmosphere that defines the weekend, the Circuit of The Americas has become one of the most beloved stops on the calendar.

When the Formula 1 circus arrives in Austin, it feels like it fits right in. The Texan capital doesn't need a Grand Prix to be lively – it's already a city full of character, music and energy – but the race weekend adds an extra edge to it all.

The United States Grand Prix has quickly become one of the most popular events on the calendar since its 2012 debut at the Circuit of The Americas (COTA), with a mix of top-class racing, atmosphere and a vibrant personality that the drivers embrace each year.

Ask around the paddock and there's an easy affection for this one. Perhaps it's the circuit layout, maybe it's the intoxicating crowd atmosphere, the vibrant city itself, or maybe it's the sense of humour that runs through the whole weekend — but something about this magical October weekend at COTA stands out. From cowboy hats to barbecue smoke, and a track that borrows the best bits of F1's greats, there's plenty to love about the sport's Texan stop.

If Monaco is all about tuxedos, elegance, and champagne, Austin is denim, fringe and cowboy hats so big they could double as parasols to shield from the intense Texas sun. It's become a bit of a ritual now, as drivers and teams fully lean into the Texas theme with special liveries and helmets, team kit, and merchandise. And frankly, who doesn't love dressing up for an exciting occasion? Enter: Daniel Ricciardo .

Honorary Texan Ricciardo set the standard a number of times, especially in 2022 when he rode into the paddock on horseback, dressed head to toe in authentic cowboy gear. “When in Texas,” he grinned. His steed, of course, was nicknamed Horsey McHorse.

Five-time COTA winner Lewis Hamilton has gone full Western more than once, arriving in unique embroidered shirts and sharp cowboy hats that look like they were tailored for him. Even Max Verstappen has joined in for media events, and when pit crews show up in flannel shirts and bolo ties, it's clear everyone in the paddock is embracing life in the Lone Star State.

The dressing up isn't just a gimmick. It reflects the whole weekend's easy-going, slightly mischievous energy. The paddock feels more relaxed, the music's louder, the smiles wider, and drivers often talk about how much they enjoy the unique atmosphere at COTA.

1 / 5

Even Max Verstappen leans into the Austin fever - swipe for more 

Formula 1 might have taken its time to find a proper home in the United States, but motor racing dates back to before the first F1 World Championship race was even devised. From dirt ovals and drag strips to the Indianapolis 500 and Daytona, motorsport runs deep here.

Despite only opening in 2012, it is clear that COTA carries that heritage proudly. It's hosted MotoGP, NASCAR, endurance racing, and even rallycross. For drivers, that gives the weekend extra weight – it gives the feeling that this is a place where GP winners become legends amongst American motorsporting royalty.

And the fans at COTA? Oh well – they're loud, they're knowledgeable and they are absolutely fully invested. You'll see rosso corsa, papaya and all shades of blue side by side with stars and stripes in the stands. They cheer everyone, they stay until the end, and they make sure the drivers know they're appreciated and admired. F1 might have arrived relatively late to the party, but now it's very much the life and soul of it.

1 / 2

Charles Leclerc entered himself into the American motorsport Hall of Fame with his emphatic COTA victory in 2024

Ask any driver what they like about COTA and they'll probably start with the circuit characteristics. Hermann Tilke designed it as a sort of “best of” collection from F1's greatest corners.

Turn 1 is pure magic – a steep, blind, uphill left-hander that rewards commitment. Drivers often say it's one of the most dramatic opening corners in the sport, with a 40-metre climb that makes the start of each race spectacular as the grid fans out into the braking zone.

What follows is a sequence of high-speed Esses inspired by Silverstone's Maggotts and Becketts, before the rhythm changes through a flowing middle sector. The long back straight echoes Shanghai, while the fast, multi-apex Turn 17 complex nods to Istanbul Park's infamous Turn 8.

It's a circuit that demands precision and bravery in equal measure. As three-time winner Max Verstappen has said: “The COTA track is very special, it's a new track but with a lot of old school corners in it (but with more run off), which makes it really cool to drive. Turn 1 has such a big radius it gives a lot of overtaking opportunities, and then the whole of the first sector has the Esses, it's a bit like Silverstone or Suzuka. It is a really fun circuit to race.”

Aside from the race, there's Austin itself. It's hard to think of another host city quite like it – laid-back but lively, creative but easy-going, and all with a genuine warmth that visitors instantly pick up on.

During Grand Prix week, the city is abuzz. South Congress is full of fans queuing for incredible street food such as tacos or brisket sandwiches, and the bars on Sixth Street spill over with live music and downtown becomes one big street party.

Drivers often want to hang around the city a little longer when they arrive for race weekend. It's the perfect opportunity to wander around the city, grab coffee, ride scooters by Lady Bird Lake, or sneak into a gig. It's a place that invites people to relax a little... even uptight Formula 1 drivers!

Beyond the vibrant nightlife, the breathtaking Texas Hill Country offers stunning cycling and running routes and quiet roads. The city's “Keep Austin Weird” slogan might sound a little tongue-in-cheek, but we reckon it captures the spirit of the weekend perfectly!

COTA might have to share the US stage with Miami and Las Vegas these days, but it remains the cornerstone of F1 in America. With its perfect blend of European racing tradition and American showmanship, it just worked.

Each autumn, as the grid lines up and the grandstands come alive, it reminds us how COTA has earned its place among the modern classics and makes us fall in love with this special race all over again.

With Mercedes confirming George Russell and Kimi Antonelli for 2026, Lawrence Barretto explains whether the squad's line-up is set for the long term.

On the eve of the United States Grand Prix weekend in Austin, Mercedes have confirmed what most had expected – George Russell and Kimi Antonelli will form their line-up for 2026. F1 Correspondent Lawrence Barretto explains more...

Fresh from one of the most convincing wins of his career last time out in Singapore, Russell can stroll into the Austin paddock tomorrow knowing that after months of negotiating, he's all sorted for a drive for next year.

Once Max Verstappen became unavailable, when he confirmed he'd be staying put at Red Bull for 2026, it was always a case of when, not if, Russell would sign on the dotted line to extend his stay at Mercedes that began in 2022.

Pirelli have confirmed the tyre compounds that will be in use across the United States Grand Prix weekend.

Formula 1 rolls on to Austin's Circuit of The Americas (COTA) for the United States Grand Prix this weekend, with tyre supplier Pirelli confirming the compounds that will be in play.

It is the second Grand Prix of the season where Pirelli are bringing three non-consecutive compounds (the last being Spa-Francorchamps), and the available tyres will again be the C1 as the hard, the C3 as the medium and the C4 as the soft.

With the Sprint format in play this weekend, drivers will be given 12 sets of tyres rather than the usual 13. Each will receive two sets of the hard, four sets of the medium and six sets of soft, as well as five sets of intermediates and two sets of wets.

“In Belgium, bad weather meant it was not possible to find out how this choice might have affected strategy and so the event in COTA could be the first real test of this choice, which sees the use of a harder hard than last year at the American track, while the medium and soft are the same,” reads Pirelli's event preview.

“The increased performance difference between the hardest compound and the middle one should, theoretically, give rise to two scenarios.

“If drivers prefer the C1, the slowest but also the most consistent of the three, then they could run a one-stop race combining it with the C3. On the other hand, using the latter along with the C4, with its improved resistance to degradation, would produce quicker lap times but would almost certainly require two stops.

“Another similarity with the Belgian round is that Austin is also running to the Sprint format, which means teams only have one hour to try the various options over long and short runs, which could add to the uncertainty as to how the weekend might pan out.”

A step between tyre compounds will add another element to the mix for drivers and teams at the upcoming United States and Mexico City Grands Prix.

Pirelli Director of Motorsport Mario Isola has explained the thinking behind the manufacturer's split tyre compound choices for the next two rounds of the season in the United States and Mexico, with the move aimed at mixing up race strategies.

Austin is the second venue that Pirelli are bringing non-consecutive compounds to this season (the last being Spa-Francorchamps for the Belgian Grand Prix), and the available tyres will again be the C1 as the hard, the C3 as the medium and the C4 as the soft.

A week later in Mexico City, the Italian supplier will provide the C2 as the hard, the C4 as the medium and the C5 as the soft, given the different characteristics and demands of the Circuit of The Americas and the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.

It compares to the traditional method of Pirelli picking three consecutive compounds out of their slick-tyre range: in 2025, from hardest to softest, that being the C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 and C6.

Speaking after those choices were confirmed, Isola opened up on Pirelli's goals with the step approach and what was learned from the first test in Belgium – even if adverse weather conditions impacted the weekend.

“It's difficult to come to a conclusion for Spa where we had the weather that was not helping at all, but I believe the idea was good, and that's why we decided to have the same approach for Texas and Mexico where we skip a compound between hard and medium,” said Isola.

“Basically, the target is always the same: to have a variation in strategies and to have teams planning a one-stop or two-stop, so different approaches to the race.

“We made some simulations, and we believe that creating a bigger gap between the hard and the medium means that if one team wants to use the hard and target a one-stop race, they are penalised by a slower tyre. While if a team wants to be aggressive, and that means moving to a two-stop strategy, at that time you can use the medium and the soft that are faster.

“So, this is the approach, and for Mexico and Austin we believe we can try this solution again.”

Elaborating on that belief, and why Austin and Mexico City were chosen as the next two events with a jump in compounds, Isola continued: “Because of the simulation we were running with our modelling department that is telling us the two-stop strategy is slightly quicker than the one-stop.

""Usually, if you have a one-stop and two-stop that are very close in terms of total race time, the teams choose a one-stop. They don't want to take a risk of an additional pit stop, traffic or a mistake during the stop, so they move in a natural way towards a one-stop race.

“That means in Mexico and Texas we have a simulation telling us the two-stop is a few seconds quicker.”

First practice for the United States Grand Prix, which features the Sprint format, will get under way at 1230 local time on Friday.

Promise, the AI studio backed by Google, Peter Chernin's North Road and Michael Ovitz's Crossbeam, is launching The Generation Company, led by Nem Perez, to bring visual effects to traditional studios.

Senior Editor


	An AI entertainment studio backed by the likes of Google, Andreessen Horowitz, Peter Chernin's North Road Company and Michael Ovitz's Crossbeam wants to bring its generative AI expertise to traditional studios and production companies.


Promise, led by Fullscreen founder George Strompolos, former YouTube executive Jamie Byrne, who most recently led creator partnerships for YouTube; and AI filmmaker Dave Clark, is launching a new division called The Generation Company, which will work with outside studios and production companies to deliver visual effects and sequences created with its tech.

	The Generation Company will be led by filmmaker and generative AI artist Nem Perez, who previously founded the virtual production and AI workflow company Storyblocker, and also directed music videos for the likes of Mac Miller, Nipsey Hussle, and Chance the Rapper.

	“With The Generation Company, Promise is bringing our GenAI filmmaking expertise to partners as a true creative ally, helping them achieve their vision and push ideas beyond the limits of traditional resources, timelines, and budgets,” said Byrne, the co-founder, president and COO of Promise. “Nem is a pioneer in applying GenAI to filmmaking, building on a career leading creative teams across entertainment, advertising, and music. His work with some of the world's top GenAI artists makes him uniquely positioned to help storytellers navigate this new frontier with both artistry and precision.”

	











	“I believe GenAI exists to serve the artist, opening the door to cinematic moments that might otherwise be impossible,” adds Perez, head of The Generation Company. “For me, it's about honoring the craft I've devoted my career to while embracing new tools that expand what's possible on screen. With human expression driving everything we do, filmmakers and creative partners who work with The Generation Company can bring their full vision to life on their own terms.”


	In addition to VFX and sequences, the company will also provide a team of AI specialists meant to advise creative departments like art, costume, props, and storyboarding.


	Promise was founded last year with the goal of building out a slate of films and series using generative AI tech. Earlier this year it raised more money, with Google and Crossbeam joining its list of investors, while also making its first acquisition: The tech-centric film school Curious Refuge, which teaches filmmakers how ton utilize advanced technology in their workflows.


	The Generation Company expands Promise's business further into the services world, seeking a piece of the production puzzle that has been most disrupted by technology, as studios seek more realistic and elaborate VFX while also seeking to manage costs.

Tuesday night saw each celebrity perform a special tribute dance, with contestants choosing to honor their parents, siblings, former co-stars, romantic partners and children.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



[This story contains spoilers from episode five of Dancing With the Stars season 34.]


	It was an emotional night in the Dancing With the Stars ballroom for Dedication Night, and to make the night even sweeter, no one was eliminated from the competition at the end of the episode.




	Each celebrity performed a special tribute dance to honor of someone in their life, delivering 10 emotional routines in honor of the cast's parents, siblings, former co-stars, romantic partners and children. (Read who the professional dancers would dedicate their own number to here.)

	Former professional dancer Kym Herjavec also returned to the ballroom, serving as the first official guest judge of the season.


	Finishing out the fifth week of season 34, the cast is noticeably dwindling down. Hilaria Baldwin was eliminated at the end of last week's Disney Night, making her the fourth contestant to exit the competition. No one was eliminated at the end of Dedication Night, meaning the remaining cast composed of 10 couples all moved onto the sixth week of competition.


	The remaining celebrities include Secret Lives of Mormon Wives stars Jen Affleck and Whitney Leavitt, Olympian Jordan Chiles, social media star Alix Earle, The Traitors season three winner (and Zac Efron's brother) Dylan Efron, actresses Danielle Fishel and Elaine Hendrix, Pentatonix's Scott Hoying, conservationist (and son of Steve Irwin) Robert Irwin and comedian-actor Andy Richter.

	











	Richter kicked off the night with an adorable salsa alongside his daughter. One of the most highly anticipated numbers of Dedication Night was Irwin's contemporary to Phil Collins' “You'll Be in My Heart,” which he devoted to his mother, Terri Irwin. And it proved to be a memorable one, as he earned his first three nines of the season, ending with a total score of 35/40 (after sending the entire ballroom into tears).


	Fishel dedicated her jive set to the Boy Meets World theme song to her former co-star William Daniels, also known as Mr. Feeny on the series. The performance landed the actress her first eight of the competition.


	Leavitt emerged as an early frontrunner during the first half of the competition, placing as the top-scoring couple for four consecutive episodes. Disney Night was the first time she and Mark Ballas pulled ahead as the only couple to place at the top of the leaderboard, and they notably earned the season's first nine. 


	However, Efron ended her top-scoring streak on Dedication Night, becoming the first celebrity to earn four nines, one from each of the judges. The Traitors winner performed his dance in honor of his little sister set to the tune of his elder brother, Zac, and Zendaya's song “Rewrite the Stars.” Trailing close behind Efron were Irwin and Earle, who both respectively scored 35/40 points.


	At the end of (most) nights of the competition, the couple with the lowest combined total of judges' scores and viewer votes is eliminated. Live voting takes place during the East Coast airing of each show and ends shortly after the final dance is completed.

	











	See the full list of scores for week five of DWTS season 34 (aka Dedication Night) below. 


	Andy Richter and Emma Slater: 24/40Robert Irwin and Witney Carson: 35/40Elaine Hendrix and Alan Bersten: 30/40Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas: 33/40Jen Affleck and Jan Ravnik: 29/40Dylan Efron and Daniella Karagach: 36/40Jordan Chiles and Ezra Sosa: 32/40Scott Hoying and Rylee Arnold: 30/40Danielle Fishel and Pasha Pashkov: 29/40Alix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy: 35/40


	Season 34 of DWTS airs and streams simultaneously on ABC and Disney+ on Tuesdays, with new episodes available to stream on Wednesdays on Hulu.

The star who retired from acting in 2017 spoke at a packed Screen Talk at the BFI London Film Festival, where he was joined by his director son Ronan.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Daniel Day-Lewis was back in the London spotlight for the first time in years on Wednesday, appearing at a jam-packed Screen Talk as part of the 69th edition of the BFI London Film Festival (LFF) where he was welcomed with a rousing ovation after signing autographs for fans before the event.


	Discussing his return to acting after eight years in family drama Anemone, directed by his son Ronan Day-Lewis, and his career, the three-time Oscar winner shared: “It began with a pure wish really to work with Ronan” to address the “sadness” of maybe not getting to do so in film otherwise. He described the film as an exploration of brotherhood and the reuniting of estranged siblings.

	“The lack of need for words” is what interested him, and understanding his character's army career trajectory was key for him to unlock the character, who is chasing his brother, and his behavior.


Anemone follows a middle-aged man, portrayed by Sean Bean, on his journey into the woods, where he reconnects with his estranged hermit brother, played by Day-Lewis. Samantha Morton also stars in the movie. Day-Lewis previously shared that he had “certain reservations about being back in the public world again” by starring in the film, but that his son “made it pretty clear that he wasn't going to do it if I didn't do it.”

	











	The project from Focus Features had its world premiere at the New York Film Festival. The movie is the feature directorial debut of Ronan Day-Lewis and was co-written by him and his father.


	In a wide-ranging discussion, the star was asked on Wednesday about how he has gotten into the physicality of many of his roles, such as My Left Foot. He eased into that one with “very gentle steps,” he shared. “I thought of the wheelchair as a cage … and I began to work a lot with my foot.”


	Asked about his approach to acting, Day-Lewis said that immersion “to me makes sense,” but other actors can do great work without that, “and hats off to them.” He emphasized that “I still find that process a joyful thing. We're playing games for a living.”


	The star also argued that criticism of method acting in recent years has at times been portrayed like a cult, saying such comments often come from people who don't really understand it. “It is invariably from people that have little or no understanding of what it actually involves,” Day-Lewis said. “It's almost like some special science that we're involved in, or a cult, but it's just a way of freeing yourself [for] the spontaneity when you are working with your colleagues in front of the camera, so that you are free to respond in any way that you're moved to in that moment.”


	The star emphasized that he came into My Left Foot without the screen experience he could have used. ”I was clueless,” he said, drawing laughter. “I didn't have a fucking clue what I was doing.”

	











	Back when he went to acting school, theater was considered the “elite cultural form,” while film was seen as “dodgy,” and TV got the reaction of “really?!” he recalled. “It always bugged the hell out of me that we were basically performing for a group of privileged people,” he said about his feelings towards such attitudes.


	To more laughs, he shared how “Stephen Frears was exasperated with me,” because Day-Lewis always needs something “real” to be able to stay in the illusion and in the sphere of acting. For example, he would, in a role, stop sweeping the floor once it was clean, to the director's frustration, Day-Lewis said.


	Asked about his long creative relationship with Jim Sheridan, he shared: “I met Jim, and I basically had a crush on him within 10 minutes.”


	He also mentioned on Wednesday how he “revered Marlon Brando,” among other actors. And he shared: “I had a crush on Mary Poppins. Julie Andrews, I mean,” he also shared. That and Zulu were two of his favorite films when he was young.


	The role that changed his life when he viewed it was Dai Bradley in Kes. “It remains one of the greatest performances,” he said before expressing hos “admiration for Ken Loach.”


	The star also discussed working with writer-director Rebecca Miller, now his wife, on The Ballad of Jack and Rose and now his son. “There was never any question about … a conflict of interest” between family and work roles in both cases, he concluded. Both movies were “experiences that people will remember happily,” he said.

	











	Ronan Day-Lewis joined the on-stage discussion for the final 20 minutes, sharing that the shoot for Anemone, much of which takes place in a shed, was “claustrophobic” but also “incredibly intimate.”


	The two wrote the script together, with Day-Lewis senior mentioning that he can't really type. But his son also saw another benefit of working with his father, explaining the familial collaboration this way: ”It takes the edge off because you know they will give you the benefit of the doubt,” as long as you have a good relationship. Added his father: “It was a joyful experience to have this time together.”


	Ronan Day-Lewis highlighted how David Lynch has influenced him and how he shared with the legendary filmmaker the interest in “exploring darkness” without “existing in darkness.”


	Asked about funny moments in Anemone, his father said, among other things, that he found the idea of ”shitting on a priest” that is mentioned in one scene really “hilarious.”


	Daniel Day-Lewis recently admitted he regretted announcing his retirement following his role in Paul Thomas Anderson's 2017 film Phantom Thread. “Looking back on it now — I would have done well to just keep my mouth shut, for sure,” he told Rolling Stone. “It just seems like such grandiose gibberish to talk about. I never intended to retire, really. I just stopped doing that particular type of work so I could do some other work.”


	The star also shared final words of advice for young actors on Wednesday, before a farewell standing ovation. “A lot of young actors, especially if they're lucky enough – when you get chances, people want to keep coming for you. They keep looking for you as long as the money's coming in,” Day-Lewis said. “And so it takes a certain steadiness in yourself to say, ‘No, I need to just do this the only way I know how.' And I did just do it the only way I knew how.”

Moriarty will succeed Kevin Lansberry, who is retiring after 39 years with the company.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	The Walt Disney Co. is making a significant change in the C-suite of its experiences division, which oversees the company's theme parks, cruise line and consumer products businesses.


	Kevin Lansberry, the CFO of Disney Experiences, will be retiring after 39 years with the company in February. Michael Moriarty, currently President and managing director of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, will succeed him as executive VP and CFO of the division, which is led by chairman Josh D'Amaro.




	“Michael Moriarty brings a deep understanding of our long-term strategy to broaden the reach and impact of Disney Experiences,” said D'Amaro in a statement. “His global perspective and leadership will help guide us through an exciting chapter of growth, reaching new fans in new places and on new platforms.” 

	











	Before leading Hong Kong Disneyland, Moriarty was CFO of that theme park, and also worked as CFO at Walt Disney Imagineering, and in senior finance roles at Walt Disney World. The company will name his successor at Hong Kong Disneyland at a later date.


	Lansberry, meanwhile, served in a wide array of roles at the company during his career, including a stint as interim CFO of Disney after the exit of Christine McCarthy in 2023. Hugh Johnston joined Disney later that year as its permanent CEO, at which point Lansberry returned to the Experiences division.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	The Bosch universe at Amazon continues to expand with a prequel series for MGM+, Bosch: Start of Watch, starring Cameron Monaghan (Shameless) and Omari Hardwick (Power). The premium linear channel and streaming service has greenlighted the offshoot which explores the origin story of Michael Connelly's detective Harry Bosch, portrayed by Titus Welliver on the original Bosch series and its sequel Bosch: Legacy. 


	Monaghan will take over the role, playing rookie cop Harry Bosch, with Hardwick portraying his training officer, police veteran Eli Bridges, a new character not in the book mythology. There is no direct source material for Start of Watch since Connelly's novels do not include a Bosch prequel, though bits and pieces from Harry's early years are planted in various books in the universe, with Connelly calling the prequel “uncharted character territory.”

Bosch: Start of Watch, from MGM+ Studios, goes back to 1991 Los Angeles and follows 26-year-old Harry Bosch (Monaghan) during his earliest days as a rookie cop. The series will explore a city on the edge, teeming with racial tension, gang violence, and a fractured LAPD. Amid routine calls and growing unrest, Bosch finds himself drawn into a high-profile heist and a web of criminal corruption that will test his loyalty to the badge and shape his future as the detective who lives by the code, “Everybody counts or nobody counts.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Produced by Fabel Entertainment, the series is co-created and executive produced by Bosch: Legacy co-developer/executive producer Tom Bernardo and Legacy co-executive producer Brian Anthony, with Bernardo serving as showrunner. Connelly, Henrik Bastin, Jamie Boscardin Martin, and Jasmine Russ also serve as executive producers. Theresa Snider co-executive produces for Hieronymus Pictures. Seth Yanklewitz is the casting director.

	











	Like all previous series in the franchise, Bosch, Bosch: Legacy and spinoff Ballard starring Maggie Q, which was just renewed for Season 2 by Prime Video, Bosch: Start of Watch will film in Los Angeles where the books are set. The prequel recently received a tax credit from the California Film Commission alongside Ballard S2. Submitted as “Project 2997 S1,” Start of Watch landed $11.6M credit on $33.2M qualified local expenditures.


	“We are thrilled to expand the Bosch universe with this compelling origin story that showcases how one of television's most beloved detectives became the man we know today,” said Michael Wright, head of MGM+. “With Cameron Monaghan and Omari Hardwick bringing these complex characters to life, and the creative vision of Michael Connelly and our talented executive producers, Bosch: Start of Watch promises to deliver the gritty, authentic storytelling that honors the franchise's legacy while opening an exciting new chapter.”


	This marks the fourth series in the Bosch franchise and third centered on Harry Bosch. All three originated on different Amazon platforms. The mothership Bosch, the longest running series on Prime Video, released seven seasons on the flagship streamer. Sequel Bosch: Legacy, which ran for three seasons, started on Amazon Freevee before migrating to Prime Video. Bosch: Start of Watch is headed to MGM+.


	“I'm deeply grateful to Michael Wright and the team at MGM+ for championing this next chapter in Bosch's journey with such remarkable care and integrity,” Connelly said. “Being able to see how Harry Bosch became the man we have loved for 10 seasons is a gift to me and his many fans. I can't wait to dig in with Cameron and the writers to explore this uncharted character territory.”


	In Start of Watch, Harry Bosch (Monaghan), a intensely observant, stoic and unyielding young man, is a probationary patrol officer with the LAPD. He possesses all the qualities that will come to mark his legendary career: he's smart, relentless, determined, fiercely protective of the victims of crime.


	Training Officer Bridges (Hardwick) is a Vietnam vet, a seasoned, salty, rough-around-the-edges kind of cop who mentors Harry through the mean streets of Los Angeles and the complicated world of the LAPD. Bridges is fighting a war on the streets and looking for soldiers, and they don't come any brighter than Hieronymus Bosch.


	“It's a terrific privilege to be able to explore both the origins of this iconic character and the Los Angeles that formed him in the early 1990s,” Bernardo said. “In telling the story of a young Harry Bosch, we want to honor the faith of Michael Connelly's legion of readers and the amazing audience that tuned into Bosch and Bosch: Legacy over the years. We're excited to embark on this journey.”


	In taking the prequel series route, Bosch follows in the footsteps of such crime dramas as CBS' NCIS (with NCIS: Origins) and Showtime's Dexter (with Dexter: Original Sin). 


	Bastin called the opportunity to film Bosch: Start of Watch in Los Angeles “a rare privilege these days.”


	“By filming in LA, we'll be able to tap into the best creative talent this industry has to offer — and in doing so deliver a story about Harry Bosch that fans have longed for,” he said. “Thanks to MGM+ for giving us the resources to make it happen, and to the California Tax Credit for bringing business back to LA!”


Bosch: Start of Watch, part of MGM+'s programming focus on classic Hollywood storytelling for a modern audience, will be available on the platform in the U.S., UK, Italy, Germany, Spain, Latin America, Belgium, and the Netherlands.

	











	Monaghan is probably best known for his decade-long portrayal of Ian Gallagher on Showtime's popular series Shameless, which earned him a Critics Choice Award nomination. He also played the Valeska twins on Fox's Gotham. In features, he is currently seen in Tron: Ares. Monaghan is repped by UTA, Amplified, and Goodman Genow Schenkman, Smelkinson & Christopher. . 


	Hardwick is known for his starring role as James “Ghost” St. Patrick on Starz's hit series Power and for portraying Vanderohe in Zack Snyder's Army of the Dead. He recently starred opposite Michelle Yeoh in Paramount+'s Star Trek: Section 31. Hardwick is repped by UTA and Sloane, Offer, Weber, and Dern


	Bernardo, a Bosch franchise veteran who worked on the mothership series before segueing to Legacy and also did a stint on Netflix's Lincoln Lawyer, is repped by Verve and Hansen Jacobson Teller.

Staff Writer


Ego Nwodim has landed her first show following her exit from Saturday Night Live.


	The stand-up comedian will perform at Lincoln Center Theater's Claire Tow Theater in New York City. The show will run from November 19 through November 23, with tickets going on sale on October 20 at 10 a.m. ET.


	Nwodim's show will be part of The Comedy Series programming, which will also feature Vir Das, Jerrod Carmichael, and Sam Jay. The series is described as “a chance for these artists to test boundaries, shape new material, and explore the space between humor and truth.”


	“No two performances will be the same—because the creative process isn't a straight line, and neither is this show. It's comedy that's evolving before your eyes,” reads the press release.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Although Nwodim was expected to return to SNL Season 51, she announced her exit from the NBC late-night show after being part of the cast for seven seasons.

	“The hardest part of a great party is knowing when to say goodnight,” she wrote in an Instagram post confirming her departure. “But after seven unforgettable seasons, I have decided to leave SNL. I am immensely grateful to Lorne [Michaels] for the opportunity, to my castmates, the writers, and the crew for their brilliance, support, and friendship. Week after week on that stage taught me more than I could have ever imagined, and I will carry those memories, and that laughter, with me always.”

I've been excited to see what she does next. I hope she gets the lead in a series or movie soon.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Cult Of Criterion: Altered States","https://www.avclub.com/cult-of-criterion-altered-states","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

In Cult Of Criterion, The A.V. Club highlights a new release from The Criterion Collection each month, examining the films entering an increasingly accessible film canon.

When I started this column a year ago, I wanted to follow in the footsteps of some of my A.V. Club predecessors who helped highlight smaller, odder films that deserve to be remembered by those dipping their toes into cinephilia. At the same time, the series is an acknowledgement of The Criterion Collection (and its streaming service The Criterion Channel) as a modern establishment, one with the same kind of inviting, taken-with-a-grain-of-salt curation as some of the form's long-standing guide texts—the Sight & Sound polls or 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die or Roger Ebert's Great Movies or A Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies—and the same kind of surprising strangeness you might once have found browsing a video store's shelves, steered solely by vibes. Those films that split the difference between the canonized and the cuckoo are special. One of them, Masahiro Shinoda's Demon Pond, kicked off Cult Of Criterion last October. Now another, Ken Russell's Altered States, rings in its anniversary.

At first blush, the British oddball's first Hollywood film offers a wealth of respectable bonafides. William Hurt plays the lead in his debut role, fresh from the post-Juilliard stage. Paddy Chayefsky, one of the few screenwriters some people actually know by name, adapted his own novel for the script (before taking his name off the project). John Corigliano, who had just won a Guggenheim fellowship, was nominated for an Oscar for his first film score. Warner Bros. put the film out into theaters on Christmas. And yet, thanks to Russell—whose baroque work includes The Devils and The Lair Of The White Worm—it's all in service of a complete head trip, a seriously unserious turn-of-the-'80s reckoning with the countercultural self-experimentation of psychonauts like John C. Lilly. 

This contradiction is echoed in the text of the film: A tenured Harvard psychopathologist's woo-woo tendencies are brushed off by those who can't help but acknowledge his brilliance. For every blistering diatribe about truth and God, sometimes in the middle of a sex scene, there is a ridiculously brash image that pierces its academic veneer, like a seven-eyed goat Christ or a trippy tea-time. As the professor finds himself drawn again and again towards hallucinating in a sensory deprivation tank, his mind—and, eventually, body—unravels away from his colleagues and loved ones.

The subsequent sci-fi body horror, courtesy of makeup wizard Dick Smith and Chayefsky's earnest script, is a bit like Russell doing David Cronenberg. Released just one month before Scanners, Altered States is similarly devoted to dry, institutional dweebs justifying their doomed, id-driven experiments with endless jargon until the façade bursts and wet, goopy truth breaks free.

But even removed from the era-specific observations around trendy, intellectualized drug use, Altered States contains unflattering universal truths. One doesn't have to be well-versed in the history of psilocybin—appropriated in America after a couple enthusiasts convinced an Indigenous Mexican shaman to let them participate in a traditional religious ceremony, then blew up her spot in Life magazine—to appreciate the plot points and arcs typical to white guys with no real problems ruining their lives. 

The passions of Eddie Jessup (Hurt) are balanced by two excellent colleagues—Bob Balaban as his moony tripsitter and Charles Haid as his frustrated Southern naysayer—and his hyper-rational anthropologist wife (Blair Brown), all sticking by his side despite his diminishing grasp on reality. Decades later, the film evokes the contemporary, myopic, smug self-assurance of alternative medicine types, of supplement grifters, of ayahuasca ceremonies turned into tourist traps. In Altered States‘ Eddie, one sees a familiar kind of man: A man fleeing the world in front of him, and, to save his ego, reframing this retreat as a pursuit, one of a greater wisdom that exists outside of convention. This is Aaron Rodgers if he took so many drugs that he monkeyfied himself.

Yes, Eddie's physical reversion into a more primate-like form is just one ridiculous element of a film that takes what initially seems like a one-sided, Prince Of Darkness-like battle between science and religion, and turns it into a silly-sweet episode of The X-Files where a goofy creature runs amok and love saves the day. It's also not the only nutty prosthetic Smith crafts for Altered States. In any given frame, Eddie could look totally normal, like a Geico caveman, or like the worm-headed Bib Fortuna from Star Wars (you know, the guy who's coworkers with Salacious Crumb).

These are just the most physical ways that Russell manifests the hopes and fears of a generation of mind-expanders. In garish montages, Russell sticks his protagonist in a Peter Gabriel music video, obliterates his body like one of Pompeii's ash-frozen corpses, and torments him with silent-movie visions of epic religious horrors. More abstract are the colorful explosions that resemble both stars and cells, vibrating with the fervor of French documentarian Jean Painlevé.

This description may lead one to believe that Altered States is a movie that naturally welcomes a high viewing experience. But I cannot emphasize enough how little this movie made me want to do drugs. Russell's film is a series of bad trips burned from the brain onto celluloid—it is a panicky, out-of-control, irrational subconscious attacking the thinking brain in every frame. These are the just deserts earned by Eddie's ravenous, avoidant appetite for discovery. 

What really matters for Eddie, in the end, is what he's been running from all along: His family, his friends, and simple human love. It's completely cheesy, or at least it would be if not for the vital, personal danger injected into this lesson by Russell and Chayefsky. This collision between two opposing auteurs (who, by all accounts, despised each other) still boasted a shared villain, normalcy, that it fought with a shared weapon, professional obsession. Altered States‘ conclusion, sincere and relatable compared to the heightened mania leading up to it, is one of acceptance. As bizarre as the film gets, and as outré as its filmmaker and main character like to think of themselves as, the undeniable revelation sought by its fringe-dweller is the same as the one found in hackneyed romances—sometimes you just need to turn yourself into the universe's throbbing fetus before you realize that we find our answers in each other.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Daniel Day-Lewis insists Method acting isn't a ""cult,"" says critics just don't get it","https://www.avclub.com/daniel-day-lewis-method-acting-criticism-cult-anemone","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 15:34:39 GMT","

Famed Method actor Daniel Day-Lewis doesn't think the technique deserves the bad rap it's gotten over the past few years. He also swears he's not in a cult. (Hear that, Brian Cox?) “All the recent commentary in the last few years about Method acting is invariably from people who have little or no understanding of what it actually involves,” the Oscar winner said during a conversation at the BFI London Film Festival, per Variety. “It's almost as if it's some specious science that we're involved in, or a cult. But it's just a way of freeing yourself so that the spontaneity, when you are working with your colleagues in front of the camera, that you are free to respond in any way that you'll move to in that moment.”

However you feel about the immersive, somewhat controversial technique, it's clearly worked for Day-Lewis. He's won three Best Actor Oscars throughout his career (for My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood, and Lincoln) and has been nominated for three more. Some such as actor David Harbour have even held him up as a rare exception to their personal philosophy that Method acting is mostly just madness. To Day-Lewis, on the other hand, it's really quite simple. “It's very easy to describe what I do as if I'm out of my mind. Plenty of people have been happy to do that, but it just makes sense to me,” he said. “You have an obligation to try to understand as far as you're humanly able to what it feels like to be inside of that experience.” The actor also pushed back against the claim that immersing yourself in a role means “you're sealed off from experiencing” your own life. It actually means “you're in a self-contained experience of your own,” he said. “But really, if you've done your work, you should be free to accept whatever passes through you.” 

The acclaimed actor recently ended his “retirement” to co-write and star in his son Ronan Day-Lewis' directorial debut, Anemone. In the film, he “unsurprisingly… delivers every line with masterful, lived-in magnetism,” as Luke Hicks wrote in his review of the surreal project for The A.V. Club. Ronan had never experienced his father's techniques from behind the camera before, but backed up his claim that immersion in a character doesn't mean you're fully cut off from the reality of the world around you. In a recent interview with The A.V. Club, the younger Day-Lewis said he wasn't expecting how “collaborative [Daniel] was able to be on set, despite how fully enmeshed in his character he was.” He added, “That was amazing to see and very reassuring early on in the shoot.”

It was a heartwarming and unforgettable night on “Dancing With the Stars“. Pentatonix singer Scott Hoying moved viewers to tears with a deeply personal performance, and a joyful announcement that left the ballroom cheering.

During Week 5's “Dedication Night,” the 32-year-old artist dedicated his foxtrot to his husband, Mark, dancing alongside pro partner Rylee Arnold to his own original song, “Parallel.” The emotional track was inspired by the night he and Mark first fell in love, staying up talking until sunrise.

“I am so in love with him, and I have been hoping we would make it to this week,” Hoying shared in rehearsal. “I've always been a workaholic. We toured every single year. I felt like I was always dating mean guys. When I met Mark, it felt like I could exhale. I could be myself.”

A post shared by Scott Hoying (@scotthoying)

The Grammy-winning artist opened up about how his husband helped him heal and grow. “What happens is your self-esteem starts to heal, and that starts to trickle into all areas of your life,” Hoying said. “He's so special.”

Their heartfelt foxtrot beautifully reflected their love story, with Hoying's vocals and emotional movement creating one of the night's standout moments.

A post shared by Scott Hoying (@scotthoying)

In a tender backstage moment that aired during the show, Scott and Mark shared exciting personal news with Rylee, and with millions of viewers watching at home.

“We're gonna be dads,” the couple announced, smiling through tears. “Our surrogate is pregnant!”

Mark added, “We've dreamed of this our whole lives. Scott's gonna be the best dad in the whole world.” He also shared how meaningful Scott's dedication was to him, saying, “For him to dedicate this performance, to a song he wrote about our love, I will treasure this for the rest of my life.”

Scott and Mark's love story began in 2017 and reached a new chapter in 2023 when they exchanged vows in a romantic ceremony officiated by singer Christina Perri. Their wedding, filled with music, laughter, and heartfelt emotion, reflected the same warmth and connection that now defines their journey into parenthood.

Their joyful baby announcement on Dancing With the Stars became one of the most talked-about moments of the evening, as fans flooded social media with love, congratulations, and tears of happiness.

It was a night to remember, a beautiful celebration of love, artistry, and new beginnings, as Scott Hoying filled the ballroom with both heart and harmony.

Bravo fans love to see their favorite reality TV stars celebrating huge life moments, including seeing how they spend their fun-filled bachelorette getaways before tying the knot.

Former “Southern Charm” star Olivia Flowers recently shared photos and videos on Instagram of her Bachelorette party, or, more like, an extravaganza in Miami, Florida. Sharing the special occasion with her closest friends, Flowers appeared to have the best time before she weds her fiancé, Alex Williams.

A post shared by Olivia Flowers (@oliviabflowers)

Olivia Flowers, who appeared on seasons 8 and 9 of Bravo's “Southern Charm,” recently celebrated her bachelorette party in Miami. She shared several photos and videos from the getaway, including the house where she and her friends stayed, having a lively pool party, and a night out on the town where the women danced the night away. 

A post shared by Olivia Flowers (@oliviabflowers)

To kick off her bachelorette, Flowers' friends set up a beautiful display of white and gold balloons with one that read “Bride” above her bed. Flowers' bachelorette weekend getaway consisted of her and her friends taking a pilates class outside their rented home, and a pool party, catered by the sauce company, Saucy Gourment. Flowers' abs were on full display as she wore a white bikini and a long lace cover-up.

During another night, Flowers and her gal pals headed to KiKi on the River, a waterfront Mediterranean restaurant in Miami, where they dined and danced. Flowers was given a bridal crown and a heart-shaped cake that unveiled a photo of her and her fiancé, Alex Williams, when lit.

A post shared by Caroline Grace McDonald (@caro1grace)

In an Oct. 1 post, the reality star shared how thankful she was to have her closest friends celebrate with her. “Some of you I met in elementary school, others we survived high school awkward phases and questionable first loves, then there are my college sweethearts who I can't imagine life without… You've been with me through every chapter. Yall are my favorite blessing. Cheers to many more milestones together.”

Fans didn't see any of Flowers' “Southern Charm” co-stars at her bachelorette party, but it didn't mean that she wasn't going to invite a few of them to her upcoming wedding. 

Speaking with Page Six's “Virtual Reali-Tea,” Flowers revealed that Venita Aspen, Leva Bonaparte, and her husband, Lamar Bonaparte, scored invites. 

“Leva and Lamar, they're close family friends, and I would love to have them there,” she told the outlet. “I think we just want to keep it to the close-knit people…[and] Venita. That would be it.”

As fans may remember, Flowers had a major falling out with former friend Taylor Ann Green after Green revealed she had kissed Flowers' ex, Austen Kroll. Flowers wasn't asked to return to the show after season 9, which she said left her completely “blindsided” during an appearance on an episode of “Scheananigans with Scheana Shay.”

Flowers got engaged to Williams in New York City in September 2024. According to Page Six, the couple will be getting married in Texas this November.

Having just wrapped filming on her 44th Hallmark movie, including starring in more Hallmark Christmas movies than anyone on planet earth, Lacey Chabert is delivering an extra dose of holiday cheer in 2025. 

As part of a “over-arching” deal with Hallmark that was announced in February, the rom-com queen and star of Hallmark's heartwarming unscripted series “Celebrations with Lacey Chabert” partnered with Hallmark designers and cardmakers to develop her first-ever line of Christmas decor and wrapping. 

A post shared by Hallmark Gold Crown Stores (@hallmarkstores)

Chabert has provided glimpses of her new product line, illustrated with a vintage-inspired holiday vibe, during the second season of “Celebrations,” airing Monday nights on Hallmark Channel. 

In scenes shared by Hallmark Gold Crown Stores' social media account, as seen above, she's seen wrapping a gift in one of her 10 colorful rolls of wrapping paper, which all have a retro feel. Several are reversible, with festive designs on both sides of the paper. 

In another scene from a recent episode of “Celebrations,” in which Chabert and her event planning team throw surprise parties for people who've made a difference in their communities, they serve cookies on her gold serving tray with handles (available for $45.99), featuring illustrated pink and red poinsettias and a mint-colored bow on a forest green background. 

Other items in Chabert's collection include a set of four coordinating dessert plates for $25.99, six assorted round, glass ornaments for $45.99, a darling box with 24 blank holiday cards inside for $15.99, a trio of ceramic bowls in red, white, and green for $28.99, and a set of two low-ball glasses with her signature ribbon decorations for $33.99. 

Hallmark Channel fans' favorite item, though, might be Chabert's set of four festive popcorn bowls with messages like “More Snacks, More Merry, More Hallmark Channel” for $33.99. 

Meanwhile, for the most die-hard fans of Hallmark's queen of Christmas, there's also a porcelain Lacey Chabert ornament, with her dressed in a sleeveless red gown, for $26.99. 

After the holidays, the Lacey Chabert Collection will expand in 2026, according to the original announcement, which said the actress will continue to help design “everyday products that help people create joyful memories year-round.”

A post shared by Hallmark (@hallmark)

Chabert is among the many Hallmark stars descending on Nashville this week to kick off Countdown to Christmas 2025 with appearances and a party at the Grand Ole Opry. On October 14, Nikki DeLoach shared a photo in her Instagram Stories of herself on a plane with Chabert, Sharon Lawrence, and Eliza Hayes Maher before they took off for Music City. 

On October 15, Chabert will be at the Little Green Apple gift store (also known as Amy's Hallmark) from 10 a.m. to noon local time in nearby Franklin, along with fellow Hallmark stars Ashley Williams, Benjamin Ayres, B.J. Britt, and Brooke D'Orsay. Fans will have the chance to purchase signed items from Chabert's new collection, per the store. 

Other stars will be at Katy's Hallmark in Nashville at the same time — fans can meet up with Andrew Walker, Kimberley Sustad, Paul Campbell, Rachel Boston, and Tyler Hynes.

Amid a whirlwind of shocking series cancellations at HGTV during the summer of 2025 and news of new series in the works, twin sisters Lyndsay Lamb and Leslie Davis have been noticeably quiet about the future of their show, “Unsellable Houses.”

The duo remains active on social media, still running and promoting their Lamb & Co. real estate, design, and decor businesses in Snohomish, Washington. Now, one year after their show's fifth season debuted in the fall of 2024, one of the sisters has finally begun to acknowledge fans' questions about their on-air future. 

Throughout the summer, many of Davis and Lamb's HGTV peers made headlines as they revealed their shows were not renewed for new seasons, including Jonathan Knight's “Fixer to Fabulous,” Egypt Sherrod and Mike Jackson's “Married to Real Estate,” and “Bargain Block” with Keith Bynum and Evan Thomas. 

Meanwhile, in late August, HGTV announced a full slate of new and returning shows for the end of 2025 and early 2026 — but “Unsellable Houses” wasn't on the list. 

For months, when fans peppered Davis and Lamb's social media posts with questions about their show's future, the duo typically ignored the inquiries. But in early October 2025, Lamb has acknowledged some of her Instagram followers' comments about wanting to see the show return. 

On an Instagram video she posted on October 3 about creative tabletop ideas for hosting a fall meal, she replied to a fan who commented, “Beautiful! Miss seeing you and your sissy on TV -😔, hope you two have another show brewing !!!!” Lamb's reply? “Always 😍”

On October 14, Lamb posted a video of the fall decor outside their Lamb & Co. storefront. She liked one fan's comment that said, “Looks great! Will you two be back on TV? I miss watching you!” She also liked when a fellow fan replied, “me too! I'm in withdrawals! 😫”

Davis, however, has primarly shared personal posts over the last several months, including chronicling her first trip overseas (to Denmark) this month and has not commented on or liked any inquiries about the show. 

Despite the lack of information about the future of “Unsellable Houses,” HGTV continues to regularly air reruns of the show. 

The show follows the twins as they help local homeowners update the houses they've had trouble selling. In a July 2024 episode of their “Twin Win Unfiltered” podcast, the sisters said they never expected or sought out being on TV. 

Davis explained that their production company checked out their YouTube after being tipped off by a friend. She said, “A friend of ours, Gina, was approached about a TV show. She said ‘no' for numerous reasons. Then she called us, and said, ‘Hey, FYI, I gave your name to a production company because I think you guys would be good on a show.'”

The unexpected death of R&B icon D'Angelo on October 14, 2025, hit many of his peers in the music industry hard, including multiple “American Idol” stars, from Jennifer Hudson to Ruben Studdard, who shared their grief and shock via social media.

D'Angelo was a legendary R&B singer who helped pioneer the genre of music known as “neo-soul,” according to Variety. He died at age 51 following a private battle with pancreatic cancer. 

A statement issued by D'Angelo's family, per the Daily Mail, said, “The shining star of our family has dimmed his light for us in this life… After a prolonged and courageous battle with cancer, we are heartbroken to announce that Michael D'Angelo Archer, known to his fans around the world as D'Angelo, has been called home, departing this life today, October 14th, 2025.”

A post shared by Jennifer Hudson (@iamjhud)

EGOT winner Jennifer Hudson, one of the most successful alumni in “American Idol” history, posted a photo of D'Angelo and wrote, “This really hurts ! We lost a true original today. It just doesn't seem real!! It can't be . D'Angelo, your voice will live on forever. Rest well, King !!!”

“Name That Tune” co-host Randy Jackson, who was one of the original judges on “American Idol” when Hudson competed on the show, also shared his sadness over D'Angelo's passing. Jackson posted a video in his Instagram Stories of D'Angelo performing and wrote, “Rest in power to an incredible legend 🙏🏽”

Also among the “American Idol” stars who shared their grief over D'Angelo's death were multiple “American Idol” winners, including season two champ Ruben Studdard. He posted a photo of the singer in his Instagram Stories and wrote, “Thank you for all of the amazing music. RIP D'Angelo 🥺🥺🥺”

Fantasia, who won the third season of “American Idol” — the same season in which Hudson took sixth place — posted a photo of D'Angelo in her Instagram Stories and wrote in large lettering, “Noooooo Way! 💔”

Season 11 winner Phillip Phillips also posted a photo in his Instagram Stories of D'Angelo's “Spanish Joint” single art and wrote, “No words. Sad day for music. Genius. Inspirational. I've loved D'Angelos music for a long time. Rest well and thank you for inspiring so many all over the world.” 

Among other celebrities who publicly mourned D'Angelo's death on October 14 was Beyoncé, who posted his photo on her website and, addressing him by his given name, wrote, “Rest in peace, Michael Eugene Archer, known to the world of music as the inimitable D'Angelo. We thank you for your beautiful music, your voice, your proficiency on the piano, your artistry. You were the pioneer of neo-soul and that changed and transformed rhythm & blues forever. We will never forget you.”

Actor Jamie Foxx posted a lengthy tribute to D'Angelo, which said in part, “God put you here for a reason and we were all lucky enough to see what God had made… That's why today real tears run down my face … to hear the news that God has taken one of his special creations home… I know God doesn't make mistakes… But this one hurts like hell… rest up my friend… you will be missed forever… But your music and your impression will be felt for generations to come”

Thousands of fans also shared their grief on social media, including in response to posts from celebrities. On Hudson's tribute to D'Angelo, one person wrote, “OMG, I'm shocked, I'm learning this through your post ☹️☹️☹️. I was learning to his songs earlier today, that's so sad, such a unique talent and voice !!! ☹️✨”

“Cannot believe this,” another commented. “Rest in peace 😢”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Mark Ballas & Whitney Leavitt's DWTS Contemporary Dedication Dance","https://entertainmentnow.com/dancing-with-the-stars/mark-ballas-dwts-whitney-contemporary-performance/","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 00:48:26 GMT","

Tonight on “Dancing with the Stars,” Whitney Leavitt and her professional partner Mark Ballas took the stage for a powerful “Dedication Night” performance. Last week the couple performed a song from “Hamilton” on Disney night. The pair danced a contemporary routine to “Heal” by Jamal Roberts, which Whitney dedicated to her husband, Connor. 

The heartfelt number followed a week of emotional challenges for Whitney, who recently opened up about having a mental breakdown while juggling motherhood, social media work, and her growing television presence.

A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars)

The performance starts off and finalizes with assistance from Whitney's husband Connor. The husband and wife moment caused tears in the ballroom, including a tearful statement by Carrie Ann. She complimented the performance by expressing how “dance was made for self-expression”. 

Ballas and Leavitt receive a combined score of 33/40 for the night. Just one point behind Robert Irwin and Witney Carson.

Whitney revealed that rehearsing for Dedication Night pushed her to the edge. “I had a breakdown yesterday, a mental breakdown. But we made it,” she admitted, describing the experience as one filled with “blood, sweat and tears” reported The National Desk. She confessed that the demands of reality TV and influencer life left her feeling detached from herself but said, “I feel most like myself when I'm dancing.”

A post shared by Whitney Leavitt (@whitleavitt)

Mark Ballas praised Whitney's ability to channel her emotions into movement, calling her “a fabulous mother and an excellent wife” while applauding her determination to keep going. The night became even more special when Whitney's husband, Connor, joined her and Mark on stage. Whitney shared that he had been rehearsing and couldn't wait to participate, adding, “He tells us multiple times that he is so excited to get on the dance floor. So I cannot wait.” The performance gave audiences a rare look into the couple's deep connection and shared strength.

A post shared by Whitney Leavitt (@whitleavitt)

“Dedication Night” is a Season 34 theme where each celebrity performs for someone meaningful in their life, often with that person joining the stage. Whitney and Mark's dance to “Heal” stood out among the evening's emotional performances. Other dedications included Andy Richter honoring his daughter, Robert Irwin paying tribute to his mother, and Scott Hoying dancing for his husband.

As one of the competition's top contenders, Whitney entered the night with high expectations. The emotional tone added an extra layer of intensity, particularly for Mark, who has been defending his choreography against critiques earlier this season. Despite the scrutiny, he maintained that his work fits within “DWTS” standards and remains focused on authenticity.

If you're wondering what members of the French 75 chat about when they're not breaking immigrants out of detainment centers or robbing banks, the answer is astrology. Or at least that's what the cast of Paul Thomas Anderson's “One Battle After Another” discussed in between firing prop machine guns and driving getaway cars in the vigilante thriller.

“We were all of us just there, chatting up in between takes, talking about astrology, talking about full moons,” Shayna McHayle, who plays French 75 member Junglepussy, told IndieWire. “Teyana [Taylor] was saying something about Scorpios, and I'm like, ‘I'm a Scorpio,' and Leo[nardo DiCaprio]'s like, ‘Yeah, I'm a Scorpio.' It was this whole thing.”

For McHayle, spending time on the set of a blockbuster action film with A-list talent was quite surreal, and not something she sought out, but the experience was “written in the stars.” While she's previously appeared in two films, 2018's “Support the Girls” and 2023's “The Perfect Find,” she's predominantly a musician who raps under the stage name Junglepussy. After Anderson saw her on tour with Tame Impala in 2022, however, he was so inspired that he created a character, also named Junglepussy, just for McHayle.

 










“My agent reached out to me like, ‘Paul Thomas Anderson wants your number. Can I give it to him?' He wants to talk to you directly,” McHayle said. “I was like, ‘Who? OK, yeah, give him my number.'”

The pair then met several times in New York City over the next few years, with Anderson telling McHayle he was crafting a far-left vigilante based on her stage persona. 

“I didn't know that it was like Junglepussy for real until it really got close to locking in,” McHayle said. “He gave me a hard copy of the script, and when I read it, I was like, ‘What the…? What is this?' When I saw my name in there, and I saw my lyrics in there, and I just saw all these pussy references, I was gagged.”

Even before shooting, however, astrology was a key topic of conversation. “Teyana's a Sag. Regina [Hall]'s a Sag. Alana [Haim]'s a Sag,” McHayle said. “One day, me and Paul were texting before we started filming, and he thought I was a Sag too. He's like, ‘Yeah, you know I got all these badass Sagittarius women in the French 75,' and I was like, ‘Yeah, I'm a Scorpio.' He was like, ‘OK, you're fired.'”

After reading the “One Battle After Another” script, however, McHayle asked Anderson to make some changes to her character. “He's writing and directing, so he wants to control everything,” she said, “But I was just like, ‘Paul, I am Junglepussy. This is me. I have to be Junglepussy after this movie. I was Junglepussy before this movie, and while I love the collaboration here that you're cooking up, I still have some non-negotiables.' There were things that I was like, ‘OK, hard no on this. Junglepussy would never, like ever.'”

 










Crafting a character that was a mix of her real-life persona and a fictional French 75 radical required some nuance from McHayle as an actor. “Because he reached out to me directly, and was so inspired by my music, even ‘This pussy don't pop for you,' having it like as a sign in the movie, which is how I've been performing it for the past decade, I knew there were a lot of things that he was drawn to, and I wanted to keep that part of me alive in the role,” she said. “But I also wanted to do some things that I wouldn't usually do, like shooting a machine gun out of a moving vehicle, like robbing a bank.”

McHayle channeled her stage persona while filming, especially during her instantly iconic bank robbery monologue. Walking across the tellers' counter amid the chaos of a stick-up, McHayle delivers a speech that serves both as a mission statement for the French 75 as well as a nod to Junglepussy's work. It's here that she tells the world, “This pussy don't pop for you.” But filming in front of the entire cast and crew was daunting. 

“That day, I just had to channel the same energy I bring to the stage whenever I do a big show,” she said. “I just had to channel that energy and do my thing.”

McHayle is “still gagged” at the magnitude of the film, and the stunts in particular. “The stunts were scary,” she said, laughing, “Like the car chase scene, we were in the vehicles, like we were in it. When the minivan takes that hard left, we were in it…I'm not even, like, a rollercoaster kind of girl. I prefer a ride over a rollercoaster, but this was like a rollercoaster ride from hell.” 

 










“I know Warner Brothers didn't want to get in trouble with me,” she added about the movie's safety protocols. “I just had to let go and trust they knew what they were doing, because they know they have to keep us safe.”

While “One Battle After Another” may only be McHayle's third movie, it's her second working with Regina Hall, whom she acted alongside in “Support the Girls,” where they both played employees of a Hooters-esque establishment called Double Whammies. McHayle described the reunion as “a dream.” 

“She is such a calming force,” McHayle gushes, “The role she plays as Deandra [in ‘One Battle After Another'] is just like steady, grounded. That's the literal energy she gives me when we work together on set. I just feel super calm around her. She's an OG, like that's my girl, just big sis vibes, like just super nurturing. I'm just like, ‘Girl, I can't believe this is my second movie with you.' Love her for life.”

McHayle is now manifesting a third Regina Hall collab and one “with more screentime for both of us.” She's also rooting for Hall to earn an Oscar for her performance. “She is truly such a force,” McHayle said. “I need her getting that Oscar. No pressure, but I want her to have it.” 

After filming wrapped in early 2024, McHayle had to wait patiently for over a year before she finally got to watch “One Battle After Another.” She was invited to a private screening at the IMAX theater at New York's Lincoln Square AMC for a morning viewing. “It was like me and some of the Christmas Adventurers, Tony Goldwyn and them,” she said. “We're in this big-ass theater, and everybody's in their own row and taking it all in.” 

 










McHayle brought a coffee and a croissant and, during her first watch, was mostly just assessing how much of her work made the final cut. “I was there ticking my boxes,” she said. “Like I know what I did, and I know what I didn't do. Now let's see what's in here. When I saw all the pieces just remained, I was like, ‘Oh, Paul is a real one. He was serious,' because you never know for real until it's done.”

Since her first screening, where she admitted to being “over-caffeinated” and “overstimulated,” she's seen the movie five more times, including in VistaVision. She's still “gagged” by the whole process, and knows there will be more to come. 

“For some reason, whenever I do me, do my music, make my art, I'm attracting these opportunities,” she said. “I'm just staying super open to expanding my acting career, because it's obviously something I can't run from, hide from, like it just keeps popping up. I am going to surrender to the process and to the full spectrum of my gifts, my artistry, and just keep being me.” 

Hopefully, that means Shayna McHayle x Regina Hall 3.0 in the near future. 

“One Battle After Another” is now in theaters from Warner Bros. Pictures.

Let this be a manifesto. Well, let it be a sort of manifesto. Let it be an essay, anyway. Let's write the thing and see how it goes. The right way to describe the project and our reasons behind it will reveal itself through process. Let's slow down. Let's open the windows. In the afternoon, the air from the windows is so soft and gentle. The crows are back, talking to the dog again, and the other birds are singing in the trees. They are all a part of this. The best way to write this would be to follow the principles of the thing itself. So let's start there with the windows open, in peace, in nature, and let's experiment.

We are Joële Walinga and Daniel Warth. We are a married couple. We are filmmakers. And we are the co-founders of a new residency called CASA PIP.

CASA PIP is a free residency that we've designed for filmmakers and filmworkers. Out in the mountains of Central Portugal, CASA PIP is a place where we hope people can come and work on their projects, or think through their ideas, play with something, experiment with something, read a damn book, look at the sky, swim in the river, write a script, experiment with light or color or sound, with motion, with time, draw something, rehearse something, lie down and rest, make lunch. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






In one full month at the residency, there are many opportunities to make lunch, and it just happens to be true that great ideas can be born while making lunch, just as they can while doing any of the above, or any other thing on the infinite list of human activities. We designed this place to let filmmakers be the artists and the individual humans that they are and work on whatever it is they need to work on in whatever way they think they need to work on it. We want to remove all the rules and the mentorships and the critiques and the guides and the script doctors and offer just a peaceful, free space for artists and their projects to blossom in their own particular, unique way.

CASA PIP was inspired in part by the generosity of our dear friend, Bruno Caetano, the impossibly humble animation filmmaker who, among his many impressive credits, produced the Academy Award-nominated short film “Ice Merchants.” Bruno offered us the use of his family cottage in a tranquil Portuguese village for us to spend some time working on our screenplays. In his lovely cottage we sat, thinking, writing, lunching, amid the sound of goats chatting and the musical clanking of their bells, amid the sound of the breeze in the eucalyptus trees, amid the overwhelming aroma of those same trees, the humidity floating softly in the October air. There, in his house in the mountains eating chips, we wrote our scripts with confidence and inspiration, with a gushing-forth of ideas and an absence of external criticism that was unlike any other experience we'd had in the film industry.

 










Both of us have had our share of experience doing labs and residencies in various parts of the world, but we noticed a discrepancy between film residencies and the residencies offered to artists working in other forms. This form that we know and love, that we're so passionate about, just didn't seem to be treated very much like an art form. Film labs and residencies don't really encourage you to trust yourself as an artist. Rather, you are given guidance on what to change, how to shape your project to address external feedback or make it more market-standard.

We dreamed of a space where film is treated properly like an art form, where its makers are encouraged to play and think and experiment, a place where they could fail with pleasure, because so often we can find something amazing in our failure, something special, something that would otherwise never have been discovered. We wanted to offer a space that doesn't guide artists towards any particular outcome, but instead encourages them to trust their gut. And we wanted it to be free-of-charge, to invite artists across the economic spectrum, not just the ones with the independent means to afford a month's stay in Europe.

It is with this in mind that we launch CASA PIP, a free residency, open to anyone who works in any field of the film industry: writers, directors, actors, production designers, script supervisors, all are welcome. While we both know first-hand how much a writer and director can benefit from time and space to work in peace, without anyone looking over their shoulder, we believe that's also true about every other discipline in film. If we think of film as an art form, then all of the people who make films are artists. And we believe that every film would be incalculably richer if every single one of the people working on them had an opportunity to give just their part of it this kind of undivided attention and unsupervised experimentation.

 










So after years of holding this dream, at last, we have lovingly designed and furnished a small house in a remote and friendly village in the mountains of Central Portugal. Each selected resident will have the house to themselves, for free, for a period of up to one month. We have done our best to make this a space that is conducive to peace, inspiration, and experimentation. 

To select these residents, we have assembled an international jury. Jesse Cumming is the associate curator of the Wavelengths program at TIFF, as well as having programmed for Hot Docs, MoMA, Anthology Film Archives, and ICA London. Ana David is the official program advisor to Berlinale, and programs for Oslo/Fusion, BFI London Film Festival, and Queer Lisboa. Winnie Wang is the winner of both the International Documentary Association's 2022 Getting Real Fellowship and the Toronto Film Critics' Association's 2024 Emerging Critic Award, and is an industry programmer at TIFF. These three will review all applications and make their decisions by the end of January 2026.

We are excited to be opening our doors to the public and launching our call for submissions in October, almost exactly two years after our stay at our friend Bruno's cottage. In fact, we are in the residency house now, writing this essay in between putting the last touches on the decoration and the design. We can confirm that the crows have now left. A rooster just … howled? It's time for lunch.

 










CASA PIP opens for applications on Wednesday, October 15. Residencies begin in 2026. For more information and to apply, please visit: www.casapip.com

Few contemporary films about unresolved childhood abuse — which is always unresolved, in the end, anyway — cut as narrowly close to the bone as Elliot Tuttle's two-hander masked as provocation, “Blue Film.” 

Rejected by mainstream film festivals before it premiered in Edinburgh this summer and NewFest in New York in October, this taboo-busting study of a masculine camboy confronted by the pedophile teacher who many years ago desired him holds back little and offers even less that's palatable to swallow. Its limitations as a stagelike piece aside, the movie wrings emotional complexity from a fraught, ever-shifting dialogue between a convicted child abuser and the student, now a late twenties sex worker, he spared.

“Blue Film,” which takes place entirely in a rented Hancock Park Airbnb in Los Angeles with only two actors, dares to go places I have not seen an American movie travel to in a while. There was an Israeli movie called “Princess” at Sundance in 2014, directed by Tali Shalom Ezer, which freaked a lot of people out. It was about a 12-year-old girl's “close relationship” with her mother's boyfriend. There was the 2011 Austrian movie “Michael,” directed by Michael Haneke protégé Markus Schleinzer, about an insurance salesman sexually abusing the 10-year-old boy locked up in his basement. These were shocking. Neither were American.

Tuttle, an American filmmaker himself who received support on the project from Mark Duplass of all possible collaborators, is willing to take you to those same dark places, ones that remind you of European directors who want to shake you with their frank psychosexual provocations. It's impressive where Tuttle, this second-time feature filmmaker, goes with his surprisingly humanistic and empathetic approach to material about abuse. One where a pedophile teacher's sexual fantasy about his former student's talent show performance emerges as oddly wistful.

“Blue Film” stars rising actor Kieron Moore as dom camboy Aaron Eagle (whose real name is Alex McConnell) opposite Reed Birney as his estranged middle school teacher, who reconnect over one night filled with conversations about desire, shame, and guilt. I'm not surprised festivals, allegedly such as Sundance and SXSW, looked away from it. Mainstream audiences will be alienated by this unapologetic exploration of quote-unquote aberrant sexuality, but those looking for a challenge in the vein of ‘90s films from Todd Solondz or Gregg Araki will feel seen in Tuttle's exploration of how abuse warps memory, and memory warps accounts of abuse.

In asking you to feel sorry for a pedophile while making a gay man his scene partner, “Blue Film” dances on the tricky line from early abuse to later-in-life sexual behavior. When the movie begins, we see Aaron (Moore), sweaty and hairy in white briefs and tattooed top-to-toe, putting on a live stream for his submissive followers. One of his anonymous fans offers $50,000 for an in-person meet-and-greet. Financially desperate, he agrees to spend the night with the client, who greets him sheathed in a balaclava with the promise of even more money and perhaps pizza if Aaron is willing to open up about himself.

 










That client, it turns out, is Mr. Grant, aka Hank, Aaron's long-ago teacher, and one who took a special interest in Aaron as a child. Some time while Aaron was in school, Hank was intercepted sexually assaulting a child on campus, was fired from his job, and received a prison sentence. With the mask off and Aaron stripped down yet again, their walls start to come down. Hank, he reveals, has now turned to religion as an atonement for his own torment, but his search for meaning has not been without other attempts at or contemplations of assaulting kids, as he tells Aaron.

Tuttle's script and camera pass no judgment on the characters, like when Aaron shares a bone-chilling story of childhood abuse while naked in a bathtub that may or may not be true, or when Hank also offers a sickening recounting of molestation he endured at the hands of a relative. The actors are as game as any you could imagine, working from a script that you can imagine a lot of people said “hell no” to.

Birney, 71, and best known for work in television and theater (“The Humans”), invites you to feel all his hurt, even as his world is a morally disturbed one we are made to live inside for the movie's running time. As Aaron, Moore, meanwhile, conceals deep wounds of his own, while also high on the power imbalance this situation has tipped his way, where Hank wants to know if he “still loves” Aaron. Another wrinkle is that the camera certainly wants us to also desire Moore, who is often next to naked, placing us at least adjacent to Hank's gaze.

 










Hank is also curious about whether he can still be attracted to adult whom he once desired as a child. He shaves Aaron head to toe to make him look more physically childlike in one of the film's queasier implications. What these two actors take on is undeniably brave, even as the movie tilts toward becoming suffocating, which is intentional. “Blue Film” is confined to a single environment, after all.

Cinematographer Ryan Jackson-Healy also shot the equally controversy-starting, Birney-led film “Mass,” about the ramifications of a school shooting for the parents affected. The DP knows his way around a tight room with just a few people, and the visual beauty of this movie (indeed, often cloaked in literal blues as night turns to dawn) helps alleviate the agonies on display.

Tuttle wisely avoids flashbacks or out-of-this-room context. We are stuck with these two people and our discomfort with them, even though we might also feel tenderness toward them. “Blue Film” nudges at a lot of tricky issues, like the question of whether being gay in the present day is somehow the result of inflictions of the past. And the parallel to that question is whether abuse can also beget more abuse, i.e. make you into a pedophile or sex offender. Hank says he knew who he was once his sexual fantasies in middle school, about his fellow same-age classmates, remained the same into adulthood. What Tuttle wants to attack here is this terrible fork-in-the-road notion that pedophilia and homosexuality stem from the same root.

 










Still, “Blue Film” does the rare work of listening with compassion to a pedophile such as Hank, and as an audience, you can either be curious about that or just let it make you uncomfortable. Hank is tormented by who he is, as is Aaron, but they are not the same person, and they did not come from the same place. “Blue Film” leaves you feeling a little bit ill, and very uneasy about how you're supposed to feel. But when most films either wouldn't dare go here at all, or would tell you how to feel about the material, that's rare and welcome.

“Blue Film” premiered at the Edinburgh Film Festival and NewFest. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Some say that, when King Arthur pulled Excalibur from the stone, it marked him as the sovereign ruler of Britain. It's hard not to feel the same way about PinkPantheress when she samples Underworld's “Dark & Long” or “Romeo” by Basement Jaxx, or lets out a “Wow, wow, wow!” at the end of her surprise summer hit “Illegal” like she's the second coming of Cassie from Skins. Pink, along with Oasis and Olivia Dean, has made British identity chic again this year, maybe for the first time since Alexa Chung released her iconic It book more than a decade ago. If you need proof, listen to Bladee's verse on his new remix of Pink's “Stateside,” in which the Swedish musician shouts out regions of the UK like he's DJ Pharris dropping Chicago references on “Cold:” Midlands, Highlands, Sussex, Yorkshire, Croydon, Knightsbridge…

Such is Pink's power: Since releasing her second mixtape, Fancy That, in May, the 24-year-old has proven she has a preternatural ability to make the most outré-normie references feel like they're on the bleeding edge of cool. Her Glastonbury set was introduced by Louis Theroux and possessed what my friend described as a “Britain's Got Talent aesthetic,” and it was one of the festival's best. Fans affectionately read Pink's style, but none of them have a bag collaboration with Diane V and Dover Street Market, do they? Fancy Some More?, Pink's new Fancy That remix project, doesn't have the ultraconceptual bent of Charli XCX's Brat remix project from last year, but it moves with the same swagger: Like, who else would have the cheek, ingenuity, and clout to gather all these people under one roof?

Fancy Some More?'s remixes are split into two discs, one featuring vocalists and the other producers. (The release also includes a third disc, featuring the original tape.) Scanning the guest list is, I imagine, what it's like to flick through Pink's iPod. On the vocalist side, you have K-pop stars (SEVENTEEN and Yves from LOONA) alt-pop it girls (Oklou, Rachel Chinouriri, Ravyn Lenae, Bladee), and centrist stars with underground clout (Zara Larsson, JADE, Kylie Minogue, JT, Sugababes). The producer disc mostly features artists who bore clear influence on Fancy That (Basement Jaxx, Groove Armada, Joe Goddard) alongside upstart locals (Nia Archives, Leod, Kilimanjaro) and also Kaytranada, seemingly kept on retainer by the major labels for any remixing needs. The project is rounded out by a coterie of Brazilians—Anitta, DJ Caio Prince, Adame DJ, and Mochakk—which, with any luck, signals the sound of future PinkPantheress music.

The vast majority of these remixes totally bang, and many of them serve the function of wish fulfillment. Have you (like me) ever wanted “Illegal” to feel even faster and more disorienting? Nia Archives, London's premiere young junglist, makes the whole song feel like a 90-degree drop on a rollercoaster. Have you been scouring SoundCloud for a mashup of “Stateside” with its spiritual forebear, Kylie Minogue's “Slow”? Here's la grand dame herself whispering “Are you ready for me?” and eliciting goosebumps when she sings “Never met an Aussie girl, you say.” The sky seems to crack wide open when the Sugababes drop into “Nice to Know You” and provide a hi-fi rendition of the hook Pink sampled on the original version of the track.

The most effective remixes flip the original songs on their head: Basement Jaxx turn “Tonight,” one of the least dance-forward tracks on Fancy That, into a throbbing, shimmery big-room banger, its five-minute runtime practically begging for a 12” version. Meanwhile, Caio Prince and Adame traverse baile funk, Miami bass, and fight-ready big beat on their flip of the previously lightweight “Stars.” Oklou drags the Basement Jaxx sample on “Girl Like Me” as far out of its original context as she can take it, making the liberated refrain of “Let it all go” sound less like dancefloor hedonism and more like a desperate attempt to get over a lingering heartbreak.

With the exception of Kaytranada's “Girl Like Me”—which sounds roughly the same as every other Kaytranada remix in recent memory—it feels like all these tracks were made with a level of care uncommon for a major label remix album, which so often feel easy cash grabs or attempts to prolong an album cycle that's running out of steam. Fancy Some More? feels like a rowdy, well-earned celebration and reaffirms the main ideas PinkPantheress has gestured toward for much of the year: Heavy reference doesn't inherently go hand-in-hand with a lack of ingenuity. Successive generations of dance producers don't have to be at war with each other. Pop music, done right, can feel like the key to a world that's smarter, more free, and way more fun.

Over the past few years, California-based singer and multi-instrumentalist Madison Cunningham has become an industry darling for her virtuosic guitar playing. She's quietly ubiquitous: opening for Hozier and Harry Styles, appearing on albums by Lucius and Mumford & Sons, performing with Sara Bareilles and Chris Thile, and recording a Buckingham Nicks covers album with Andrew Bird. Her résumé may be highly NPR-friendly, but her work is often genuinely challenging. Her 2022 song “In From Japan” is a solid example of Cunningham's capabilities as a songwriter and guitarist: a lightly psychedelic, heavily syncopated 7/4 ballad that's delightfully inside-baseball about the commodification of music. “Watermark/They're trying to own the image nature carved/Well, metadata won't support your cause,” she sings. She fully came into her own on her second studio album, the Grammy-winning album Revealer, made in 2022 with a team of industry veterans like Matt Chamberlain, Dan Wilson, and Mike Elizondo.

Shortly after Revealer's success, Cunningham met Prince's former guitarist, Wendy Melvoin.  “You have something to say, and you aren't saying it yet,” Melvoin told her, and played her Martha Wainwright's confrontational classic “Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole.” Months later, Cunningham divorced her husband of five years (she'd known him since they were teens in church) and ditched her guitar for a piano-based album indebted to Joni Mitchell's Blue (she'd previously recorded a cover of “California”). As with Cunningham's other music, the lush presentation of Ace disguises unexpected chord changes and unconventional time signatures. Here, it's a perfect strategy for a record about the disintegration of a seemingly perfect relationship. The orchestral arrangements, by Cunningham, yMusic's Rob Moose, Philip Krohnengold, and Mercury Rev's Jesse Chandler, often approach Joanna Newsom territory, something Cunningham hasn't tried before. While Ace is quieter and less accessible than her past work, it's just as musically sophisticated, with newfound chamber-pop grandeur.

Cunningham is a classic “musician's musician,” her songs dense with time signature hops and jazzy voicings. Even the earthy acoustic song “Wake” comes with an uneasy melody, with Fleet Foxes' Robin Pecknold's offering dissonant harmonies that sound like a worn-out Simon & Garfunkel vinyl wavering in pitch. And there's a lot of grief and animosity simmering underneath even Ace's quieter songs.On “Skeletree,” Cunningham teases, “Something's got to give” over a dense groove, until she finally shouts, “I don't trust what you say/But I've come to lose my faith in everyone” as the trembling strings and electric guitars finally break through.

The album's central theme is one of untangling yourself from someone else, particularly after anger and betrayal. Cunningham doesn't go into specifics, but her lyrics are loaded anyway. On “My Full Name,” she sings, “Your brother only shares your family shame/But he doesn't really know you”; on “Mummy,” she sings, “I'm the oldest of five/The first to be torn/In your mother's eyes/You were the firstborn”—a line with enough baggage to outfit an entirely different song. “Mummy” sounds like a whimsical lullaby, or one of Regina Spektor's artsier moments, but it contains some of Cunningham's most incisive lyrics. First she blames herself—“I never could explain myself, the hurt that I feel, the hurt that I cause”—then she turns the same words against an ex. The truth of what actually happened feels deliberately out of reach, much like a partner can “know every mole and skin tag” (“Take Two”) and still not actually understand their lover.

Ace is the work of a mature, controlled songwriter. The album largely avoids the clichés of the divorce postmortem, earning its more plainspoken lines like, “Some days I hate you so much/I want you back.” Even when the music is more conventional, Cunningham fits in a cutting line—as on the very '70s soft-rock “Beyond that Moon,” where she sings, “I'd stay under your skin if I were convinced that there were room.” Only lead single “My Full Name”  keeps things a little too simple, lacking the complex sentiments and intricate arrangements that make this album special. Ace rewards close listening; from a stately chamber-folk album, something quietly unrelenting emerges.

Amber Mark has mastered the art of honoring tradition without getting hamstrung by it. Like Brittany Howard and Nourished by Time, she's comfortable in the present as well as the past, and she can bend both to her needs. The New York-based singer and producer has covered Eddie Kendricks and Sade, and she leans toward arrangements inspired by the layered vocals and instrumentation of '80s soul and funk. Like the FCC-friendly stars of old, she even cusses sparingly and tends to pine for touch rather than sex. “Hate sleeping by myself these nights/The empty space fills up my mind,” Mark sang achingly on her first record. It's easy to lose track of the year when listening to her music.

Three Dimensions Deep, Mark's space-themed debut, charted a new age journey of self-discovery through R&B and pop. She continued the adventure on last year's breezy EP Loosies, effortlessly sliding from swinging synth-funk to thumping house and druggy sing-rap. Mark manages the sweep of Janelle Monáe or Bruno Mars with half the sweat and none of the wardrobe changes. She treats R&B's many eras as heritage, language, rather than costume, a fluency that guides her latest record, Pretty Idea. The album is a compact but expansive survey of the genre built on slick grooves, stacked melodies, and deep heartache.

Mark knows she's not reinventing the wheel. When asked what inspired her latest album, she deadpanned, “Boys.” She went on to explain the record came on the heels of a return to dating after the end of a long-term relationship, but the one-word answer fits. Pretty Idea is a tight 37 minutes of disco, funk, and R&B, laser-focused on the big questions. What is love? Is it supposed to make you feel insane? Is it necessary to be happy? The familiarity of these concerns, and the sounds through which Mark explores them, is the point. Tradition is less an altar she worships at and more the point of departure for her voyage to the land beyond heartbreak.

The album is loosely structured as a wayward path to self-acceptance. Mark begins with poise, vowing on “By the End of the Night” to rebound on the dancefloor. She's quickly swooning, swathing a new paramour in her perfume on the buoyant “ooo” and going “weak in the knees” on the sprung “Sweet Serotonin.” “Too Much” features a nifty interpolation of Usher's “My Boo” as she second-guesses her enthusiasm. “Is it too much if I'm thinking about you daily?” she sings coyly, more to herself than her crush. By the album's end, she's removed enough from the doomed relationship to consider her own role in its demise. “Your touch when I'm coming home/It's a pretty idea, a pretty idea,” she croons on the title track. “Who's the one that did you wrong?/Maybe I did, maybe I did.”

Mark doesn't really tell stories in her songs; she lives the turmoil, her lithe vocals tracing the flutters of the heart. Survival anthem “Problems” showcases her range, her voice variously a coo, a wail, and a feathery prayer as she tries to will away stress. Folk ballad “Cherry Reds” clings to a warm memory like an heirloom: “Smoking Cherry Reds/In the trees,” Mark trills in her smooth upper register, stretching the last word into four wounded syllables. She's just as pained on “Let Me Love You,” where her background vocals become increasingly distressed. The sticky hook—“Why won't you let me love you?”—is an exclamation by the song's end.

The open spaces and pained harmonies of quiet storm are the go-to style for R&B singers working through such dark nights of the soul, but that's one tradition Pretty Idea breaks from. The core producers—Mark, One Direction songwriters Julian Bunetta and John Ryan, and duo Two Fresh—supply a dense, full-band sound. The arrangements are shimmery and lush, every little crevice filled with (at minimum) keys, synths, rhythm guitar, and background vocals. It's as if they've spackled all the negative space that defined Three Dimensions Deep. When the drums drop out on “Sweet Serotonin"" and “Too Much,” finger snaps reminiscent of the days when T-Pain and The-Dream ran urban radio subtly keep the meter. And on duet “Different Places,” which channels the warped funk of For All We Know, guitar melodies swell and recede as Mark and John Ryan trade woes. “You and I/Have we fallen out of love yet?/Doing all these circles/Round around the subject,” Mark sings. These songs are retro, but they're not stagnant.

That's a hard balance to strike. The past goes for cheap, in spirit if not actual cost (chill, JNCO). What if all the best things have already happened? What if all the sweet serotonin your brain struggles to produce because you're too pumped full of dread and cortisol could be solved by Alien:Earth or Supreme Clientele 2 or Toy Story 5? Pretty Idea is an album about boys, of course. But I admire its regular relationship to the past. Mark presents R&B's archives not as sacred texts or exotic loot but as context, precedent, pearls from grandma's attic that can look nice if you style them just so. This customization is what pushes her music past pastiche. Mark's boys are all hers.

	Start with the laundry. Of the many times Bob Mould‘s band Sugar unexpectedly found itself at the center of pop culture in the Nineties, one in particular springs to mind for him: a 1992 festival in Belgium where Sugar were on the same bill as Metallica, Neil Young and Crazy Horse, Lenny Kravitz, and the Black Crowes. For Mould, who emerged from indie rock the previous decade with Minneapolis' mighty Hüsker Dü, it was far from a typical gig. “Being on the periphery of the excess of those times was pretty crazy,” he says. “It was very, very different than jumping in a van and doing a punk rock tour. It was like, ‘So, Metallica bring washers and dryers out with them. I get it now.'”


	Compared with his years in Hüsker Dü and the many decades after on his own, Sugar were a streaking comet in Mould's career: two albums and one EP in two years, then over and out. But within that compressed time, Sugar brought Mould, bassist David Barbe, and drummer Malcolm Travis as close to the mainstream as Mould would ever get. In addition to that Belgium festival, the band played others with headliners like the Cure, powering through sandblasters like “If I Can't Change Your Mind,” “JC Auto,” and “Your Favorite Thing,” which found a home on alt-rock radio.

	











	Now, 30 years after Sugar played their last show — and more than a dozen years after an attempted but abandoned reunion — the band has returned. The group teased something was in the works on social media last week and this week unveiled a newly recorded raver, “House of Dead Memories.” There are shows announced in London and New York, too, set for May 2026.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Ironically, Sugar weren't even originally intended to be a band. Mould's first post-Hüskers album, Workbook, was critically lauded — “See a Little Light” was a college radio hit and found its way onto soundtracks — but the follow-up, the bleaker and tenser Black Sheets of Rain, received a more muted response. Mould plowed on, recruiting former Mercyland bassist Barbe and Human Switchboard and Zulus drummer Travis as his new rhythm section. As they were rehearsing in Athens, Georgia, to make a Mould album, the trio were invited to play a one-off show at the 40 Watt Club there.

	“We were like, ‘Sure, why not?'” Mould says. “It was already feeling like a band.” Next came a name, inspired by a packet on a coffee-shop table, and Mould unexpectedly had his first group after the glorious but often fraught ride that was Hüsker Dü. “I knew David and Malcom and their abilities and personalities, and I thought, ‘I bet this will work — I think it should work,'” he recalls. “And it did work.”


	Released in 1992, just after Nirvana's Nevermind and Pearl Jam's Ten messed with everyone's expectations of how rock could sound and sell, Sugar's debut, Copper Blue, was the right record at the right moment in the culture. “I was over in Europe in the summer of '91, playing a lot of festivals with Nirvana and Dinosaur Jr., and the table was getting set then for everything,” he says. “And to have Nirvana blow up like that, at the moment I'm coming back with a power-pop thing as opposed to what Workbook and Black Sheets were: I wish I could say, ‘Oh yeah, I knew this was coming.'”


	While not quite Nevermind in terms of sales, Copper Blue introduced Mould and his raging voice and guitar to a raft of Lollapalooza-minded kids — who probably didn't know much about his previous band but loved Mould's razor-edged songs and the MTV-friendly videos that accompanied them. “I got my ass handed to me a little bit by Black Sheets of Rain, so I went into Sugar with a little bit of ‘I'll show everybody,'” he says. “And everything sort of blew up immediately. I didn't wish for it, but when it happened It was like, ‘Well, here we are.'”


	With Sugar's success, Mould was thrust into a world of big-league alt-rock he'd only slightly experienced before. “It was a crazy time,” he says. “Whether I was in the office or doing press or writing and recording in the studio, I did not have a life beyond keeping that rocket in the sky for as long as I could. I wasn't a stranger to mainstream stuff, since Hüsker Dü was on The Joan Rivers Show. But when it's coming at you every day, that was sort of wild.”

	Late in 1994, Barbe told Mould he wanted to spend more time with his family, and the timing proved right for Sugar to wind down: A few months before, Kurt Cobain had killed himself. “Kurt's passing really hit me personally,” Mould says. “Sugar were in Atlanta, working in the studio, and to see Kurt Loder pop up on the TV and say, ‘Kurt Cobain is dead,' it was pretty demoralizing. It made me wonder, ‘What is this?' Kurt's situation was unique to him but not dissimilar to what was starting to happen when young people get really successful and lose track of things. And I thought, ‘Wow, this business is sort of harsh.'”


	Sugar played one week of shows in Japan early in 1995 and called it a day, with Travis moving on to other bands and Barbe shifting to academia (he currently teaches music business at the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business). In the 30 years since, Mould has made innumerable records on his own, ventured into DJ'ing and electronica, wrote scripts for World Championship Wrestling, and toured and recorded regularly with his current rhythm section, Jason Narducy and Jon Wurster. Sugar first resurfaced in 2011, as the 20th anniversary of Copper Blue approached. Mould, Barbe, and Travis got together and rehearsed for a possible reunion, but the musical vibe was not as inspiring as Mould had hoped. “I was a little resistant to the idea of going out on a 20-year thing,” he says. “I know a lot of people were doing it. So we got together and took a shot at it, and I think we all walked away thinking, ‘Eh, not right now.' At least for me, it was like, ‘I think I'm going to do what I'm doing.'”


	Last fall, as he was working what would be his next record, Here We Go Crazy, Mould began to sense a surge of interest in his old band, from music business folks who sensed a market and BMG, which was planning a Copper Blue reissue and a Sugar singles collection. “Fans have always shown interest,” he says. “But people in the business, whether it was BMG to different promoters around the country, were voicing things.” 


	Mould and Barbe had toured together, playing separate sets, but a year ago, the trio reconvened once more, at Barbe's Athens, Georgia, studio to play the old material. “This second time felt much, much better for all three of us, personally and as a former band,” Mould says. “So we started looking at getting back together to do a few things.”

	











	Earlier this year, they took the next step. When the band reformed 14 years ago, Mould had just written “House of Dead Memories,” which he never recorded but unearthed for Sugar's resurrection. “It's a failed-relationship song, nothing too unique for me,” he says with a chuckle. “But the riff is definitely a Sugar-type riff, and it was fun to get the three of us on the floor together to record for the first time in ages.” So much so, apparently, that the take of “House of Dead Memories” we're hearing is the first one. 


	In a curious bit of timing, another part of Mould's past will be resurfacing this fall. Arriving next month is 1985: The Miracle Year, a collection of unreleased Hüsker Dü live recordings from that pivotal moment in the band's history. Centered around a tape of an entire set recorded at Minneapolis' First Avenue club in January of that year, and fleshed out with other recordings from 1985, the album captures the blistering roar, frenetic energy, and punchy songs that Mould, Greg Norton, and the late Grant Hart made (along with covers of Donovan's “Sunshine Superman,” the Beatles' “Ticket to Ride” and “Helter Skelter,” and “Love Is All Around,” the Mary Tyler Moore Show theme song). It's a sound that, decades later, still surprised Mould when he heard the restored tapes. 


	“I was pretty speechless,” he says. “At that period, we were firing on so many cylinders at once that I never had a moment to stop and think. I just knew we were the best. I didn't know how much fire we had, so to hear it close to 40 years later, I was like, ‘Jesus Christ, this is insane.'”


	As Mould has talked about and written about in his memoir See a Little Light, Hüsker Dü could be an insane experience unto itself, thanks to tension between Mould and Hart, but the time frame of the collection brought back largely positive memories. “What we did in January '85 is in such contrast to whatever collapse happened in December of '87 and whatever animus happened in the decades after,” he says. “Grant and I were in touch, but it was a complicated, complex situation. We were very strong-minded, very stubborn, opinionated young men in a band. But 1985 was the year New Day Rising came out, and going into the summer Grant and I took full control of everything and we made ‘Makes No Sense at All' and then Flip Your Wig. Those were good times.”

	Mould particularly feels the absence of Hart (who died in 2017 of liver cancer) in the album's packaging. “Grant was always in charge of the art department, and it's been tough,” he says. “When a new designer comes along, I'm like, ‘Well, let me think about what Grant would have think of this.' People step in and do what they can. But for me personally, it's always, ‘What would Grant do with this?' It's a big chair to fill.”

	











	As far as Sugar, Mould says the response to their reunion announcement and “House of Dead Memories” will determine what to do beyond the two sets of concerts already set. “I don't want to get out too far in front of the skis, as they say,” he says. “People's reactions will probably guide a lot of the possibilities in front of us, whether it's more songs or more shows. All three of us are all in for whatever feels right. I just want to see if people are still interested.”

Justin Timberlake has paid tribute to D'Angelo, whose three solo albums — his debut, Brown Sugar, 2000's Voodoo, and 2014's Black Messiah — reshaped the landscape of soul music and helped ignite a new era. Following D'Angelo's passing on Oct. 14 at 51, Timberlake shared how the visionary's work impacted his own musical journey and how he had the opportunity to meet him backstage at Radio City Music Hall.


	“I'll never forget hearing Brown Sugar for the first time. It changed me. You changed me,” wrote Timberlake in his letter posted to Instagram Stories, calling the record the “most pivotal moment in establishing confidence in my own voice.” 


	“For the first time, I heard a sound that reflected the sounds I grew up with — early R&B but now it was intertwined with a modern edge,” he continued. “The chords and arrangement carried a mixture of church/jazz/funk, the harmonies delicately dancing with one another. It sat in my spirit and always will.”

	Timberlake went on to praise Voodoo as his “favorite mixed album of all time.” He added, “The legendary players and collaborators. The sounds, the way it made colors dance around my head. It grabbed me. It shook me. I was changed once again.” 

	











	The “Selfish” singer also said that the Voodoo tour stop at Radio City was “one of the best concerts” of his life. “You. Quest. Pino. Poyser. And everyone on that stage had just ripped the faces off that crowd,” Timberlake reminisced. “And then I was lucky enough to grab a sacred moment with you backstage. And tell you how in awe of you I was.” The singer said that his previously posted photo of him and D'Angelo was taken at that exact moment and when they met, he was “kind, under-spoken.” Timberlake added, “I will never forget that.”

	











	While Timberlake said he could go on about D'Angelo's breadth of work including his “favorite Lauryn collab,” to “put it the way I know best in this moment: you took R&B and put it in all capitals.”

	Last month, Nicki Minaj revealed the release date for her sixth studio album. The follow-up to 2023's Pink Friday 2 would arrive on March 27, 2026, the rapper announced on social media. A few weeks have passed since the date was set, but Minaj has hit pause on her countdown.


	“Ok I'm not going to put out the album anymore,” she wrote today on social platform X. “No more music.” At the end of the post, Minaj added, “Hope you're happy now” and tagged Jay-Z's account. Bidding her fans farewell, she wrote, “Bye, Barbz. Love you for life.”


	To its credit, her fan base has been calling her bluff in response. The replies to the post express full disregard for the statement with fans stating that they simply don't believe her.


	Reps for Minaj did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.

	In the posts that preceded the apparent album cancellation, Minaj spoke about dissenters who “don't want me to put out music.” Without explicitly naming any parties, she continued, “Me winning makes them feel like they lost. They're right. However, it didn't have to be this way. Lots of ppl part ways in business. They know how successful my next album is going to be.”

	In other posts, Minaj criticized Roc Nation CEO Desiree Perez, nodding to discontent between her and the label. She specifically referenced a legal battle in which she and husband Kenneth Petty were ordered to pay $500,000 to a security guard over an alleged backstage altercation that left the man with a broken jaw. The ruling was issued from a Los Angeles judge in March 2024.

	











	Minaj commented on a TikTok post from Page Six that claimed she has “refused” to pay the court ordered amount. “Desiree Perez you mad. Ahhhhahahaaaaaaa,” she wrote. “CONSPIRACY. FALSE IMPROSONMENT. CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS!!!! ROC NATION CEO. ААНААААНННААААА.”

	In her X post about the parties allegedly pushing back on her album, Minaj said, “Tried to sign Wayne, Drake, me. So they keep wanting to take or stop my money simply b/c narcissists believe what you work hard for belongs to them. Fuming b/c they can't siphon anymore energy, money, blessings, love, grace, joy, PEACE… the culture. No successful tours. Just vibes & payola.”


	Fans will have to wait until March to see whether Minaj was truly bluffing, though they've been looking forward to a new project from the rapper since September 2024. At the time, she announced plans to release an entirely new album rather than an extensive deluxe version of Pink Friday 2. “The new music is just too good to be thrown away on a deluxe album,” she said. “Last night, the songs I recorded were just way too iconic.”

	The government shutdown has been dragging on for two weeks. It's been a dystopian stretch for America's military and veteran community. The stoppage, led by President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress, has frozen military pay, leaving active-duty military families wondering how they will pay their mortgages, feed their kids, and afford life-saving medicine.


	House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) recently went on C-SPAN, where he fielded a question from an American whose husband serves, and who suffers from PTSD from two tours in Afghanistan. She was not happy, noting that if they miss a paycheck their children won't be able to get the medication they need to survive. “As a Republican, I'm very disappointed in my party, and I'm very disappointed in you, because you have the power to call the House back,” the caller said. “You refuse to do that just for a show.”


	Johnson responded by saying he was sorry and blaming Democrats.

	Trump also blamed Democrats in a Truth Social post a few days later, writing that the administration has “identified funds” to pay the troops. Congress has appropriated those funds elsewhere, though, and it's unclear if the president can redirect them. Regardless, the uncertainty has military families literally worried for their lives as Republicans continue to keep the government closed over their insistence on gutting Medicaid, the health care program serving low-income and disabled Americans.

	











Veterans are also being squeezed. The Trump administration has announced mass layoffs across the federal work source, which employs one third of veterans, many of which are disabled. Several Department of Veterans Affairs programs have ceased operating during the shutdown, as well. The fact that the layoffs will disproportionately affect the men and women who have served doesn't seem to be of any concern to the president. 

	











	The Office of Management and Budget — headed by Project 2025 mastermind Russell Vought — confirmed Friday that “substantial” reductions in force, or RIFs, have begun across multiple federal agencies, including the Departments of Education, Treasury, and Health and Human Services. These are not abstract bureaucratic cuts; they are the livelihoods of men and women who have already served their country. Nearly one-third of the federal workforce is composed of veterans, many of them disabled. Now, they face unemployment not because of performance but because of politics.

	Meanwhile, almost unbelievably, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that the U.S. military will be outsourcing at least part of Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho to the Qatari government. Even some of Trump's most fervent allies in right-wing media have been aghast at the decision, citing Qatar's connections to terrorism, including the 9/11 attacks. Many veterans feel betrayed, just as they have been since Trump took office and started gutting their jobs and services earlier this year.


	At a time when America's military families are already under immense strain, the actions the administration has taken since the shutdown began represent something far more dangerous than neglect. They signal a quiet dismantling of the institutions that sustain our all-volunteer force and the post-service opportunities veterans have earned. The mass layoffs of federal employees, the decision to allow a foreign government to operate on U.S. soil, and a shutdown that threatens to withhold pay from active-duty troops all point to one chilling truth: America's service members and veterans are under assault.


	This progression is deeply suggestive of Vladimir Putin's path to autocratic consolidation in Russia. What took Putin decades to construct — the hollowing out of independent institutions and empowerment of intelligence services, the marginalization or elimination of rivals, the suppression of meaningful civic and economic pluralism, the deployment of private or semiprivate security forces — and what Trump seems to be laying the foundation for amount to rewriting the rules to stay in power indefinitely.

	For Putin, this was a calculated strategy to preserve Russia's global influence even as its economy contracted to roughly the size of Texas.

	Trump and Republicans in Congress could end this shutdown in a second. They won't because this chaos is by design. We're watching the very class of public servants who protect our democracy — the only ones capable of stopping a coup against the U.S. Constitution — being dismantled and replaced right before our eyes.

	Before the release of Lauryn Hill's masterful solo debut, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, the singer met with D'Angelo to record one of the album's most captivating tracks, “Nothing Even Matters.” The duet would play a part in expanding and nurturing soul's rebirth in the Nineties, while both artists as individuals would make even deeper impacts felt across genres today. Hill's record took home five Grammy Awards, while D'Angelo would go on to release 2000's Voodoo and 2014's Black Messiah (following his own debut, Brown Sugar).


	On Tuesday, Hill penned a letter to D'Angelo following the visionary's passing on Oct. 14 at the age of 51 following a long battle with cancer.  “People need reflection,” began Hill in her tribute. “I regret not having more time with you,” she continued. “Your undeniable beauty and talent were not of this world, and a presence not of this world needs protection in a world that covets light and the anointing of God. You sir, moved us, stirred us, inspired and even intimidated others to action with your genius.”

	She continued, “Thank you for being a beacon of light to a generation and beyond who had no remembrance of the legacy that preceded us. Thank you for charting the course and for making space during a time when no similar space really existed. You imaged a unity of strength and sensitivity in Black manhood to a generation that only saw itself as having to be one or the other.”

	“It is my earnest prayer that you are in peace, far away from selfishness, fear and/or controlling interests. Far from possessiveness, far from greed, far from manipulation, far from exploitation, far from intentionally designed chaos and that you Brother are in peace, in bliss and in eternal light and fulfillment with our Father in heaven,” Hill wrote. “I Love you and I miss you. May God grant peace and shelter to your family, true friends and genuine appreciators, Brother, King.”


	When speaking to Rolling Stone in 2008, D'Angelo looked back at this time working with Hill, calling her “warm and sweet.” “Originally, we were going to swap tunes for each other's projects because I was working on Voodoo at the same time and my keyboardist James Poyser was also working with her,” D'Angelo recalled at the time. “I went to her house in New Jersey, she played a lot of songs for me and gave me a rough copy to listen to. When Lauryn and I went into the studio together, I laid down my vocals in the course of an hour.”

I
t seemed like any city council meeting: a beige, cinderblock room, metal chairs, a U-shaped table with a maroon tablecloth reading “Leonia Board of Education.” But for the men — some sporting matching T-shirts, claiming that they were survivors of sexual abuse at the hands of a once-beloved teacher — it signified a release, a silence broken.


	Paul King, 59, choked back sobs as he took the mic, his family thronged behind him on a school lunch table bench. “I hope that none of you have ever experienced sexual assault,” he said in measured tones, despite the emotion. “So what do I want? That's a good question. I don't know. But I do know that I want what's fair. I want the people that are victims to be free to come out. To heal. … There's a saying that a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. This crisis has been going on for over 50 years.”


	“That was like the most I've ever seen him cry in my life,” King's 24-year-old son, also named Paul, later tells me. He sat behind his father during his speech, nodding emphatically. “He was reaching really deep down into his memories, into his darkest, repressed stuff, to figure out what happened to him and convey it in a way that was more digestible for these guys sitting on the council.”

	











	Nearly half a century ago, King and his fellow survivors saw their idyllic enclave of Leonia, New Jersey, turn into a hostile place. A leafy, close-knit community less than 10 miles from New York City, Leonia isn't that kind place where tragedy often happens — in fact, it was the model for the suburban utopia depicted in Disney's WandaVision. But, much like in that show, there was unease beneath the surface: back in the Eighties, King and the rest watched as their beloved hometown rallied around elementary school teacher John Anagnosti, a.k.a. Mr. A — despite the fact that Mr. A was convicted of abusing one of their fellow students. It was a stunning state of affairs: a young boy's pain dismissed, his abuser given a slap on the wrist and thousands of dollars of legal support from local parents. Now, though, due to expanding statutes of limitations on child sexual abuse cases, more and more of those who say they are Mr. A's victims are coming forward, including two brothers who sued the school board, settling for a combined $6 million. As one of the plaintiff's attorneys claims, more than a dozen survivors could be coming forward in the coming weeks — alleged victims of abuse that reportedly spanned nearly 15 years. And his supporters? Some have apologized to survivors; others are now silent.

	AT 66, MICHAEL GONZALES RESEMBLES a svelte Santa Claus, wiry and strong. But back in the 1970s, he was an eight-year-old with a high and tight haircut and a mischievous smile — a Dennis the Menace incarnate. He also believes he was likely Mr. A's first victim.


	At the time, unconventional teaching was all the rage: field trips, dinners at teachers' houses, ballgames — anything to get fidgety, bored students engaged. Mr. A embraced that educational style, even earning him a glowing piece in the local paper in 1971 about a class trip to dig fossils with a Columbia University professor. ”I spend so many hours with the kids outside the classroom because that's when I truly get to see them as human beings,” he later told The New York Times. ”They're more open then. I feel that if I get to know them, I can help them.”


	Unfortunately, it seems, those outings also allowed Mr. A unfettered access to his alleged victims, like Gonzales. “The bell rings for lunch, and he would put his arm out to prevent me from going out the classroom door, and that's when the molestation started,” Gonzales says. He says Mr. A molested him until seventh grade, roughly 500 times, a claim also included in his lawsuit against the school board. “All the kids are out in the school yard playing, and I'm here being molested. That same scenario over and over again, but not just in the classroom…. That all started with me; that was his plan on how he gathered the kids. That was his master plan.”

	Gonzales' brother, Joe, also says he became one of Mr. A's victims at age six, when Michael went by the teacher's house to rake leaves with his brother in tow. Michael didn't find out until years later, but the experience nearly ruined both of the brothers' lives. “I became a bully. I ruined friendships,” Michael says. “I came out of high school and I didn't know how to read, because I couldn't concentrate.” Joe, 60, turned to drinking at age 12; he was 35 days sober when we spoke. “I wasn't born an alcoholic,” he says. “I was born a normal kid that was abused at five, six years old, and alcohol, it was a savior, and it is the love of my life.”


	The brothers' pain only intensified in January of 1981, when an elementary school student publicly accused Mr. A of molestation. “I carried around that burden,” Michael says, his voice breaking. “Why didn't I say something? It's not what he did to me. These kids [that he may have abused], who knows if they're even alive…. It's just a total failure of humanity.” It didn't help that the people of Leonia seemed firmly on Mr. A's side back in 1981. When the child's father paraded through the town center with a sign proclaiming the teacher's guilt — then took the pulpit at the Presbyterian Church to do the same — he was charged with harassment, and endangering his child by keeping him out of school, and ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation, according to The New York Times. 

	











	Mr. A wasn't completely able to escape consequences. In spring of that year, following an investigation he was charged with molesting the student, pleaded guilty, and resigned. Still, by June, he'd changed his tune — especially after local parents had raised $7,500 for his defense. Mr. A then opted to retract his plea, claiming that he'd only fessed up to the crime to spare the child “emotional trauma.” The case then moved to state Superior Court, and in 1982, he was convicted of sexual assault. 


	It may seem strange in 2025 that Leonia would stand by an alleged child abuser, but even the headlines of the day reflect a different time: “Leonia Parents Support Teacher in Morals Case,” trumpets one, while another article, titled “Supporting a Neighbor,” casts a benefit dinner at All Saints Episcopal Church as a heartwarming communion in support of a beloved educator. ”When Mr. A resigned,” one child said, according to the paper, “we got a teacher who just told us what to do and sat there. Mr. A said it was better to learn by experiencing things. We went to New York to the planetarium, to the World Trade Center, to the Statue of Liberty and other places. The class would go to his house for dinner and talk about what we'd seen.”


	According to the the Times, the local TV shop even put up an open letter from Mr. A thanking the town for its support — a sore point for Joe, who worked at the store. Paul King had to walk by that poster every day on his walk to school, silently seething. “Joe told me, ‘Every time I walked into that TV [store], I look at that effing poster,” he says. “I'm thinking, ‘I've been abused for over two years by this guy, like big time.'…It wasn't, ‘You show me your weenie and I'll show you mine,' it was full-on physical touching and beyond.' But nobody believed the kid.” King has not filed a suit.


	Michael was similarly enraged by the support. He was on leave from the Army when he heard the news of Mr. A's conviction, and wracked with guilt and shame (and alcohol), he went to the man's house with the intention of killing him. Mr. A let him into his condo, and after calling his lawyer or psychiatrist — Michael isn't sure which — Michael changed his mind. “You know, it tortures me,” he says. “I could have went to jail. I could have ruined my whole life.” 


	Even after Mr. A was convicted of sexual assault, the judgment was muted. He received only three years of probation and a $25 fine. “I don't know what other punishment this man deserves,” the judge opined at the time, while Mr. A took the stand to tell the court: “I would rather cut off my right hand than harm a hair on a child. My love for children is genuine.” It's not all that surprising, then, that Leonia received a glowing write-up in the infamous pedophile magazine, Pan, an underground publication about “boy love.” “He was indicted by a grand jury in October. But instead of running him out of town, as, sadly, often happens in such cases, the community rallied to his support,” the magazine said. “It must have occurred to more than one of the good parents at the All Saints Episcopal Church: John Anagnosti is a paedophile in the true sense of the word; he loves children, and whether or not there is a sexual expression of this love would not seem to be very important.” 

	











	MR. A DIED IN 2020, BUT THE MEN never forgot him — or what he did. And, at the time, they suffered in silence, since neither King nor the Gonzaleses knew that they shared the same abuser. “I had lost my hope,” Michael says. “I'm going to the grave with the secret. …I'm laying in bed, and I see this commercial on TV, and it says if you were molested by a teacher in New Jersey or something or another, to call this number. I called the number.”


	The law firm from the commercial then connected Michael with Baldante & Rubenstein, which has seen a massive uptick in such cases since New Jersey, along with several other states, changed its statute of limitations for child sexual abuse survivors in 2019. Now, Michael and his brother could fight back. “When you sit down with these victims and they start to tell their story, oftentimes we're the first person they've ever spoken to about it,” lawyer John Baldante says. He adds that 80 to 90 percent of their cases deal with sexual abuse cases. “They start crying like the eight- and 10-year old-children that they were when they were abused. … One of my clients once said, ‘It's the first time I've ever spoken out on behalf of that 10-year-old version of myself.'”


	With Baldante's help, Joe and Michael each sued the Leonia Township Board of Education, alleging that the school and board knew about Mr. A's reported actions, but did nothing to stop them. “Despite such knowledge,” Michael's suit reads, “[the school] failed to adequately respond to stop harassment…against the plaintiff.” 


	The brothers garnered a combined $6 million in separate settlements in 2024. Still, according to Michael's daughter, Keegan, “this lawsuit wasn't a payday. It was acknowledgement that something horrific happened, and the school system failed these kids. The story does not end here. We're going to continue speaking about this, because this goes beyond compensation. We want people's stories to be heard.” To date, Baldante says several other men have come forward with similar stories about Mr. A, and he expects there will be many more. The firm is in the process of working up further litigation. “There's no question that there's undoubtedly hundreds [of victims],” he claims. “Mr. A was the Pied Piper.” Although stressing that there are only three cases of litigation currently pending against the teacher and school board, Baldante says “in the context of cases against a single perpetrator within a public school Board of Education, the claims against Mr. A are evolving into one of the largest clusters of claims.”

	











	AND THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THAT city council meeting. Through a series of happenstances, Keegan met the younger Paul King, and they figured out that both their fathers claim to have been victims of Mr. A — right before the Gonzaleses and another alleged survivor, Daniel Schlademan, were due to speak at the meeting on June 17. In light of more and more alleged victims coming forward, the men planned to address the Board of Education, calling on them to take steps to bring closure and comfort to the victims, as well as concrete moves to ensure the safety of the town's children in the future.


	King joined them, and, one by one, they emptied their hearts in that ugly municipal board room. The men acknowledged that the school board is populated by far different people than it was 50 years ago, but they still want justice — and recognition of systemic failure. “The Leonia school district dismissed the reports of sexual abuse made by students and tried to sweep Anagnosti's predatory conduct under the carpet,” says the lawyer, Baldante. “Unfortunately, these efforts by Leonia only compounded the problem.” 


	“The Leonia School District is currently involved in active litigation related to these matters, and therefore we cannot provide specific comments,” said Daniel Lee, President of Leonia Board of Education. “That said, our lack of direct response to the public comments on this matter must not be mistaken for indifference to the pleas of those who have come forward. We recognize how painful these issues may be for victims, their families, and the wider community. We take this concern very seriously. The Board's goal is always to foster a safe, supportive environment, and we are mindful of the role we can play in the healing process. At this moment, however, our legal and ethical responsibilities require restraint to avoid jeopardizing the district or those it serves now and in the future.”


	In a 2022 filing, the BOE denied “any wrongdoing or negligence,” adding: “The Board did not have actual or constructive knowledge of the allegations of sexual misconduct of Defendant John Anagnosti. The Board did not enable any alleged sexual abuse and the Board did not fail to take action with regards to any alleged sexual abuse.”

	Now, all the men can do is wait. Wait for the school board to listen to them. Wait for more people to come forward. Schlademan created a website in May outlining the town's history with Mr. A called Voices of Leonia; he's currently fighting his own legal battle against the school board and declined to be interviewed for this article. Meanwhile, Baldante is interviewing more survivors of Mr. A in preparation for future lawsuits. 

	











	And the Gonzaleses? They're just continuing to heal. “It's so important to me that this story is told,” Michael says. “Everybody's at fault here — full circle. I've been disappointed so many times. This guy is a monster and nobody paid attention.”

A senior U.S. Navy officer has claimed his crew witnessed a massive unidentified underwater object racing through the ocean at around 200mph. 

The startling testimony adds to growing reports of unidentified submerged objects, or USOs, being investigated by the Pentagon and Congress.

Congressman Tim Burchett revealed the account as part of a congressional probe into unexplained aerial and underwater phenomena. 

“A very high-ranking member of the Navy described some underwater experiences with something that was doing 200mph underwater,” he said. “It was as big as a football field. That's no fish.”

Burchett told U.S. television that no man-made craft could reach such underwater speeds. 

“Not with our technology, no,” he said. “The best we have is probably in the high 30s.” 

His remarks suggest that whatever was seen moved nearly six times faster than the most advanced military submarines or torpedoes.

According to Burchett, these encounters occurred in “very deep water areas,” making them even harder to explain.

Officials are now examining reports of Unidentified Submerged Objects (USOs) alongside flying UFOs, suggesting that unexplained technology might be operating both in the sky and under the sea.

Burchett dismissed the idea that these objects might belong to any known defence program. 

“Why would we risk multi-million-dollar apparatus? Why would we put something in the air around our best pilots that could have a crash?” he asked. “It would be stupid.”

The claims echo those of Bob McGwire, a professor and intelligence officer who once worked aboard the USS Hampton. 

He said he experienced a similar encounter while on duty, hearing “something whizzing by” the submarine at speeds faster than sound.

The USS Hampton's sonar allegedly tracked the unidentified object travelling faster than the speed of sound through water, a feat no torpedo or known craft can achieve. 

“The sub's sonar picked it up. It blew by us,” McGwire said. 

He stressed that it wasn't part of any U.S. experiment or secret project.

McGwire said he kept the incident secret for decades due to the classified nature of his naval work. 

“It is mine to tell whoever I want. They blew it,” he said, referring to the Navy's failure to properly document the event. 

He only came forward when the Pentagon began its probe into hundreds of UFO and USO reports.

He recalled how “a person with knowledge of onboard systems” confirmed something had sped past their submarine “faster than the speed of sound.” 

The engagement lasted only seconds but was so distinct that everyone on board felt the shockwave.

The story gained traction after a 2019 video surfaced showing the USS Omaha tracking a glowing orb off the coast of San Diego. 

The object hovered briefly, then plunged into the water, disappearing completely.

“Wow, it splashed,” a crew member can be heard shouting in the footage.

The Pentagon is now examining over 800 unexplained encounters, including those beneath the ocean. 

Both McGwire and Burchett argue that these sightings prove humans may not be alone, or that unknown technology is operating in Earth's most remote environments.

The ""MLB on FOX' crew preview the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the NLCS. 

Los Angeles Dodgers star Teoscar Hernandez revealed that he and his wife will be switching their living quarters while in Milwaukee to face the Brewers in the National League Championship Series. 

It isn't because their hotel isn't good enough, but rather, Hernandez's wife, Jennifer, is not fond of the rumors of paranormal activity connected to it.

The Pfister Hotel is historic in Milwaukee, and that's where the Dodgers have been staying for the start of this series. However, Hernandez said before Game 2 on Wednesday night that he and his wife are moving due to rumors that the Pfister Hotel is haunted.

This isn't uncommon, as Mookie Betts continues to book Airbnbs during the series in Milwaukee because of the haunting stories about the hotel. 

Hernandez said his wife heard some stories about alleged issues while staying at the Pfister from other Dodgers' significant others. The player himself doesn't care for the stories, though.

""I don't believe in ghosts,"" he said, via The New York Post. ""I have stayed in there before. I've never seen anything or heard anything.

""But my wife is on this trip, and she said she doesn't want to stay there. So we have to find another hotel. But I've been hearing from other players and other wives that it's something happening in these couple of nights.""

As for what Hernandez has heard from teammates, he said ""some of the rooms, the lights goes off and on. And the doors, there are noises, footsteps, things like that, I don't know.""

No matter the stories, Hernandez is focused on helping his team repeat as World Series champions, and he helped the cause early in Wednesday's game. Hernandez belted a home run as part of a two-run top of the second inning that gave the Dodgers the lead after the Brewers jumped ahead with a Jackson Chourio solo homer in their first trip to the plate. 

The Dodgers were able to stave off the Brewers' ninth-inning rally in Game 1 on Monday night, as Blake Treinen got Brice Turange to strike out to end the game with bases loaded for Milwaukee. 

If the Dodgers are unable to come away with a two-game lead in the best-of-seven series, there is a chance Hernandez and his wife won't have to return to Milwaukee.

Science is supposed to be about finding and assessing facts. But when the topic turns to extraterrestrial life, much public discussion seems aimed simply to keep up hope that They're Out There. There's nothing wrong with that in principle, as long as we acknowledge the nature of the situation. Otherwise, we are building empires of the imagination.

A few stories that hit the fan this year seem to fit that description:

But the idea of discovering technosignatures within our own solar system, on Mars, the Moon or even on Earth, is far harder to accept. One reason is that science simply isn't prepared for it. Theoretical discussions are limited, and serious search efforts remain rare. In mainstream scientific circles, the topic is still considered fringe — which only reinforces the lack of rigorous enquiry into solar system technosignatures.

The deeper issue, though, may be psychological and political. A close encounter with alien technology could spark geopolitical instability. Unlike some abstract suggestion of a distant exoplanet signal, a discovery near Earth would carry the weight of perceived threat. World governments might scramble to respond, not out of curiosity, but fear. To consider such a possibility would demand new strategies, new science and a level of intellectual risk we've so far resisted. And if the discovery does ever come, it could provoke fear, confusion or overreaction. 

This is basically a science fiction premise with a flourish of sociology. We have found no hard evidence of any kind of alien technology that would justify a search for it. The search is really for emotional gratification.

That idea is gaining traction thanks to a pair of missions — NASA's OSIRIS-REx and Japan's Hayabusa2 — that, in the past few years, have returned rocks from asteroids back to Earth.

Analysis of those samples suggests that some of the building blocks of life are present in the asteroids, raising the prospect that those same building blocks, and perhaps even life itself, could have been delivered to Earth.

It's “absolutely” plausible, says Dr Jason Dworkin, project scientist on the OSIRIS-REx mission at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. 

The word “plausible” is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. A thesis can be plausible without any evidence whatever. It need only remain within the rules of reasonable speculation.

Finding extraterrestrial siblings would inspire us to reach out beyond the limited experiences we had so far on our home planet. There are richer opportunities in our cosmic street than available at home…

Rolf [Dobelli] asked: “And why should we expect aliens to be kind to us and not have the gangster mentality?” I explained that gangsters often have a short life because they engage in conflicts and play Russian roulette under risky circumstances. Any interstellar visitors to our back yard must have survived under duress for billions of years. They might abide by the principle of “survival of the kindest.” 

There is a novel lurking in there but not a taxpayer-funded research program.

The very fact that the universe is so silent and ET is not obvious may support an argument for pessimism. Perhaps benign alien civilizations are in the majority, but they know something that newbies such as ourselves do not, namely, that the universe is a very dangerous place, and there are some really bad actors out there. They therefore intentionally keep quiet and low profiles, lest they provoke the bad actors. 

Perhaps. We usually speculate about behavior when guessing the intentions of entities of whose existence we are already certain. Here we are asked to speculate about the psychology of intelligent aliens without finding so much as a single extraterrestrial bacterium.

But wait. That's very like the Privileged Planet hypothesis. Such reflections are more commonly associated with belief in a Creator than with belief in countless ET civilizations. And the only thing Privileged Planet's ideas have going for them is a much closer relationship to facts.

The question looms: How much can science avoid facts while retaining the character of science?

NASA astronaut Don Pettit tests the Mould Effect in space.

NASA astronaut Don Pettit has helped YouTuber Steve Mould with the final step in his ""weird chain theory"": testing the idea in space.

In 2013, YouTuber and science communicator Steve Mould brought the ""chain fountain"", an unsolved problem in physics, to the attention of the wider public. The effect, sometimes referred to as the ""Mould effect"" for his work on it, is strange to see. Simply put, place a long chain in a container, pull one end out, and let it fall to the floor. Now watch as the whole chain seems to jump up out of the glass, before falling towards the floor.

     

The effect, though independently found by Mould, was known about before, even if it was unexplained. Since the effect was popularized by Mould, he, Mehdi Sadaghdar of YouTube channel ElectroBOOM, and several academic studies have attempted to explain it. Mould has also set the record for the biggest chain fountain.

    

What is really puzzling about the effect is how the chain appears to rise out of the glass before starting its downward journey.

""Motivated by the fact that the chain has a maximum local curvature, and the fact that the phenomenon does not happen with a chain that does not have this maximum bending curvature, the chain was modelled as a sequence of freely joined rods,"" a 2016 paper on the topic explains.

""When a rod is pulled from one end, the end attached to the part of the chain that is already moving, the rod tends to rotate around its center of mass; consequently, the other end will go down, towards the surface of beads, kicking the pile of beads. Finally, there is a reaction force to this kick that pushes the beads upwards.""

Mould's explanation (see above for the full explanation, and an awesome chain fountain) is generally thought to be correct, after a long (and friendly) argument and experiments against ElectroBOOM (and further analysis by others). 

""In short, the chain rises above the pot in a fountain because of an extra upward force coming from the pot,"" Mould explains in his latest video, partly shot in space. ""How strong does that force need to be, though? Well, it needs to be able to overcome the weight of this arc of chain that would obviously fall under gravity. And that's it. That's all you need.""

Unfortunately, in order to test his idea, Mould needed gravity to disappear. This is where NASA astronaut Don Pettit came in. Pettit, who had been intrigued by Mould's videos, offered to test the behavior of chains on the International Space Station (ISS).

 

""According to the maths, that yanking of the chain has no influence on the ark at all. If gravity wasn't a factor, the ark would be fixed there in space even though it was being yanked downwards at one end. Or at least that's the theory,"" Mould explained. ""That's what we want to test. We want to test the theory that a chain moving at constant speed will flow through its own shape so long as it isn't acted on by an external force like gravity.""

In a phone call with Mould, Pettit attempted to tug on the chain and test whether the chain truly did flow through its own shape, supporting Mould's idea, or whether it did something else. Unfortunately, it's pretty difficult to get a chain to remain stationary in microgravity, with Pettit describing them as moving around like molecules. 

Mould suggested that instead they put a chain into a loop, and stretch it out to make a rectangular shape. Then Pettit could grab the longer sides of the rectangle-ish chain and set them in motion, pushing the top one right and the bottom left, for example. If he was correct, the chain should flow through that rectangle shape, rather than spread out into a circle as you might expect.

The setup was not ideal, and the two were limited by the ISS passing out of reach of communication satellites. However, before the informal experiment ended, they did appear to set chains in motion that followed their own shape, seemingly adding evidence to Mould's explanation for the effect.

""It was a great demonstration seeing it pass through the same path through the loop and your explanation about why it would eventually turn into a full circle due to friction was pretty adequate,"" Sadaghdar said, adding that he wouldn't have to embarrass himself by making another debunk video.

""Although you didn't quite demonstrate if the path will remain the same if the chain wasn't in a loop. Another simulation might be nice, but what would be better is to take 100m of chain into space and drag it behind you in a spacewalk. Do it.""

Three years ago, The Black Phone (reviewed here) made a real impression by being the rare horror film to feel both grounded and fantastical. The abduction/serial killer elements were gritty and realistic, while the voices from beyond the grave were a special sauce to give the flick a unique personality. At the same time, a sequel didn't even seem possible, besides feeling unnecessary. Well, along comes Black Phone 2, and it turns out that all involved were aware of that feeling. Instead of rehashing what's come before, the now series opts to change things up in a major way, giving it a freshness that fuels things from start to finish.

Black Phone 2 moves the franchise towards a more supernatural territory, clearly taking a page from A Nightmare on Elm Street and some of its own sequels. It has a slower pace and a more serious feeling, especially in the first act, and really the first half, but once we get to The Grabber being a new Freddy Krueger, we're really cooking with gas. The horror wheel isn't being re-invented, to be sure, but it is showing how a property can extend its life by being creative and not playing it safe.

Four years have passed since the events of the last film, where then thirteen year old Finn (Mason Thames) was abducted by the serial killer known as The Grabber (Ethan Hawke). Finn ultimately killed his captor and escaped, though now as a seventeen year old, he's still dealing with the trauma. His younger sister Gwen (Madeleine McGraw) is now fifteen and beginning to receive calls from the black phone in her dreams. While Finn numbs himself with weed nightly, Gwen is seeing disturbing visions of three boys being stalked and murdered at Alpine Lake, a nearby winter camp. Needing to solve the mystery for her own sanity, as well as perhaps for her brother as well, she convinces them to sign up as counselors in training, in order to visit the camp.

Arriving at Alpine Lake with Ernesto (Miguel Mora), they're welcomed by Armando (Demián Bichir), though not everyone there is so kind. Plus, it's at the camp that Gwen begins to be tormented in her dreams by The Grabber, who is dead but very much still a threat. As she learns about how the killer and her family have history, he begins attacking her when she falls asleep. Along with Finn, she'll need to confront The Grabber, even as he's gotten more powerful in death, especially once they realize what he's done to them.

Ethan Hawke returns as The Grabber, alongside prior heroes Madeline McGraw and Mason Thames (as well as Jeremy Davies, playing Finn and Gwen's father). This time, McGraw is more of the lead and really does anchor the film. She's strong and determined, though also gets put through the ringer like a true scream queen. Mason Thames showcases the trauma that The Black Phone subjected him to in a way that few horror sequels opt to do, with compelling results. As for Hawke, he's not in it quite as much as last time, though he's just as disturbing, albeit in a new way. He's again having a blast being a villain, this time embracing the demonic side of being dead but still very much an omnipresent threat. If he's going to keep playing The Grabber every so often, sign me up. Demián Bichir is a bit wasted, though always a welcome presence. In addition to Davies and the aforementioned Mora, supporting players here include Anna Lore, Arianna Rivas, and more.

Co-writer/director Scott Derrickson, along with his writing partner C. Robert Cargill, is clearly influenced by the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, taking his series in this supernatural direction. Things start off pretty slowly, but once the rhythm sets in, it picks up in a big way, especially when The Grabber turns Freddy-esque. Derrickson and Cargill are interested in some heavy themes and don't shy away from darkness, though occasionally their script is on the nose and has characters saying things you only hear in the midst of a horror movie. At the same time, Derrickson's direction is a highlight, especially with how the dream sequences are shot on Super 8, giving them a unique quality. It's jarring at first, but by the end, it becomes a defining feature of Black Phone 2. That sort of creativity rarely arises in horror sequels. 

Black Phone 2 is hardly groundbreaking, but by mixing things up, the series manages to stay fresh. I'd happily see a third one if Derrickson, Hawke, and company want to keep giving us more of The Grabber. He's not quite as iconic as Freddy, admittedly, but he's in that ballpark, which is something worth exploring more. Regardless, this sequel sets itself apart by being bold enough to do things differently than most.

SCORE: ★★★

“Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” star Lisa Barlow gets a psychic reading done at Whitney Rose‘s “Telepathic Tasting” event in episode 5. When her marriage to John Barlow is mentioned, Lisa finally opens up about the cracks in their relationship. 

Flashbacks during episode 5 shed light on some of the issues Lisa and John are going through in their relationship.

The first flashback showed a tense conversation between the couple that occurred one month prior to the psychic reading. They were discussing their son Jack Barlow‘s living arrangements when he returned from his mission trip.

“Jack and I were talking about two or three weeks ago. I actually was in favor of him getting an apartment,” John said.

“You were? I don't think he should be allowed to move out,” Lisa responded. This scene showed how the couple was on two completely different wavelengths when it came to their children.

Another flashback from a year ago showed Lisa telling John that he needs to “take it a little more seriously. I think it bothers me because I feel lonely in my feelings.”

“How can I take it more seriously? I stress about it just as much as you do,” John said.

“You don't act like you do, and that frustrates me,” replied Lisa.

Earlier in Season 6, Bronwyn Newport told Whitney that she saw legal documents related to a lawsuit Lisa was facing where she had secretly borrowed money from the “mystery man” that Angie Katsanevas had referenced in the past. It remains unclear if this accusation caused any strain in their marriage, and Lisa has already denied all of these legal claims against her.

Whitney invited an “intuitive consultant” named Terence to give the group one-on-one psychic readings during their wine tasing lunch. When Lisa first sat down with Terence, the first thing he asked was, “why do you feel like you're just rebuilding trust?” 

This immediately caused Lisa to break down in tears, reaching for her sunglasses to mask her emotions. “I don't know,” she said, her voice breaking.

“It's like an elastic band, you guys keep snapping back together,” said Terence. “You need to figure out how to communicate to each other again. I also look at this, and go, cause it feels like you have different paths. And I feel like you don't know how to find your way back to his path.” He continues to point out how much “angst and frustration,” there is in their marriage.

Lisa continued to agree with Terence. In her confessional, she explained to a producer, “marriage is hard,” while still struggling to control her emotions. She continued, “lately, I think with everything we have going on, we're, like, on totally different pages. Sometimes it feels like totally different planets.”

“I feel like he's my best friend. My person,” Lisa told Terence.

“But you're not on the same team.”

“We're not.”

The intuitive consultant concluded their session by stating, “until you get back to that same team, you're gonna feel, like, lost.”

At the end of her confessional, Lisa admitted, “I just feel, like, alone sometimes, you know? And it hurts.”

Superhero Globalist Conspiracy Theories over DC's K.O. in Titans #28, as well as Justice League Red #3 and Wonder Woman #26 (Spoilers)

Bleeding Cool mentioned that this might be coming… previously, I wrote, ""DC's K.O. is coming. The big knockdown fight event, to take on Darkseid. But before any of this can happen, something is going to have to happen to the Earth. Everyone is going to have to be evacuated. The entire planet. The fight is coming, it is coming to Earth, and there can be no harm done to the bystanders. Darkseid plans to build a new Apokolips on Earth."" Indeed, today's Justice League Red #3 by Saladin Ahmed and Clayton Henry sees Red Tornado prophesying such a future, and underlining the need to save Red Arrow, to stop it. 

Save the marksman, save the world.

But also it is a bit…

I mean, right? But while all that is going on, the Titans are dealing with the here and now. The DC K.O. battle is to find a champion imbued with Omega Energy to inherit the power of the Omega King rather than Darkseid. As I previously wrote, ""it's down to the Titans, minus those in the competition, to evacuate a planet of eight billion people. Ships, teleportation, city shrinking, whatever comes to hand. Oh, and they only have a week."" And in today's  Titans #28 by John Layman and Pete Woods are both published by DC Comics today, it comes to pass.

Rocketing populations into space in buildings that double as spaceships… and shrinking people to fit.

And it's not just the people who are being saved but also the supervillains.

Of course, as we saw in DC's K.O. #1, it seems that maybe that didn't work out as intended.

While on Earth, not everyone wants to go. As I previously wrote, …there are some who don't want to be evacuated. Who don't believe the superheroes. Who don't want to leave their homes, their possessions or their lives….""

…""And who have got placards to protest, presumably left over from COVID, or Absolute Power, dubbed ""evacuation truthers"". Amanda Waller taught humanity to mistrust the superheroes, and plenty, it seems, still think she was right…""

As we have seen from Moray Island in today's Wonder Woman #26 by Tom King and Daniel Sampere, they are not alone there either…

Mouse Man knows. Justice League Red #3 by Saladin Ahmed, Clayton Henry, Titans #28 by John Layman and Pete Woods and Wonder Woman #26 by Tom King and Daniel Sampere, are all published by DC Comics today.

Investigators with the Columbus Police Department are taking a fresh look at a cold case that has remained unsolved for nearly three decades.

Laura Chaney, 37, was found shot to death on Jan. 4, 1998, outside the former Peabody Apartments on Talbotton Road. The complex is now known as Ashley Station. Her killer has never been caught.

Chaney's children have made emotional pleas in previous interviews, asking anyone with information about their mother's murder to come forward to police.

The U.K. government on Oct. 15 imposed its ""strongest sanctions yet"" against Russia, blacklisting five individuals and 35 companies, including oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil, as part of a package targeting 90 new entities and vessels.  

The measures aim to choke off Russia's vital fossil fuel revenues that fund its war against Ukraine.

According to the U.K. Foreign Office, both Rosneft and Lukoil conduct business in sectors of ""strategic and economic significance"" to the Russian government. 

The sanctions include asset freezes and restrictions on trust and transport services, extending the reach of previous U.K. and EU measures targeting Russia's energy sector.

Rosneft alone accounts for nearly half of Russia's oil production and 6% of global output. The oil and gas industry generated 113 billion euros ($131 billion) in tax for the Kremlin in 2024, about a third of its total revenue, covering 83% of military expenditures.

""At this critical moment for Ukraine, Europe is stepping up,"" U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said. ""Together, the U.K. and our allies are piling the pressure on (Russian President Vladimir) Putin — going after his oil, gas, and shadow fleet.""

""We will not relent until he abandons his failed war of conquest and gets serious about peace.""

The new U.K. measures also target foreign companies that facilitate Russian oil exports, including India's Nayara Energy — in which Rosneft holds the largest share — and China's National Pipeline Group Beihai Liquefied Natural Gas Co. Ltd.

Three companies based in the United Arab Emirates — Novus Energy DMCC, Wissol Commodities FZCO, and Alghaf Marine DMCC — were also sanctioned for transporting or trading Russian oil. 

The U.K. also blacklisted 51 vessels belonging to Russia's so-called ""shadow fleet,"" tankers that operate under opaque ownership and flags of convenience to evade Western sanctions.

Additional restrictions were placed on several Russian banks, the National Card Payment System, and technology firms operating in sectors deemed strategically vital to the Kremlin.

As Russia's traditional oil revenues continue to fall, the Kremlin has sought to expand its liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports to offset losses. In response, the U.K. extended sanctions to seven specialized LNG tankers and China's Beihai LNG terminal.

London's latest measures add to growing Western efforts to tighten enforcement of sanctions and restrict Russia's ability to reorient its oil trade through third countries.

The U.S. has not directly sanctioned Rosneft or Lukoil, but it has blacklisted some subsidiaries. 

Kyiv continues urging Western allies to tighten sanctions on Russia's energy sector, arguing that depriving Moscow of oil revenues would further limit its ability to finance its war against Ukraine.

The Brampton plant has been idle since 2023, and work on retooling for new vehicles halted in February, after Donald Trump announced tariffs on imported automobiles.Chris Young/The Canadian Press

Stellantis NV STLA-N says it is moving production of the Jeep Compass to Illinois from Brampton, Ont., part of a US$13-billion plan to boost production in the United States.

The Brampton plant has been idle since 2023, and work on retooling for new vehicles halted in February, after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to lay 25-per-cent tariffs on imported automobiles.

The factory northwest of Toronto had been slated to produce the Jeep Compass when it reopened, but more than 3,000 unionized Stellantis employees remain on layoff while the plant's future remains unclear. 

Stellantis on Tuesday said it plans to boost U.S. production in the U.S. by 50 per cent over the next four years, producing five additional models and adding more than 5,000 jobs in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.

“As part of this announcement, we will move one model from Canada to the U.S.,” Stellantis said in response to questions from The Globe and Mail. “We have plans for Brampton and will share them upon further discussions with the Canadian government.”

Prime Minister Mark Carney said in a statement Stellantis's decision is a “direct consequence” of U.S. tariffs and possible future trade actions. “Until a more certain trade environment for the North American Auto sector is established through the upcoming review of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, decisions on new investments in the auto sector will continue to be affected.”

The head of Unifor, which represents Stellantis workers, called on the federal government to fight for the jobs. 

“Canadian auto jobs are being sacrificed on the Trump altar,” Lana Payne said. “Stellantis cannot be allowed to renege on its commitments to Canadian workers, and governments cannot stand by while our jobs are shifted to the United States. Saving Brampton Assembly must now be this country's top priority, sending a strong message to any corporation thinking they can take the same egregious actions.”

Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown said he was “deeply disappointed” with Stellantis's move, which he called a “step backward” from the commitment the company made to workers and their families.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Stellantis has received no provincial funding for its Brampton plant and none will be provided until the company provides details on when the factory will restart. 

“Stellantis has a duty to live up to their promise to Brampton autoworkers and continue with their allocation in Brampton,” Mr. Ford said.

In 2023, Stellantis's chief operating officer at the time said the company was committed to the plant and assured the press and employees it would reopen with new models after the retooling. “I've given a reassurance in writing to the province, to the feds as well, that we absolutely are committed on the agreements we have with … Brampton,” Mark Stewart said. 

In a statement on Tuesday, Stellantis provided no details on its plans for the plant. “We have been in Canada for over 100 years, and we are investing. We are adding a third shift to the Windsor Assembly Plant to support increased demand of all versions of the Chrysler Pacifica and the new Sixpack-powered Dodge Charger Scat Pack and R/T models. Canada is very important to us.” 

Stellantis said its new U.S. investments include:

Mr. Trump says the import taxes on cars and other goods are intended to foster domestic manufacturing. 

“We want to make our own cars,” Mr. Trump said in May. “We don't really want cars from Canada. And we put tariffs on cars from Canada and at a certain point, it won't make economic sense for Canada to build those cars.” 

His trade policies upend decades of free trade in the auto sector that relies on an invisible border for efficient, just-in-time production. A car part typically crosses the border six or seven times before final assembly. 

Auto parts are not subject to tariffs if they are compliant with the North American free trade agreement. But aluminum and steel face tariffs of 50 per cent, driving up costs for suppliers. 

Ontario is also home to plants owned by Ford, General Motors, Honda and Toyota. Ford's Oakville plant is idle but work is progressing on a retooling to make heavy-duty pickup trucks, the company has said.

Since Mr. Trump's import taxes were put in place, there have been thousands of layoffs in Ontario's auto sector, which mainly produces cars for the U.S market. Some companies have delayed new products and cancelled shifts.

Toyota has called the tariffs on its Ontario exports to the U.S. “unsustainable in the long term.”

Afghanistan and Pakistan have announced a temporary ceasefire, putting an end to the fighting which broke out between their forces on Wednesday morning. Over a dozen civilian deaths have been reported in the latest exchange of fire between the two neighbors.

Pakistan's Foreign Ministry announced several hours after the clash that Kabul and Islamabad have agreed to a limited 48-hour truce, which is to begin at 6pm local time (13:00 GMT) on Wednesday. 

In its statement, the ministry said both sides “will make sincere efforts through dialogue to find a positive solution to their complex yet resolvable issues.”

Earlier in the day, Afghan Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid wrote on X that Pakistani forces had launched an attack, firing “light and heavy weapons,” killing 12 civilians and injuring more than 100. 

He claimed Afghan forces had returned fire, killing a “large number” of soldiers, seizing Pakistani weapons and tanks, and destroying military installations.

Ali Mohammad Haqmal, a press spokesman in Spin Boldak district, Afghanistan, the reported site of the altercation, put the civilian death toll at 15. AFP has also cited a local hospital official who said 80 women and children were among the wounded.

Islamabad has denied the allegations as “outrageous” and “blatant lies,” claiming it was the Afghan Taliban that initiated the hostilities by attacking a Pakistani military post and other areas near the border. The Pakistani army said its forces had repelled the assault, killing 37 Taliban fighters in two separate operations.

Reuters has reported, citing unnamed security officials, that the clash allegedly lasted around five hours.

The confrontation follows a weekend flare-up in which Afghanistan and Pakistan traded casualty claims. The Taliban said it had killed 58 Pakistani soldiers, while Islamabad claimed to have captured 19 Afghan frontier posts.

Cross-border tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have intensified in recent years as both sides have repeatedly accused each other of harboring militants.

ISLAMABAD, October 15. /TASS/. Islamabad and Kabul have reached a temporary agreement on a 48-hour ceasefire, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

""A temporary ceasefire has been declared between the Pakistani government and the Afghan Taliban regime, with the mutual consent of both parties, for the next 48 hours,"" reads the statement, cited by the Dawn newspaper.

The ceasefire took effect at 1:00 p.m. GMT. In the next two days, ""both sides will make sincere efforts to find a positive solution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue,"" the statement adds.

Armed clashes on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan resumed on Wednesday morning. According to PTV, the Pakistani army carried out a strike on terrorist positions in Afghanistan in response to an attack on checkpoints in the Kurram District of the country's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Taliban Deputy Spokesperson Hamdullah Fitrat said that 12 people had been killed and over 100 had suffered injuries. According to him, ""early in the morning, Pakistani troops resumed attacks on Afghanistan"" and ""Afghan forces had to retaliate.""

Shootouts took place in Afghanistan's Helmand province on October 11. Later, the Afghan Air Force conducted a strike on the Pakistani city of Lahore. Taliban officials did not provide any details of the operation. Afghanistan's TOLO News TV channel claimed that the clashes killed at least 58 Pakistani service members. Islamabad, in turn, said that at least 200 militants had been eliminated, 19 terrorist facilities had been destroyed in Afghanistan, from which shelling attacks had been carried out, and the headquarters of an Afghan tank battalion providing support to extremists involved in an attack on Pakistan had also been targeted.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Cancellations represent escalating government-wide campaign to suppress criticism of rightwing influencer

Civil liberties advocates are warning that the Trump administration's decision to strip visas from at least six foreign nationals over social media posts about Charlie Kirk's killing represents yet another example of dangerous government crackdowns on protected speech.

On Tuesday, the state department announced it was systematically identifying visa holders who “celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk”, declaring in a social media statement that “the United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans”.

The visa cancellations represent an escalating government-wide campaign to suppress criticism of Kirk, who was killed last month. The administration cut visas for nationals from Argentina, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, Germany and Paraguay.

“You can't defend ‘our culture' by eroding the very cornerstone of what America stands for: freedom of speech and thought,” Conor Fitzpatrick, an attorney at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (Fire) said in a statement to the Guardian. “The Trump administration must stop punishing people for their opinions alone.”

Visa revocations under these parameters “are censorship, plain and simple”, Carrie DeCell, Knight First Amendment Institute's senior staff attorney and legislative adviser, said in a press release.

“Mere ‘mockery' can't be grounds for adverse government action – whether revocation of broadcast licenses or revocation of visas,” DeCell said. “While the government can revoke visas for many reasons, the First Amendment forbids it from doing so based on viewpoint.”

The crackdown has ensnared foreign nationals for posts with minimal reach, raising questions about the extent of government surveillance of social media activity. Among those whose visas were revoked was a South African national whose commentary attracted just 2,344 views. The individual “mocked Americans grieving the loss of Kirk, saying ‘they're hurt that the racist rally ended in attempted martyrdom' and alleging ‘he was used to astroturf a movement of white nationalist trailer trash'”, according to the state department.

A German national also had their visa cancelled for a post written in German that translated to: “when fascists die, democrats don't complain.” The state department characterized this as celebrating Kirk's death and attempting to justify his murder.

The Brazilian stripped of his US visa is Tiago Santineli, a far-left standup comedian and online influencer who published a series of inflammatory tweets about Charlie Kirk after his assassination.

In one 16 September post, cited by the state department on Monday, the 33-year-old comedian, who has more than 430,000 X followers, wrote: “Charlie Kirk was the reason for a Nazi demonstration where they marched in tribute to him. Good riddance!”

In a second part of the tweet, not cited by the state department, Santineli refers to the fatal shot to Kirk's neck, writing: “If only someone had given Hitler this kind of tracheostomy before he had reached power. It's too bad that Little Charlie Deep Throat was killed by another by another right-wing conservative, it takes a bit of the fun out of it, but it's still worth it.”

The controversial Brasília-born comedian, who has nearly a million YouTube subscribers, published several other incendiary messages about Kirk's 10 September assassination. In one 18 September post, Santineli wrote beneath a photo of two well-known rightwing Brazilian politicians: “When are these [two] going to get the charlie kirk treatment?”

Santineli did not reply to a request for comment but writing on X on 1 October he said he had received an email from the US embassy revoking his visa. The Brazilian boasted that that made him “the world's first comedian to be banned from entering the US because of a joke”. “I can't go to the US,” Santineli wrote. “But the worst thing is that Charlie Kirk will never be able to leave hahahahahahahahaha.”

Another person singled out by the visa restrictions was Enrique “Kike” Gamarra, a veteran talkshow host who is often critical of Paraguay's conservative government. In a recent programme, Gamarra said that Kirk's killing “doesn't absolve the way he lived his life. Charlie Kirk was a son of a bitch and died according to his own rules.” Gamarra declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian.

Pro-government media in Paraguay celebrated the travel ban imposed on the broadcaster, which comes amid deepening ties between Trump's White House and Paraguay's president, Santiago Peña. 

The state department's actions draw on a vast surveillance apparatus established in 2019, when the department began requiring nearly all visa applicants worldwide to provide social media handles from platforms including Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn and Reddit used within the past five years.

The policy, adopted under Trump's first administration as part of “extreme vetting” measures, continued under Joe Biden, and expanded dramatically in March this year. A state department cable obtained by the Guardian at the time ordered consular offices to conduct comprehensive social media investigations of student visa applicants, with officers instructed to preserve screenshots of “potentially derogatory” content to create permanent records – even if posts were altered or deleted.

The March directive established sweeping new grounds for visa denials, writing that “evidence that an applicant advocates for terrorist activity, or otherwise demonstrates a degree of public approval or public advocacy for terrorist activity or a terrorist organization” could justify rejection.

It also mandated social media reviews of all students applying for visas, with fraud prevention units directed to flag and document content the administration deems threatening to national security.

The directive followed high-profile visa revocations and arrests targeting pro-Palestinian campus activism, signaling an aggressive expansion of how immigration enforcement could be wielded against political speech.

Dispute over Louisiana district returned to justices after long legal saga – and could have far-reaching implications

A 160-year-old campaign against civil rights heads to the supreme court

US politics live – latest updates

The conservative majority on the US supreme court appeared poised to weaken a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act after a lengthy oral argument on Wednesday, paving the way for a significant upheaval in American civil rights law.

After hearing arguments from lawyers for nearly two and a half hours, it seemed clear there was a majority on the court in favor of narrowing section two of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racially discriminatory electoral practices, as it applies to redistricting. The only remaining question in the case, Louisiana v Callais, appeared to be how far the court was willing to go.

A ruling narrowing section two would strip minority voters of a tool to challenge discrimination. For decades, voting rights lawyers have turned to section two to challenge district lines – from congressional districts to school boards – that dilute the influence of minority voters. Supreme court precent precedent requires plaintiffs to clear a series of challenging hurdles in order to strike down an existing district.

“This court's cases in a variety of contexts have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time. Sometimes for a long period of time, decades in some cases, but they should not be indefinite and should have an endpoint. What exactly do you think that endpoint should be?” asked Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a key swing vote in the case, to Janai Nelson, a lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, who was defending the maps.

Winning a section two lawsuit already requires plaintiffs to clear a series of high bars, Nelson said, including showing evidence of current discrimination. She added that maps are redrawn every 10 years. She warned the justices that a ruling weakening section two would be “pretty catastrophic”.

“We only have the diversity that we see across the south, for example, because of litigation that forced the creation of opportunity districts under the Voting Rights Act,” she said. “It is an intervention that that has been crucial to diversifying leadership and providing an ability of minority voters to have an equal opportunity to participate in the process.”

The court's decision could also have immediate political consequences as Republicans plow ahead with an effort to redraw districts ahead of next year's midterm elections. A decision getting rid of section two could cause Democrats to lose around a dozen seats in the US House, according to a New York Times analysis. Edward Greim, a lawyer representing white voters challenging Louisiana's map, urged the justices to issue a ruling in time for next year's midterms.

Cutting through the oral arguments, Justice Sonia Sotomayor summarized what those challenging the map were trying to do.

“The bottom line is get rid of section two,” said she said, towards the end of the argument, summarizing how she understood the plethora of arguments coming from lawyers attacking the maps.

The caseinvolves a dispute over Louisiana's sixth congressional district, which snakes from Shreveport in the state's north-west to Baton Rouge in the center. Louisiana Republicans drew the district after a successful lawsuit filed by Black voters under section two.

Those challenging the map, which included a group of white voters, the state of Louisiana, and the Trump administration – argued that the existing interpretation of section two essentially required lawmakers to rely too much on race when drawing district lines.

“Race based redistricting is fundamentally contrary to our constitution. It requires striking enough members of the majority race to sufficiently diminish their voting strength, and it requires drawing in enough members of a minority race to sufficiently augment their voting strength,” J Benjamin Aguiñaga, Louisiana's solicitor general, told the justices.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, a conservative on the court, also seemed skeptical of the use of race in redistricting. “One argument is often ‘well once you've found a section two violation, you've got a compelling interest to go ahead and discriminate on the basis of race in your remedial map,” he said.

The court's liberal justices tried to rebut those attacks by pointing out the court has long considered consideration of race under the right circumstances.

“Race is always a part of these decisions,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor said. “My colleagues are trying to tease it out in this intellectual way that doesn't deal with the fact that race is used to help people.”

“What you're saying to us [is] ‘if you use it to remedy past lingering discrimination, intentional discrimination, then you can't use it,''” she added.

Lawyers challenging the map said the court's current interpretation of section two punished lawmakers for drawing district lines to achieve their desired partisan outcomes.

“If these were white Democrats, there's no reason to think they would have a second district. None. And so what is happening here is their argument is because these Democrats happen to be black, they get a second district. If they were all white, we all agree they wouldn't get a second district,” Hashim Mooppan, the principal deputy solicitor general, told the justices.

The justices already heard argument in the case in March, the supreme court took the unusual step of not issuing a ruling at the end of last term. Instead, it instructed the parties to address an explosive question: whether Louisiana's decision to create an additional majority-minority district violated the 14th and 15th amendments to the constitution, which guarantee equal protection under the law and prohibit denying the right to vote based on someone's race. In asking the question, the supreme court set up a blockbuster case on whether section two itself was constitutional when it comes to redistricting.

A ruling gutting section two could force the court to overturn precedent it issued just two years ago in a case in which it said Alabama had to add a second majority-Black congressional district. In that case, Allen v Milligan, the court upheld a decision requiring Alabama to draw a second majority-Black district under section two.

Chief Justice John Roberts, another key swing vote in the case, appeared searching for a way to distinguish Callais from the recent Milligan case. “That case of course took the existing precedent as a given and considered Alabama's application of its approach to the evidence,” he said.

Nelson told Roberts Milligan was a “nearly identical case”. And at another point, Justice Elena Kagan, another liberal on the court, said those challenging the map in the case were rehashing the arguments the court had rejected in Milligan just two years ago. It seemed to be a clear play to get the attention of Roberts, who authored the majority opinion in Milligan and is likely aware of the institutional harm of gutting a precedent that isn't even three years old.

“A couple of years ago when we decided Milligan, the party there, the state there, made several arguments that we specifically rejected. And in the answers that you just gave to me, it seems to me that you've repeated each and every one of those arguments that we rejected,” she said.

Kavanaugh seemed particularly interested in a proposal for the solicitor general's office that would make it significantly harder for minority voters to challenge districts. Under the proposal, challengers would have to show that they could draw a reasonably configured district that gives them the opportunity to elect the candidate of their choice without sacrificing the political goals of the mapmaker.

Such a requirement would be virtually impossible to meet, Nicholas Stephanopolous, an election law scholar, wrote in a blogpost earlier this year.

“It would doom most section two claims in areas where most minority voters are Democrats and most white voters are Republicans. In these areas – which notably include much of the south – an additional minority-opportunity district can usually be drawn only at the cost of an existing Republican district,” he wrote in a post on Election Law Blog earlier this month. “This swap of an old Republican district for a new minority-opportunity district, however, is exactly what the SG's proposal would prevent.”

The case is returning to the justices after a long and twisted legal saga.

After the 2020 census, Louisiana Republicans passed a congressional map in which Black voters only comprised a majority in one of the state's six congressional districts. A group of Black voters sued under section two of the Voting Rights Act in March of 2022, arguing that it was possible to draw a reasonably configured district in the Baton Rouge area that would give Black voters a majority in a second-congressional district. A district court judge and US court of appeals for the fifth circuit agreed with them, ordering a new map. The supreme court let the map go into effect for the 2024 elections.

With the midterm elections fast approaching, Louisiana Republicans decided to draw a new map. Rejecting proposals from the plaintiffs, they adopted the strangely shaped Shreveport-to-Baton Rouge district for political reasons, saying they wanted to preserve the seats of powerful Republicans, including Mike Johnson, the House speaker, and Julia Letlow, a member of the appropriations committee.

The US supreme court has said there is nothing federal courts can do to stop redistricting for partisan advantage. A Black Democrat, Cleo Fields, won the new majority-Black congressional district last fall.

But when the new map went into effect, a group of white voters sued in a different court, saying that the new map violated the 14th and 15th amendments because it sorted voters based on their race. A three-judge panel agreed and struck down the new map and the supreme court heard the case on appeal.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Hi, this is Kateryna Hodunova reporting from Kyiv on day 1,330 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story:

At least 1,076 Cuban nationals have fought or are fighting for Russia in Ukraine, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15.

Ninety-six are known to have died or gone missing in action.

The figures come after the U.S. earlier this month circulated an unclassified cable sharing details about Cuba's support for Russia's full-scale invasion, in which it claimed an ""estimated 1,000 to 5,000 Cubans (are) fighting in Ukraine.""

The information from HUR shared with the Kyiv Independent tallies with the lower end of the U.S. estimate, but also provides further insight into the recruitment process and training of Cuban nationals.

HUR claims they receive only two weeks of training at the Avangard training center in Moscow Oblast before being sent to the front line.

The information provided by HUR suggests that some Cuban nationals are tricked into travelling to Russia after being lured by the promise of lucrative construction work advertised on Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok.

Their travel is facilitated by ""private intermediaries"" who sometimes pay for flights, with Russian diplomatic institutions issuing tourist or work visas.

Aid trucks rolled into Gaza on Wednesday and Israel resumed preparations to open the main Rafah crossing after a dispute over the return of the bodies of dead hostages that had threatened to derail the fragile ceasefire deal with Hamas. 

Israel had threatened to keep Rafah shut and reduce aid supplies because Hamas was returning bodies too slowly, showing the risks to a truce that has stopped two years of devastating warfare in Gaza and freed all living hostages held by Hamas. 

Here's what you need to know about Gaza and the Israel-Hamas war, including the ceasefire deal, the toll of the war so far and what comes next.

However, the militant group returned more Israeli bodies overnight, and an Israeli security official said on Wednesday preparations were under way to open Rafah to Gazan citizens, while a second official said that 600 aid trucks would go in.

Hamas' armed wing said on Wednesday night that it would hand over two more bodies.

Hamas returned four bodies confirmed as dead hostages on Monday and another four bodies late on Tuesday, though Israeli authorities said one of those bodies was not that of a hostage. 

The dispute over the return of bodies still has the potential to upset the ceasefire deal along with other major issues that are yet to be resolved. 

Palestinians voiced ongoing struggles as they have 'no food, no housing' in Gaza City.

Reuters

Israel has said that the next phase of the truce calls for Hamas to disarm and cede power, which it has so far refused to do. It has launched a security crackdown, parading its power in Gaza through public executions and clashes with local clans. 

Longer-term elements of the ceasefire plan, including how Gaza will be governed, the make-up of an international “stabilization force” and moves toward the creation of a Palestinian state have yet to emerge. 

Israelis return to Oct. 7 sites, but some don't see long-lasting peace

Twenty-one bodies of hostages remain in Gaza, though some may be very hard to find or recover because of destruction during the conflict. An international task force is meant to find them. 

The deal also requires Israel to return the bodies of 360 Palestinian militants killed in battle. The first group of 45 was handed over on Tuesday and were being identified, said Palestinian health authorities.

The war has caused a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, with nearly all inhabitants driven from their homes, a global hunger monitor saying famine was present in the enclave and health authorities overwhelmed. 

“Our situation is utterly tragic. We went back to our homes in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood and found there are no homes at all. There is no shelter. Nothing,” said Moemen Hassanein in Gaza City, with tents and shanties behind him.

Reuters video showed a first group of trucks moving from the Egyptian side of the border into the Rafah crossing at dawn on Wednesday, some tankers carrying fuel and others loaded with pallets of aid.

However, it was not clear if that convoy would complete its crossing into Gaza as part of the 600 trucks that were due to enter the enclave on Wednesday – the daily number required under the ceasefire plan. Aid trucks entered Gaza through other crossings. 

The Rafah crossing with Egypt is due to be open for people to cross on Thursday with a European Union mission deployed there, two sources said. It was not immediately clear if there would be any restrictions applied on the movement of people.

The Palestinian Authority, which governs in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said it was preparing to operate the crossing. 

Some Palestinians awaiting medical evacuation told Reuters they had not yet received notification to prepare for travel.

Israel's public broadcaster Kan reported that Wednesday's aid deliveries would include food, medical supplies, fuel, cooking gas and equipment to repair vital infrastructure. 

“Humanitarian aid continues to enter the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom Crossing and other crossings after Israeli security inspection,” the Israeli security official said.

Underscoring the political challenges facing the truce, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, an opponent of the ceasefire plan, said on X that the aid delivery was a “disgrace.”

“Nazi terrorism understands only force, and the only way to solve problems with it is to wipe it off the face of the earth,” he added, accusing Hamas of lies and abuse over the return of hostages' bodies.

Several other Palestinian factions in Gaza have backed a days-long Hamas security crackdown as it battles local clans. 

The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, one of the groups backing the Hamas crackdown, described the clans being targeted as “hubs of crime.” Hamas has executed several people that it accused of collaborating with Israel.

The U.S. military's Middle East command called on Hamas to “suspend violence and shooting at innocent Palestinian civilians” and to disarm “without delay.” 

U.S. President Donald Trump, who brokered the ceasefire deal, this week endorsed Hamas' crackdown on gangs, while warning it would face air strikes if it did not later disarm.

Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas condemned the public executions after a video, authenticated by Reuters, showed masked gunmen shooting dead seven men in a Gaza street. 

Israeli forces inside Gaza have pulled back to what the truce deal calls a yellow line just outside the main cities. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said it would immediately enforce any violation of the line. 

President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants dead hostages held in Gaza back and warns Hamas 'if they don't disarm, we will disarm them.'

CAPSAT military unit commander Col. Michael Randrianirina says 'we will be sworn in soon,' during a press briefing.Brian Inganga/The Associated Press

Madagascar's new military ruler Michael Randrianirina said on Wednesday he would soon be sworn in as president of the African island nation after a coup he led to oust President Andry Rajoelina. 

Rajoelina, who was impeached by lawmakers after fleeing abroad at the weekend, has condemned the takeover and refused to step down despite Gen Z demonstrations demanding his resignation and widespread defections in the security forces.

Randrianirina has told Malagasy citizens that the military has taken power and dissolved all institutions except the lower house of parliament or National Assembly.

“We will be sworn in soon,” the army colonel told a press briefing on Wednesday, a day after the High Constitutional Court invited him to serve as president of the former French colony.

“We took responsibility yesterday.”

Two sources close to him earlier told Reuters he would be sworn in as president in the next day or two.

Randrianirina said on Tuesday that a committee led by the military would rule for up to two years alongside a transitional government before organizing new elections.

Randrianirina was a commander in the elite CAPSAT army unit that played a key role in the 2009 coup that brought Rajoelina to power but broke ranks with him last week, urging soldiers not to fire on protesters.

Rajoelina fled Madagascar on Sunday aboard a French military plane, security sources told Reuters. He has said his life was at risk and is now believed to be in Dubai, according to three diplomatic and opposition sources. The 51-year-old former DJ himself rose to power in a coup in 2009 on the back of youth protests, becoming the world's youngest head of state at 34. But promises to improve living standards and eradicate corruption were never fulfilled.

Madagascar, where the average age is less than 20, has a population of about 30 million, three-quarters of whom live in poverty. Between its independence in 1960 and 2020, GDP per capita plunged 45 per cent, according to the World Bank.

As well as the CAPSAT unit, the paramilitary gendarmerie and the police have also broken ranks with Rajoelina.

The European Commission is set to unveil an ambitious defense policy ""roadmap"" that includes boosting anti-drone efforts, according to documents. Plus, Germany pledges more military aid to Ukraine. 

       Here is a roundup of news related to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on October 15, 2025.

Kyiv is introducing emergency power cuts across most of the country, officials and grid operator Ukrenergo announced on Wednesday, following a string of Russian strikes that have largely crippled the country's energy systems.

""Because of the complicated situation for Ukraine's energy system, emergency electricity cuts have been imposed in all regions,"" except for Donetsk in the east, at the center of most of the fighting, Ukrenergo posted on Telegram.

The grid operator added that ""emergency repair work is underway in all the regions affected by the bombardments,"" urging people to use electricity ""sparingly.""

Ukraine's Energy Ministry said in a statement that it was forced to implement the cuts due to the fallout from recent Russian strikes.

The decision extends controls already put in place on Tuesday.

Russia's attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities have increased as winter approaches, causing significant damage to gas production and leaving major cities including the capital Kyiv in long stretches of darkness.

Ukraine also regularly targets oil refineries and hydrocarbon pipelines in Russia using drones.

The European Commission is preparing to propose anew counter-drone initiative that it wants to be fully operational by the end of 2027, according to a document seen by news agencies.

The proposal is set to be made on Thursday and discussed later on Wednesday.

It follows Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's idea for Europe to build a ""drone wall"" that was floated last month after NATO shot down Russian drones that invaded Poland's airspace.

The concept, dubbed the ""European Drone Defense Initiative,"" should be operational by the end of 2026, according to the document seen by Reuters and AFP news agencies.

Some EU members have deemed the 2027 deadline as one that was too ambitious. Others, including Germany and France, are wary about the EU Commission stepping on NATO's toes.

Berlin will finance a US weapons package worth $500 million (roughly €429.8 million) for Ukraine, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius announced on Wednesday.

Speaking in Brussels at a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, Pistorius said the package will include air defense systems, Patriot missiles, radar systems and precision-guided artillery rockets and ammunition.

The package addresses ""a number of urgent requirements of Ukraine,"" Pistorius said.

Separately, the German defense minister also announced the delivery of another two IRIS-T air defense systems, including a number of guided missiles, shoulder-fired air defense missiles, anti-tank weapons, communication devices and hand-held weapons.

German military aid to Ukraine totalled over $2 billion, Pistorius said.

Swedish armed forces were following on Wednesday a Russian submarine that entered the Baltic Sea a day earlier, in what the Swedish military described as a ""routine operation.""

The submarine entered the Baltic Sea via the Great Belt, a Danish strait, according to a statement by the Swedish military.

""The armed forces' jet fighters and warships met up with the submarine in the Kattegatt [strait between Denmark and Sweden] and are now following it,"" the military said, describing it as a ""a routine operation taking place in close collaboration with our allies.""

The military added that it had a ""good overview of our immediate vicinity.""

Tensions have flared in the Baltic Sea since Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said on Wednesday the military alliance was testing new anti-drone defenses on its eastern flank to counter threats from Moscow.

""NATO will implement a number of additional counter drone measures that will build on and expand and accelerate our ability to counter drones,"" Rutte said after a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels. ""We are testing integrated systems that will help us detect, track and neutralise aerial threats.""

The announcement comes as the European Union is looking into setting up a ""drone wall"" to counter the threat of Russian drones infiltrating EU airspace, which has happened at least in Poland and Estonia recently, with more drone sightings having temporarily groundede flights in several European airports.

Rutte has stressed there would be no duplication between the NATO and EU drone projects.

""Let me say it once and for all, the EU and NATO are working hand in hand, closely together, and we both know our strength,"" he said.

US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned Moscow on Wednesday that Washington and its allies were ready to ""impose costs on Russia for its continued aggression"" if the Ukraine war doesn't end.

""If we must take this step, the US War Department stands ready to do our part in ways that only the United States can do,"" Hegseth said at a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group — a coalition of over 50 countries focused on streamlining the delivery of military equipment to Ukraine — at NATO headquarters.

NATO defense ministers are meeting to look at ways to boost the alliance's ability to defend against airspace violations by Russia and bolster support for Ukraine.

Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told a news conference that the US was ready to impose tariffs on China over its Russian oil purchase but only if European allies were willing to take part in such a measure.

""It is the purchase of Russian oil by China that fuels the Russian war machines. China buys 60%, six zero percent, of Russian energy. They buy 90% of Iranian energy,"" he said.

The Trump administration has reignited its trade war with Beijing, with Trump threatening a new whopping 100% additional tariffs in reaction to China's restrictions on rare earths export.

Germany and Turkey will hold talks over the potential deliveries of Eurofighter jets, a Berlin Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday, confirming Berlin has agreed to the negotiations.

""The German government has responded positively to a preliminary request from Airbus to negotiate the delivery of Eurofighters to Turkey,"" the spokesperson said, adding that the aircraft would be used for ""collective defence within the NATO framework.""

German top diplomat Johann Wadephul is due in the Turkish capital Ankara on Friday to go over the issue with his Turkish counterpart, the spokesperson added.

The discussion comes as European members of the NATO alliance scramble to firm up air defenses against Russia, amid a string of drone sightings across various European airports.

The UK has issued a fresh round of sanctions targeting Russia's oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil as well as 44 tankers from the so-called ""shadow fleet.""

In a statement on Wednesday, the UK Foreign Office said the 90 new sanctions reflect London's determination to cut off Russian President Vladimir Putin's revenue streams.

Rosneft and Lukoil export 3.1 million barrels of oil per day, the Foreign Office said, adding that the former alone is responsible for nearly half of all Russian oil production.

""At this critical moment for Ukraine, Europe is stepping up. Together, the UK and our allies are piling the pressure on Putin - going after his oil, gas and shadow fleet — and we will not relent until he abandons his failed war of conquest and gets serious about peace,"" British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said.

Since Western countries sanctioned Russia's oil exports, the Kremlin has relied on a group of aging oil tankers to transport oil to buyers across the world.

""We are sending a clear signal: Russian oil is off the market,"" British Chancellor Rachel Reeves said.

Russia continued with its escalating attacks on Ukraine's energy system overnight, causing outages in seven mostly eastern regions, power grid operator Ukrenergo said.

State-run gas firm Naftogaz said a thermal power plant had also been hit, without identifying the location.

Russia has been stepping up its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure as winter and the heating season approach.

In a report, state-run energy company Naftogaz said Russian forces had attacked gas facilities three times in the past seven days, including ""critically important facilities"" in the Kharkiv, Sumy and Chernihiv regions.

Ukrainian Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk said earlier this month that Ukraine wanted to import 30% more gas after the damage caused by the Russian strikes.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has said his country will increase its contribution to policing European airspace following a spate of Russian aerial incursions and mysterious drone sightings.

Germany was prepared to take the lead in any EU air defense shield, Reuters news agency reported. 

At a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels on Wednesday, Pistorius said Germany would send Eurofighters to carry out patrol flights in Poland, which saw a major Russian drone incursion in September, as well as spend €10 billion ($11.6 billion) on all kinds of drones in the coming years.

""We will contribute to protecting the eastern flank with patrol flights,"" he said, adding Germany would be ""more active, more present and more visible"" on NATO's eastern border. 

When asked whether Germany would help finance US Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine, he said a decision would be taken when the time came to do so.

 US President Donald Trump says he is currently considering whether to allow the long-range Tomahawks, which would enable Ukraine to carry out attacks far within Russia, to be purchased by or for Kyiv.

US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Wednesday called on NATO member states to purchase more weapons for Ukraine under his country's Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) scheme, which has replaced US arms donations to Kyiv. 

""Our expectation today is that more countries donate even more, that they purchase even more to provide for Ukraine, to bring that conflict to a peaceful conclusion,"" he told reports ahead of a meeting with other NATO defense ministers in Brussels.

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said he expected further pledges, noting that $2 billion (€1.7 billion) already had been committed through the mechanism.

Sweden, Estonia and Finland pledged contributions on Wednesday, joining a number of other European countries, including Germany, who are already purchasing weapons through the scheme

Spain, Italy, France and Britain have so far not joined, drawing criticism from Washington.

Under the Trump administration, the US, previously a major supplier of military aid to Ukraine, has ceased donating military equipment to Kyiv.

According to Germany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy, most military aid to Ukraine now flows through PURL.

However, it reported on Tuesday that military aid to Ukraine fell nonetheless by 43% in July and August compared with the first half of the year.

Families living in villages near the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kupiansk have been ordered to leave their homes amid what local authorities have called the ""worsening security situation"" in the region.

Russian forces have been advancing on Kupiansk for months as they push westward through central and eastern Ukraine.

The governor of northeastern Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, wrote on Telegram that a total of 409 families with 601 children were told to leave 27 localities.

A local official later told the public broadcaster Suspilne the number of localities affected had risen to 40.

World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said an UN convoy, including a team from his agency, came under attack in southern Ukraine on Tuesday while on an aid mission.

He wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the team managed to deliver medical supplies to the city of Bilozerka, in the Kherson district, despite the incident, adding that two World Food Programme trucks were damaged.

""Attacks on humanitarians must end,"" Tedros wrote in his statement.  

 

NATO defense ministers are meeting in Brussels amid fears that Russia is probing the alliance's reactions with a number of high-profile incursions into its members' airspace.

Among other things, the ministers are expected to discuss establishing what the EU calls a ""drone wall"" to counter the Russian threat, a project NATO chief Mark Rutte said was being worked on jointly with the bloc.

Europe has seen a recent spate of mysterious drone flights that have disrupted airports and flown close to military sites in several countries.

NATO is currently looking at incorporating low-cost technologies, such as those used by Ukraine, into its anti-drone defenses.

Current anti-drone systems rely largely on expensive missiles and aircraft.

The ministers are also to look at shoring up support for Ukraine against Moscow's full-scale invasion of its territory, with a study released on Tuesday showing a major drop in Western military aid to Kyiv in recent months.

The study by Germany's Kiel Institute showed such support dropping by 43% iin July and August compared to the first half of the year, even after Kyiv's European allies began purchasing US arms for Ukraine under a US scheme known as the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL).

Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden have all bought weapons under the scheme, but Italy and Spain, among others, have sent very little. France does not intend to take part in the arrangement.

Spain's defense minister, Margarita Robles Fernandez, is also likely to come under pressure from her US counterpart, Pete Hegseth, over Madrid's failure to meet NATO spending targets. 

This failure already drew criticism last week from US President Donald Trump, who threatened to throw Spain out of NATO if it did not comply.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Record renewable energy growth falls short of climate goals","https://www.dw.com/en/record-renewable-energy-growth-falls-short-of-climate-goals/a-74357169","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 10:37:30 GMT","

While a record 582 gigawatts of renewable energy was added to the grid in 2024, the international renewable energy agency IRENA said this was not enough to meet global climate targets.

Countries around the world are not on track to meet their renewable energy goals despite record growth last year, according to an interim report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) released on Tuesday.

IRENA is an intergovernmental agency that includes 169 countries and the European Union.

The newly installed capacity from renewable energies amounted to around 582 gigawatts in 2024, or around 15.1% more than the previous year.

While this was the highest amount ever recorded, in its report IRENA stressed that this was not enough for countries to reach global renewable energy goals, which target a yearly increase of 16.6%.

The UN Climate Conference in Dubai in 2023, also known as COP28, set the goal of reaching 11.2 terawatts within seven years.

According to the report, an additional 1.122 terawatts would be needed per year to reach the goal by 2030. A terawatt is equivalent to 1,000 gigawatts.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the world was not moving fast enough to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

""Renewables are deployed faster and cheaper than fossil fuels — driving growth, jobs, and affordable power. But the window to keep the 1.5°C limit within reach is rapidly closing,"" the UN chief was cited by the report as saying.

""We must step up, scale up and speed up the just energy transition — for everyone, everywhere,"" he stressed.

The target of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels was set in the Paris Agreement signed at COP21 in 2015.

The long-term global temperature increase was estimated at 1.3 degrees last year.

The next UN Climate Conference, or COP30, is due to be held on November 10 in the city of Belem in the Brazilian Amazon.

			Leaked Young Republican club group chat allegedly describes black people as ‘monkeys'

Left-wing activists amplifying a story about a racist Young Republican group chat “need to grow up,” JD Vance has said.

The US vice-president dismissed the allegedly racist, misogynistic, and anti-Semitic messages as “edgy jokes” told by “stupid kids”.

Leaked messages from the Telegram group chat for Republican students, young staffers, and budding politicians, allegedly described black people as “monkeys” and “the watermelon people,” joked about sending their political foes to the gas chamber, and wrote: “I love Hitler”.

The group, which is not formally affiliated with the Republican Party or the Trump administration, is also said to have praised conservatives they guessed would support slavery, used racial slurs, and referred to rape as “epic,” according to Politico.

In one of the messages shared by Politico, a member said the group was “cooked” if the chat were ever leaked, meaning they would face serious consequences.

The Young Republicans group chat is said to have included members from New York, Kansas, Arizona, and Vermont.

It also included senior members of the club, a sitting senator, and staffers working for elected officials, according to MSNBC, several of whom have since apologised.

Following the publication of the messages, some members of the group chat lost their jobs or had job offers rescinded.

Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, called on Donald Trump to condemn the “revolting messages”, while Hakeem Jeffreies, his counterpart in the House, said GOP representatives had been “palling around with these racist, anti-Semitic and bigoted ‘Young Republicans' for years”.

“The more the political atmosphere is open and liberating – like it has been with the emergence of Trump and a more Right-wing GOP even before him – it opens up young people and older people to telling racist jokes, making racist commentaries in private and public,” Joe Feagin, a Texas A&M sociology professor, told Politico. “It's chilling, of course, because they will act on these views.”

The White House rejected any suggestion the group chat was linked with, or inspired by, Mr Trump's rhetoric.

“Only an activist, Left-wing reporter would desperately try to tie President Trump into a story about a random group chat he has no affiliation with, while failing to mention the dangerous smears coming from Democrat politicians who have fantasised about murdering their opponent and called Republicans Nazis and fascists,” Liz Huston, the White House spokeswoman, told Politico.

“No one has been subjected to more vicious rhetoric and violence than President Trump and his supporters.”

Asked about the Politico report, Mr Vance said outraged reactions amounted to “pearl-clutching”.

Referring to texts sent by Jay Jones, the Democratic candidate for Virginia attorney general, in which he joked about shooting a political rival, Mr Vance said: “This is far worse than anything said in a college group chat, and the guy who said it could become the AG of Virginia.

“I refuse to join the pearl-clutching when powerful people call for political violence.”

Later on Wednesday, Mr Vance implored critics to “grow up”.

“Grow up. I'm sorry, focus on the real issues don't focus on what kids say in group chats,” he said. “The reality is, kids do stupid things, especially young boys. They tell edgy offensive jokes, that's what kids do.”

In a statement, a spokesman for the Young Republicans' board of directors said: “We are appalled by the vile and inexcusable language revealed in the Politico article published today.

“Such behaviour is disgraceful, unbecoming of any Republican, and stands in direct opposition to the values our movement represents.

“Those involved must immediately resign from all positions within their state and local Young Republican organisations. We must hold ourselves to the highest standards of integrity, respect, and professionalism.”

Israel has reportedly disappeared over 400 health care workers from Gaza and the West Bank in the last two years.

More than two dozen Palestinian healthcare workers held hostage in Israel's torture camps were supposed to be released on Monday, October 13, according to Healthcare Workers Watch-Palestine (HWW), an organization that tracks Israel's attacks on Palestine's healthcare system.

“While not all releases are confirmed yet, the list includes 24 nurses, 7 doctors, and 2 paramedics,” the group said in a press release issued on Monday.

“While their release is warmly welcomed, there are at least 115 more Gazan healthcare workers who are still being held in Israeli detention,” HWW continued. “These include at least 20 doctors, of whom 15 are irreplaceable senior specialists.”

Of the 55 healthcare workers listed for release, Israeli soldiers abducted 44 from the hospitals where they were working; one person from an organized convoy to transfer patients through Israel-designated “safe routes”; and one person during a rescue mission, as per HWW.

Dr. Ahmad Mhanna, the director of Al-Awda Hospital, was not on the list, but was released on Monday, the group said. Israeli forces abducted Mhanna in 2023.

“During his captivity, Dr. Mhanna endured various forms of suffering and torture, yet he remained steadfast, holding firmly to his humanitarian and professional principles, believing that medicine is a calling before it is a profession,” the hospital said in a statement on Tuesday, as per CNN.

Renowned pediatrician Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, ​​the director of Gaza's Kamal Adwan Hospital, has not yet been released, according to news reports. On December 27, 2024, Israeli forces forced Abu Safiya to evacuate everyone in the hospital, approximately 350 people. That evening, soldiers stripped, shackled, blindfolded, and beat him, along with the rest of the male members of the medical staff, according to a new documentary, “The Disappearance of Dr. Abu Safiya,” produced by Al Jazeera Fault Lines. They abducted Abu Safiya, and burned down the hospital.

On Monday, pursuant to the ceasefire agreement, Hamas released all 20 living Israelis who had been taken on October 7, including at least two IDF soldiers, and Israel released approximately 1,700 Palestinian hostages who had been abducted over the last two years, including six children and more than two dozen men over 60. Approximately 250 Palestinians serving lengthy or life sentences were also freed, although about 150 were exiled to Egypt, as per Drop Site News. Israel threatened Palestinians in the West Bank with arrest if they celebrated the releases.

Since the genocide began over two years ago, Israeli forces have targeted Gaza's hospitals, ambulances, patients, and healthcare workers. Israel attacked close to 40 hospitals, and slaughtered more than 1,700 healthcare workers. The blockade forced doctors in Gaza to perform surgeries, including amputations, without anesthesia.

A year ago this week, Israel bombed the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Among the victims was Shaban al-Dalou, a 19-year-old software engineering student. Video captured the teenager, attached to an IV drip, engulfed in flames, burning alive. His mother, and at least three others, also perished in the attack.

Over the last two years, Israel has disappeared more than 400 healthcare workers from Gaza and the West Bank, according to HWW.

“Israel's systematic abduction of healthcare workers is a war crime which has decimated the hospital workforce in Gaza,” Dr. Muath Alser, the co-founder and director of HWW, said in a statement. “Israel must immediately and unconditionally release all the detained healthcare workers including the bodies of those tortured to death in detention.”

According to HWW, five healthcare workers were killed while held captive.

Healthcare workers detained in Israel's torture camps have reported to HWW that they were beaten, sexually assaulted with foreign objects, sexually humiliated, and hung from ceilings. A paramedic told the group he was hung from a ceiling and electrocuted.

“They put me in an overall that had electricity wires around it and put, like a headband with wires on my head,” they said, as per a report released last year by HWW. “I swear, it was so degrading, it was unbelievable. I was helping people as a paramedic, I never expected something like this.”

(The Carceral Report is using they/them pronouns for the victim as their gender is not included in HWW's report.)

A nurse said he too was hung from the ceiling, with his hands tied behind his back. His captor subjected him to penile torture and beatings.

“I endured this torture for about 19 hours,” he said. “When I woke up, I found myself in a place that looked like a clinic, but I wasn't sure if it was really a clinic or not. I didn't know if I had been given a blood transfusion or not. Then, they returned me to the same room, but the second time was worse.”

Earlier this year, The Guardian published harrowing testimonies from senior doctors and surgeons' — including from hospital director Mhanna, who was released on Monday — about the torture they endured while held hostage.

“I was taken to a military barracks where I spent 21 days,” Mhanna told his family in a letter, dictated to his attorney, as per The Guardian. “During this period, they took me to what they called the ‘Disco' – an interrogation room with deafening music and freezing temperatures. I slept on gravel, wearing only a thin tracksuit.”

They told him he would be released, but he was sent to Naqab prison, where Israeli prison guards routinely terrorize their Palestinians victims.

“They used to let the dog drink from a bowl of water and then pour the rest over me,” Mhanna said, as per The Guardian. “I fell to the ground because my legs were shackled. They laughed and kicked me in the side.”

He continued: “At one point, they forced me to stand for six hours in the cold, arms raised and shackled, before interrogating me. I told them the same thing every time: ‘I am a doctor. I do not belong to anything else.'”

We speak with Rutgers University professor Mark Bray, who fled from the U.S. to Spain with his family after receiving death threats over his scholarship. He is the author of the 2017 book Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, which explores the history and tactics of anti-fascist movements in Europe, the United States and beyond. Turning Point USA, the conservative campus group founded by Charlie Kirk, had called for Bray's firing and branded him “Dr. Antifa.” This comes as the Trump administration has dramatically escalated its war on dissent following Kirk's assassination, using his death as pretext to launch an assault on activists, organizations and speech it disagrees with.

“What we're seeing today in the U.S. is increasingly fascist. MAGA, I believe — and I study fascism, I don't say this lightly — is a fascist movement,” says Bray, referring to Trump's political movement.

President Trump signed an executive order designating antifa as a terrorist organization, but Bray stresses there is no such organization; anti-fascism is a loose political movement or ideology akin to feminism, but Trump is using the label to “demonize resistance” to his policies.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: We begin today's show with the war on antifa that the Trump administration has ratcheted up in the aftermath of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk being assassinated last month. Yesterday, President Trump posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Charlie Kirk at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden.

Trump recently signed an executive order purporting to designate antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, even though it's not really an organization. Antifa is actually a shortening of the term “anti-fascist” and is a term that arose in Europe for the movement against the Nazis, both before and after World War II. The decentralized movement in the U.S. today draws on this history.

Several high-level Republicans have accused this Saturday's “No Kings Day” protests of being organized by antifa. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said last week the administration will take the, quote, “same approach” to antifa as it has to drug cartels it's bombed in the Caribbean. This is Bondi on Fox News last night.

ATTORNEY GENERAL PAM BONDI: That's one of the things about antifa. You've heard President Trump say multiple times they are organized, they are a criminal organization. And they're very organized. You're seeing people out there with thousands of signs that all match, pre-bought, pre-put together. They're organized, and someone is funding it.

AMY GOODMAN: This comes as Los Angeles County officials voted Tuesday to declare a state of emergency over ongoing federal immigration raids they say have, quote, “caused widespread fear,” unquote.

Violent attacks by federal agents at protests against immigrant raids have also been documented in Chicago and Portland. On Tuesday, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson [was asked] if he would call for more oversight of federal agents. He responded by complaining about a naked bike ride protest against ICE in Portland, Oregon, which Trump has called a war zone.

SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON: To demand oversight on federal law enforcement? I've not seen them cross the line yet, and that we have committees of jurisdiction who have that responsibility, but it's not risen to that level. What I've seen is the abuse of law enforcement by radical leftist activists. You know, most recently, the most threatening thing I've seen yet was the naked bicyclers in Portland who were protesting ICE down there. I mean, it's getting really ugly.

AMY GOODMAN: Experts are increasingly raising concerns the Trump administration's attacks on antifa are ungrounded in fact and law, and violate free speech rights.

For more, we're joined by someone who knows a lot about all of this. Mark Bray is a Rutgers University history professor, author of the 2017 book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook. Last week, he was forced to leave his home in New Jersey and move to Spain with his family after receiving death threats following Trump's push to categorize the anti-fascist movement as a domestic terrorist organization. Charlie Kirk's group, Turning Point USA, had also circulated a petition labeling him “Dr. Antifa” and calling for him to be fired.

In a remarkable development, Bray was at first blocked from flying out of the United States last week. He wrote on Bluesky, “Someone canceled my family's flight out of the country at the last second. We got our boarding passes. We checked our bags. Went through security. Then at our gate our reservation ‘disappeared.'” They later took another flight, and professor Mark Bray joins us now from Spain.

Thanks so much for being with us. I'm sorry you've gone through all this, Professor Bray. If you can start off by talking about why you left the country and what happened, as we try to follow what was happening to you at the airport?

MARK BRAY: Right. So, I published this book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, in 2017. I'm actually researching different historical topics now. But after Trump's executive order, a series of far-right trolls, online influencers started attacking me. I received a number of death threats. Someone published my home address on X. So I started to fear for the safety of my family staying in our home. More and more death threats came in, and I knew I needed to get away. Getting to another country, getting across the ocean would make us feel much more comfortable.

As you said, our first flight was mysteriously canceled at the last moment. My two small children were sobbing. We had to regroup. The next day, as you said — 

AMY GOODMAN: I want to ask: When you — 

MARK BRAY: — I told — yeah.

AMY GOODMAN: I just want to ask: When say your flight was canceled, you went to — what was it? Newark Airport? Or Kennedy?

MARK BRAY: Yes, Newark.

AMY GOODMAN: And you got — and you got your boarding passes, and you went through security. So you were all set. And you got —

MARK BRAY: Yes.

AMY GOODMAN: — to the gate. And what did they tell you?

MARK BRAY: Right. Well, there was an error. They had us step to the side to talk to the United worker at the desk. There were a series of phone calls and mumbling. And they basically said, at the last moment, someone had canceled our reservation — not the whole flight, just for the four of us, for me, my wife and our two small children. And this is around the same time that Andy Ngo and Jack Posobiec, two of the far-right provocateurs who had been harassing me online, were meeting in the White House with President Trump to discuss antifa. I just can't believe it's a coincidence.

AMY GOODMAN: And yet, you were able to rebook the next day, and you made it through security, and you actually made it onto the flight?

MARK BRAY: Well, this time, I was stopped, searched and interrogated by federal agents for an hour. And at one point, they took me into a side room, and my two kids saw what looked like very bad men taking me in another room, and they started sobbing. So, it was quite an ordeal even the next day. But I made it out. And frankly, I'm very fearful about the potential of returning, but hopefully, by next year, things will improve.

AMY GOODMAN: I mean, this is astounding. You weren't trying to come into the United States. You were trying to leave. And you are an American citizen — not that that should have mattered.

MARK BRAY: And I'm not being charged with any crimes. If anything, I'm the victim of crimes. I wrote a book eight years ago. I consider myself politically an anti-fascist — I detest fascism — but I'm not a member of any antifa group. I'm a professor. I'm a dad. I'm just trying to live my life here. But, of course, because the far right is trying to create a bogeyman term in “antifa” to equate protests with terrorism, I got caught up in the middle of this.

AMY GOODMAN: So, you are the author, Professor Bray, of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook. If you can explain what antifa is and what it means for President Trump to have issued this executive order calling it a terrorist — domestic terrorist organization? Is it even an organization? Talk about antifa now and through history.

MARK BRAY: Right. So, as you said, it's a term that is short for “anti-fascist” or “anti-fascism.” It's originally German from the era of opposition to Hitler. After World War II, anti-fascism continued throughout the world, and the specific European tradition of what they called antifa spread to other countries around the world. For example, in the U.S., you had Anti-Racist Action in the '80s and '90s, which was a network of decentralized groups across the continent organizing against the far right.

The term “antifa” really kind of made its appearance in the U.S. in the late 2000s, but it's not an organization. It's more of a politics or a movement. I liken it to feminism. Sometimes there are feminist groups, but feminism itself is not a group. There are antifa groups, but antifa itself is not a group. It's just sort of like more of a verb. It's a thing you do to organize against the far right in decentralized groups.

Trump, of course, doesn't care about any of that. It's a useful bogeyman term to demonize protest, demonize resistance, equate it with terrorism. And it's really, you know, an obvious page out of the textbooks about fascist and authoritarian leaders. It's so — it's such an obvious imitation of, you know, the kind of the Red Scare talk about communism, but applied to today.

AMY GOODMAN: It's very interesting you've moved to Spain. I mean, for years we've covered the Abraham Lincoln Brigadistas, Brigade, those Americans who went to Spain, where you are now, to fight against the fascist Franco. Many of them died. Many of them came back. And this was just before World War II. They were the most experienced, presumably, in fighting. But when a number of them signed up to fight in World War II, to fight Hitler, they were labeled “premature anti-fascists.” Can you talk about that? And they were not allowed to fight in World War II.

MARK BRAY: Right. So, there were a lot of activists and leftists in the U.S. and around the world who realized the threat of Hitler well before mainstream society. And a number of them journeyed over to Spain to fight in the international brigades. A significant number of them lost their lives. Some of them returned. They were blacklisted in the U.S.

And it is also worth pointing out that a number of Spanish Civil War veterans from other countries who ended up going to France after the Spanish Civil War played important roles in the French underground. And there was a tank battalion of Spanish anarchists that were among the first to liberate Paris in 1945. It's a fascinating history. It's the one that I — I teach a course on the Spanish Civil War.

So, it is strange to sort of have these things twisted around. And I ended up going to Spain because I'm a historian of Spain. But I've received a lot of solidarity and support from the social movements here. And actually, there's a general strike today in Spain for Palestine, as well — just to throw into your news report.

AMY GOODMAN: We had you on last in 2017 to discuss your book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, when it first came out. In the introduction, you wrote you hoped your work would promote organizing against fascism and white supremacy. Can you elaborate?

MARK BRAY: Right. So, anti-fascism has a broad history. In the U.S., certainly, there's the European-inspired antifa tradition. There's also a really good book called The Black Antifascist Tradition that talks about the role of anti-fascism in Black liberation struggles, Black Panthers and so forth, which I suggest people check out. So, it takes many different forms.

What it has in common is actually this impulse towards unity and putting aside the differences that often divide the left, in the interest of promoting the common struggle against fascism, against white supremacy. And what we're seeing today in the U.S. is increasingly fascist. MAGA, I believe — and I study fascism, I don't say this lightly — is a fascist movement. And if we don't organize, if we don't take action in the streets, we're going to end up somewhere really bad.

And for me personally, I felt like my situation was such that I had to get my family out of harm's way. But this story about me is about me, but it's not really about me. It's about attacks on academic freedom, free speech, the right to protest. We're in a really dangerous situation. And so, everyone, in their own way, needs to take action to try and organize against this.

AMY GOODMAN: I mean, it's interesting. You remind me of Timothy Snyder, as well as Jason Stanley, the two Yale professors, who also left the country. They've gone to Canada to teach, both having written books against fascism and tyranny. I wanted to ask you about U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi's comments, saying the administration will take the, quote, “same approach” to antifa as it has to drug cartels it's bombed in the Caribbean. The latest bombing, I think, took place yesterday, killing a number of people. Even Republican politicians, behind closed doors, are saying, “Where is the evidence?” for who these people are, who have been killed by the U.S. bombs. Mark Bray, your response to Pam Bondi?

MARK BRAY: Right. Well, the paradox of fascism is that while it's trying to gain power, it talks about the need for law and order, and to the degree that it gains power, it tramples all over the law. It does not care about the law or legality, due process, civil liberties. And so, this kind of call to murder people in this country, without, of course, even having gone through any due process — not that I'm in favor of capital punishment anyway, but that's another story — it is this kind of example of calling for the strongman, in Trump, to use deadly force, without any evidence, against people accused of made-up crimes that are being equated with — you know, at times, some of the Trump administration people have compared it to — ISIS to antifa, right? So, to me, it's really this kind of fascist attack on civil liberties.

And if they're equating protesters with antifa, and they're saying that they're going to use the methods used for the people in the boats in the Caribbean on antifa, the implication is they are ready to kill American protesters. And, you know, we know the history of Kent State — right? — where students were gunned down in the '60s. It could happen again if we're not careful. So we really need to be very vigilant about this.

AMY GOODMAN: Do you think progressive groups, groups that care about democracy, free speech, across the political spectrum, are pushing back enough around the attack on anti-fascists?

MARK BRAY: Well, you know, I think there's always room for more action. And I think that my main takeaway for viewers today is that whether or not you consider yourself an anti-fascist, anyone who has any critiques of Trump is potentially in the crosshairs here, because there's a concerted project from the top to equate protest with terrorism and to say anyone who's not a Trump supporter is basically the equivalent of ISIS. You can't make this stuff up. It's absolutely ridiculous. They don't care at all about grounding in fact or information. It's something that plays to their base and justifies attempts to step beyond due process to use, apparently, lethal force against dissidents. This is terrifying. And so, everyone really needs to do what they can to sound the alarm.

AMY GOODMAN: Finally, I wanted to ask you about the Rutgers students calling for the university to support you, wanting Rutgers President William Tate to issue a statement, a, quote, “Resolution in Support of Professor Mark Bray's Academic Freedom and Free Expression.” This apparently is slated for consideration and vote Friday by the Rutgers University Senate. Your response, Professor Bray?

MARK BRAY: Well, I've received a tremendous amount of support from the Rutgers faculty, from the student body and from the administration. I support that call. I hope it passes. I would very much appreciate a statement of direct support from President Tate. But, you know, to his credit, he did issue a statement in support of the free speech and academic freedom of all Rutgers faculty, which did not mention me directly, but I think, implicitly, supported my right to do my scholarship in accord with my job. But, you know, again, the Rutgers community has been fantastic, and especially given attacks on higher education across the country, the way that some subjects have been, basically, straight-up banned in states like Florida, I'm happy to be a professor at Rutgers.

AMY GOODMAN: Mark Bray, Rutgers University history professor, author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook. He's just moved his family to Spain after receiving death threats following President Trump's push to categorize the anti-fascist movement as a domestic terrorist organization.

Coming up, we speak with a professor at Stanford University, professor emeritus, about what — the deal that was made in Sharm el-Sheikh, and also about his own niece, who had been held hostage by Hamas in Gaza for 54 days, her husband killed. This is Democracy Now! Back in 30 seconds.

 How the Country Can Bring Peace to the Middle East

In his recent speeches in Egypt and Israel, U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly invoked the word “peace” when describing his vision for a new Middle East. He is right to do so. After decades of perpetual conflict, the region may be on the precipice of a genuinely stable future. As we argued in Foreign Affairs last December, Israel's battlefield achievements against Hamas and Hezbollah—together with the collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria—had created a rare opening for the Jewish state, the United States, and key Arab countries to forge a coalition capable of stabilizing the region and countering extremism. And developments since then have only made that vision more urgent and attainable.

Earlier this month, after two years of fighting, Hamas and Israel finally agreed to a U.S.-brokered cease-fire that could both end the war in Gaza and dismantle the terror organization. Israel and the United States have decimated Iran's network of proxies and struck the country's own nuclear and missile infrastructure, breaking the Islamic Republic's grip on much of the Middle East. As a result, these two regional spoilers are on the back foot. A better future, in other words, is very much within reach. Even Israeli politicians—foremost among them Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu—are speaking of peace again, after years in which that word had virtually disappeared from their lexicons.

That does not mean the path forward is obstacle-free. Israel is diplomatically isolated and extremely unpopular on Arab streets, in European squares, and on American campuses. Hamas is still the strongest political and military force in Gaza and has maintained support in the West Bank. Iran remains dangerous, even if it is weaker. And a radical Muslim Brotherhood, backed by Qatar and Turkey, is expanding its influence. Unlike in the past, these hurdles are all surmountable. But overcoming them will require a new regional coalition. This coalition will have to offer a moderate alternative to both the Iranian axis and Sunni jihadists. It will need to eventually expand into a broader Mediterranean partnership. And it must receive dedicated American backing.

Trump may have been disappointed not to receive the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. But in the eyes of most Israelis, he has earned it. The U.S. president imposed a cease-fire framework on Netanyahu, who had resisted popular demand for a deal that would have returned all hostages and ended the war. Trump did so while simultaneously getting Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey to exert heavy pressure on Hamas, which had also been reticent to sign such an agreement. It was a display of diplomatic finesse reminiscent of the shuttle diplomacy U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger deployed to end the Yom Kippur War in the 1970s.

The agreement Trump brokered is opaque. Many of its provisions remain undefined, and it appears that Washington offered bilateral assurances—perhaps even contradictory ones—to both parties. But this ambiguity is deliberate, designed to allow each side to declare victory. Israel's claim to victory centers on the return of all hostages, the military's dismantlement of Hamas as an organized force, and the creation of an international plan to eradicate its rule and disarm its militias. Israelis also get to maintain a security zone in Gaza until Hamas's disarmament is complete. Hamas, for its part, gets to declare that it withstood Israel's army for two years, forced its withdrawal from Gaza, secured the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners, put the Palestinian issue back on the global agenda, and extracted assurances that Israel will not resume the conflict.

The war in Gaza could reignite. Trump's 20-point peace plan unfolds in three stages, and only the first is underway and well defined with numerical parameters: the release of all Israeli hostages in exchange for the liberation of convicted Palestinian militants, coupled with the redeployment of Israeli forces outside central Gaza. Hamas will likely exploit areas of ambiguity even in this stage to slow the transition to the next phase, as recent delays in the return of hostages' bodies have demonstrated.

The second phase—disarming Hamas and establishing a new governing authority in Gaza with the participation of Arab and other international forces—will be far more difficult to implement. And should the parties fail to carry it out, Gaza could come to resemble Lebanon: formally ruled by a recognized government but effectively controlled by a militant organization. (Hezbollah has long dominated the Lebanese state.) In that case, Israel may once again find itself compelled to fight in Gaza wherever Hamas continues to operate.



Then there is the third phase. This stage calls for the creation of a pathway to Palestinian statehood and self-determination, conditioned on the full demilitarization of Gaza and sweeping reforms within the Palestinian Authority. It will be Israel's most significant contribution to the Trump plan, taking place after Hamas's dismantlement in the second phase. It will take far longer to see through, if it is even achievable.

Still, there is reason to be hopeful that this war, at least, is finished. Through a combination of pressure and inducements, Trump and his talented team have succeeded in forging an Arab-Palestinian front that supports the demilitarization of Hamas—an unprecedented achievement in a region where no actor has ever voluntarily surrendered its military capabilities.

The region's broader conflicts might also simmer down, thanks to the weakening of the Iranian regime. Israel's military campaign against Tehran severely damaged core components of its strategic apparatus, including its nuclear facilities, its missile systems, its air defenses, and, critically, its network of regional proxies. Israeli fighting in Lebanon, for instance, diminished the power of Hezbollah, which now faces mounting pressure from the United States and from Lebanon's government. The Yemeni Houthis continue to pose a threat to the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, but they are limited in their ability to hit Israel because of the country's excellent air and missile defense. The survival and broad recognition of Ahmed al-Shara's government in Syria further underscores Tehran's diminishing influence, especially given that Shara clearly wants to prevent Iranian meddling in the country. Meanwhile, the Iranian regime is struggling to keep its own country's economy running in the face of widespread sanctions. France, Germany, and the United Kingdom even recently reimposed the UN Security Council's sanctions, using the snapback provisions in the 2015 nuclear deal.

Still, the Iranian regime should never be underestimated, and it remains the Middle East's most patient and determined threat. Its leadership seeks revenge against Israel, and it will almost certainly study the war's lessons alongside its partners in Beijing, Moscow, and Pyongyang. Its nuclear infrastructure is bruised, but it has effectively dismantled the International Atomic Energy Agency's oversight of its nuclear program and still has several nuclear weapons' worth of enriched uranium on hand. It frequently threatens to alter its nuclear strategy and has hinted at leaving the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty or even obtaining a bomb. Iran is driven by a desire for vengeance against Israel and will use whatever weapons and cash it can scrounge up to proliferate and foster terrorism. It remains committed to perpetual conflict—which is why it is virtually the only government that did not welcome the end of the war in Gaza.

As it navigates a new future, Israel has a major advantage: its rock-solid relationship with Washington. For all the hand-wringing about the U.S.-Israeli alliance over the past two years, the two states coordinated more closely than ever after October 7, 2023. The results were excellent. The two countries' attacks on Iran's nuclear program, for instance, improved the United States' leverage in future negotiations without prompting escalation or regional warfare: all the predictions that U.S. attacks would provoke a regional war, close the Strait of Hormuz, prompt oil prices to skyrocket, and yield a wave of terror never materialized. Meanwhile, in Gaza, American diplomatic, financial, and military support allowed Israel to degrade Hamas and thus strike a deal to bring the hostages home. That doesn't mean the two sides were perfectly aligned; in private, U.S. officials pushed their Israeli counterparts to move toward peace, resulting in this month's agreement. Yet Washington showed that genuine influence over Israeli policy derives not from public reprimands or arms embargoes but from unwavering public support and closed-door pressure.

As a result, for the first time in the twenty-first century, the United States has reasserted its leadership role in the Middle East. It has achieved military success without the loss of a single American life and facilitated a peace that has been broadly welcomed across the region. Washington has demonstrated that sustained and strategic involvement in the Middle East can, in fact, reinforce the United States' position as a leading power—in contrast with its rivals. The region is not a quagmire of endless conflicts and financial burdens from which it must disengage.

But for Israel, relations with the United States are now the diplomatic exception. Almost everywhere else in the world, the country is facing a tsunami of condemnation. The harrowing images from Gaza have overshadowed the massacre of October 7. Distorted narratives—including claims that Israel deliberately starved civilians—were fueled by anti-Semitic networks and Hamas's global propaganda machine and compounded by Israel's own diplomatic shortcomings. This prompted recrimination from both the country's longtime critics and even some of its partners, including Germany and Italy. The consequences of all this anger are real. Arab governments, for example, have put a stop to their efforts at normalizing relations with Israel because they are fearful of antagonizing their constituents. Regional officials are also worried that Israel is aiming not just for security but for regional hegemony through military dominance and territorial expansion. But Netanyahu himself has said that Israel has no designs on Gaza, Lebanon, or Syria. The voices in his coalition who have called for annexing the West Bank face resistance from both the Israeli public and the Trump administration. Yet unfair as this reputation may be, Israel is nonetheless seen as a state whose conduct is fundamentally at odds with liberal values and as an unreliable regional interlocutor.

Israel is also staring down new regional competitors. Iran may be weakened, but Muslim Brotherhood–aligned governments in Qatar and Turkey have gained influence. Both states have leveraged their personal rapport with Trump to expand their regional influence, and both now coordinate closely with Washington on Syria, increasing their foothold there. Qatar has also extended its reach into Lebanon. After Israel's failed strike on Hamas leaders in Doha, Trump even compelled Netanyahu to apologize to Qatar. The White House then offered the country defense assurances that were reminiscent of NATO commitments.

Neither of these countries threatens Israel in the same way that Iran does—or to nearly the same extent. In fact, both played central roles in securing a cease-fire in Gaza, and they currently play a central role in keeping Iran weak. But they are not friendly to the Jewish state, either. Qatar, for example, continues to act as a patron of Hamas, and it amplifies anti-Israeli messaging via its Al Jazeera media network. Israel will thus need to carefully manage its relations with the two countries and push for a shift in their hostile policies, ideally in cooperation with Washington. Otherwise, they could fill the vacuum left by Tehran by propping up Sunni radicals from East Africa to the Middle East.

For Israel, diplomatic isolation, Iran, and Sunni extremism will cause continued headaches. Yet overall, the Middle East is becoming more favorable for Israeli interests. There is now a genuine opportunity to end hostilities between Israel and both Lebanon and Syria—and even to slowly normalize relations with both countries. There is also a chance to outright expand the Abraham Accords into the broader Muslim world. Indonesia—the world's largest Muslim-majority nation—represents a particularly significant opportunity. So does Somaliland, in the Horn of Africa, which seeks international recognition and occupies a strategically vital position in the struggle against the Houthis. If Azerbaijan, a long-standing Israeli partner, formally joins this regional force, it would strengthen its own relationship with the United States and reinforce stability across Central Asia. And a political change in Israel could further promote normalization discussions with Saudi Arabia and other Arab states.

Changes in geopolitics will also facilitate such talks. Today, countries across the world, including in the Middle East, are seeking more autonomy in their relationships, diversifying partnerships, and redefining their dependencies. They are more focused on acquiring advanced technology—which has become the currency of power—and maintaining stability. That means the Middle East's future will be shaped by actors who possess the military power to defend themselves and their allies without constant American intervention; the economic capability to rebuild and stabilize destroyed areas, and the technological excellence needed to link the region's economies to Asia and Europe—all while drawing on U.S. leadership when needed. And Israel, with its powerful military, strong tech industry, and ties to Washington, is the best partner most Arab states can find for running this gauntlet.

These countries can deepen their integration even without normalization. They could build a technological ecosystem that links the United States to the Gulf's infrastructure, its energy resources, and Israel's knowledge and innovation, for example, without doing so—and it would be far less politically sensitive. But either way, Arab governments will have to overcome their fears of angering their populations and plow ahead with regional integration.



Israel can simultaneously forge an even stronger relationship with Washington. The two countries should set up a new technological partnership, codified in a bilateral memorandum of understanding, predicated on equitable Israeli-American capital contributions across important tech sectors—including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, energy, and semiconductors. As part of this initiative, the United States should also extend defense assistance to Israel for the ensuing decade.

Most of all, the United States should help facilitate Israel's integration with its Arab neighbors. That means, most obviously, pushing for normalization. But it also means that Washington should ensure Israel's innovative tech ecosystem is connected to the Gulf's and invigorating the India­–Middle East–Europe Economic Corridor (better known as IMEC). To do so, Washington could name a czar specifically tasked with making this bloc of states more cohesive. The envoy would, in turn, help catalyze a technological ecosystem that bridges the Gulf's infrastructure with India's advanced services sector, both of which fit into the Trump administration's plans to turn the Middle East into the world's second most important tech hub, after the United States.

On the military front, the United States should set up a permanent security architecture that combines both Israeli and Gulf resources. It should establish a regional air defense apparatus controlled by the U.S. military's Central Command (popularly known as CENTCOM). But Washington should also establish a broader permanent joint command structure that oversees the region's maritime, cyber, and counterterrorism operations. This structure can feature Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and even Qatar—if it recalibrates its policies.

To further their cooperation, Israel, the United States, and the Arab states should expand their regional coalition into a broader Mediterranean partnership—a kind of pax Mediterranea—that promotes stability, prosperity, and technological progress across all its members. Israel and the United States should do so by convening a leadership summit featuring Arab partners as well as Cyprus, Greece, and Italy (with planned expansions to Azerbaijan, Germany, and India). There, these countries would collectively invest in joint defense procurement and military logistics; technology and energy, with a priority on innovations that can mitigate the effects of climate change and reduce food and water insecurity; and a joint financial institution. They would also figure out ways to support regional reconstruction and plan for how to respond to the many natural disasters that can afflict their shared region. The United States can invite Qatar and Turkey to participate in the coalition if they end their anti-Israeli policies, cease financing Hamas and other terrorist groups, and generally stop spewing propaganda.

A U.S.-backed Arab-Israeli coalition has long been the most viable path toward a stable Middle East. And today, it is more achievable than ever. The challenges—regional mistrust, a resurgent Muslim Brotherhood, and an Iran and a Hamas that are itching to act as spoilers—are real. But if the United States channels its renewed assertiveness and if local actors can align their power with purpose, the Middle East may finally move from perpetual crisis management into a sustainable order.

To achieve this vision, Washington and its regional partners do not need to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But they can certainly try to shift its trajectory in a more hopeful direction. To do so, these actors will need to embrace Trump's framework for a peace committee, which conditions any Israeli concessions on genuine Palestinian reform. The Palestinian Authority (or any other Palestinian government) will need to dismantle terror networks and end Palestinian incitement in schools, religious institutions, and the international arena. Israel will need to receive the remaining hostages' bodies and retain its security primacy in Gaza in order to prevent Hamas's resurgence and ensure that whatever administration follows is effective, made up of both Palestinians and international technocrats.

But regional integration cannot hinge on the Palestinian issue. A veto from Ramallah would almost assuredly doom the rest of this project—and, with it, the region's chance at long-term stability. It is instead time to prioritize peace through strength in its truest sense: not as a slogan, but as a strategy anchored in shared interests, credible deterrence, and the conviction that stability is best secured by those prepared to defend it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Federal judge is extending temporary orders barring Trump administration from deploying National Guard to Portland","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/15/us/oregon-national-guard-judge-order","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 18:50:40 GMT","


            US District Judge Karin Immergut has ruled to extend her temporary restraining orders barring the deployment of the National Guard troops to Portland, keeping President Donald Trump's federalization efforts in limbo as legal challenges unfold.
    


            The ruling by the Trump-appointed judge blocks the federal troops from deploying to Portland for another 14 days. The orders were originally set to expire this weekend.
    


            The extension comes as the federal government challenges the judge's earlier ruling on deployment in a higher court as it works to crack down on Democratic-led cities it claims are stricken by crime and disorder.
    


            The president has cited  protests outside Portland's Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility to justify the callups of troops in the deep blue city.
    


            Leaders in Oregon have emphatically disputed the president's characterizations of their cities as “war-ravaged” and uncontrollably violent, arguing in court that the situation on the ground in Portland is nowhere as extreme as federal officials portray it to be.
    


            Protests in Oregon's biggest city over White House immigration policies started in June, with a declared riot and arson arrests in mid-summer. The scene was largely calm until Trump had declared late September he was sending 200 Oregon National Guard troops to the city.
    


            Oregon and Portland officials jointly sued following the announcement, and Immergut granted a temporary order barring the federalization of those Oregon troops.
    


            The federal judge then expanded that ruling a day later to include barring the deployment of any US troops when the Trump administration reassigned federalized guard troops in Los Angeles to Portland in an apparent effort to get around the initial order.
    


            A three-judge panel with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is still weighing whether the Trump administration should be blocked from deploying the Oregon National Guard to respond to ICE protests in Portland. They have yet to release a decision. The panel last week granted an administrative stay that allowed for the federalization of the Oregon National Guard.
    


            As Trump continues efforts to federalize National Guard members across the US for deployment to Democratic-led cities, the administration faces mounting legal pushback from states saying they don't need — or want — any federal help.
    


            After the state of Illinois and its largest city sued the administration last week, calling plans to move troops from the Illinois and Texas National Guards into Chicago “illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional,” a federal appeals court ruled that the troops in Illinois can remain under federal control but can't be deployed as the appeals process continues in the ongoing showdown between the Trump administration and the state.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A senior adviser at the State Department and expert on Indian and South Asian affairs is accused by the Justice Department of printing out classified documents and storing more than 1,000 pages of highly sensitive government records in filing cabinets and trash bags at home.

Ashley Tellis, who has also worked as a contractor in the Defense Department's Office of Net Assessment, was charged in federal court in Virginia with the unlawful retention of national defense information after FBI agents who searched his home over the weekend found what they said was a trove of records marked as classified at the secret and top secret levels.

He was ordered detained Tuesday pending a detention hearing next week. One of his lawyers, Deborah Curtis, told The Associated Press that “we look forward to the hearing, where we'll be able to present evidence” but declined to comment further.

An FBI affidavit cites several instances over the last month in which Tellis is alleged to have printed on government computers, or asked a colleague to print, classified documents on topics including U.S. military aircraft capabilities. Surveillance video shows him on several occasions exiting the State Department and a Defense Department facility with a briefcase in which he was believed to have stashed the printed-out papers, according to court documents. 

Tellis also met multiple times with Chinese government officials in recent years, according to the affidavit. Tellis arrived to one 2022 dinner with a manila folder while the Chinese officials he was meeting with entered with a gift bag, the FBI says. The affidavit says Tellis did not appear to have the manila folder in his possession when he left the restaurant, but does not accuse him of providing any classified information during his meetings with the Chinese.




Tellis is a prominent foreign policy expert with a specialty in Indian and South Asian affairs. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace lists him as a senior fellow and the Tata Chair for Strategic Affairs. He also served on the White House National Security Council staff under Republican President George W. Bush.

This story has been corrected to reflect that Tellis is an expert on Indian and South Asian affairs, not Indian and South affairs.

Democratic lawmakers stormed House Speaker Mike Johnson's office on Tuesday, demanding that he swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz.

Democratic lawmakers stormed House Speaker Mike Johnson's office on Tuesday night, demanding that he swear in a newly-elected representative.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., joined arms and chanted ""swear her in"" with Reps. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M., and Nanette Barragan, D-Calif., as well as Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., as they marched on Johnson's office with members of their staff. Capitol Hill police officers blocked the lawmakers from entering the speaker's office.

Footage from various angles shows Jayapal and Stansbury messing with the sign in front of the speaker's office and getting into an altercation with one of the officers.

Grijalva won her special election on Sept. 23, but she still has not been sworn into office. Her vote would be the final vote needed for the House to approve a discharge petition relating to the Epstein files, put forward by Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky.

The petition, which is currently just one vote shy of passing, calls on the GOP-controlled House to vote to urge the Justice Department to release the files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

""It shows again their disdain for law enforcement, as we see all around the country, the Democrats and everyone in that party screaming, assaulting ICE officers. They did it right here in the Capitol last night. A few members of Congress went into the little foyer of my office and tore down a sign that I had up and, and just engaged in all sorts of political stunts and antics,"" he added.

Fox News correspondent Madeleine Rivera reports on President Donald Trump working to fund troops during the government shutdown. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., weighs in on the shutdown and his state's gubernatorial race.

An aircraft carrying War Secretary Pete Hegseth made an ""unscheduled landing"" Wednesday afternoon in the United Kingdom.

Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell announced on social media that on the way back to the U.S. from NATO's Defense Ministers meeting, Hegseth's ""plane made an unscheduled landing in the United Kingdom due to a crack in the aircraft windshield.""

The plane landed based on standard procedures and everyone onboard, including Hegseth, was safe, according to Parnell.

""All good. Thank God,"" Hegseth wrote in an X post. ""Continue mission!""

Less than a month ago, President Donald Trump and the first lady had to transfer from Marine One to a support helicopter after a hydraulic issue forced an unscheduled landing at a local airfield on the way to Stansted Airport in England.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Sept. 18 the switch was due to a ""minor hydraulic issue,"" and the president and first lady safely boarded the support helicopter.

No injuries were immediately reported, according to the Pentagon. (Omar Havana/Getty Images)

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin discusses Democratic Attorney General candidate Jay Jones' controversial texts about political violence on ‘Hannity.'

Democratic Virginia attorney general candidate Jay Jones is facing backlash online over an X post that came in the wake of his texting scandal.

""As the father of two young boys, I know what it's like to feel the squeeze of grocery prices every week. I'm running for Attorney General to protect families' pocketbooks from rising costs — whether it's utility rate hikes or the price of berries,"" Jones wrote on X.

Many critics took issue with him framing the post from his point of view as a father in the wake of a texting scandal that has rocked Virginia politics.

The Republican Attorneys General Association chimed in, saying, ""As the father of two young boys, you must think anyone who fantasizes about killing children is seriously deranged and unfit for office!""

Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, also responded by calling Jones a ""dirtbag"" and demanding he drop out of the race.

""'As the father of two young boys,' you should know that wishing death upon your political opponents' children is abhorrent. Drop out, dirtbag,"" Gill wrote.

While some critics dissected Jones' wording, Rep. Brad Knott, R-N.C., simply asked, ""What's your take on political violence?""

JOE SCARBOROUGH TELLS DEM CANDIDATE JAY JONES TO LEAVE RACE OVER VIOLENT COMMENTS AGAINST GOP LAWMAKER

The scandal involving Jones came to light earlier this month when the National Review published text message exchanges between the attorney general hopeful and his former state legislative colleague, Republican House Delegate Carrie Coyner. In the exchanges, Jones appears to call for violence against then-Virginia House of Delegates Speaker Todd Gilbert, his wife, Jennifer, and their children.

""Three people, two bullets. Gilbert, Hitler and Pol Pot. Gilbert gets two bullets to the head,"" Jones wrote on Aug. 8, 2022. In a subsequent text he added, ""Spoiler: put Gilbert in the crew with the two worst people you know, and he receives both bullets every time.""

Coyner asked Jones to stop, adding, ""It really bothers me when you talk about hurting people or wishing death on them.""

Jones excused the tirade by saying he was asking questions. Coyner denied that was the case, saying that Jones was ""talking about [hoping] Jennifer Gilbert's children would die.""

""Yes, I've told you this before. Only when people feel pain personally do they move on policy,"" Jones replied.

Coyner told the National Review that she had not spoken to Jones since the exchanges, other than having short discussions about policy. She told the outlet in a statement that ""what he said was not just disturbing but disqualifying for anyone who wants to seek public office.""

YOUNGKIN SAYS DEMOCRAT AG CANDIDATE JAY JONES MUST 'STEP AWAY IN DISGRACE' OVER TEXTS ABOUT FORMER GOP LEADER

Jones acknowledged the text messages and apologized. In a statement to CBS News, he said, ""I want to issue my deepest apology to Speaker Gilbert and his family. Reading back those words made me sick to my stomach. I am embarrassed, ashamed and sorry.""

Democrats have largely avoided calling on Jones to drop out of the race or pulling their endorsements of the embattled candidate.

Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., discusses the ‘historic' Israel-Hamas peace deal that President Donald Trump helped broker on ‘Saturday in America.'

As Israel and Hamas lay down their arms after more than two years of war, the U.S. is stepping in to oversee the next phase of the deal as a peacekeeping force is formed. 

Sources tell Fox News that all 200 U.S. troops had arrived in Israel by Tuesday night and will operate out of a base in Israel. Additionally, a U.S. Military C-17 transport plane packed with command-and-control equipment and supplies arrived Tuesday.

Last week, negotiators working toward a Gaza deal participating in talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, asked U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) to brief both sides, sources tell Fox News. CENTCOM Commander Adm. Brad Cooper, along with Jared Kushner and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, briefed the Qataris, the Egyptians and the Turks on the Civil Military Coordination Center (CMCC).

ISRAEL-HAMAS CEASEFIRE TAKES EFFECT, IDF BEGINS PULLING BACK IN GAZA

Once the U.S. committed to providing heavy coordination, but no boots on the ground in Gaza, negotiators left to tell the Israelis and Hamas. From there, things moved quickly, and, as one well-placed source said, ""They saw an opportunity and moved at lightning speed and took it."" However, with speed comes risk as certain questions were left unanswered, such as who would be in the stabilization force in Gaza? Or, what is the mechanism for ensuring Hamas disarms?

Fox News has learned that the CMCC will be located a few miles northeast of Gaza, not at the Israel Defense Force's Hatzor Airbase, as some previously reported. The CMCC will be under U.S. leadership, but it will also have representatives from multiple countries and stakeholders, such as the United Nations and private aid groups. U.S. personnel will monitor everything going in and out of Gaza, and will oversee all logistics of delivering aid to the enclave.

While the center is expected to be operational in the coming days, Egypt, Turkey and Qatar have yet to decide whether their representatives will be based there.

TRUMP ENVOY WITKOFF VISITS IDF BASE IN NORTHERN GAZA AS PEACE DEAL ADVANCES, THOUSANDS RETURN HOME

Neither Jordan nor Egypt said they would be willing to send troops to stabilize Gaza, and it looks as though countries outside the region could be left to handle the situation, but nothing has been finalized. Additionally, outside countries willing to send troops would likely need a mandate passed by the U.N. Security Council, as well as approval from their own governments, giving Hamas more time to rebuild and fill the power vacuum.

Despite heavy losses in the war and international threats, Hamas fighters have shown signs that they are not ready to stand down. Since the start of the ceasefire, videos of extrajudicial killings by Hamas in public squares began circulating online.

""We strongly urge Hamas to immediately suspend violence and shooting at innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza — in both Hamas-held parts of Gaza and those secured by the IDF behind the Yellow Line,"" Cooper said in a statement Wednesday. ""This is an historic opportunity for peace. Hamas should seize it by fully standing down, strictly adhering to President Trump's 20-point peace plan, and disarming without delay.""

Fox News has learned of a massive effort taking place behind the scenes to plan and execute the rebuilding of Gaza. Part of the issue is the giant tunnel network under Gaza City. To rebuild the city, the tunnels will need to be filled to make the ground stable enough for construction.

The first phase of the deal remains ongoing as Hamas has failed to deliver all 28 bodies of deceased hostages, making it less clear when the second stage will begin. Israel has repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to getting all the deceased hostages' bodies so they can have proper burials.

On Monday, Israel received the bodies of four deceased hostages later identified as Yossi Sharabi, Binpin Joshi, Guy Iluz and Daniel Peretz. Israel received four more bodies on Tuesday, three of whom were identified as deceased hostages Staff Sgt. Tamir Nimrodi, Uriel Baruch and Eitan Levi. Israel said the fourth body did not match any of the hostages and was in fact a Palestinian. 

""Hamas is required to make all necessary efforts to return the deceased hostages,"" the IDF wrote on X.

AI-powered driving will help with a growing shortage of drivers, rising costs and relentless demand for faster deliveries.

Road crews may soon get a major assist from artificial intelligence. Researchers at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute have developed a fabric embedded with sensors and AI algorithms that can monitor road conditions from beneath the surface. This smart material could make costly, disruptive road repairs far more efficient and sustainable.

Right now, most resurfacing decisions are based on visible damage. But cracks and wear in the layers below the asphalt often go undetected until it's too late. That's where Fraunhofer's innovation comes in.

The system uses a fabric made from flax fibers interwoven with ultra-thin conductive wires. These wires detect minute changes in the asphalt base layer, signaling potential damage before it reaches the surface.

THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY AUTONOMOUS TRUCKING

Fraunhofer researchers test AI sensors that detect road damage beneath the surface.  (Fraunhofer Institute)

Once the fabric is laid under the road, it continuously collects data. A connected unit on the roadside stores and transmits this data to an AI system that analyzes it for early warning signs. As vehicles pass over the road, the system measures changes in resistance within the fabric. These changes reveal how the base layer is performing and whether cracks or strain are forming beneath the surface.

Traditional road inspection methods rely on drilling or taking core samples, which are destructive, costly and only provide information for a small section of pavement. This AI-driven system eliminates the need for that kind of invasive testing.

Instead of reacting to surface damage, transportation agencies could predict and prevent deterioration before it becomes expensive to fix. The approach could extend road life, cut down on traffic delays and help governments spend infrastructure funds more efficiently.

ULTRA-THIN SOUND BLOCKER CUTS TRAFFIC NOISE DRAMATICALLY

The real power comes from combining AI algorithms with continuous sensor feedback. Fraunhofer's machine-learning software can forecast how damage will spread, helping engineers prioritize which roads need maintenance first. Data from the sensors is displayed on a web-based dashboard, offering a clear visual of road health for local agencies and planners.

The project, called SenAD2, is currently being tested in an industrial zone in Germany. Early results suggest the system can identify internal damage without disrupting traffic or damaging the road itself.

Smarter road monitoring could lead to fewer potholes, smoother commutes and less taxpayer money wasted on inefficient repairs. If adopted widely, cities could plan maintenance years in advance, avoiding the cycle of patchwork fixes that often make driving a daily headache.

For drivers, it means less time sitting in construction zones. For local governments, it means better roads built on data, not guesswork.

In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America. Published daily by senior writers and experts, these in-depth pieces go beyond the headlines to give readers the full picture. You can find our full list of In Focus pieces here.

She's won Woman of the Year on several occasions. She's been awarded multiple Emmy awards and a Peabody. When one thinks of CNN's international coverage, she's usually the first name that comes to mind. 

Christiane Amanpour first burst onto the journalism scene on 60 Minutes in the 1980s. She would later go on to anchor ABC News and host programs on PBS while primarily doing war reporting for CNN. 

THE CLOSING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY MIND

So while the British-born star is decorated, she is anything but remotely close to being an objective, trustworthy reporter. For example, just a few months ago, she compared the United States to North Korea. 

“I must say I was afraid. I'm a foreigner. I don't have a green card. I'm not an American citizen. I'm fairly prominent, and I literally prepared to go to America as if I was going to North Korea,” she claimed. “I took a burner phone. Imagine that … not my mobile phone, not my iPad, nothing, and I had nothing on the burner phone except a few numbers.”

This is the definition of unhinged hyperbole. She also led the charge against the now-former CNN president, Chris Licht, by publicly blasting him for hosting then-candidate Donald Trump for a town hall in 2023 when he was easily leading in the polls for the Republican nomination. 

Amanpour would later argue that CNN should have taped and edited the Trump town hall to craft the proper narrative. This is exactly what CBS News did with then-Vice President Kamala Harris's infamous 60 Minutes interview last October. That stunt ended up costing the network $15 million after the network settled a lawsuit with Trump. 

“So maybe less is more,” she said. “Maybe live [television] is not always right.”

Yes, because God forbid Trump says something even a liberal audience like CNN agrees with. 

But matters really came to a head after Amanpour made the disgusting claim that Israeli hostages were actually treated relatively well during their two years in captivity under Hamas. 

“It's been a terrible, terrible two years for them because not only are they there — you know, they're probably being treated better than the average Gazan because they are the pawns and the chips that Hamas had,” Amanpour said. “Now Hamas has given up all its leverage, by the way, by giving them all up. So that is a victory for the Israeli side.”

“…treated better than the average Gazan.” Uh-huh. Was the average Gazan forced to dig their own graves in tunnels underground? Was the average Gazan starved, electrocuted, or held in chains? 

On Monday night, after overwhelming backlash, Amanpour apologized on social media for her remarks. 

“It was insensitive and wrong. From speaking to many former hostages and their families, like everyone, I've been horrified at what Hamas has subjected them to over two long years,” she wrote. 

One has to wonder about Amanpour's future at CNN at this point because apparently, she doesn't think she's biased in any way, shape, or form. 

“To be honest, Oliver, I never hear myself being called ‘partisan,” she told the hopelessly biased Oliver Darcy in an interview. “I am not an American, I don't cover U.S. elections or domestic politics. I tell the truth and the stories from around the world, including what everyone over here thinks of America at any given time.”

She doesn't cover politics? That's weird, because besides publicly rebuking her own network for hosting Trump in a town hall setting in 2023, she also once defended Hillary Clinton after collapsing at a 9/11 memorial event before the 2016 presidential election, as her just having an “off day.” 

“Surely this can't be a case of a human being having an off day,” Amanpour said sarcastically. “No, like so many things, Hillary, the media are having a field day. Off to the races with another debilitating case of indignant outrage. This must be another typical Clinton conspiracy to fool them with a total transparency breakdown.”

Nope. No bias there whatsoever. And here's Amanpour back in 2020 comparing the Trump administration to the Nazis. 

“This week, 82 years ago, Kristallnacht happened,” Amanpour said in a CNN monologue. “It was the Nazis' warning shot across the bow of our human civilization that led to genocide against a whole identity, and in that tower of burning books, it led to an attack on fact, knowledge, history, and truth. After four years of a modern-day assault on those same values by Donald Trump, the Biden-Harris team pledges a return to norms, including the truth.”

Again, Amanpour said she didn't cover U.S. elections, right? And similar to she did with the Israeli hostages, she apologized for these remarks. Sort of.

“I should not have juxtaposed the two thoughts. Hitler and his evils stand alone, of course, in history,” she explained. “I regret any pain my statement may have caused.”

But she just couldn't leave it there. Instead, she defended the thought process in the most pious way possible.

“My point was to say how democracy can potentially slip away, and how we must always zealously guard our democratic values,” she warned.

Yes. Because nothing says saving democracy quite like the Democrats weaponizing the justice system or installing candidates at the 11th hour, as the party did with Kamala Harris, without one vote from the public  

For CNN, cutting ties with Amanpour has little downside. The network is already hemorrhaging viewers at an alarming rate. In prime time, despite a dizzying news cycle largely thanks to President Donald Trump, CNN is only averaging 543,000 viewers, which is down 36% from one year ago. In contrast, Fox News averaged more than 3.3 million viewers in prime time, or more than six times the audience of CNN. Amanpour reportedly makes $5 million per year, and the return on investment is low ratings and constant PR headaches like the one she's causing this week in again showing her anti-Israel bias.

I'm often asked if CBS News can be turned around by hiring Bari Weiss, a true journalist who created The Free Press from scratch to one of the most respected and read news sites in business. My answer is that the network can only change if the faces seen on it change. And until that happens, until the culture and presentation look and sound different, one person alone can't change its failing direction.

The same goes for CNN. It tried to return to the center two years ago, but the inmates with microphones revolted against its network president in Licht. He was shown the door for having the audacity to give Trump an hour-long town hall.

“You have every right to be outraged and angry and never watch this network again,” alleged anchor Anderson Cooper told viewers the night after Trump's appearance, which he also called “disturbing.”

Licht was ousted a few weeks later. Cooper kept his job. 

DEMOCRATS WANT THE GOP TO DESTROY NORMS

If CNN truly wants to earn viewers and readers' trust, it's time to take out the trash. 

And dumping Christiane Amanpour would be a very good start. ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A “compact” offered by the administration could devastate racial diversity at elite universities.

Sign up for Trump's Return, a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.

Since taking office, President Donald Trump has attacked colleges and universities using such a bewildering range of tools—civil-rights investigations, research-funding recissions, student-loan cuts, visa bans—that it's hard to keep track of what the White House is trying to reform or destroy. But the new higher-education compact offered to universities by the administration strongly suggests that Trump's higher-education agenda, if successful, will result in a far less diverse academy, with fewer Black and Latino students. It will do this by demanding that colleges adopt an admissions system based purely on test scores and GPA—and accusing any institution that resists of illegal racial preferences.

Trump's fixation on the racial makeup of selective colleges was evident during his first term, when the Justice Department sued Yale for racial bias. To back its claim, the DOJ included a table comparing Yale's admissions rate for students of different races and ethnicities with an “Academic Index,” a measure that combines high-school grades and SAT or ACT scores. The admissions rates weren't identical: 35 percent of Hispanic students in the top decile of the Academic Index were admitted, for example, compared with 20 percent of white students. The government argued that this showed “significant discrimination on the ground of race.”

The Biden administration withdrew the lawsuit, which seemingly became moot in 2023, when the Supreme Court outlawed affirmative action in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard. But after that ruling, the racial makeup of elite universities didn't shift as much as the winning litigants might have hoped. Although the percentage of Black students enrolling at Harvard fell after the decision, just as the university had warned, it stayed the same at Yale. Meanwhile, the percentage of Asian students enrolling at Yale declined—even though the stated aim of the SFFA lawsuit was to eliminate anti-Asian discrimination.

Trump's second administration seems to be treating SFFA not as the end of the affirmative-action wars but more as the beginning, even as it has sought to eliminate “DEI” from government, business, and higher education. In February, the Department of Education sent a letter to every college and university denouncing “pervasive and repugnant race-based preferences” and claiming that SFFA prohibits universities from considering race in any way, including “admissions, hiring, promotion, compensation, financial aid, scholarships, prizes, administrative support, discipline, housing, graduation ceremonies, and all other aspects of student, academic, and campus life.” It was forced to withdraw the letter in April after a federal judge noted that the SFFA ruling applied only to admissions.

Rose Horowitch: The race-blind college-admissions era is off to a weird start

The administration tried to impose its expansive view of the law again in July, when it cut a deal with Columbia to restore hundreds of millions of dollars in grants that were being withheld ostensibly on the grounds that the university had violated the rights of Jewish students. Under the agreement, Columbia “may not, by any means, unlawfully preference applicants based on race, color, or national origin in admissions throughout its programs. No proxy for racial admission will be implemented or maintained.” Brown University struck a deal a week later. Its agreement had identical language, minus the word unlawfully. The universities also agreed to provide the government with admissions data “broken down by race, color, grade point average, and performance on standardized tests,” and to maintain “merit-based admissions.” The deals being negotiated with other elite schools, including Harvard and UCLA, likely include the same terms.

“Merit-based admissions” is not a defined legal concept. Traditionally, colleges consider a wide range of criteria when evaluating an applicant: not only raw academic numbers, but also extracurricular factors such as artistic or athletic ability, and the potential to attract parental donations. But the administration's focus on GPA and standardized-test scores suggests that it plans to use the new stream of admissions data to re-create the chart it used in the Yale lawsuit, showing different admissions rates by race and ethnicity. It could then portray the chart as definitive evidence that Columbia and Brown have broken their promise to implement merit-based admissions, and once again withhold federal funding. In this scenario, the universities might be able to get their money only by radically reducing the number of Black and Latino students who enroll.

This would be a victory for the MAGA agenda, but only at two institutions. The White House, however, is also moving to get the data it wants for all selective universities. In August, Trump directed Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to “expand the scope of required reporting to provide adequate transparency into admissions.” A week later, the Department of Education published a notice in the Federal Register, normally a repository for some of the most mind-numbing bureaucratic prose imaginable. This one had more spice:

Despite the ruling in SFFA, the continued widespread emphasis on “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) in higher education causes concerns that unlawful practices may persist because DEI has been used as a pretext to advance overt and insidious racial discrimination. The federal government does not currently collect racial data on admissions and scholarships and has limited tools to ensure widescale compliance with Title VI. Greater transparency through the collection of this type of information will help to expose unlawful practices, enable the Department to better enforece [sic] Title VI, and create good incentives for voluntary compliance.

The regulation would direct the department to:

Collect data by race-sex pair on: (1) the count of institutions' applied, admitted, and enrolled cohorts, both overall and further disaggregated by admission test score quintiles, GPA quintiles, ranges of family income, Pell Grant eligibility, and parental education; (2) the average high school grade point average and admission test score quintiles for institutions' applied, admitted, and enrolled cohorts; (3) the count of students admitted via early action, early decision, or regular admissions.

Once the notice of a new regulation is posted, it enters a “public comment” phase. The government is legally obligated to consider all comments. Hundreds of identical submissions have been filed about the new admissions rule. “As a concerned citizen, I am worried about the appearance of continued racial discrimination in college admissions,” they say, before citing research from Defending Education, a Virginia-based advocacy organization whose trustees include Edward Blum, the founder of Students for Fair Admissions.

In theory, the new data being sought by the Education Department would allow the administration to re-create the Yale chart hundreds of times over. But the administration faces another obstacle: Over the past decade, and particularly since the pandemic, many selective universities have gone test-optional, meaning applicants don't have to submit SAT or ACT scores. Columbia, Duke, Vanderbilt, and Amherst are among those that no longer require a standardized test. (Other elite schools have since brought back standardized-test requirements.) Proving that admissions aren't “merit based” is hard if you lack reliable data about your preferred measure of “merit.”

This difficulty might help explain certain demands in the administration's higher-ed compact, which offers hazy promises of preferred access to funding if the schools in question adopt Trump's higher-education agenda wholesale, and less vague threats of financial ruin if they don't. (Last week, MIT became the first institution to reject the deal.) Signatories, the compact explains, must not only promise not to use any “proxies” for race during admissions; among other requirements, they must “have all undergraduate applicants take a widely-used standardized test (i.e. SAT, ACT, or CLT) or program-specific measures of accomplishment in the case of music, art, and other specialized programs of study.”

Rose Horowitch: So much for class-based affirmative action

In the Columbia and Brown settlements, the administration suggested that it will use the admissions data it gathers to conduct “appropriate statistical analyses.” This appears to be a euphemism for creating a new version of the Yale chart and declaring that any overrepresentation of minority students relative to their scores is evidence of illegal preferences. In fact, there is no statistically valid way to conclusively prove racial bias in an incredibly complex process like college admissions just by calculating average SAT scores. The SFFA case itself showed how difficult such determinations can be when done in good faith. Highly respected economists testified for both sides on the question of whether Harvard had discriminated against Asian students—and arrived at opposite conclusions. The divergence came down to subtle choices in which variables to include and how to model the highly complicated and, in certain respects, inherently unquantifiable admissions process. (Ultimately, the Supreme Court did not pick a side, focusing instead on the question of whether the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits colleges from considering race as an admissions factor to promote educational diversity.)

Elite universities have never had a “merit based” admissions process based solely on high-school grades and test scores. Nor should they. These institutions are spoiled for choice among applicants with perfect GPAs and 1600 SATs. They look for unusual talents and leadership potential, and these are not merely ways to achieve racial diversity by other means. In fact, Peter Arcidiacono, SFFA's expert witness, found that at Harvard, getting an admissions bump for sports was statistically correlated with being white.

And yet the Department of Education seems unlikely to declare admissions preferences for athletes an illegal racial proxy. The Trump administration appears to have already made its conclusions about higher education, and is now seeking to backfill the data that will justify them. Trump's precise vision for elite academia remains ill-defined, but it does not seem to make much room for nonwhite faces. It's another step toward what The Atlantic's Adam Serwer has called the “Great Resegregation.” The administration has been systematically removing Black people from senior government positions. Its college-admissions policy might ensure that the next generation of diverse leadership is stopped before it begins.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Why Is Trump Making Excuses for Hamas?","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/10/trump-israel-hamas-executions/684563/","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 16:45:00 GMT","

The president seems undisturbed by the terrorist group's murderous campaign against dissidents. In fact, he seems to admire it.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Until recently, open support for Hamas in the United States was confined to the far left. The national chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, which circulated talking points supporting the October 7 attacks, has lately declared on Instagram “DEATH TO COLLABORATORS.” But the notorious terrorist organization has found a new defender: President Donald Trump.

On Sunday evening, a reporter asked the president about reports that Hamas is reestablishing its authority in the Gaza Strip by executing its rivals. Trump said that the group is merely cracking down on crime, for which it has American approval.

“They do want to stop the problems, and they've been open about it, and we gave them approval for a period of time,” he said. “We are having 'em watch that there's not going to be big crime or some of the problems that you have when you have areas like this that have been literally demolished.”

Read: How Trump pushed Israel and Hamas to yes

Yesterday, talking with reporters in the White House, Trump added more detail to his defense of Hamas. “They did take out a couple of gangs that were very bad—very, very bad gangs,” he said. “And they did take 'em out. And they killed a number of gang members. And that didn't bother me much, to be honest with you. That's okay. A couple of very bad gangs.”

Why is Trump praising one of the world's most violent and fanatical terrorist organizations as crime-fighting guardians of public order? Two motives spring to mind.

First, Trump is invested in his cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas. The terms of the pact are shaky, though. Hamas has agreed to release the bodies of its remaining Israeli hostages, but the group is reluctant to heed demands that it give up power. Its frantic campaign of murder and intimidation against alleged gangsters and gangs—who are mostly anti-Hamas armed groups and dissidents, some with ties to Israel—seems designed to foreclose the political transformation the deal calls for. Admitting that this violence poses a dire threat to the prospect of peace in the region would challenge Trump's claim to have brought about a historic truce. And so he is reflexively brushing off any news that seems to undermine his own achievement.

A second, more disturbing explanation is that Trump genuinely does not distinguish between crime-fighting and authoritarian crackdowns. He has praised authoritarian governments elsewhere for using force to suppress protests. In 1990, he told Playboy that China had mistakenly allowed some protests before wisely reversing course: “When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it. Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength. Our country is right now perceived as weak.”

Trump has long praised autocrats who suppress dissent, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. At a press event on Monday, he praised the dictatorship of Egypt's Abdel Fattah el-Sisi for its supposed tough-on-crime stance: “It's about leadership, and it's really nice when you say, ‘How is your crime situation?,' and they don't even know what you're talking about. ‘What do you mean crime? We don't have crime.' Because if he has crime, he puts it out very quickly.” Rather than recoil at the sight of masked goons carrying out street justice without due process, Trump seems similarly inclined to praise Hamas for being tough on crime.

Graeme Wood: One era ends in Gaza, and another begins

The suggestion that Trump sees Hamas's tactics as admirable may sound uncharitable, but Trump himself likened Hamas's approach to his own. Elaborating on his defense of Hamas yesterday, Trump said, “You know, it's no different than other countries. Like, Venezuela sent their gangs into us, and we took care of those gangs. We have Washington, D.C.—it's one of the safest cities in the country. It was one of the worst cities in the country if you go back just a little while ago.”

To be clear, it is different: American cities such as Washington, D.C., may be occupied by the National Guard, but U.S. soldiers are not summarily executing people on the streets. Likewise, the spreading abuses associated with ICE's crackdown fall short of Hamas-level brutality.

Yet Trump's cavalier acceptance of these horrors, and his instinct to equate them with his own domestic crackdown, is revealing. It shows how easily he sees crime-fighting as a valid pretext for the naked murder of political rivals. It also shows that he observes no distinction between the level of force he ought to be able to apply and the unaccountable cruelty exercised by one of the world's most ruthless regimes.

The Republican justices hunt for a reason to gut America's most successful civil rights law.

Two things were obvious at Wednesday morning's Supreme Court argument in Louisiana v. Callais, a case asking the Court to abolish longstanding safeguards against racially gerrymandered legislative maps.

The first thing is that the Court will split along party lines, with all six Republicans voting to destroy the federal Voting Rights Act's (VRA) restrictions on racial gerrymandering, and all three Democrats in dissent. The other thing is that there is no consensus among the Republicans about how they should write an opinion gutting these protections.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

While all six Republican justices almost certainly walked into Wednesday's argument with a particular result in mind, they had wildly divergent theories of how to get there.

Justice Samuel Alito seemed to argue that maps that exclude Black voters are acceptable so long as they were enacted for the purpose of benefiting the Republican Party, rather than for explicitly white supremacist reasons.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh argued that the Voting Rights Act must sunset after an undetermined amount of time.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett proposed imposing a limit on Congress's power to remedy discrimination — one that the Court has applied in nonvoting cases — on election-related laws like the VRA.

But even if the Court's Republican majority cannot agree on a reason why they want to kill decades-old protections against racial gerrymanders, it's been obvious for a long time that they are eager to kill them. As a young lawyer, Chief Justice John Roberts was a central figure in a failed effort to convince President Ronald Reagan to veto an amendment to the Voting Rights Act that strengthened its protections and spawned its modern rules against gerrymandering.

Although Roberts shocked many Court-watchers when, in a 2023 case that is virtually identical to Callais, he wrote an opinion leaving the VRA's anti-gerrymandering provisions in place. Roberts claimed on Wednesday that the 2023 case “took the existing precedent as a given.” In Callais, by contrast, the Court specifically asked the parties to brief whether requiring states to draw maps that give more representation to racial minorities, as the VRA sometimes requires, violates the Constitution.

The Court, in other words, essentially asked the lawyers challenging Louisiana's current maps to directly challenge the precedents which, Roberts now claims, he previously “took as a given.”

The Republican justices, moreover, began the process of dismantling the Voting Rights Act a dozen years ago, in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), and they've handed down at least two other decisions since then that attacked this landmark civil rights law. So, in the almost certain event that Callais takes another bite out of the VRA, it will be a continuation of an ongoing Republican project.

Wednesday's argument was largely political theater. The outcome of this case was almost certainly determined long before the argument began.

The Voting Rights Act, as amended by the law Reagan signed in 1982, prohibits any state election law that “results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any US citizen to vote on account of race or color.” In Thornburg v. Gingles (1986), the Court held that this language requires states to redraw their legislative maps in a limited set of circumstances.

While the Gingles framework is complex, it primarily turns on two factors: whether a state is residentially segregated by race, and whether the state's voters are racially polarized — meaning that voters of one race tend to vote for one party and voters of another race tend to vote for another party.

When these two factors exist, they will produce two separate political communities within a state. And whichever racial group is in the majority can use its dominance of the state legislature to draw electoral district maps that cut the other racial group out of representation. Gingles held that courts sometimes must step in when this happens and require new maps that give additional representation to the minority groups.

In Callais, for example, Louisiana's Republican legislature initially drew maps that included only one (out of six) Black-majority congressional districts, despite the fact that Black people make up about 30 percent of the state's population. A lower court, applying Gingles, struck down this map, and the state responded by drawing new maps with a second Black district.

During Wednesday's arguments, the Court's Republicans made a hodgepodge of attacks on this Gingles framework. Alito, for example, appeared at odds with Gingles's holding that racially polarized voting is a problem. Louisiana, he argued, enacted its maps to protect Republicans, not to cut Black people out of representation. And partisan gerrymandering, as Alito has said in the past, is permissible.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, meanwhile, seemed to want to impose a catch-22 on racial gerrymandering plaintiffs that the Court recently rejected in the 2023 case.

The Gingles framework requires these plaintiffs to produce a sample map showing that it is possible to draw additional districts where a racial minority group is in the majority, because if it is not possible to draw such a map, then there is no point in litigating the question of whether the state must draw one. But Gorsuch seemed to argue that it is unconstitutional for courts to consider these sample maps, because the only way to draw one is to draw lines based on race.

Kavanaugh, meanwhile, proposed expanding a rule that the Court announced in Shelby County. In that case, the Court held that a central provision of the Voting Rights Act — requiring states with a history of racist election laws to “preclear” new election laws with the federal government — could not remain in effect any longer because the United States was less racist in 2013 than it was when the VRA was initially enacted in 1965.

Many of Kavanaugh's questions suggested that a similar rule must apply to the VRA's racial gerrymandering safeguards, and that those safeguards also must sunset after some time.

Finally, Barrett suggested that the Voting Rights Act may violate a standard, known as “congruence and proportionality,” that the Court first announced in City of Boerne v. Flores (1997). City of Boerne concerned the scope of Congress's power to enforce civil rights protections enshrined in the 14th Amendment. But the Voting Rights Act was enacted under Congress's power to enforce the 15th Amendment, which prohibits states from denying the right to vote “on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.”

The Supreme Court has never applied City of Boerne to a 15th Amendment case. And, in any event, it is unclear how Congress, which amended the VRA in 1982, could have complied with a test that the Court first announced in 1997.

Whichever argument the Court's Republican supermajority chooses to accept, there were no surprises in Wednesday's argument. The Court's Republicans proposed multiple, wildly divergent explanations for why they want to strike down the VRA's racial gerrymandering safeguards, but they were all rowing in the same direction. It's hard to imagine Callais ending well for voting rights plaintiffs.

A federal jury is set to hear opening statements in Manhattan on Tuesday in the fraud and conspiracy trial of two MIT-educated brothers accused in a lightning-fast, $25 million cryptocurrency heist.

The defendants — Anton Peraire-Bueno, 25, of Boston, and James Peraire-Bueno, 29, of New York City — will face a jury of their peers in the complicated case, at least in terms of education.

The daylong jury selection on Monday resulted in a four-woman, eight-man panel consisting entirely of individuals with college degrees.

Half of the jurors hold master's degrees, including in finance, the sciences, medicine, and education.

The jurors, almost all of whom are middle- or retirement-aged, will return to court on Tuesday morning, when they'll be sworn in, listen to opening statements, and hear the first government witnesses by the end of the day.

The openings promise to describe a complex, multi-step transaction on the Ethereum blockchain that left the brothers $25 million richer, while a trio of traders were left holding a pile of worthless, illiquid junk crypto.

Prosecutors say the ""first-of-its-kind"" fraud scheme took months of meticulous planning and was executed in just 12 seconds on a day in April 2023.

Before and after the alleged exploit, prosecutors say, the brothers typed in internet searches that included: ""how to wash crypto,"" ""top crypto lawyers,"" ""fraudulent Ethereum addresses database,"" and ""money laundering statue [sic] of limitations.""

Prosecutors allege that the brothers studied the trading behaviors of the victim traders before the heist, then took steps afterward to hide their identities and the location of the pilfered cryptocurrency. They've promised to reveal a web of shell companies, private cryptocurrency addresses, and foreign cryptocurrency exchanges.

""Using the specialized skills developed during their education, as well as their expertise in cryptocurrency trading,"" the brothers ""exploited the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain,"" prosecutors said in a 19-page indictment last year.

The brothers, who remain free on $250,000 bail each, have strongly contested the prosecution's accusations.

Their defense attorneys have argued that there was no fraud at all and that they merely outsmarted some ""predatory"" automated trading bots.

The alleged victims lost their cryptocurrency ""through pre-programmed trades without ever interacting with the Peraire-Buenos, directly or indirectly,"" the defense lawyers argued earlier this year, in a failed motion to dismiss the indictment.

In a blow to the defense last week, US District Judge Jessica G. L. Clarke barred the Peraire-Bueno's lawyers from arguing, as she put it, ""that the victims deserved this.""

The judge also barred defense experts from testifying about the lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency market.

The trial is expected to last into early November.

A federal judge on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration, for now, from firing federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown.

The order came five days after the administration issued reduction-in-force notifications to more than 4,000 federal workers.

""The activities that are being undertaken here are contrary to the laws,"" San Francisco U.S. District Court Judge Susan Yvonne Illston told lawyers for the administration on Wednesday at a hearing where she issued the temporary restraining order.

""You can't do this in a nation of laws,"" Illston said, according to NBC News. ""And we have laws here, and the things that are being articulated here are not within the law.""

The judge cited comments by President Donald Trump and White House Budget Director Russell Vought that have indicated the workers were being laid off explicitly to target programs favored by Democrats.

Two unions representing tens of thousands of federal workers had asked Illston to block the RIFs. 

The Trump administration had warned that it would lay off workers during the shutdown, and President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that the cuts were aimed at ""Democrat agencies"" or initiatives.

Shortly before Illston issued her order blocking layoffs, White House Budget Director Russell Vought, during an interview on ""The Charlie Kirk Show,"" said that he expected that ""north of 10,000"" federal jobs would be cut because of their shutdown.

Illston said that the Trump administration took ""advantage of the lapse in government spending and government functioning to assume that all bets are off, the laws don't apply to them anymore, and they can impose the structures that they like on the government situation that they don't like,"" according to NBC.

The judge also said that she believed the unions would be able to prove that the Trump administration's actions were illegal and ""arbitrary and capricious.""

Illston's order came on the 15th day of the government shutdown, and shortly before a stopgap funding bill that would end the shutdown failed in the Senate for the ninth time.

Democracy Forward, an advocacy group representing the unions in court, praised the judge's order.

""The president seems to think his government shutdown is distracting people from the harmful and lawlessness actions of his administration, but the American people are holding him accountable, including in the courts,"" said Skye Perryman, CEO of  Democracy Forward.

""The statements today by the court make clear that the President's targeting of federal workers — a move straight out of Project 2025's playbook — is unlawful,"" Perryman said. 

""Our civil servants do the work of the people, and playing games with their livelihoods is cruel and unlawful and a threat to everyone in our nation.""

The Trump administration could slash more than 10,000 federal jobs during the government shutdown, White House budget director Russell Vought said Wednesday.

""We want to be very aggressive where we can be in shuttering the bureaucracy, not just the funding,"" said Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget.

""We now have an opportunity to do that, and that's where we're going to be looking for our opportunities,"" he said during an appearance on ""The Charlie Kirk Show,"" which was broadcasting from the White House.

The comments came shortly before a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from firing federal workers during the shutdown.

Vought listed a number of government entities that could be targeted for cuts, including so-called Green New Deal programs at the Department of Energy and environmental justice efforts at the Environmental Protection Agency. He also pointed to the Commerce Department's Minority Business Development Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA.

Vought also said he aims to close the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which he currently leads as acting director, within ""the next two, three months.""

He said that the agency has ""the DNA of [Democratic Sen.] Elizabeth Warren,"" and that it has tried to ""weaponize"" the law against small financial institutions.

The Trump administration has warned that the shutdown, which has now stretched into its third week with no end in sight, will lead to mass firings of federal workers.

The White House said it sent layoff announcements, known as reduction-in-force notices or RIFs, to around 4,200 federal employees on Friday. That number was revised slightly downward on Tuesday.

But Vought, in Wednesday's talk show appearance, said he expects the number of RIFs to grow. 

""It could grow higher,"" he said. ""I think we'll probably end up being north of 10,000.""

The White House has shared its rolling RIF estimates in court documents as part of a federal lawsuit filed by unions representing government workers who are challenging the Trump administration's cuts.

In a hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Susan Illston issued a temporary restraining order blocking the firings for now.

""The activities that are being undertaken here are contrary to the laws,"" Illston told lawyers for the administration as she issued the order, according to NBC News.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Vought said the RIF numbers provided in the lawsuit are ""just a snapshot.""

""I think it'll get much higher, and we're going to keep those RIFs rolling throughout this shutdown, because we think it's important,"" he said.

Government employees who are furloughed during the shutdown, as well as those deemed ""excepted"" who are still required to work, are going without pay while the lapse in federal funds drags on.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday afternoon issued a presidential memorandum directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to use any remaining congressional funds to continue to pay active-duty military personnel.

Anthropic on Wednesday announced Claude Haiku 4.5, a small artificial intelligence model that's available as a lower-cost offering for all of the company's users. 

The model is fast and can outperform other larger models that were considered cutting edge just months ago, Anthropic said. 

Claude Haiku 4.5 is better at using computers than Claude Sonnet 4, for instance, which is a midsized model the company launched in May. It performs similarly to Claude Sonnet 4 and OpenAI's most recent model, GPT-5, at coding, according to SWE-bench Verified, a test set that measures an AI system's software coding abilities.

""It punches way above its weight,"" Mike Krieger, Anthropic's chief product officer, told CNBC in an interview. 

Claude Haiku 4.5 is available to Anthropic's free users, and it's now the cheapest model available to paid users.

Anthropic is an AI startup that develops a family of large language models called Claude. The company assigns new numbers to the models as they advance across generations, but the smallest model in the family is typically called Haiku, the midsized model is called Sonnet and the largest model is Opus. 

After OpenAI burst onto the scene with the launch of its chatbot ChatGPT in 2022, Anthropic launched a rival product, Claude, the following year. It's powered by Anthropic's family of models, and users can choose between free and paid tiers. 

The launch of Claude Haiku 4.5 comes just weeks after the company announced Claude Sonnet 4.5 in September and Claude Opus 4.1 in August. Anthropic is working to release another model, likely an updated version of Opus, by the end of this year or early next year, Krieger said.

For paid users, Haiku models are typically around one-third of the cost of Anthropic's Sonnet models, while Sonnet models are one-fifth of the cost of its Opus models, Krieger said. Anthropic's free users can still choose to use Claude Sonnet 4.5, but they'll get more capacity out of Claude Haiku 4.5 since it's smaller, he added. 

Claude Sonnet 4.5 is still Anthropic's best-performing model, but the company said Claude Haiku 4.5 is ideal for users looking for fast, accurate answers.

""Even for my own use, even though it is not as smart as Sonnet, I've started defaulting to it on Claude, especially in the mobile app, because it's just much faster getting an answer,"" Krieger said. 

The two models can also work together. Anthropic said Claude Sonnet 4.5 can create multi-step plans to solve complex problems, and Claude Haiku 4.5 can complete subtasks within those plans, for example. 

Running the models in parallel could be particularly useful for businesses that want to use AI to tackle longer-term projects, Krieger said.

""You could have Haiku monitoring financial streams of data – and because it's a smaller, cheaper, faster model, it can do that at a higher volume – and then pass off its early insights to Sonnet to do some deeper analysis,"" he said. 

Anthropic, which was No. 4 on CNBC's 2025 Disruptor 50 list and is valued at $183 billion, serves more than 300,000 business customers. Its annual revenue run rate is approaching $7 billion this month, according to an Anthropic spokesperson.

The company has been racing to keep up with competitors like Google and OpenAI, whose valuation has swelled to $500 billion. Following the launch of GPT-5 in August, OpenAI has inked several multibillion-dollar infrastructure deals and released a short-form video app called Sora.

The breakneck pace of the industry doesn't afford Anthropic much time to get comfortable after a launch. While the company was carrying out the training for Claude Sonnet 4.5, it had already kicked off work on Claude Haiku 4.5.

""We're really firing on all cylinders,"" Krieger said.

Bunge Global jumped more than 11% on Wednesday on the back of the Trump administration's threat to cut off U.S. purchases of Chinese cooking oil.

Bunge is one of the largest soybean processors and cooking oil producers in the world. The stock's year to date gains are roughly 18%.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the U.S. is considering ""terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil"" as a retaliatory action against Beijing's refusal to buy U.S. soybeans. China was the top buyer of American soybeans for years but has not bought a single soybean from the U.S. since May amid its trade war with the Trump administration. The country has instead been buying the crop from Argentina and Brazil due to Trump's high tariff rates on China.

Trump's threat to China comes after China's used cooking oil exports surged to record highs last year, with the U.S. accounting for 43% of the total export number.

Trade tensions between China and the U.S. have escalated in recent days. Late last week, President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports. That came after China placed new export controls on rare earth minerals. China this week then moved to tighten its grip in the global shipping space by sanctioning five U.S. subsidiaries from South Korea's Hanwha Group. 

Bunge earlier Wednesday also gave a full-year forecast that reflects its merger with grain and oilseeds processor Viterra. The company said it expects to earn $7.30 to $7.60 per share, excluding items, while analysts polled by FactSet expected $7.39 per share. Still, that appeared to be better than many investors feared. 

Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland, another large American oilseed processor, also rose 1.5% after Trump's threat.

 This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here. 

A former U.S. citizen who earned the moniker “Bitcoin Jesus” for his evangelism of cryptocurrency has agreed to pay the IRS nearly $50 million in back taxes in exchange for dropping its criminal case against him.

Roger Ver once owned two computer companies in Santa Clara. But he said goodbye to the United States in 2014 and moved to the eastern Caribbean Sea, specifically the island country St. Kitts and Nevis. 

When he renounced his U.S. citizenship, Ver owned roughly 131,000 Bitcoins either personally or through companies that he owned, according to federal prosecutors. At the time, Bitcoins traded for around $871 each and Ver was required to pay an “exit tax” on his capital gains. 

He hired a law firm to help him with his expatriation process and prepare his tax returns, along with an appraiser to value his companies. But prosecutors say he provided false or misleading information to the law firm and appraiser by hiding the actual number of Bitcoins he owned.

The following year, an appraiser Ver hired to value his companies asked him in an email to provide the number of Bitcoins he owned when he expatriated. That appraiser copied Ver's attorney in the email, but Ver did not provide a clear answer, according to court documents.

 California 

Federal public defenders in Los Angeles have accused the Trump administration of circumventing rules with the way acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli was appointed.

Ver asked, “[c]ompletely hypothetically speaking, what would the ramifications be if I were to have had 200,000 [bitcoins] at the time of my renunciation?”

The lawyer advised Ver to get an appraisal of his personally held Bitcoins from a “third party who [had] no personal interest in the tax implications of the appraisal,” according to court documents.

Ver continued to provide unclear responses to the appraiser. In some emails, the appraiser asked point blank for a number, but instead Ver wrote back about the state of the cryptocurrency market. 

“I actually have all the information you need to make it super easy for you. I would just need to explain it all, and then you would affix your name to it,” Ver wrote in an October 2015 email.

He then filed false returns in May 2016, which omitted the true number of Bitcoins he owned. 

By November 2017, Ver had sold tens of thousands of Bitcoins on cryptocurrency exchanges for approximately $240 million in cash, according to federal prosecutors. Even though he was no longer a U.S. citizen, Ver was required to report his earnings to the IRS and pay taxes, because his companies were U.S. corporations. 

A federal grand jury indicted Ver in April 2024 for mail fraud, two counts of tax evasion and three counts of subscription to a false tax return. At the time, he was living in Tokyo but was arrested in Spain. 

Ver agreed to pay his back taxes under an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office and the charges against him are set to be dismissed. 

“Mr. Ver is accepting responsibility for his actions and has agreed to pay a substantial penalty,” acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli said in a statement. “Every person, whether you're a millionaire or not, is required by law to pay taxes and we will not hesitate to hold anyone accountable.”

Through his attorney, Ver said in a statement, “I am very grateful this case has been dismissed and appreciate the Trump Administration's leadership and professionalism in working towards this final resolution. I am also grateful to everyone who supported me and sought justice in my case.”

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin belongs in the debasement trade — despite dropping $10,000 in the same week gold topped a fresh price record.

That's according to analysts who say last week's brutal sell off, which wiped out around $19 billion in leveraged positions from the broader crypto market, was driven by technical factors rather than a fundamental breakdown in Bitcoin's store-of-value thesis.

“The crash on Friday was mostly due to technical reasons related to leverage in perps markets, so nothing has fundamentally changed in the thesis for Bitcoin as a store of value,” Carlos Guzmán, analyst at research firm GSR, told DL News. 

“Bitcoin still qualifies for the debasement trade.”

Last week's crash came as investors fled risk assets following US President Donald Trump's latest tariff threats.

Meanwhile, gold stormed past $4,200 per ounce, up over 50% year-to-date. The precious metal's performance has raised questions about whether Bitcoin truly belongs in the same conversation as gold when it comes to hedging against government dysfunction and macro uncertainty.

JPMorgan analysts coined the debasement trade as a bet against governments' ability to manage their finances.

Basically, investors pull away from sovereign debt and fiat currencies, fearful their value will erode as governments address massive debt burdens by simply printing more money.

But concerns have compounded in recent months.

In the US, Trump's assault on Federal Reserve independence have sown doubts about whether Treasuries will continue to enjoy their status as the world's main risk-free asset. And this marks the second week of a government shutdown that has stymied the release of key economic data.

In this environment, gold has been the clear winner.

Even Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase CEO and a historic gold bear, has said it is “semi-rational” to hold some of the yellow metal.

For Guzman, however, Bitcoin's latest crash may tarnish its reputation as a hedge against inflation.

“Bitcoin has been in this awkward position where its main value proposition is as a store of value and protection against debasement, but it tends to trade with tech stocks instead of gold,” he told DL News.

“Last Friday's crash may be viewed as lending support to the latter view.”

But Guzman sees this as temporary.

“As the market matures and a greater proportion of Bitcoin trades in large, regulated, onshore venues, crypto-native liquidation cascades will have less impact,” he said.

André Dragosch, European head of research at Bitwise, expects Bitcoin to catch up to gold's performance in the coming months.

“There is increasing performance asymmetry in favour of Bitcoin,” he said.

Dragosch reckons three factors should drive Bitcoin higher: Bitcoin's historical relationship with global money supply reasserting itself, improving global growth expectations due to accelerating liquidity, and the relative performance between Bitcoin and gold appearing oversold by more than two standard deviations.

Although Dragosch suggests investors shouldn't use global money supply to predict Bitcoin price, there has been a long-running relationship between the two.

“Bitcoin has been undershooting global money supply, but I think that the long-run relationship between Bitcoin and global money supply will reassert itself,” Dragosch told DL News.

“The moment you see a renewed risk on, Bitcoin should outperform gold again, which I am expecting into a seasonally strong Q4.”

For now, Bitcoin remains caught between two identities: the digital gold narrative that believers have been promoting, and the reality of a volatile asset still prone to violent selloffs.

As if crypto trading isn't already volatile enough, ETF manager Volatility Shares hopes to launch Bitcoin and other digital asset funds that would give investors five times the daily exposure to the asset class. 

The long list of proposed funds includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP ETFs, as well as funds giving amplified exposure to crypto-related stocks such as crypto exchange Coinbase and Bitcoin treasury firms Strategy and Tesla. 

Typical ETFs give investors exposure to an asset—be it a security or commodity—via shares that track its price and trade on stock exchanges. 

A leveraged ETF holds debt to amplify its position. The idea is that returns for investors can be greater than the tracked asset, but losses can also be compounded—in this case, potentially by five times. 

Volatility Shares had already filed the paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission to get crypto ETFs on the market with three times exposure to the daily returns of the asset.

The company in March debuted two ETFs tracking Solana futures, including one with two times daily exposure to SOL. 

Leveraged crypto ETFs are already on the market: Miami, Florida-based Defiance ETF's MSTX gives investors access to a leveraged position in Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy's stock (MSTR), amplifying gains—and losses—by 175%.

VolShares filed for 5x single stock and crypto ETFs incl COIN, CRCL, GOOG, MSTR, NVDA, PLTR, TSLA, Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP...   They haven't even approved 3x and VolShares is like let's try 5x.  Maybe an option on long term govt shutdown (if no govt in 75 days they can… https://t.co/rVaYDcn9H0

The SEC in January 2024 approved 11 Bitcoin ETFs after saying no to applications for a decade. The funds were launched by prestigious asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, and had the most successful launch in the history of ETFs, with Ethereum funds following in summer last year.

Asset managers are now trying to get ETFs approved that give exposure to altcoins, including top assets like Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin—though a couple have already started trading.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Could Ethereum's Price at $100,000 Reshape the Entire Financial System?","https://www.tipranks.com/news/could-ethereum-at-100000-reshape-the-entire-financial-system","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 15:39:15 GMT","

If Ethereum ever reaches $100,000, the ecosystem could grow into a $12 trillion digital economy.

It sounds almost impossible, yet some investors are starting to wonder what would happen if Ethereum (ETH-USD) really did reach $100,000. At this level, Ethereum  would no longer be just another cryptocurrency. It would become one of the largest financial ecosystems in history.





At a $100,000 price, Ethereum's current circulating supply of around 121 million ETH would be worth nearly $12.1 trillion. This is more than three times Apple's (AAPL) market capitalization and close to half the total value of gold. These are world-shifting numbers that could redefine what digital assets mean for global finance.

If Ethereum reached six figures, about 36 million ETH or roughly 30% of supply would likely remain staked, which would represent around $3.6 trillion locked up in network security. At this scale, Ethereum would function as a global digital economy with its own financial infrastructure.

Every part of the network would expand in value. Transaction fees, validator rewards, and the amount of ETH permanently removed from circulation through burning would all rise in U.S. dollar terms. The entire system would start to resemble a digital nation with its own monetary policy and incentives.

Getting to $100,000 would require more than retail enthusiasm. It would take a steady flow of institutional money. Spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have already shown that traditional investors are willing to buy and hold ETH.

If pensions, wealth managers, and retirement funds begin to treat ETH as a long-term asset class, their constant inflows could keep buying pressure high. This type of structural demand would provide stability instead of relying on hype or short-term speculation.

Another major force could come from tokenized dollars. Stablecoins and digital U.S. Treasury funds now move billions across Ethereum each day. As these assets grow, Ethereum becomes the main payment and settlement layer of the digital economy, which continually drives demand for ETH.

ETH's design already supports long-term scarcity. The network burns a portion of transaction fees in every block, reducing supply over time. Meanwhile, staking continues to remove large amounts of ETH from circulation.

Overall, roughly a third of all ETH locked up, therefore the available supply in markets becomes increasingly limited. When this shrinking supply meets consistent institutional demand, the conditions for higher prices become stronger.

At $100,000 per ETH, the scale of Ethereum's “security budget” would be staggering. The network pays validators in new ETH and fees to keep it secure. Even small changes in issuance would mean huge shifts in dollar terms.

If 100,000 ETH were issued in a year, validators would earn $10 billion. At 300,000 ETH, this number jumps to $30 billion. If the issuance reached 1 million ETH, the total security payout would reach $100 billion a year. These figures show how Ethereum's economic size directly fuels its protection.

At such a high price, ordinary users would not tolerate expensive transactions. This is why Ethereum's Layer 2 networks are so important. These secondary systems handle most transactions for just a few cents while still using ETH to settle on the main chain.

The Dencun upgrade helped by introducing “blob” data storage, which reduced costs for these networks. This setup allows Ethereum to scale for millions of users while keeping fees manageable and still ensuring ETH remains central to the entire system.

If ETH did climb to $100,000, it would likely be driven by several forces working together. ETFs would create consistent buying pressure from long-term investors. DeFi (decentralized finance) would expand as higher prices increase the value of collateral and boost lending activity.

Stablecoins would keep the system running smoothly by providing liquidity for payments and trading. Together, these elements could sustain a healthy balance between buying, staking, and burning ETH, keeping the ecosystem active and valuable.

Rapid growth brings new dangers. A multitrillion-dollar Ethereum would attract much closer scrutiny from global regulators. Oversight of staking providers, liquid staking tokens, and ETFs would increase sharply.

Technical risks would also rise. Larger stakes mean higher rewards for attackers, making network decentralization and validator diversity even more important. Any sign of centralization or technical weakness could trigger sharp market reactions.

Reaching $100,000 per ETH would take years of consistent growth, stable regulation, and strong technical execution. It would not happen overnight or from a single upgrade. It would depend on a deep integration of Ethereum into global finance, where everything from digital dollars to investment funds depends on its infrastructure.

If that vision becomes real, Ethereum would evolve from a blockchain network into a core part of the world's economic system. It would represent a new era in how technology, money, and trust connect — and show just how far one decentralized idea can go.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is sitting at $4,018.90.

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) is battling to hold the $4,000 level while Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA) clings to $0.65, with both charts nearing breakout zones that could decide the next altcoin rally.

ADA Key Technical Levels (Source: TradingView)

Cardano's price structure that began in November 2024 is reaching its apex. 

The token trades around $0.67 as of Oct. 15, after sliding toward the lower boundary of a long-term symmetrical triangle.

The daily chart shows consolidation between descending resistance from the $1.50 peak and ascending support near $0.42. 

ADA recently retested this base after rejection at $0.95 earlier in October. 

Major EMAs now act as layered resistance between $0.77 and $0.84. 

The Parabolic SAR aligns near $0.84, reinforcing this ceiling.

A drop below $0.65 could expose stronger demand near $0.55 to $0.58. 

A rebound above $0.77 may open targets at $0.80 and $1.00 if momentum improves.

ADA Netflows (Source: Coinglass)

On-chain data shows consistent outflows in October, indicating that investors are moving ADA to private wallets. 

Netflows on Oct. 15 totaled negative $8.08 million. While this reduces selling pressure, it also narrows trading liquidity.

ADA Derivqtive Analysis (Source: Coinglass)

Derivatives activity has declined sharply. ADA futures volume is down 34.9% on the day, and open interest has slipped 3.7% to $682 million. 

Options volume is nearly inactive, down 92.9%. Long-short ratios still favor bulls, with Binance accounts showing 2.6 longs for every short.

In the last 24 hours, $2.04 million in ADA positions were liquidated, mostly from longs. The data shows leveraged traders remain exposed even as overall positioning turns cautious.

ETH Price Analysis (Source: TradingView)

Ethereum slipped to $3,996 on Oct. 15, down about 3% in the session, testing key support within its year-long ascending triangle. 

The move follows heavy exchange outflows and increased liquidations across derivatives markets.

The daily chart shows ETH compressed between an ascending trendline from April and descending resistance from the $4,800 peak. 

Price now trades near $3,950 to $4,000, where the 50-day EMA ($3,979) offers immediate support. 

A hold above this range could spark a rebound toward $4,230 and $4,639. A close below may expose the 200-day EMA at $3,546 and deeper support near $3,400.

The Parabolic SAR remains overhead at $4,639, signaling that buyers have yet to regain control.

ETH Netflows (Source: Coinglass)

Exchange data shows $65.28 million in ETH outflows on Oct. 15, consistent with the broader trend of coins moving off exchanges. 

This often signals accumulation but also reduces liquidity, which can amplify volatility during sharp moves.

ETH futures volume fell 25.8% to $107.6 billion, and open interest dropped 2% to $46.7 billion. 

Options trading also slowed. Despite lower volume, positioning remains bullish. Binance accounts show a 2.4-to-1 long-short ratio, with top traders holding similar exposure.

Liquidation data reveals ongoing stress. Over the past 24 hours, $125 million in ETH positions were liquidated, including $77 million in longs. 

The figures show that optimism persists, but leveraged positions remain vulnerable to another dip.

The whole crypto community just went through one of the biggest liquidation events in history.
Billions of dollars in leveraged positions were wiped out in just 24 hours.

Bitcoin plunged, Ethereum followed, and panic spread across almost every major altcoin. Some of them dipped by more than 50%. Yet, if there's one thing every experienced investor knows—these violent shakeouts often mark the beginning of the next big run.

When the weak hands are flushed out, the smart money starts hunting for the next 100x opportunity. And right now, three names are catching that attention. One of them is already live in the App Store and building real-world utility. Let's go through the top 3 altcoins to watch after this crash.

Digitap ($TAP) is quietly becoming a hot story in crypto. The reason is simple—Digitap has an entire live financial ecosystem, available today on both the App Store and Google Play.

It's the world's first omni-bank, combining crypto and traditional finance under one roof. Inside the app, users can open multi-currency IBAN accounts, order Visa-backed cards, and manage both fiat and crypto balances seamlessly.

It supports instant crypto-to-fiat conversion, Apple Pay and Google Pay integration, and offshore accounts for global accessibility.

This makes Digitap a safe haven during liquidation events. When exchanges freeze withdrawals or traders panic-sell, Digitap users can still convert assets instantly. It's practical, real, and already working.

But it's not just the app that's getting a lot of attention. The native token, $TAP, powers all transactions, card rewards, and in-app staking. A fixed portion of ecosystem revenue goes directly into buybacks and token burns, reducing supply and supporting long-term price stability.

The presale is moving fast:

That's a 22% increase coming in the next round—and with over 57 million tokens already sold, early investors are rushing in before the next stage closes.

Digitap is already a functioning fintech platform with real adoption, a working app, and revenue mechanics that protect holders even when the market collapses. That's why many see $TAP as one of the most resilient and fundamentally strong altcoins in 2025.

Next up is Giggle (GIGGLE), the crypto project backed by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ). Giggle powers Giggle Academy, a Web3 education initiative designed to provide free, global access to learning through blockchain transparency.

Here's how it works: Giggle runs on the BNB Smart Chain, keeping transaction fees low and speeds high. Every transaction comes with a 5% tax, and part of that tax automatically funds Giggle Academy's donation wallet.

That wallet supports the development of AI-assisted learning tools, gamified educational content, and programs targeting underserved regions around the world. All funds are on-chain and traceable, ensuring transparency—something rare even among traditional NGOs.

What makes Giggle special is its mix of meme-coin energy and real-world impact. Every trade helps fund free education while keeping the community engaged through trading volume.

With a market cap near $100 million, it's still early days for GIGGLE. Considering CZ's reputation, the transparency model, and the narrative of “doing good through crypto,” this project could easily become one of the standout tokens of this cycle.

The third altcoin on this list needs no introduction—Solana (SOL). Even during the recent market crash, Solana held up much better than most altcoins, recovering faster than Ethereum and maintaining strong ecosystem activity.

Why is that happening? Institutional interest.



Source: X/@solana

In the past year, Solana generated $2.85 billion in ecosystem revenue, spanning from DeFi platforms to trading and even AI-based applications. That's more than Ethereum produced in its early growth phase, and it shows how diverse and powerful the Solana economy has become.

Even more interesting—multiple Solana ETFs are now pending SEC approval. Once those get the green light, institutional investors will gain direct access to Solana exposure, which could bring billions in new liquidity.

From public companies adding SOL to their treasuries to massive growth in active wallets, Solana's fundamentals remain incredibly strong. Anything under $200 could be viewed as a strategic entry zone ahead of the ETF wave.

For investors who prefer established altcoins, SOL remains one of the safest high-growth plays for 2025.

Each of these three projects offers something unique. Solana brings institutional adoption and ETF potential. Giggle merges philanthropy and meme-driven community culture. But Digitap is the only one already live, already earning, and already changing how people use crypto daily.

When the next market cycle begins, investors will look for real utility, revenue-backed models, and live products. Digitap checks all those boxes. With the next presale stage price jumping from $0.0159 to $0.0194, this might be the last window to get in early before the broader market catches on.

In a post-liquidation market full of uncertainty, Digitap looks like the most promising 100x altcoin of them all; a fintech utility, a working app, and tokenomics designed for long-term growth. Anyone hunting for the next big crypto story after the crash should be paying attention to $TAP today.

Coinbase surprised crypto markets on Wednesday by unveiling a new issuer-facing listings program and, minutes later, adding BNB to its listing roadmap — an unexpected nod to the flagship token of its biggest rival.

At 4:12 p.m. UTC, the Coinbase Markets account on X introduced “The Blue Carpet,” a revamped asset-listing experience aimed at making the process more transparent for onchain builders. 

According to Coinbase's blog post, the bundle offers a direct line to the listings team for tailored guidance, the ability to request updates to an asset's page across Coinbase's centralized exchange and its retail DEX, referral discounts for services such as MiCA whitepaper support and market-maker matching, and limited Coinbase One subscriptions for select core team members. Coinbase reiterated that applications and listings are free and that issuers are not required to purchase ancillary services.

At 4:45 p.m. UTC, Coinbase Markets posted that BNB had been added to the roadmap. As with other roadmap items, the signal reflects intent rather than immediate availability. Roadmap inclusion does not ensure a listing; Coinbase can delay or decline assets if liquidity, technical, compliance, or other requirements are not satisfied. Coinbase said trading will be announced separately once sufficient market-making support and infrastructure are in place.

The timing is notable. 

Just nine days earlier, Arca CIO Jeff Dorman published a critique arguing Coinbase lists “some of the absolute worst assets” while ignoring “the best ones,” and he highlighted tokens issued by rival platforms — including BNB — as examples of high performers the exchange had historically not offered. He said an exchange should either list widely and be neutral, or curate the “best assets” like a broker, and faulted Coinbase for falling between those models. 

Dorman further contrasted BNB, LEO, TRX and HYPE — citing revenue-backed buybacks and strong tokenomics — with what he called inflationary tokens and opaque listing practices, framing Coinbase's approach as selectively exclusionary. Against that backdrop, adding BNB to the roadmap looks like a meaningful shift in posture, even if a listing is not guaranteed. 

Beyond its 2017 origins as a trading-fee token, BNB now serves as the primary gas asset for BNB Chain transactions and is used across that network for payments, staking, token launches and governance proposals — functioning as the chain's transaction fuel and utility token.

Pairing the Blue Carpet rollout with a high-profile roadmap addition signals Coinbase aims to court major nonnative assets when liquidity, compliance and technical standards are met — rival affiliations notwithstanding. 

At the time of writing, bnb was $1,164.33, down 4.7% in the past 24 hours.

A Surgeon Explains the Alarming Rise of Lung Cancer in Nonsmoking Women

Thoracic surgeon Jonathan Villena explains why early screening for lung cancer is critical—even for those without symptoms.

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

Lung cancer is the deadliest cancer among women in the United States, surpassing the mortality numbers of breast and ovarian cancer combined. And surprisingly, younger women who have never smoked are increasingly being diagnosed with the disease.

Here to explain what could be driving this trend—and why early screening can make all the difference—is Johnathan Villena, a thoracic surgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among U.S. women, surpassing breast and ovarian cancer combined. Thoracic surgeon Jonathan Villena explains why younger nonsmoking women are increasingly affected—and how early screening could save lives.

Thank you so much for joining us.

Johnathan Villena: Thank you for having me.

Feltman: So our viewers and listeners might be surprised to hear that lung cancer [deaths] in women now tops breast cancer, ovarian cancer combined. Can you tell us more about what's going on there?

Villena: Yeah, definitely. So in general lung cancer is the number-one cancer [killing] people in the U.S., both men and women. If you look at the American Cancer Society, around 226 new—226,000 new cases of lung cancer are projected to be diagnosed in 2025. Of those about 50 percent are cancer-related deaths, meaning [roughly] 120,000 people die every year from lung cancer. Now, what's—the good news is that the incidence has actually been decreasing in the last few years.

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: If you look at the American Cancer Society's statistics, in the last 10 years [ of data, which goes through 2021], the, the incidence of lung cancer has decreased in men around 3 percent per year. And it's about half of that in women, meaning it's decreasing [roughly] 1.5 percent per year. So one of the reasons that they think that this might be happening is that there was an uptick in smoking in women around the '60s and '70s, and that's why we're seeing a slight, you know, decrease in the incidence in men but not so much in the women.

What's more interesting and very surprising is the fact that when you look at younger people, meaning less than 65 years old—especially younger never-smoking people—there's actually an increase of women in that subgroup. They're overrepresented, and that's something very surprising.

Feltman: Does the research offer us any clues about what's going on in this demographic of younger women?

Villena: Yeah, so there's been a lot of research. So, you know, in general—and something that people don't know is that about 20 percent of lung cancers actually occur in people that have never smoked in their entire lives.

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: This is something that we don't really understand why this happens to this one in five people, but there are some risk factors associated with it. Number one is exposure to radon, which is a natural gas that sometimes people are exposed to for a prolonged time. Number two is secondhand smoking ...

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: So they don't smoke directly, but they live in a household where they smoke. And number three are kind of other environmental factors, things such as working in a specific, you know, manufacturing plant that deals with specific chemicals. And then lastly, the one that has had, actually, had a lot of research into it are genetic factors. There's definitely a preponderance of certain mutations in somebody's genes that can cause lung cancer, and that is overrepresented in women.

Feltman: Do women face any unique challenges in getting diagnosed or treated when it comes to lung cancer?

Villena: So, yes. First of all, you know, how do we treat or catch lung cancer? So the newest and, and latest way of catching this disease is actually through lung cancer screening.That's something that's relatively new; it's only happened in the last 10 years. And that's in certain demographics, meaning that if someone is over 50 years old and they have smoked more than one pack per day for 20 years, they meet the criteria for lung cancer screening, which is basically a radiograph or a CAT scan of their lungs. That's the way that we pick up lung cancer.

That's the—almost the exact same thing that people have for breast cancer, such as mammography, or colonoscopy. So that's before any symptoms come in. That's really just to try to capture it when it's in very nascent stages, right?

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Villena: Where it's very small or not symptomatic. And that's the way we diagnose a, a lot of lung cancer.

Now, that being said, there's a couple of things. So first of all, [roughly] 60 to 70 percent of people, like, in general get mammographies.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Villena: [About] 60 to 70 percent of people get colonoscopies. Only 6 percent of people actually get lung cancer screening. So it's dismally low.

Feltman: Yeah.

Villena: The reason being that sometimes people don't know about it; it's relatively new. Sometimes even doctors don't know about it. There's also a little bit of guilt involved, where people, you know, they think they did it to themselves by smoking ...

Feltman: Hmm.

Villena: So they don't wanna go do it. The second thing is that, as you could imagine, this is only for high-risk individuals or people that have a history of smoking, all right? So it misses these never-smoking one in five patients. So that's one of the things that we're actively working on.

Feltman: Yeah, how else does the, you know, the stigma associated with lung cancer because of its association with smoking, how does that impact people's ability to get diagnosed and treated?

Villena: I think there's a lot of hesitancy between patients. There's, you know, a recent study that showed that people are more—have more tendency to downplay their smoking history, meaning that if they quit, let's say 10 years ago, you tell your doctor that you never smoked.

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: And that's something very common. Or if you smoked, you know, one pack a day, maybe you say you smoked half a pack a day because you feel that guilt. So then you don't give your doctor or your caretaker the full picture. And sometimes that prevents you from getting these tests, right? So there's definitely that attitude.

There's also a bit of a fatalistic attitude, sort of like, “I did it to myself. I'd rather not know. You know, this is something that—you know, I made that choice, and if I get cancer, that's my choice.” Right? So that's, that's also another attitude that we're constantly trying to change in patients. You know, the treatment, once you capture it, is all the same, but really it's about getting screening and it's about finding the lung cancer.

Feltman: So with smoking no longer necessarily being the driving factor, at least in this younger demographic, what kinds of risk factors should we be talking about more?

Villena: So I think, you know—so smoking is always number one.

Feltman: Sure.

Villena: In the never-smoking people it's either radon, secondhand smoking or environmental factors, and then a little bit of genetics plays, plays a part.

Radon is something that people can test for in their homes. It's something that people should read up on. So that's number one: if you have exposure to that, to get rid of that.

If you are in, in an environment, let's say you work with chemicals that you think, you know, are astringent or have caused—causes you to have coughs or, you know, affects you in any sort of way, to kind of try to talk to your employer to work in a more ventilated setting.

Really important with genetic factors is understanding your family history.

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: If you have a mother, a grandmother, a grandfather who died of cancer or you have a lot of cancer in your family, sometimes understanding that and knowing that from your, you know, from your family perspective will actually clue a doctor in to doing further tests, to looking into that further, 'cause that sometimes is passed down and you can have the same genes.

Feltman: Are there any big research questions that scientists need to answer about lung cancer, specifically in young women?

Villena: So, you know, there's so much to look at, all right? So if we think about just the genetic aspect of it, there's one specific gene called the EGFR gene—or it's a mutation that's found in lung cancer that in, if you look at all people with lung cancer, it's found in about 15 percent ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Villena: Of the population with lung cancer. Now, if you look at never-smoking Asian women that get lung cancer, it's about 60 percent of them ...

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: Have that mutation. So the important thing about that EGFR mutation is there's a specific drug for that mutation, all right?

So there's definitely a lot of genetic kind of information that we're still actively researching. But the important thing about this genetic information is that there's drugs targeted specifically for those mutations. So the more we know, the more we understand, the better.

Feltman: So for folks who are hearing this and are surprised and, and maybe concerned what is your advice for how they should proceed, how they should look into their risk factors?

Villena: You know, I think one of the, the, the major aspects of health in general is understanding your own health.

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: I think that younger people tend to delay care, tend to not see their doctors, and because, one, they're busy, right, at their very busy moment in their lives. But second is that, you know, you don't wanna deal with it, and you think that you will not get cancer, that you will not get this disease because you're young and you've never smoked and you've never done anything bad.

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: But, you know, you have to be very aware of your body, so what are the kind of top four symptoms? So number one, let's say you have a cough, and that cough lasts for longer than two weeks, right?

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Villena: A normal cold, things like that will go away after a couple of weeks. But if it's there for a couple of months, and I've definitely seen patients that tell me in retrospect, you know, “I've had this cough for three months,” right, and it should have been checked up sooner. So understanding yourself, understanding your body, not, you know, waiting for things, not procrastinating, which is very hard to do, but you should definitely see your doctor ...

Feltman: Yeah.

Villena: Regularly.

Second is, like I said before, understanding your family, right, and what your genetic makeup is, right? Knowing your family history, understanding if your parents, grandparents had cancer, etcetera, or other chronic diseases.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Villena: And that's, that's basically the, the major aspects of it. It's really being in tune with yourself.

Feltman: So once a patient is actually diagnosed, what does treatment look like?

Villena: So treatment for lung cancer, actually, is heavily dependent on the stage. There's everything from stage 1, in which it's localized to one portion of a lung, to stage 4, where it actually has gone to other parts of the body.

Now, stage 1 disease, you basically need a simple surgery, where that lung nodule, or that lung cancer, is surgically removed, and typically you don't need any other treatments. So stage 1 is what we look for. Stage 1 is the reason that lung cancer screening works because stage 1 doesn't really have any symptoms ...

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: So when you find it that early patients do very well.

Stage 4, once it's left the lung, you are no longer a surgical candidate, unless in, you know, sometimes very specific cases, but for the most part you're no longer a surgical candidate. And there you need systemic treatments.

Feltman: And how long does the treatment tend to take for a stage 1 patient, if it's just a surgical procedure?

Villena: So if it's just a surgical procedure, look, I do these surgeries all the time: the patient comes in; we do the surgery; the patients usually go home the next day.

Feltman: Wow.

Villena: And then we follow the patient and get CAT scans every six months for a long time to make sure nothing comes back or nothing new comes. So it's pretty straightforward, and we do this all the time. We do these surgeries robotically now. Patients recover incredibly well, and they're out, you know, doing—living their lives in a couple of weeks. So it's really something very, very, very efficient.

Feltman: Yeah, so huge incentive to get checked early.

Villena: Mm-hmm.

Feltman: Are there any advances in treatment, you know, any new treatments that doctors are excited about?

Villena: Yeah, so there's two major steps forward that have changed lung cancer treatment. Number one is something called targeted therapy.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Villena: So that means that there's a drug that targets a specific mutation. So just how I was speaking about earlier about the EGFR mutation in young, never-smoking Asian women, there is a drug that targets that mutation that has really shown amazing results at all stages now.

And the second one is actually immunotherapy, which won the Nobel Prize, which is this idea that you can use your own body's immune system to kill the cancer cell. So cancer is very smart—what it does is it evades your immune system; it pretends that it's part of your own body. And what this drug does is that it basically reawakens your immune system to recognize that cancer again and kill it. And we've seen amazing results, even in the stage 4 patients, where they are potentially cured of cancer, which, which we've never seen before.

Feltman: What motivated you to get into this specialty?

Villena: You know, I do have a family history of this in an uncle that passed away from lung cancer ...

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: And he was a heavy smoker. And, you know, I saw how, basically, decimated his, he was—[his] life [was], basically. He was a very vibrant guy, he was very active, and in six months he was gone, right?

And I think, you know, once I started getting into, you know, medical school and understanding things, one of the major things that I really got into was research. And I see that if my uncle had been treated 20 years ago, he potentially could have been saved ...

Feltman: Mm.

Villena: Because of these advances in research. And right now we are right at the cusp where we are learning all these new things, and we actually have the tools to change how patients are treated, you know? And this—every year there's a new treatment, which prior to that, there was no new treatment; i t was basically just chemo, and that's it, all right? So I think that that really motivated me—something that I can actually take part in and actually change the course for a lot of people.

Feltman: Well, thank you so much for coming on to chat with us today. This has been great.

Villena: Thank you.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode. We'll be back on Friday to unpack the shocking story of a missing meteorite.

Scientists created this new phase of ice—known as Ice XXI—by supercompressing water to 20,000 times normal pressure in just 10 milliseconds.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Ice isn't all that complicated. Gather together some H20 molecules, drop the thermostat to zero degrees Celsius (at atmospheric pressures) and voila—ice. So, it may come as a surprise that there isn't just one molecular arrangement, or “phase,” of ice. In fact, there are 20 phases of ice, all denoted with Roman numerals from I to XX. 

Now, in a new study published in the journal Nature Materials, scientists from the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) have now found yet another phase, appropriately named Ice XXI. At the heart of the experiment, scientists used diamond anvil cells (DACs)—a common device used in materials science for squeezing samples under immense pressure—to subject water to 2 gigapascals (20,000 times higher than normal atmosphere) of pressure in just 10 milliseconds. Then, they utilized state-of-the art X-ray facilities like the European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser Facility (XFEL) and PETRA III to visualize the structure.

The scientists call this kind of water “supercompressed,” and it's metastable, meaning it persists for a time even when another form of ice would be more stable. And because of the immense pressure, ice forms at room temperature but the molecules are much more densely packed. 

“Rapid compression of water allows it to remain liquid up to higher pressures, where it should have already crystallized to ice VI,” Geun Woo Lee, a co-author of the study from RISS, said in a press statement. “The structure in which liquid H2O crystallizes depends on the degree of supercompression of the liquid.”

Compressing the water is only part of this high-tech experiment, though, as scientists also need to meticulously document the water's molecular journey during those handful of milliseconds. The European XFEL produces X-ray flashes that capture an image every microsecond, which is one millionth of a second. This basically creates an ultra-advanced high-speed camera that shows the ice phase formation in motion.

Then, the team used the P02.2 beamline at PETRA III to conduct diffraction experiments to understand the overall structure of Ice XXI, which has a tetragonal structure composed of large repetitive units called “unit cells” that contain 152 water molecules. Using DACs to examine materials under immense pressures is a common way for scientists—especially geologists—to glimpse the inner workings of Earth. These high-pressure ice experiments similarly aim to help experts understand hard-to-reach physics.

“Our findings suggest that a greater number of high-temperature metastable ice phases and their associated transition pathways may exist, potentially offering new insights into the composition of icy moons,” Rachel Husband, a co-author of the study from Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron's (DESY), said in a press statement. 

The idea isn't as far-fetched as one from a study in 2021, which focused on how the superionic Ice XVIII and Ice XX phases might lie at the heart of the formation of the unusual magnetic fields found on Neptune and Uranus. In other words, unlocking the mysteries of ice on Earth could help us unlock an unknown number of mysteries throughout the cosmos.

When Mary Leakey discovered the OH 5 cranium of Paranthropus boisei alongside Oldowan stone artefacts, it was declared “the oldest yet discovered maker of stone tools”1. Whether Paranthropus made and used tools has been debated ever since2,3,4, largely because there are no known hand bones that can be definitively attributed to this genus. Here we report fossil hand and foot bones unambiguously associated with craniodental material of P. boisei. KNM-ER 101000 demonstrates that P. boisei shared key manipulative and bipedal adaptations with the genus Homo. Moreover, the hand morphology of KNM-ER 101000 converges on that of gorillas in ways that are consistent with manual food processing and would have facilitated powerful grasping, such as that used in climbing. These fossils suggest that P. boisei was capable of tool making and use in some capacity while also supporting the proposed dichotomy of distinct dietary adaptations between Paranthropus and Homo. In addition to offering insights into the poorly known postcranial functional anatomy of Paranthropus, this discovery illuminates broader patterns of hominin hand evolution and tool use.

In recent decades, some researchers have opined that it should be assumed until proven otherwise that all Plio-Pleistocene hominin species engaged in tool behaviours to some degree3,5,6,7. Meanwhile, others have argued that Paranthropus was a toolmaker on the basis of analyses of hand bones with uncertain attribution to the southern African species Paranthropus robustus8,9,10,11,12. However, fossil hand bones confidently associated with taxonomically diagnostic craniodental remains have been conspicuously missing from these debates. Almost none of the approximately 2.5–1.0 million-year-old hominin hand fossils from eastern Africa are known with certainty to belong to a particular species13. This uncertainty extends to the OH 7 hand bones, which form part of the holotype of Homo habilis2, but whose species assignment has been questioned (for example, see ref. 14).

Here we describe a hominin partial skeleton that includes hand and foot bones unambiguously associated with craniodental elements of P. boisei. KNM-ER 101000 was recovered in 2019–2021 during survey and excavations at Koobi Fora on the eastern side of Lake Turkana, Kenya (Supplementary Fig. 1). The fossils derive from laminated sandy silt that directly overlies a known hominin trackway surface (FE22)15. This sequence represents a lake margin facies approximately 10 m above the prominent stromatolitic marker bed A6 and 7.6 m below the base of the Koobi Fora Tuff complex16 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Information). On the basis of this information, KNM-ER 101000 is estimated to be slightly older than 1.52 million years.

Fine sands with abundant nondecalcified molluscs, silts with saline crusts (halite) and clays with multiple pedogenic carbonate (Bk) horizons characterize this interval of strata. Note that the source strata for KNM-ER 101000 are 10–25 cm above a siltstone layer that has a known hominin trackway surface (FE22)15. c, Specimen distribution map of the KNM-ER 101000 excavation.

Between approximately 2 and 1 million years ago (Ma) in eastern Africa, there is evidence of up to four contemporaneous hominin species: P. boisei, H. habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus (for examples, see refs. 17,18,19). The teeth of KNM-ER 101000 resemble those of P. boisei in size more than those of any Homo species. Moreover, they exceed the sizes of Homo in all dimensions of the mandibular premolars and molars except for the buccolingual breadth of the second lower molar (M2), which falls within the upper limits of the early Homo range (Extended Data Fig. 2a–f and Supplementary Table 2). In terms of relative proportions, the ratio of the maxillary crown sizes of the canine and third upper molar (M3) (55%) of KNM-ER 101000 is within the range for P. boisei (49–56%) and below that of early Homo (66–76%), which signifies that KNM-ER 101000 possessed the relatively small canines that are characteristic of P. boisei (Fig. 2b). Hyperthick enamel is another well-established synapomorphy of Paranthropus20,21,22. The average enamel thickness (AET)23,24 of the maxillary and mandibular M3 specimens of KNM-ER 101000 is within the P. boisei range (M3 AET = 2.86 and M3 AET = 2.68; Fig. 2c). Overall, the dentition of KNM-ER 101000 strongly supports its taxonomic attribution to P. boisei.

In b and c, data are presented as boxplots, with the median indicated by a vertical line, the box spanning the interquartile range and the whiskers extending to 1.5× the interquartile range from each quartile. The skull silhouette in a was created by Mark Belan.

Associated cranial fragments also preserve morphology diagnostic of P. boisei (Fig. 2a). These include a parietal fragment that preserves a prominent sagittal crest, which suggests that it can be attributed to a male P. boisei individual. The anterior margin of the zygomatic process of the maxilla originates in alignment with the third upper premolar (P3)19,25,26. Likewise, the nasoalveolar contour of the maxilla is flat, suggesting that the incisors would not have protruded beyond the bicanine line27. Computed tomography imaging of this maxillary fragment revealed a three-rooted fourth premolar (P4) (Supplementary Fig. 2), which is universally expressed in Paranthropus28. However, it is also present in some specimens attributed to early Homo. The right temporal bone preserves a well-defined and robust articular eminence, with a maximum preserved mediolateral length of 39 mm, which distinguishes it from the narrower mandibular fossae of Homo25,29. These features of the maxillary and temporal fragments are congruent with the identification of KNM-ER 101000 as P. boisei.

Spatially associated with these P. boisei craniodental elements are multiple bones from the right and left hands (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 1). As with the craniodental remains, there is no indication that more than one individual is represented (for example, there is no duplication of elements and no notable difference in element size). Bones of the left thumb include a mostly complete manual distal phalanx (mDP1), the proximal end of a proximal phalanx (mPP1) and the proximal half of a first metacarpal (Mc1). The palm is represented by a complete right fifth metacarpal (Mc5) and three other metacarpal shaft fragments. The finger bones include nine phalanges (six proximal and three intermediate), with the second proximal phalanx (mPP2) and the probable third intermediate (mIP3) phalanx preserved largely intact. Substantial portions of what are provisionally assigned to mIP2 and mPP4 are also preserved along with smaller phalangeal fragments, which are probably mPP3, mPP5 and mIP4. The wrist is represented by the left trapezoid and scaphoid and by the right lunate and hamate.

Palmar (left) and dorsal (right) views. The following right elements were mirrored: hamate, lunate, Mc5 and proximal phalanx (second ray). See Supplementary Table 1 for a full list of element attributions and sides (where known). The outline is for illustrative purposes only and not an interpretation of the relative phalangeal lengths (see Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3 for analyses of digit proportions). Scale bar, 10 mm. The hand outline was created by Francis Tre Lawrence.

KNM-ER 101000 indicates that P. boisei had essentially modern human-like intrinsic hand proportions. That is, the thumb was long relative to the palm and other fingers (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c and Supplementary Table 3), a characteristic also exhibited by known species of Australopithecus but not Ardipithecus ramidus, which had more ape-like hand proportions. Although only the base of the mPP1 is preserved, human-like thumb-to-finger proportions are indicated on the basis of the length of the Mc5 against both a reconstruction of the total pollical phalangeal length (using the mDP1 length plus the predicted mPP1 length based on the hallucal proximal phalanx length) and the mDP1 length alone (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Furthermore, the length of mPP2 compared with that of mDP1 indicates a thumb that was long relative to the index finger, as in recent humans and all fossil hominins except Ar. ramidus (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Such proportions in KNM-ER 101000 would have enabled P. boisei to form human-like precision grips that require opposition of the distal pads of the fingers to that of the thumb30.

The mDP1 is broadly similar in morphology to those of most other early hominin specimens but larger in absolute maximum length and width (Extended Data Fig. 3b). It is very robust, with an expanded apical tuft and a deep proximopalmar fossa and pronounced insertion gable for the tendon of flexor pollicis longus. Weathering prevents full assessment of the ungual fossa, but it seems to have been expansive, which is indicative of a well-developed digital pulp. The exceptionally broad apical tuft of KNM-ER 101000 is most similar to that of OH 7 (but OH 7 lacks any clear indication of a well-developed flexor pollicis longus muscle30), as well as to specimens of Homo naledi and to Neanderthals. Earlier hominins such as Orrorin tugenensis and Australopithecus afarensis exhibit moderately broad tufts similar to recent humans, whereas Ar. ramidus resembles Pan and Gorilla in the narrowness of its tuft. Broadening of the pollical distal phalanx may represent an adaptation to increased manual dexterity (for example, human-like forceful precision grips). However, what drove the extreme broadening of the distal phalanx in some of these hominin species is unclear.

In contrast to species of Australopithecus, KNM-ER 101000 exhibits a robust thumb, with evidence of well-developed thenar musculature. The pollical metacarpal, although lacking the distal half, is exceptionally robust with marked entheses. It is considerably larger in relative and absolute size than any of those known for australopiths, including KNM-ER 47000 (a specimen that has been tentatively attributed to P. boisei31; Extended Data Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 3). The articular facet for the trapezium is strongly curved dorsopalmarly and radioulnarly as seen in extant great apes and in Australopithecus (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c). Such marked articular curvature is unlike the derived, relatively flatter condition (especially radioulnarly) shared among modern humans, Neanderthals and H. naledi.

The trapezoid is well preserved and, similar to those of extant great apes, is wedge-shaped with a relatively large triangular-shaped facet for the scaphoid and a mostly dorsally placed facet for the capitate. The palmar aspect of the bone is expanded proximodistally such that the radial and ulnar portions of the second metacarpal facet are oriented more parallel to the scaphoid facet than is typically seen in extant great apes. However, the palmar portion is not radioulnarly expanded as it is in modern humans, Neanderthals and H. naledi (Extended Data Fig. 5a,d).

The scaphoid preserves facets for the radius, capitate, lunate and trapezoid that are all mostly intact, but with some erosion near their respective boundaries; however, the tubercle (and most of the trapezium facet) is missing. As with all hominins and the African apes, the centrale portion is completely incorporated into the body. The shape and orientation of the capitate and lunate facets, as well as the large facet for the trapezoid that distally closes the scaphoid–capitate joint, are most similar to those of extant African apes. By contrast, modern humans, Neanderthals and H. naledi display a configuration which is more open distally and is confluent with an enlarged and palmarly placed capitate-trapezoid joint (Extended Data Fig. 5b,e).

The lunate is well preserved. The facet for the capitate head is deeply concave and the radiocarpal surface is convex and mediolaterally broad (Extended Data Fig. 5f). Overall, the lunate exhibits the morphology shared by African apes and hominins. However, in combination, the morphologies of the lunate and scaphoid suggest that KNM-ER 101000 mostly retained a primitive, African ape-like radiocarpal and midcarpal joint configuration (Extended Data Fig. 5c).

As with the thumb, the hypothenar elements of KNM-ER 101000 are robustly developed, which is suggestive of considerable ulnar-side hand strength (Extended Data Fig. 6). The hamulus of the hamate is long relative to the length of the hamate body (Extended Data Fig. 6a,c), which resembles the condition in Gorilla (particularly Gorilla beringei). However, unlike in Gorilla, Pan and Pongo, KNM-ER 101000 shows a more hominin-like relationship between the hamulus breadth and width and only a moderate distal inclination of the hamulus, which is similar to most other early hominins (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b, measurements are defined in the caption). The large hamulus of KNM-ER 101000 probably provided expanded entheses and increased leverage (longer moment arm) for the opponens digiti minimi and flexor digiti minimi muscles and probably the flexor carpi ulnaris with its connection to the hamulus through the pisohamate ligament. The morphology of the hamulus is accompanied by an Mc5 shaft that is very robust (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c) and exhibits marked radioulnar bowing with an exceptionally large and rugose crest along its ulnar aspect, which marks the distal attachment of the opponens digiti minimi (Extended Data Fig. 6c). In these aspects, the hypothenar complex of KNM-ER 101000 converges on the condition seen in G. beringei (Extended Data Fig. 6c). However, Gorilla and other great apes tend to have Mc5 and Mc4 bases that are ‘locked in' by the strong distal inclination of the hamulus. By contrast, KNM-ER 101000 exhibits a more convex surface on the Mc5, and the correspondingly concave surface on the hamate indicates increased mobility of the fifth ray, similar to that of recent humans and other hominins. Pronounced protuberances at the base of the Mc5 mark attachment of the extensor carpi ulnaris (on the dorsal side) and the flexor carpi ulnaris (on the palmar side by way of the pisometacarpal ligament) along with the capsular ligaments of the fifth carpometacarpal joint.

The morphology of the non-pollical phalanges is consistent with that of the thumb and hypothenar region in exhibiting marked robusticity (Extended Data Figs. 7 and 8). The complete mPP2 is the most robust specimen in the fossil comparative sample. Moreover, its exceptional radioulnar breadth at the midshaft relative to the proximodistal length is matched only by a few male specimens of Gorilla (Extended Data Fig. 7a). KNM-ER 47000 (ref. 31) (ostensibly also representing P. boisei) is considerably more gracile, although this difference could reflect sexual dimorphism (see the G. beringei male–female comparison in Extended Data Fig. 7b). In overall gestalt, the proximal phalanges of KNM-ER 101000 resemble those of gorillas (especially G. beringei), although the complete mPP2 lacks strong longitudinal shaft curvature (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d) as do the less complete phalanges from the other digits (based on qualitative assessments). This result suggests that climbing and suspension may not have been a regular component of the adult male P. boisei locomotor repertoire. All of the mPP specimens of KNM-ER 101000 are similar to those of gorillas in having pronounced flexor sheath ridges, which indicate strong recruitment of the long digital flexors (sometimes interpreted as another correlate of climbing or suspension). However, these ridges are generally less well developed in the more arboreal great apes (genera Pongo and Pan), which renders the biological role of this trait (beyond strong digital grasping) difficult to interpret32,33,34,35.

The intermediate phalanges of KNM-ER 101000 evince a robusticity similar to the proximal phalanges, which is again matched only by a few Gorilla specimens and by OH 7, possible P. robustus or Homo specimens from Swartkrans and some Neanderthal specimens. The longitudinal shaft curvature of the intermediate phalanges does not clearly separate recent Homo sapiens from the African apes, but the measurable intermediate phalanx of KNM-ER 101000 is among the least curved in the fossil sample, with only two specimens from Swartkrans exhibiting lower included angle values (Supplementary Table 5). Relative to the midshaft radioulnar width, the mPP2 of KNM-ER 101000 has an exceptionally narrow distal trochlea (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Although relative trochlear breadth has been suggested to align OH 7 with Paranthropus14 (rather than its typical attribution to H. habilis36), there is extensive overlap with the extant ape sample and several of the other hominin samples in this measurement (Extended Data Fig. 8b).

A small fragment of the left proximal radius of KNM-ER 101000 is preserved. Much like the other known radius of P. boisei (OH 80)37, the size of the radial tuberosity (long axis of enthesis = 27.8 mm, perpendicular to the long axis = 17.6 mm) suggests that KNM-ER 101000 possessed a large biceps brachii muscle that was probably capable of generating strong forearm flexion and supination. Its absolute cross-sectional cortical area is within the range of Gorilla and in the upper quartile of Pan troglodytes, well above that of recent humans (Supplementary Fig. 5). Some studies have suggested that P. boisei would have engaged in arboreal behaviours on the basis of the thick cortical bone observed in the tentatively attributed humerus of KNM-ER 47000 (ref. 38). Although a strong upper limb could have facilitated climbing behaviours, other explanations such as systemically thick cortical bone in this species should also be considered in the context of the overall morphological pattern across the postcranium39.

The right foot of KNM-ER 101000 is represented by a complete hallucal proximal phalanx (pPP1), a non-hallucal proximal phalanx (probably pPP5) and a right third metatarsal (Mt3) that is missing its distal end (Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10). The pPP1 is intrinsically robust, with a dorsally canted proximal articular surface similar to that of recent humans and other hominin fossils (for example, SKX 45690 and StW 470). Dorsal canting facilitates increased dorsiflexion during bipedal push-off40,41. The logged ratio of pPP1-to-pPP5 length in KNM-ER 101000 reflects a hallux that is long relative to that of great apes but short in comparison to recent humans. The pPP5 of KNM-ER 101000 is relatively short, displaying reduced curvature compared to Ar. ramidus (ARA-VP-6/500-044 and GWM67/P2u) and A. afarensis (A.L. 333-115i, A.L. 333-154 and A.L. 333-160) along with a greater dorsal inclination of its metatarsophalangeal joint facet that matches pedal phalanges from Neanderthals, Pleistocene H. sapiens and SKX 16699 (ref. 42), which probably reflect similar functionality of the lateral forefoot (Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10). A high positive Mt3 torsion angle (about 41°) in KNM-ER 101000 indicates the presence of a well-developed transverse arch, which significantly contributes to stiffness in the hominin foot43. By comparison, the Mt3 of OH 8 has a lower Mt3 torsion angle (15°) than KNM-ER 10100, falling near KNM-ER 803 and Sterkfontein specimens attributed to Australopithecus africanus, but its value falls within the range of the modern human sample. Finally, the Mt3 of KNM-ER 101000 displays a dorsoplantarly tall and relatively flat proximal articular surface, which is associated with tarsometatarsal joint stability in bipeds44. The Mt3 base of OH 8 is slightly shorter than that of KNM-ER 101000, with a ratio value falling near those of H. naledi (U.W. 101-1035 and U.W. 101-1457), Dmanisi H. erectus (D2021) and SKX 247. However, the difference between OH 8 and KNM-ER 101000 could be sampled in our modern human and chimpanzee samples. Overall, the pedal elements of KNM-ER 101000 indicate that increased stiffness and bipedal push-off characterized the foot of P. boisei. However, the relatively short hallux of KNM-ER 101000 also suggests that the push-off mechanics in P. boisei would have differed slightly from those of recent humans (sensu45). The reduced intrinsic length and diaphyseal curvature of its non-hallucal proximal phalanx are more human-like than those of A. afarensis and Ar. ramidus, which suggests that there was little reliance on pedal grasping in P. boisei by approximately 1.5 Ma. Although a fully bipedal foot does not preclude occasional (or even frequent) climbing, as observed in some human populations46, it suggests that this behaviour was not the primary selective force in the locomotor repertoire of this species.

It has long been assumed that the earliest members of the genus Homo manufactured and used stone tools2. However, the discovery of 3.3 million-year-old stone tools at Lomekwi47 together with 3.0-million-year-old Oldowan artefacts alongside a purported Paranthropus molar at Nyayanga4 has reignited debate about possible tool use in other taxa. On the basis of analyses of KNM-ER 101000, it is clear that the hand of P. boisei had derived thumb–finger length proportions and was probably capable of grips similar to those of modern humans. However, judging from the retention of a suite of plesiomorphic features in the wrist and base of the thumb, radioulnar transmission of loads from the powerful thumb probably differed from that of recent humans and Neanderthals, which indicate differences in habitual thumb use during manual manipulation. We propose that precision-pinch-type grips were likely to be less effective in P. boisei than in later members of the genus Homo with a more derived trapeziometacarpal and radial wrist morphology. However, this does not rule out tool behaviours (including the making and use of early lithic technology).

Overall, the functional morphology of the hand and wrist of KNM-ER 101000 suggests that it had a powerful grip strength, particularly in the ulnar aspect of the hand. An important caveat is that tool use may not have been the only factor driving selection on hominin hands. For example, in some fossil hominin taxa such as A. afarensis and H. naledi, there is compelling evidence to suggest that climbing was an important part of the locomotor repertoire. There are indications of strong grasping in KNM-ER 101000 that would have facilitated climbing performance, and P. boisei may have engaged in arboreal behaviour at some frequency. However, one of the clearest signals of frequent climbing and suspensory behaviour in primates (that is, longitudinal shaft curvature of the manual and pedal phalanges48) is notably less expressed in KNM-ER 101000 than in A. afarensis, H. naledi and extant African apes, whereas pedal morphology in KNM-ER 101000 evinces a greater commitment to terrestriality than in earlier hominins.

Although one possibility for explaining the convergence of gorilla-like hand morphology in P. boisei is that it may have adopted a climbing style that was specifically gorilla-like, the distinctive features of the climbing gait in gorillas seem to be a compensation for their large body mass49. Thus, it is unclear why P. boisei would have adopted such a mode of climbing given that estimates of its body mass50 are similar to those of other early hominins such as A. afarensis51, and notably smaller than modern gorillas. Consequently, although any primate will use its hands in a variety of behaviours, climbing competency may not have been the sole (nor likely to be the primary) selective factor in the convergent evolution of the gorilla-like manual features in P. boisei.

In primates more broadly, feeding behaviours often require complex manual manipulation and forceful processing52. Mountain gorillas use forceful, palm dominated power grasping that incorporates the fifth digit during arboreal behaviours, but they also regularly use their hands in this capacity to access edible portions of tough vegetation53. The morphological convergence of P. boisei hand morphology with that of G. beringei (especially in the hypothenar region and manual phalanges) is notable in light of dietary reconstructions indicating that P. boisei subsisted on a tough diet dominated by herbaceous, grass-like plants (reviewed in ref. 54). On the basis of the overall morphology of the postcranial elements of KNM-ER 101000 (and possibly other specimens attributed to P. boisei, such as OH 80), the similarities to gorillas may reflect intensive manual processing of such plants for food.

In addition to insights into the paleobiology of Paranthropus, KNM-ER 101000 provides an opportunity to revisit longstanding debates over the taxonomic attribution of the foot bones from OH 7 and the hand bones from OH 8 (refs. 10,14,55). The morphology and relative proportions of the intermediate phalanges of KNM-ER 101000 are highly similar to those of OH 7. Although this similarity could be viewed as evidence in favour of the hypothesis that the hand of OH 7 belongs to Paranthropus rather than H. habilis14, the degree of variation in relative trochlear breadth makes the taxonomic significance of this metric unclear. It seems unlikely that a pollical metacarpal base as curved as the Mc1 in KNM-ER 101000 (or KNM-ER 47000) would articulate with a trapezium like in OH 7. This finding weakens the hypothesis that the hand of OH 7 belongs to Paranthropus14 (further detailed analyses are required to establish whether this range of variation occurs in a single species). Poor scaphoid preservation in both OH 7 and KNM-ER 101000 limits the utility of comparison between these elements. The Mt3 of KNM-ER 101000 is similar to that of OH 8, which has intrinsically large Mt2 and Mt4 articular facets and a dorsoplantarly tall diaphysis relative to its mediolateral breadth. By contrast, the Mt3 diaphysis of KNM-ER 101000 has a substantially greater transverse curvature and a dorsoplantarly flatter proximal articular surface than OH 8. However, the extent to which these metatarsal traits distinguish P. boisei from H. habilis is currently unknown.

More generally, because Homo and Paranthropus are sister taxa21,22,27, the KNM-ER 101000 fossils enable the reconstruction of the probable ancestral condition of the hand that would have characterized the earliest members of both the Homo and Paranthropus lineages. Modern humans and Neanderthals share several derived features in the thumb and radial wrist bones that probably evolved as an adaptation to making and using stone tools3,7,56,57,58. Exactly when this complex of derived features first evolved remains unclear, but available fossil evidence suggests that it had occurred by at least 1.4 Ma (for example, KNM-WT 51260)59.

Our analyses reveal that the last common ancestor (LCA) of Homo and Paranthropus (and therefore the earliest members of the genus Homo) would have possessed a relatively robust Mc5 and Mc1 and a radially expanded first carpometacarpal joint (Fig. 4). This proportional increase in the marginal elements of the hand represents an adaptive shift from earlier australopiths, such as those probably responsible for the Lomekwian stone tools47, and indicates an increased reliance on stabilized power grips56. By comparison, derived aspects of the modern human wrist that facilitate effective precision-pinch grips do not seem to have been present in the Homo–Paranthropus LCA. Rather, these evolved later in the Homo lineage.

Summary of ancestral state reconstructions highlighting key inferred transitions in hominin hand evolution. Ancestral state reconstructions were conducted across a phylogeny consisting of 6 extant apes and 14 hominin fossils for 20 morphological characteristics using maximum parsimony. No polarity or character ordering was assumed a priori. KNM-ER 101000 was taken as the sole representative of P. boisei, although it never differed in character state from KNM-ER 47000. FPL, flexor pollicis longus. Illustrations were created by Mark Belan.

If the derived features of the P. boisei hand are indeed convergent with gorillas to facilitate strong and repeated grips involved in intensive food processing, then it may support a model in which Paranthropus and Homo evolved divergent dietary strategies in a sympatric setting that allowed them to subsist as ecological specialists and generalists, respectively, with Homo including further commitment to intensified tool use60.

Immediately after specimen excavation and preparation, surface scans of each fossil element were generated by T. Gichunge using a HDI Advance 3D scanner (Polyga). Subsequently, micro-computed tomography (microCT) scans of KNM-ER 101000 were generated at the Stellenbosch University CT Scanner Facility61 with a General Electric Phoenix VTOMEX L240 microCT system (the scan resolution ranged from 15 to 50 μm depending on the size and density of the element).

Linear measurements of the dentition of KNM-ER 101000 were recorded from the original fossils using Mauser 0.05 mm accuracy dial calipers. Comparative dental metrics were obtained from published sources (Supplementary Tables 6–10). For comparisons between the anterior and posterior dentition, crown modules of hominin maxillary M3 specimens and canines were calculated per a previous study62.

To measure enamel thickness, buccolingual sections through the apices of the dentine horns of the mesial cusps of the unworn maxillary RM3 (protocone and paracone) and the unworn mandibular RM3 (metaconid and protoconid) were virtually extracted from the microCT scans of these teeth in Avizo (v.2021). In each slice, the enamel–dentine junction (EDJ) was clearly visible, and the area (mm2) of the enamel cap was measured using ImageJ. With reference to the RM3, a wedge of dentine was lost below the preserved EDJ of the metaconid, and the missing cervical extension of its enamel cap could be estimated with reasonable accuracy by following its curvature inferiorly as previously advocated63. The area of the narrow crack through the cusp tip of the metaconid was subtracted from the overall estimated measurement of the enamel cap to obtain a value of 63.21 mm2, and its inferior length was subtracted from the overall estimated length of the EDJ to obtain a value of 22.11 mm. With reference to the RM3, the area of the wide crack through the intercuspal embrasure (1.80 mm2) was subtracted from the overall measurement of the enamel cap to obtain a value of 67.70 mm2, and its inferior length (0.73 mm) was subtracted from the overall measured length of the EDJ to obtain a value of 25.25 mm. The AET was then calculated by dividing the area of the enamel cap by the length of the EDJ. Summary metrics of comparative data from refs. 23,24 are provided in Supplementary Table 4.

Relevant linear dimensions of KNM-ER 101000 were measured and compared with data from extant comparative groups and available fossil hominins (see Supplementary Tables 11–37 for details of the compositions of extant and fossil samples and data sources for each analysis).

Only the proximal base of the mPP1 is preserved for KNM-ER 101000. To estimate the total pollical phalangeal length (proximal plus distal), the mPP1 length was estimated on the basis of the length of the hallucal proximal phalanx, which in the comparative sample of extant H. sapiens (n = 53), Pan spp. (n = 52) and Gorilla spp. (n = 48) specimens correlates strongly with pollical proximal phalanx length (least squares regression: mPP1 length = 0.997 × pPP1 length − 0.38; r2 = 0.66; P < 0.001). The total mPP1 and mDP1 length using the mean estimate of the mPP1 length and the upper and lower 95% prediction intervals are plotted against the Mc5 length in Extended Data Fig. 3a to show the uncertainty, but is human-like in all cases. Note the relative length of only the distal pollical phalanx relative to the Mc5 length. Supplementary Fig. 3 also demonstrates the human-like proportions.

The longitudinal shaft curvature of the mPP2 and the complete mIP3 of KNM-ER 101000 were quantified using the included angle method. Landmarks were extracted from the 3D polygon model of the specimen to measure dimensions used to calculate the included angle per a previously described method64. The extant comparative sample was measured in the same way along with all compared fossils, except for one whose included angle values were taken from the literature (OH 86)65. The sample composition for the curvature analysis is provided in Supplementary Tables 34 and 35.

The principal curvatures of the articular surface were quantified for the Mc1 of KNM-ER 101000 and the extant and fossil comparative samples in the dorsopalmar and radioulnar directions using a quadric surface fit with a least-squares method57 (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Zero values indicate a flat surface with no curvature, whereas values greater or less than zero indicate a curved surface with more curved surfaces having larger absolute values than less curved surfaces. Because this articular surface in hominids is typically saddle-shaped, the sign indicates the direction of curvature (for example, dorsopalmar is positive, radioulnar is negative). Comparative sample details are provided in Supplementary Tables 21 and 22.

A canonical variate analysis of trapezoid shape was conducted using angles between articular surfaces and relative surface areas (Extended Data Fig. 5a). The former were quantified by fitting least-squares planes to each and measuring the angles between the resulting planes66, whereas the latter were quantified by dividing the articular surface area by the surface area of the entire bone67. Comparative sample details are provided in Supplementary Tables 23 and 24.

A 3D geometric morphometric analysis of the preserved portions of the scaphoid of KNM-ER 101000 was conducted (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Using Stratovan Checkpoint software, surface patches were fit to the radius and capitate articular facets and to the preserved portion of the trapezium–trapezoid facet. Landmark patches (density of 9 × 9) were manually placed using the ‘patches' option in Stratovan Checkpoint (v.2022.12.16.0419, Stratovan). No patch was placed on the trapezium surface because this region was broken in KNM-ER 101000. Landmarks that were homologous and easily locatable (for example, points where three structures met, maxima of curvature) were treated as conventional landmarks and used as anchors to place the patches. The remainder of the landmarks were treated as sliding semi-landmarks. In total, there were 8 landmarks and 235 sliding semi-landmarks. The sliding semi-landmarks were slid along the surfaces in 3D to minimize the bending energy of a thin-plate spline deformation using the function slider3d() in the R package Morpho (v.2.10)68. Sliding is an iterative process; specimens were relaxed against the Procrustes mean configuration by sliding along tangent planes until a designated threshold distance (the Procrustes distance between the old and new mean) was reached68. After each iteration of the sliding process, the points were projected back onto the surface to avoid the semi-landmarks ‘falling off' the bone68,69,70. The set of slidden landmarks underwent a generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) and subsequent principal component analysis (PCA) using the function procSym() in the R package Morpho (v.2.10)68. The procSym() function returns an array of GPA superimposed coordinates of the translated, scaled and rotated landmark configurations for each specimen. A PCA was then performed on the array of GPA superimposed coordinates, which returned a matrix of principal component (PC) scores. The PC scores were plotted using the function ggplot() in the R package ggplot2 (v.3.4.1)71. Point clouds were used to visualize the shape variation along PC axes. Point clouds representing the most negative and positive shapes along the PC axes were generated using plotReftoTarget() in the R package geomorph (v.4.0.4)72,73. Comparative sample details are provided in Supplementary Tables 25 and 26.

A canonical variate analysis of scaphoid and lunate shape (using matched pairs of these carpals) was conducted using angles between articular surfaces and relative surface areas (following the same methods as described above for the trapezoid shape analysis). Comparative sample details are provided in Supplementary Table 27.

Variables quantifying functional aspects of hamate form were quantified using landmarks placed on 3D surface scans of KNM-ER 101000 and the comparative sample following previously described methods74 and summarized in Supplementary Fig. 4c. Details of the comparative sample are provided in Supplementary Tables 28 and 29.

The cross-sectional cortical area of the radius of KNM-ER 101000 was measured immediately distal to the radial tuberosity at a level that we estimated to represent 25% of the total physiological length (as defined in a previous study75). The comparative dataset for this analysis consisted of radii from a mixed sex sample of recent cadaveric modern humans (n = 10) housed in the Department of Anatomical Sciences, Stony Brook University, as well as P. troglodytes (n = 18) and Gorilla spp. (n = 24) specimens housed at the American Museum of Natural History (New York City) and the Museum of Comparative Zoology (Harvard University). These comparative specimens were subjected to longitudinal CT scanning using a LightSpeed VCT scanner (GE Healthcare) in the Department of Radiology, Stony Brook University Hospital. The slice thickness was 2.5 mm. Specimens were scanned dry, and a bone-reconstruction algorithm was used. The cross-sectional area of the cortical bone was calculated from DICOM files using the BoneJ plugin76 for ImageJ software (NIH). Each element was first segmented by the BoneJ automated thresholding protocol ‘Optimize Threshold' to extract the bone phase. Structural properties were then analysed on a DICOM slice that was determined to represent 25% of the physiological length using the ‘Slice Geometry' function.

The size and composition of the extant sample varied across the analyses of different pedal elements. These are described in Supplementary Tables 38–43. The fossil hominin data were collected from original specimens housed at the following institutions: the Ditsong National Museum of Natural History; the Evolutionary Studies Institute, University of the Witwatersrand; the National Museum of Ethiopia; and the Turkana Basin Institute, Ileret. We supplemented the fossil data using research-quality casts of specimens housed at the following institutions: the National Museum of Kenya (for example, Koobi Fora specimens) and the National Museum of Tanzania (OH 8). We also used published data on base measurements of fossil hominin metatarsal samples77,78. For most analyses, we visualized distributions of raw values across species combined with box and whisker plots that display summary statistics such as the median, the interquartile range and the range for each sample.

CT data from the New Mexico Decedent Image Database (NMDID) and Primate Research Institute Computed Tomography (PRICT, Kyoto University) were segmented to produce 3D meshes using ORS Dragonfly software. CT data from the Center for Academic Research and Anthropogeny (CARTA, University of California, San Diego) were used to generate 3D meshes using OsiriX software. The remaining individuals were scanned using a NextEngine HD or an Artec Space Spider scanner. We cleaned each 3D model using Geomagic Wrap software (for example, filling small holes and smoothing meshes generated by CT scanning). We calculated the pPP1 dorsal canting angle as the angle between a least-squares plane fit to the proximal articular surface and a plane fit to the plantar surface defined by three landmarks: the most plantar point on the medial tubercle of the base; the most plantar point on the lateral tubercle of the base; and the most plantar point on the trochlea. We calculated the angle as the inverse cosine of the dot product of the normal vectors of each plane.

We calculated a phalangeal length ratio (pPP1/pPP5) and a pPP5 length ratio (pPP5 length/pPP5 base mediolateral breadth) from linear measurements collected using Mitutoyu sliding calipers.

The articular angle method was used to quantify the orientation of the metatarsophalangeal joint surface to enable comparisons with previously published data42. To quantify the shaft curvature, we used ImageJ software to calculate the included angle from three measurements collected on photographs of pPP5 specimens79. The three measurements included the maximum length, the midshaft depth and the projected phalangeal height at the midshaft.

We evaluated the morphometric affinities of the pPP5 of KNM-ER 101000 using PCA. The analysis included nine variables: the included angle of curvature; the dorsal canting ratio; the length; the base mediolateral breadth (BML); the base dorsoplantar depth (BDP); the midshaft mediolateral breadth (MSML); the midshaft dorsoplantar depth (MSDP); the trochlea mediolateral breadth (TML); and the trochlea dorsoplantar depth (TDP). The seven linear distances (length, BML, BDP, MSML, MSDP, TML and TDP) were divided by their geometric mean. The dorsal canting ratio was calculated using two linear measurements: the dorsal interarticular length and the plantar interarticular length. The combination of curvature, ratio and geometric mean-standardized lengths required the use of the correlation matrix in the PCA. We used the ‘princomp' function in R (v.4.4.0).

We calculated Mt3 torsion using a previously described 3D landmark method80. As previously noted, the CT data from NMDID, PRICT and CARTA were segmented to produce 3D meshes using ORS Dragonfly or OsiriX software. All 3D models were imported into Geomagic Wrap for smoothing and/or cleaning before analysis. We digitized six landmarks on each 3D model: the most plantar point of the proximal articular surface at midline (LM1); the most dorsal point of the proximal articular surface at midline (LM2); the centroid of the proximal articular surface (LM3); the most proximal point of the medial tubercle on the plantar Mt head (LM4); the most proximal point of the lateral tubercle on the plantar Mt head (LM5); and the most dorsal point of the Mt head at midline (LM6). A seventh landmark (LM7) was calculated as the midpoint between LM6 and the midpoint of landmarks LM4 and LM5, which positioned it inside the 3D model near the Mt head. The landmarks were used to define a local coordinate reference frame. LM1 and LM2 were used to define a tarsometatarsal joint vector (TMT). LM3 and LM7 were used to define a proximodistal axis vector (PD). LM4 and LM5 were used to define a mediolateral axis vector (ML). The cross-product of PD and ML vectors was used to define a dorsoplantar axis vector (DP). TMT was projected onto the same plane as DP, and the metatarsal torsion angle was calculated as the rotation of TMT relative to PD using the atan2 function. The resulting angular rotation value was converted from radians to degrees (where 1 radian = 180°/π). For right metatarsals viewed from their proximal ends, a positive torsion value indicates a counterclockwise rotation, whereas a negative torsion angle indicates a clockwise rotation of DP relative to TMT for comparability with previous studies80,81,82,83. Metatarsal torsion angles were calculated using a custom Matlab script.

We computed the ratio of Mt3 base dorsoplantar to mediolateral dimensions using linear distances (Mt3 BDP/BML).

To reconstruct patterns of hand evolution across the hominin phylogeny, we constructed a character matrix consisting of 20 discrete morphological characteristics across the manus (Supplementary Table 44). The previously proposed characteristics3 served as the starting point for this matrix (Supplementary Table 45). We then coded character states for 6 extant species and 14 fossil taxa when preserved elements permitted the assessment of a given character. In most cases, we based these character codings on fossils that were unequivocally attributed to a taxon (for example, category A in ref. 13). The following samples were exceptions to this criterion: OH 7, which we coded as H. habilis; SK 84 was taken to represent P. robustus; and all Sterkfontein Member 4 fossils were considered to represent A. africanus. KNM-ER 101000 was treated as the sole representative of P. boisei, although it never substantially differed from the character states observed in KNM-ER 47000. The tree topology used for ancestral state reconstructions was based on the most parsimonious tree recovered per a previous study22. Ancestral state reconstructions were conducted individually for each character along the tree using maximum parsimony in Mesquite (v.3.61)84. No character ordering or polarity was assumed a priori.

Manual proximal phalanges robusticity (a,b) and longitudinal shaft curvature (c,d). RU = radioulnar width. Data presented in a) consist of the following samples: KNM-ER 101000 n = 1, KNM-ER 47000 n = 1, G. beringei n = 109, G. gorilla n = 96, P. troglodytes n = 152, P. paniscus n = 66, Ar. ramidus n = 1, A. afarensis n = 8, StW 573 n = 2, A. africanus n = 3, Swartkrans n = 5, A. sediba n = 4, OH 86 n = 1, H. floresiensis n = 1, H. naledi n = 11, H. antecessor n = 1, H. neanderthalensis n = 13, recent H. sapiens n = 216. Data presented in c) consist of the following samples: KNM-ER 101000 n = 1, KNM-ER 47000 n = 1, G. beringei n = 68, G. gorilla n = 96, P. troglodytes n = 68, P. paniscus n = 84, A. afarensis n = 7, StW 573 n = 2, A. africanus n = 3, Swartkrans n = 2, A. sediba n = 4, OH 86 n = 1, H. floresiensis n = 1, H. naledi n = 8, H. antecessor n = 1, H. neanderthalensis n = 2, recent H. sapiens n = 96. In both boxplots (a,c) the median is indicated by a horizontal line, the box spans the interquartile range (IQR), and the whiskers represent the minimum and maximum values in the sample.

RU = radioulnar width. OH 7 and KNM-WT 15000 are juveniles and are missing the proximal epiphyses. Raw lengths (without epiphyses) are used in the calculation of the index plotted in (a). Data on primate epiphyseal thicknesses are scant. Conservative upper estimates of the added length added by epiphyses (an additional 2.0 mm) would put the median index slightly lower for the OH 7 specimens at 0.38 (maximum 0.39, minimum 0.37) and thus closer to the Swartkrans sample. Similarly, when the KNM-WT 15000 phalanx is estimated at an additional 2.0 mm length with epiphysis, it results in an index of 0.29. However, the growth allometry of length and width for early hominin intermediate phalanges is unknown, so caution is warranted in interpreting these metrics for such juvenile individuals. Data presented in a) consist of the following samples: KNM-ER 101000 n = 1, OH 7 n = 4, G. beringei n = 77, G. gorilla n = 48, P. troglodytes n = 68, P. paniscus n = 59, A. afarensis n = 11, A. africanus n = 4, Swartkrans n = 5, A. sediba n = 3, H. erectus n = 1, H. floresiensis n = 2, H. naledi n = 4, H. neanderthalensis n = 42, recent H. sapiens n = 155. Data presented in b) consist of the following samples: KNM-ER 101000 n = 1, OH 7 n = 4, G. beringei n = 77, G. gorilla n = 48, P. troglodytes n = 68, P. paniscus n = 59, A. afarensis n = 11, A. africanus n = 4, Swartkrans n = 5, A. sediba n = 1, H. erectus n = 1, H. floresiensis n = 3, H. naledi n = 4, H. neanderthalensis n = 42, recent H. sapiens n = 155. In both boxplots (a,b) the median is indicated by a horizontal line, the box spans the interquartile range (IQR), and the whiskers represent the minimum and maximum values in the sample. c) illustrates the observed morphology in a sample of hominin and extant ape intermediate phalanges.

(b) Proximal articular angle of the non-hallucal pedal proximal phalanx. (c) PP1 to PP5 length ratio. (d) PP5 length to base mediolateral breadth ratio. Note that KNM-ER 101000 has a non-hallucal proximal phalanx articular angle within the range of the fossil Homo sample combined with intrinsic length reduction compared to Ar. ramidus and A. afarensis. In each boxplot (a-d) the median is indicated by a horizontal line, the box spans the interquartile range (IQR), and the whiskers represent the minimum and maximum values in the sample.

Analyses of pedal proximal phalanx shape, included angle of proximal phalanx curvature, and third metatarsal variables. (a) PCA on 9 variables reflecting the intrinsic dimensions, curvature, and base dorsal canting ratio of the pPP5. Individuals on the positive end of PC1 have increased curvature, decreased dorsal canting, increased intrinsic length, and a mediolaterally narrower base and trochlea. Individuals on the positive end of PC2 have mediolaterally wider and dorsoplantarly shallower midshafts. Open triangles = H. sapiens, black crosses = P. troglodytes, grey crosses = P. paniscus, open black circle = G. gorilla, solid black circle = G. beringei, open black diamonds = Pongo spp., green diamond = Ar. ramidus (ARA-VP-6/500-044), red squares = A. afarensis (1 = A.L. 333-115i, 2 = A.L. 333-154, 3 = A.L. 333-60), gold star = KNM-ER 101000. (b) Pedal PP5 included angle of curvature. (c) MT3 torsion angle. (d) Third metatarsal base dorsoplantar height to mediolateral breadth ratio. KNM-ER 101000 has a more derived, Homo-like pPP5 combined with high metatarsal torsion and a dorsoplantarly deep tarsometatarsal joint. In each boxplot (b-d) the median is indicated by a horizontal line, the box spans the interquartile range (IQR), and the whiskers represent the minimum and maximum values in the sample.

Non-aromatic heterocycles and carbocycles form the skeleton of countless bioactive and functional molecules1,2. Of note, four-membered saturated cyclic molecules such as azetidines, thietanes and cyclobutanes have garnered increasing attention in medicinal chemistry3-7. These molecules often possess physicochemical properties relevant to drug discovery: potency, stability, metabolic stability and target specificity3. The replacement of oxygen atoms in readily available oxetanes would offer a direct route to a variety of these cyclic pharmacophores, yet such atom swapping has been rarely reported for non-aromatic molecules. Here we report a general photocatalytic strategy that selectively substitutes the oxygen atom of an oxetane with a nitrogen-, sulfur- or carbon-based moiety, transforming it into a diverse range of saturated cyclic building blocks in a single operation. This atom swapping method exhibits high functional group compatibility and is applicable to late-stage functionalization, substantially simplifying the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and complex drug analogues that would otherwise require multi-step routes. Mechanistic investigations unveil insights on the origin of chemoselectivity that allows the endocyclic oxygen atom to react preferentially to generate an acyclic dihalide intermediate, which then undergoes efficient ring reconstruction in the presence of a nucleophilic species.

The site-specific encoding of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) provides a powerful tool for expanding the functional repertoire of proteins1,2,3,4. Its widespread use for basic research and biotechnological applications is, however, hampered by the low efficiencies of current ncAA incorporation strategies. Here we reveal poor cellular ncAA uptake as a main obstacle to efficient genetic code expansion and overcome this bottleneck by hijacking a bacterial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter5 to actively import easily synthesizable isopeptide-linked tripeptides that are processed into ncAAs within the cell. Using this approach, we enable efficient encoding of a variety of previously inaccessible ncAAs, decorating proteins with bioorthogonal6 and crosslinker7 moieties, post-translational modifications8,9 and functionalities for chemoenzymatic conjugation. We then devise a high-throughput directed evolution platform to engineer tailored transporter systems for the import of ncAAs that were historically refractory to efficient uptake. Customized Escherichia coli strains expressing these evolved transporters facilitate single and multi-site ncAA incorporation with wild-type efficiencies. Additionally, we adapt the tripeptide scaffolds for the co-transport of two different ncAAs, enabling their efficient dual incorporation. Collectively, our study demonstrates that engineering of uptake systems is a powerful strategy for programmable import of chemically diverse building blocks.

Co-translational incorporation of ncAAs via genetic code expansion (GCE) enables precise reprogramming of the proteome's chemical diversity. By leveraging orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), a wide range of functionalities, including post-translational modifications (PTMs), bioorthogonal handles, crosslinking moieties, spectroscopic probes and photocaged amino acids, have been site-specifically introduced into proteins of interest (POIs) across all domains of life, typically via amber suppression1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. These strategies offer powerful tools for studying and manipulating protein functions and for generating proteins with therapeutic and biotechnological importance.

Despite substantial progress, broad implementation of GCE remains limited by low protein production yields. Inefficiencies arise from insufficient substrate activation by orthogonal aaRSs, as well as unfavourable competition of aminoacylated tRNAs with release factors at introduced nonsense codons10. In addition, many ncAAs require advanced expertise in chemical synthesis and are used at high concentrations in typical experiments, making them prohibitively expensive, a factor that is exacerbated by the low incorporation yields.

Multiple efforts have addressed these limitations through optimized aaRS/tRNA expression systems combined with novel selection and evolution strategies that enhance suppression efficiencies11,12,13. Additional advances include orthogonal ribosomes14, release-factor knockouts15,16 and recoded genomes that permit sense codon reassignment17,18,19,20.

A less explored, but critical factor lies in the intracellular bioavailability of ncAAs. In most GCE applications, ncAAs are added exogenously to cells and taken up by passive diffusion or via native amino acid transporters. This often results in low intracellular concentrations, which is especially detrimental for aaRS/ncAA pairs with low catalytic efficiency, for which aminoacylation operates below optimal conditions10,21. Furthermore, reliance on passive diffusion and endogenous importers restricts the available design space for novel building blocks. For a small number of ncAAs, efforts in engineering biosynthetic pathways to produce them directly within cells have overcome some of these limitations, but such approaches require substantial strain development and are currently applicable to only a narrow range of functionalities22,23,24,25,26.

Engineering membrane transport systems presents a promising, yet underexplored, strategy to enhance ncAA uptake and has potential to be widely applicable. Prior work has investigated the substrate scope of a periplasmic leucine-binding protein towards known ncAAs27 and ‘Trojan horse' strategies, in which ncAAs are conjugated to carrier groups that facilitate recognition and uptake by transporters28,29,30,31,32.

Here we leverage a modular propeptide-based strategy coupled with engineering of a bacterial ABC transporter for programmable import of ncAAs, enabling their efficient encoding in E. coli. We demonstrate that isopeptide-linked tripeptides (Z-XisoK, where Z and X are natural or non-canonical residues) are actively imported into E. coli via the oligopeptide permease (Opp) and processed intracellularly, resulting in high accumulation of Z and XisoK. Using G-XisoK scaffolds, we efficiently incorporate 11 previously inaccessible XisoK ncAAs bearing functionalities such as bioorthogonal handles, crosslinkers and PTMs. We further devise a directed evolution platform to reprogramme the periplasmic binding protein of the transporter (OppA) for preferential uptake of G-XisoK tripeptides over competing linear peptides that are present in commonly used growth media. Expanding this approach, we adapt our platform for importing Z-XisoK tripeptides with diverse Z groups, including bulky or negatively charged ncAAs that are cell-impermeable on their own. Genomic integration of evolved OppA variants creates E. coli strains that are tailored for efficient single and multi-site ncAA incorporation. Finally, we adapt our scaffolds for the incorporation of two distinct ncAAs, mediated by their concomitant transport via a single tripeptide. Together, our results establish transporter engineering as a powerful strategy to unlock and customize ncAA import for the efficient production of proteins with an expanded alphabet.

Previous work in our group combined transpeptidases with GCE to generate defined protein–protein conjugates. By site-specifically encoding an azide-caged diglycine acceptor motif (AzGGisoK) (Supplementary Fig. 1a) followed by on-protein Staudinger reduction, GGisoK-bearing proteins can undergo transpeptidation with donor proteins bearing a C-terminal recognition sequence. We applied this strategy to generate ubiquitin (Ub)- and Ub-like modifier (Ubl)–POI conjugates using sortase or an asparaginyl endopeptidase as transpeptidases33,34,35.

To diversify the linker sequence in the generated protein conjugates, we explored site-specific incorporation of ncAAs resembling a general G-XisoK scaffold (Fig. 1a). Supplementing E. coli K12 with the alanine-bearing G-XisoK tripeptide (G-AisoK; Fig. 1a) enabled efficient amber suppression of superfolder GFP (sfGFP-N150TAG) using the wild-type Methanosarcina barkeri pyrrolysine-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair (wt-MbPylRS/PylT), with yields comparable to that of wild-type sfGFP production and similar to the gold-standard ncAA BocK (Fig. 1a,b). Mass spectrometric analysis revealed site-specific incorporation of AisoK (Fig. 1c), suggesting intracellular cleavage of the N-terminal glycine, either on the free ncAA, co-translationally or post-translationally. By contrast, direct supplementation of K12 with AisoK resulted in negligible sfGFP production (Fig. 1b). This was corroborated by live-cell sfGFP fluorescence measurements, which showed minimal signal with AisoK, whereas G-AisoK induced earlier and stronger fluorescence than BocK (Fig. 1d).

Intracellular G-AisoK concentrations in K12 grown with 2 mM G-AisoK are negligible. Intracellular AisoK concentrations in K12 grown with 2 mM G-AisoK are 5- to 10-fold higher than when grown with 2 mM AisoK. Consistent results were obtained over three independent replicate experiments. f, Proposed model for increased AisoK incorporation. The tripeptide G-AisoK is actively taken up via an E. coli transporter. Within the cytosol, G-AisoK is processed to AisoK, which is a substrate for wt-MbPylRS/PylT and is incorporated site-specifically into a POI.

Source Data

Similarly, G-AisoK-mediated AisoK incorporation was observed for other amber-containing target proteins (Supplementary Fig. 1b). To investigate the underlying mechanism, we performed liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)-based uptake assays21,36. We did not detect any intracellular G-AisoK after G-AisoK supplementation, but AisoK accumulated at fivefold to tenfold higher concentrations compared with supplementing K12 with AisoK directly (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 1c).

These findings led us to hypothesize that a specific transport mechanism actively imports G-AisoK into cells. Within the cytosol, G-AisoK is enzymatically processed to AisoK, which accumulates in high concentrations and serves as a substrate for MbPylRS, leading to efficient AisoK encoding (Fig. 1f).

In Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, small peptides enter the periplasm by diffusion through outer membrane porins37. Within the inner membrane, two major peptide-transporter classes facilitate peptide uptake into the cytosol: proton-dependent oligopeptide transporters (POTs) and ABC transporters5 (Supplementary Fig. 2a). To identify a potential uptake system for G-AisoK, we screened E. coli single-gene knockouts38 with deletions of individual transporters or transporter domains for amber suppression of sfGFP-N150TAG in the presence of the wt-MbPylRS/PylT pair and G-AisoK. We hypothesized that loss of a required transporter would reduce or abolish sfGFP expression. Whereas deletion of POT family members and dipeptide-specific ABC transporters had no effect, individual knockouts of genes constituting the opp operon completely abolished sfGFP expression with G-AisoK (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2b,c).

Genomic deletion of oppA results in undetectable AisoK concentrations when growing cells with 2 mM G-AisoK. Consistent results were obtained over three independent replicate experiments. d, SDS–PAGE analysis of sfGFP-N150TAG expression with BocK or G-AisoK in single peptidase knockouts ΔpepN and ΔpepA and the double knockout ΔpepN/pepA. G-AisoK-dependent full-length sfGFP expression is significantly reduced in ΔpepN/pepA, indicating that pepA and pepN are the main peptidases responsible for cleavage of the N-terminal glycine. Results for other knockouts are presented in Supplementary Fig. 3. Consistent results were obtained over three independent replicate experiments. Arrow indicates full-length sfGFP, asterisk indicates truncated sfGFP. e, Proposed mechanism of Opp-mediated uptake. G-AisoK binds to OppA in the periplasm and is shuttled to membrane-bound OppB and OppC. The tripeptide is actively transported into the cytosol in an ATP-dependent manner, where it is cleaved by pepN and pepA to AisoK. OppA, in its apo-form, is released from the TMDs to allow binding of new G-AisoK.

Source Data

The Opp ABC transporter comprises the periplasmic binding protein (OppA), two transmembrane domains (TMDs) that span the inner membrane (OppB and OppC) and two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) that drive ATP hydrolysis (OppD and OppF) (Fig. 2b). Peptide-bound OppA docks to the TMDs, triggering ATP-binding and substrate translocation into the cytosol5. Individual deletions of OppA, or any of the two TMDs or NBDs led to complete loss of amber suppression and sfGFP fluorescence with G-AisoK, but not with BocK, indicating Opp-dependent G-AisoK uptake (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 1a). Uptake assays confirmed that intracellular BocK levels were unchanged in ΔoppA-K12 compared with wild-type K12, whereas AisoK, which accumulated in millimolar concentrations in K12 treated with G-AisoK, was undetectable when oppA was deleted (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 1b).

To identify the enzyme responsible for processing of G-AisoK to AisoK, we performed amber suppression experiments with G-AisoK using single-gene knockouts that lack specific aminopeptidases38. However, none of the ten tested knockouts exhibited an effect on the amber suppression yield (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 3a). We therefore generated multi-peptidase knockouts using a CRISPR–Cas12a-based genome editing platform for E. coli39. Notably, only cells with both pepN and pepA deleted (ΔpepN/pepA), showed a marked reduction in sfGFP expression with G-AisoK, whereas amber suppression yields with BocK remained unaffected (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 3b). Complementation with either pepA or pepN restored sfGFP expression with G-AisoK, indicating that either peptidase is sufficient for G-AisoK processing (Supplementary Fig. 3c).

Together, these findings support a model in which G-AisoK is actively imported via the Opp transporter into the cytosol of E. coli, where it is processed by endogenous peptidases, releasing AisoK for efficient amber suppression (Fig. 2e).

Next, we tested whether amino acids in a general G-XisoK (Fig. 3a) scaffold behaved similarly. Indeed, SisoK, bearing serine instead of alanine, was similarly incorporated in a tripeptide (G-SisoK)-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). OppA is known to promiscuously bind 2- to 5-amino-acid-long peptides, favouring positively charged side chains. To explore how OppA distinguishes G-XisoK from XisoK, we solved the crystal structure of OppA bound to G-SisoK (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 9RD1; Supplementary Table 5). The structure shows a good overlap with previous ligand-bound OppA conformations40 and adopts the closed state, with G-SisoK enclosed in the binding pocket (Fig. 3b). G-SisoK engages in extensive interactions with OppA through its backbone and termini. The N-terminal glycine forms key hydrogen bonds and electrostatic contacts: its protonated α-amine interacts with D445, whereas the C-terminal carboxylate is stabilized by hydrogen bonds involving the side chains of R439, H397 and N392 (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4c). To validate these interactions, we expressed OppA variants in ΔoppA. Expression of wild-type OppA fully restored sfGFP expression with G-SisoK, whereas the D445A variant, which disrupts the interaction with the N-terminal α-amine of G-SisoK, did not rescue expression. Mutations targeting the hydrogen-bonding network at the C terminus of G-SisoK (for example, R439A), had less pronounced effects, suggesting that the OppA binding site possesses some structural flexibility (Supplementary Fig. 4d). These results highlight the essential role of the interaction between the α-amine of glycine and D445 for effective OppA binding and transport.

Arrow indicates full-length sfGFP; asterisk indicates truncated sfGFP.

Cells expressing both binding partners in the presence of G-ClAisoK display a higher molecular weight band corresponding to the crosslinked complex in both anti-H6 and anti-streptavidin (Strep) blots. Full data and further experiments can be found in Extended Data Fig. 4. e–i, Consistent results were obtained over three independent replicate experiments.

The OppA–G-SisoK crystal structure revealed no specific interactions with the serine side chain, which is accommodated in a spacious pocket (Fig. 3c). This suggests that OppA binding and uptake rely primarily on recognition of the tripeptide backbone and termini rather than side-chain identity. Accordingly, this mechanism may represent a more general concept that is applicable to a variety of ncAAs presented within a G-XisoK scaffold. We thus expanded our propeptide strategy to efficiently incorporate XisoK derivatives bearing functionalities commonly used in GCE, including moieties for site-specific protein conjugation and crosslinking (Fig. 3d). Supplementing E. coli K12 with G-XisoK derivatives—where X represents various side chains—enabled efficient suppression of sfGFP-N150TAG and Ub-K63TAG using either wt-MbPylRS/PylT or suitable synthetase variants identified from an in cellulo screen (Fig. 3e). Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed site-specific incorporation of the respective XisoK dipeptides (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6), and supplementation with free XisoK derivatives led to minimal protein expression (Fig. 3e).

Efficient genetic encoding of XisoK derivatives is notable, as lysine aminoacylation (at the ε-amino group) with any of the 20 canonical amino acids is a recently identified reversible PTM41,42. Previous attempts at directly encoding SisoK, TisoK, PisoK or CisoK via GCE have proved highly inefficient23,41,43,44 (Fig. 3e). Our strategy offers a high-efficiency alternative, providing a foundation for functional studies on these PTMs. CisoK-modified proteins are also ideally suited for native chemical ligation approaches45. Comparing obtained CisoK-incorporation efficiencies with previous yields using specifically evolved PylRS variants23 highlights the benefit of actively importing G-CisoK, (Supplementary Fig. 7a), indicating that intracellular ncAA concentration may be more crucial for efficient ncAA incorporation than extensive PylRS engineering.

Site-specific incorporation of XisoK derivatives enables installation of an amino acid with an α-amine moiety, effectively creating a second, artificial N terminus for internal labelling46. For example, G-PisoK uptake allows installation of an internal proline bearing a free α-amine and its labelling with phenol derivatives using a chemoenzymatic approach47. Tyrosinase oxidizes p-cresol to the corresponding o-quinone, which oxidatively couples to the α-amine of proline in PisoK, enabling specific and quantitative labelling of PisoK-modified POIs (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 2).

When we screened for PylRS variants for bulky or aromatic X side chains, such as HisoK, no hits emerged using G-HisoK. To probe whether this was due to poor Opp transport or lack of appropriate HisoK-specific PylRS variants, we performed directed evolution using a custom-designed MbPylRS library. A novel MbPylRS variant supported HisoK incorporation with G-HisoK, but not with HisoK (Fig. 3e), indicating that OppA also delivers G-XisoK derivatives with bulky or aromatic X side chains. Efficient encoding of synthetically easily accessible histidine-containing ncAAs may expand the range of metal coordination sites in artificial metalloenzymes48.

We further broadened the G-XisoK toolbox with non-canonical X side chains for bioorthogonal labelling6 and crosslinking7,49. As a considerable advantage of our propetide strategy, G-XisoK derivatives can be easily synthesized at large scales via solid-phase peptide synthesis from commercially available building blocks, overcoming synthetic limitations of previous methods. A propargyl-containing derivative (G-PrgisoK) enabled efficient installation of PrgisoK (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 8) and subsequent fluorophore labelling via Cu(i)-catalysed azide alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) on an eGFP-specific nanobody (eGFPNb) (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 3a). PrgisoK incorporation using G-PrgisoK compares favourably with recently reported efficiencies using a dedicated PrgisoK-PylRS variant41 (Supplementary Fig. 7b).

To map and trap protein–protein interactions (PPIs), we used our propetide strategy to efficiently incorporate crosslinkers. Incorporating photoleucine (pL), a commercially available ncAA, as X in the G-XisoK scaffold enabled diazirine encoding into POIs using a Methanomethylophilus alvus PylRS variant (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 8). UV-induced crosslinking confirmed functionality by capturing PPIs, exemplified by successful crosslinking of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and sfGFP dimers (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 3b).

For proximity-based crosslinking, we designed G-ClAisoK to endow POIs with chloroalanine (ClA). Supplementation of K12 with G-ClAisoK led to efficient ClAisoK incorporation (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 8), enabling SN2-mediated crosslinking with nearby nucleophiles (such as cysteines) in interacting proteins. By pairwise incorporation of ClAisoK and cysteine residues at protein–protein interfaces, we covalently stabilized various low-affinity PPIs (dissociation constant (Kd) in the micromolar to low millimolar range), including sfGFP homodimers, affibody–protein Z50, and Rab1b–DrrA51 complexes (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 4). Distances of 8–12 Å between the corresponding Cα atoms could be efficiently crosslinked.

All tested G-XisoK tripeptides enabled efficient protein production in chemically defined autoinduction (AI) media52, but not in nutrient-rich conditions, such as 2-YT medium (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 9a,b). We hypothesized that short peptides in tryptone and peptone-rich medium may compete with G-XisoK tripeptides for OppA binding. Supporting this, intracellular SisoK levels were sixfold lower in 2-YT medium compared with AI medium after G-SisoK supplementation, indicating impaired OppA-mediated uptake under nutrient-rich conditions (Supplementary Fig. 10). This poses a challenge for scalable, cost-effective use of the G-XisoK toolbox, as AI media are expensive, cumbersome to prepare and lead to lower biomass, diminishing expression yields of ncAA-modified proteins.

a, SDS–PAGE analysis of sfGFP-N150TAG expression in the presence of SisoK or G-SisoK in AI or 2-YT medium. In wild-type K12, full-length sfGFP expression yields are significantly reduced when using tryptone-containing 2-YT medium owing to competition between tryptic peptides and G-SisoK for OppA binding. sfGFP expression in 2-YT medium is recovered when using the engineered IsoK12 strain. Consistent results were obtained over three independent replicate experiments. Arrow indicates sfGFP, asterisk indicates truncated sfGFP. b, Scheme for OppA evolution to improve G-SisoK uptake in tryptone-containing medium. OppA libraries were screened for increased G-SisoK uptake under increasing tryptone concentrations by monitoring amber suppression of sfGFP-N150TAG and sorting fluorescent cells. Initial screening of an error-prone library yielded four variants, which were used as basis for creating a cassette mutagenesis library. Screening of this library identified OppA-iso. c, Extracted ion chromatograms to determine intracellular SisoK concentrations.

Consistent results were obtained over three independent replicate experiments. d, Affinity measurements of G-SisoK and a linear GSK peptide (GSK(lin)) towards wild-type OppA (wt-OppA) and OppA-iso using microscale thermophoresis.

Full gels and gels for other G-XisoK derivatives are presented in Supplementary Fig. 9.

Source Data

To overcome this, we engineered an OppA variant with increased selectivity for G-SisoK over linear tripeptides. We developed a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based platform to screen an error-prone OppA library in ΔoppA cells containing the wt-MbPylRS/PylT pair and sfGFP-N150TAG through successive enrichment in increasing tryptone concentrations. This system couples uptake of the G-SisoK tripeptide to sfGFP fluorescence (Fig. 4b). Four converging OppA variants with four or five mutations distributed all over the OppA-fold were identified. Mutational hotspots were targeted for saturation mutagenesis and the obtained library was subjected to multiple FACS-based enrichment steps in peptide-rich medium, yielding the final OppA variant (OppA-iso). OppA-iso contains seven mutations, with only R439Q occurring near the binding site (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Genomic integration of OppA-iso into the K12 genome via lambda red-mediated homologous recombination created the IsoK12 strain. IsoK12 and parental K12 showed similar doubling times in AI and 2-YT media (Supplementary Fig. 11a). In 2-YT medium, IsoK12 exhibited sevenfold to tenfold higher intracellular SisoK concentrations compared with K12 when supplemented with G-SisoK, whereas BocK levels remained unchanged, confirming enhanced G-SisoK transport with OppA-iso (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 10). Notably, IsoK12 restored amber suppression efficiency in 2-YT medium to levels observed for K12 in AI medium (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 9).

Analysis using microscale thermophoresis showed that wild-type OppA and OppA-iso exhibited similarly low binding affinities towards SisoK (around 300 µM), whereas OppA-iso exhibited a slightly improved affinity (37 µM) towards G-SisoK, compared with wild-type OppA (50 µM). Notably, binding of a linear GSK tripeptide (mimicking linear tryptone peptides) was fourfold lower for OppA-iso (275 µM) compared with wild-type OppA (71 µM), validating its altered selectivity (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 11b).

Structural analysis showed that most mutated residues in OppA-iso do not directly contact G-SisoK. One notable exception is R439, which lies within hydrogen-bonding distance of the C terminus of the ligand and is replaced by glutamine in OppA-iso. Since the R439A mutant still supports efficient G-SisoK uptake (Supplementary Fig. 4d), binding is likely to be maintained through compensatory interactions with H397 and N392, which are well positioned to interact with the lysine carboxylate of G-SisoK. By contrast, linear tripeptides such as GSK are dependent on R439 for binding, so its mutation reduces affinity, consistent with structural and binding data (Extended Data Fig. 5b).

Notably, the uptake benefit of OppA-iso extended to other G-XisoK derivatives. IsoK12 grown in 2-YT medium achieved efficient amber suppression for all tested X residues (A, S, T, C, V, L, P, H, Prg, pL and ClA) with minimal truncation and yields matching those obtained in AI medium (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 9). In fact, tripeptide uptake was so efficient in IsoK12 that G-SisoK concentrations as low as 50–100 µM matched incorporation levels seen in K12 with 1 mM G-SisoK, reducing required ncAA concentrations by a factor of around 10 (Extended Data Fig. 6a).

The G-XisoK/IsoK12 system enabled high-yield XisoK incorporation at various positions in a wide range of target proteins (PCNA, β-lactamase, SUMO2, calmodulin, eGFPNb, interleukin-2, human growth hormone, RanGAP and Hsp82) ranging in size from 7 to 85 kDa, including therapeutically relevant examples. Suppression efficiencies surpassed those with BocK and matched wild-type levels (Extended Data Fig. 6b and Supplementary Figs. 12–14). Preparative large-scale production of eGFPNb bearing PrgisoK resulted in similar purified protein yields (44 mg l−1) as obtained for wild-type expression (41 mg l−1), exceeding yields from a previously optimized alkyne-ncAA/PylRS combination (Extended Data Fig. 6c).

Increasing intracellular ncAA concentrations via efficient tripeptide uptake also facilitated multi-site amber suppression. We introduced up to three TAG codons into histone H3 (K27, K79 and K122) and expressed the corresponding variants with G-SisoK. IsoK12 outperformed K12 in single, double and triple suppression, achieving wild-type-like expression in the first two cases and significant H3 yields even for triple suppression. By contrast, BocK produced only trace amounts of doubly and triply suppressed variants (Extended Data Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 15).

Efficient uptake and processing of G-XisoK results in high intracellular concentrations of both the XisoK dipeptide and cleaved N-terminal glycine. Crystallographic analysis of the OppA–G-SisoK complex revealed a spacious cavity extending from the serine side chain to the N-terminal glycine (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Given the promiscuity of OppA, we hypothesized that other side chains, including those of ncAAs, could also be accommodated at this position, enabling efficient transport of diverse non-canonical tripeptides into the E. coli cytosol. If different N-terminal residues (Z) in a Z-AisoK scaffold (Fig. 5a) are also efficiently cleaved, the strategy could broadly enable intracellular delivery of various amino acids.

Right, LC–MS analysis of sfGFP purified from K12-Z1 cultures grown with 13. Observed mass confirms incorporation of LipK. Consistent results were obtained over three independent replicate experiments. f, Dual stop codon suppression using a single isopeptide-linked tripeptide. Left, chemical structure of the tripeptide AcK-pLisoK (16). Middle, SDS–PAGE analysis of sfGFP-N40TAA-N150TAG expression in the presence of either AcK and G-pLisoK (or pLisoK) separately added to medium or in the presence of tripeptide 16 in IsoK12. Right, LC–MS analysis of purified sfGFP confirms dual ncAA incorporation (AcK and pLisoK) after the addition of tripeptide 16. Consistent results were obtained over three independent replicate experiments.

We synthesized a panel of 14 Z-AisoK tripeptides bearing either natural amino acids or ncAAs with diverse side chains, including bulky or negatively charged groups with poor or negligible cell permeability as N-terminal Z residues (Fig. 5a). To monitor uptake and cleavage of Z, we assessed AisoK incorporation into sfGFP-N150TAG using the wt-MbPylRS/tRNA pair. For 8 out of 14 Z residues, supplementation of K12 with corresponding Z-AisoK tripeptides, yielded amber suppression efficiencies resembling those obtained with G-AisoK (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 7b), with LC–MS confirming AisoK incorporation in all cases (Supplementary Fig. 16a). No sfGFP expression was observed in ΔoppA cells, confirming dependence on OppA-mediated uptake (Extended Data Fig. 7b).

By contrast, tripeptides bearing bulkier or negatively charged Z side chains (compounds 5, 6 and 12–15; Fig. 5a), resulted in reduced (5 and 6) or completely abolished (12–15) amber suppression (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 7b), suggesting inefficient uptake and/or cleavage. To address this, we leveraged our OppA engineering platform to evolve new OppA variants capable of accommodating tripeptides with larger or negatively charged Z residues (Fig. 5c). Guided by our OppA–G-SisoK structure, we selected four residues around glycine of G-SisoK for site-saturation mutagenesis (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 7a) and subjected a corresponding library to multiple FACS-based enrichments in the presence of tripeptides 13 and 15. From these screens, we isolated two OppA variants with enhanced uptake: OppA-Z1 (evolved with 13) and OppA-Z2 (evolved with 15). Both variants feature small side chains at the targeted positions, which are likely to increase the size of the binding pocket to accommodate larger substrates, and in the case of OppA-Z2, a non-programmed R439H mutation. These findings provide further evidence that the R439 variant can enhance binding of isopeptide-linked scaffolds.

We genomically introduced these OppA variants, generating K12-Z1 and K12-Z2 strains, respectively. Supplementing K12-Z1 with bulky Z tripeptides (5, 6, 12 and 13) enabled efficient AisoK incorporation, but uptake of tripeptides with negatively charged Z residues (14 and 15) was not supported by this engineered strain (Extended Data Fig. 7c). By contrast, K12-Z2 enabled efficient uptake of all 14 Z-AisoK tripeptides, including those bearing negatively charged ncAAs such as SucK and GluK as Z residues (Fig. 5b, Extended Data Fig. 7c and Supplementary Fig. 16b).

To demonstrate that tripeptide-based uptake is superior to direct ncAA supplementation, we focused on selected Z residues that are known to have low suppression efficiencies, for which limited uptake was suspected to be the main bottleneck. We compared amber suppression yields after supplementing cells either with Z directly or with the Z-AisoK tripeptide. Compound 3 (with acetyl-lysine (AcK) as the Z residue) yielded higher AcK incorporation than AcK alone using the MbPylRS variant AcKRS353 (Extended Data Fig. 8a), highlighting the benefit of active delivery. Notably, compound 13 (bearing LipK as Z residue) or LipK alone led to negligible expression of full-length sfGFP in the presence of the LipKRS/tRNA pair54. By contrast, K12-Z1 supplemented with 13 enabled efficient sfGFP production, with LipK incorporation confirmed by LC–MS (Fig. 5e). Similar improvements were observed for tripeptides 5 and 6 in K12-Z2, confirming that evolved OppA variants enable effective delivery of tripeptides that are impermeable in wild-type strains (Extended Data Fig. 8b).

Given the adaptability of OppA in substrate recognition, we envisioned a broadly applicable strategy to co-deliver two ncAAs using a single, easily synthesized Z-XisoK tripeptide. To leverage such a mechanism for site-specific dual ncAA incorporation into a single protein, we designed tripeptide 16, bearing AcK (a PTM) as Z and pLisoK (a photocrosslinker) as XisoK (Fig. 5f). Such a setup would represent an ideal tool to investigate PTM-specific protein interactors or to chemically stabilize transient POI–reader complexes55.

Notably, the PylRS/PylT pairs for AcK and pLisoK are mutually orthogonal56 (Extended Data Fig. 8c). After OppA-mediated uptake and cleavage of 16, both AcK and pLisoK accumulate intracellularly, allowing dual suppression of TAA and TAG codons within the same target protein (sfGFP-N40AcK-N150pLisoK; Fig. 5f), using the respective PylRS/PylT pairs. Notably, protein yields were significantly higher when cells were supplemented with tripeptide 16 compared with addition of free AcK and G-pLisoK, underscoring the enhanced efficiency of transporter-mediated delivery. LC–MS of full-length sfGFP confirmed dual incorporation of AcK and pLisoK (Fig. 5f). Mutual orthogonality and accurate decoding of both ncAAs was furthermore shown using a Ub–SUMO2 fusion construct containing a Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease site (Ub-K48TAG-TEV-SUMO-K11TAA). LC–MS analysis after TEV cleavage revealed specific pLisoK incorporation at TAG48 of Ub and AcK encoding in response to TAA11 of SUMO2 (Extended Data Fig. 8d).

Low protein yields and the limited chemical accessibility of many ncAAs remain major obstacles to the routine application of GCE for the generation of proteins with therapeutic or biotechnological potential. Here we overcome these limitations by combining a modular propeptide strategy with the programmed ‘hijacking' of the Opp transporter, enabling active and tailored import of a broad range of ncAAs, including those that have historically been refractory to efficient uptake and encoding. Isopeptide-linked Z-XisoK tripeptides act as Trojan horses that can be readily synthesized from commercially available building blocks via solid-phase peptide synthesis, and function as privileged ligands for the periplasmic binding protein OppA, enabling their ATP-driven transport into the cytosol. Once inside the cell, Z-XisoK tripeptides are enzymatically processed, leading to intracellular accumulation of isopeptide-linked XisoK ncAAs and Z residues. Using a FACS-based directed evolution approach, we reprogrammed OppA to selectively discriminate against linear peptides that are present in complex media. The resulting engineered E. coli strain, IsoK12, enables cost-effective, high-yield production of modified proteins in nutrient-rich conditions using minimal tripeptide concentrations. This platform allows robust incorporation of 11 previously inaccessible XisoK ncAAs, expanding the chemical space available through GCE. Among these functionalities are ncAAs bearing bioorthogonal handles, novel PTMs, chemical and photocrosslinkers, and functional groups for chemoenzymatic ligations, all of which we demonstrated in proof-of-principle applications. The positively charged side chains of XisoK ncAAs make them ideal moieties for applications such as protein labelling, for which site-directed incorporation at surface-exposed positions is essential. This strategy avoids aggregation and misfolding that are often associated with bulky, hydrophobic ncAAs commonly used for labelling purposes6. With these advantages, we anticipate that the XisoK toolbox can be further expanded through aaRS engineering to include functionalities for inverse-electron-demand Diels–Alder cycloadditions or spectroscopic probes.

Notably, uptake and processing of Z-XisoK tripeptides can also be leveraged for customized delivery and intracellular accumulation of challenging Z residues that typically lack cell permeability. By synthesizing a panel of 14 different Z-AisoK tripeptides, we demonstrate that AisoK incorporation into sfGFP serves as a straightforward readout for efficient tripeptide uptake and processing, thereby eliminating the need for intensive mass spectrometry-based uptake assays21. Our platform provides a foundation for developing OppA variants with specific binding sites for tripeptides carrying otherwise cell-impermeable Z residues, such as bulky and negatively charged groups. Thus, our innovation enables the intracellular delivery of these challenging ncAAs. Site-specific incorporation of Z residues from Z-XisoK significantly outperforms direct Z supplementation. As OppA evolution for a specific Z residue is decoupled from availability of a Z-specific orthogonal aaRS, our system presents a practical and modular strategy for dissecting ncAA uptake from its co-translational incorporation, complementing recent efforts in decoupling and optimizing individual GCE steps towards synthesis of non-canonical biopolymers in E. coli57,58. The current system relies on orthogonality of Z incorporation to AisoK-selective PylRS variants, but future efforts will focus on relaxing this constraint by diversifying the XisoK scaffold to further expand the versatility and applicability of the system. Notably, the ability to co-import two distinct ncAAs via a single Z-XisoK scaffold enables efficient dual ncAA incorporation. We envision extending our concept towards multi-ncAA encoding in synergy with advances in non-canonical polymer biosynthesis57,58 and E. coli strains with compressed genomes18,19,20.

Chemically competent E. coli K12 cells were co-transformed with pBAD_POI (encoding the POI with a C-terminal H6 tag) and pEVOL_PylRS (encoding two copies of the PylRS variant and tRNACUA). After recovery in 1 ml SOC medium for 1 h at 37 °C, cells were cultured in 5 ml of 2-YT medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg ml−1) and chloramphenicol (50 µg ml−1) and grown overnight at 37 °C. The overnight culture was then diluted to an OD600 of 0.05 in either 2-YT or AI media52 supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg ml−1), chloramphenicol (50 µg ml−1) and ncAA. Cells grown in 2-YT medium were grown to an OD600 of 0.6 and induced with 0.05% l-arabinose and grown overnight at 37 °C. Cells grown in AI media52 were directly grown overnight at 37 °C. Cells of the overnight culture were collected by centrifugation at 4,000g for 10 min at 4 °C and the pellets were analysed by SDS–PAGE or stored at −20 °C for further use.

For the incorporation of XisoK ncAAs into proteins for purification and downstream characterization, the corresponding G-XisoK peptides were used during expression. The dipeptide XisoK was only used for comparing expression levels in whole lysate. For the incorporation of Z ncAAs, both the free amino acid Z and the corresponding Z-AisoK tripeptide were used. Proteins expressed in the presence of Z-AisoK tripeptides were purified and analysed via LC–MS to confirm Z or AisoK incorporation. For dual incorporation, peptide 16 was used for purification experiments.

Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF) and the cells were lysed via sonication in an ice water bath. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 14,000g for 20 min at 4 °C and cleared lysate was incubated with Ni Sepharose fast flow beads (1 ml slurry per 1 l culture, Cytiva) pre-equilibrated with Ni-NTA wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole) and incubated on a roller for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer 3 times and protein was eluted with elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole). Resulting protein was either directly used for mass determination or further purification was performed via gel filtration using a Superdex 75 increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva) equilibrated with SE buffer (2× PBS pH 7.0 for eGFPNb or 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.5, 100 mM NaCl for PisoK-bearing proteins or 1× PBS pH 7.4 for Affibody and ProteinZ). Fractions containing protein were pooled and concentrated using Amicon centrifugal filter units with the appropriate molecular weight cut-off (MWCO). Protein was then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C till further use. Proteins bearing CisoK were treated with methoxyamine (10 µM protein, 100 mM methoxyamine at pH 4.0 ammonium acetate) and buffer exchanged in 1× PBS before storage.

An error-prone library of oppA was generated using an error-prone PCR kit (Jena Bioscience PP-102). Primers OppA_EP_fwd and OppA_EP_rev (Supplementary Table 2) were used to amplify oppA from pEVOL_MbPylRS_oppA according to the manufacturer's instructions, running for 25 cycles and adding 2.5 µl error-prone solution. Resultant amplicon was purified on a 1% agarose gel and digested with NdeI and PstI-HF. Digested insert was then ligated with T4 ligase into a backbone generated by digesting pEVOL_MbPylRS_oppA with NdeI and PstI-HF, followed by dephosphorylation with Antarctic Phosphatase. Electrocompetent DH10β cells were then transformed with the purified ligation. After recovery in SOC medium for 1 h at 37 °C, cells were added to 50 ml of 2-YT medium supplemented with chloramphenicol (50 µg ml−1) and grown overnight at 37 °C. Library plasmid from the overnight culture was purified and used for subsequent steps. The size of the library was determined by plating the freshly transformed cells in a dilution series on LB agar plates supplemented with chloramphenicol (50 µg ml−1). The size was calculated to be 4 × 106. Multiple single clones were sequenced to determine the average error rate and was optimized to be ~0.8% or an average of 5 amino acid mutations per gene.

For the tryptone resistance site-saturation library, four hotspot positions in OppA were selected for site-saturation, on the basis of sequenced variants from selection of the error-prone library. Positions were chosen if mutations occurred more than once (R439 and S460) or if mutations occurred close to each other in different variants (D221 and W222).

For the site-saturation library targeting the pocket of the Z position, four positions were selected on the basis of the X-ray crystal structure of wt-OppA–G-SisoK around the N-terminal glycine of G-SisoK (V60, S63, L530 and N532) to accommodate new N-terminal amino acids.

Sites were randomized using degenerate trimer primers (Ella Biotech) or NNK primers. For the tryptone resistance library, a mix of templates based on pEVOL_MbPylRS_oppA containing wild-type OppA and four variants from the error-prone library were amplified with library primers (Supplementary Table 2). For the Z position library, pEVOL_MbPylRS_oppA_wt was used as a template. Both tryptone resistance template mix and Z library wild-type OppA template were amplified with their respective library primers (Supplementary Table 2). The linear amplicon was then purified on a 1% agarose gel and digested with BbsI-HF and DpnI. Digested fragments were circularized via ligation with T4 ligase and electrocompetent DH10β cells were transformed with the circularized library plasmid. After recovery in SOC medium for 1 h at 37 °C, cells were added to 50 ml of 2-YT medium supplemented with chloramphenicol (50 µg ml−1) and grown overnight at 37 °C. Library plasmid was purified from the overnight culture and used as the template for the next round of amplification to randomize the next position(s).

For the tryptone resistance library, this process was repeated 3 times, each time randomizing a different position, to give a library with positions D221, W222, R439 and S460 mutated to all 20 amino acids on wild-type OppA and 4 error-prone variants. The library size was 8 × 105. For the Z library the process was repeated 2 times to cover all 4 positions (V60, S63, L530 and N532). The library size was 1 × 106.

Electrocompetent E. coli K12 ΔoppA cells containing sfGFP reporter plasmid pBAD_sfGFP_N150TAG_H6 were transformed with the OppA library (pEVOL_MbPylRS_oppA_EP_lib, pEVOL_MbPylRS_oppA_trimer_lib, pEVOL_MbPylRS_oppA_Z_lib or pEVOL_MbPylRS_oppA_wt). After recovery in 1 ml SOC for 1 h at 37 °C, transformed cells were diluted in 50 ml of non-inducing medium (AI medium19 without arabinose) supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg ml−1) and chloramphenicol (50 µg ml−1) and grown overnight. The overnight culture was then diluted in non-inducing medium and grown to an OD600 of 0.6.

At this point, 0.05% arabinose was added to induce sfGFP expression and the culture was split into smaller cultures. For the tryptone resistance screening campaign, cultures were supplemented with or without 0.5 mM G-SisoK and varying amounts of tryptone to apply a selection pressure towards OppA variants which preferably bound to G-SisoK.

For the screening of the Z library, cultures were supplemented with 2 mM of each Z-AisoK tripeptide of interest (13 or 15). Cultures were then grown for 4 h at 37 °C to allow for sfGFP expression. To halt growth, the cultures were cooled on ice for 10 min, centrifuged (4,000g, 5 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in ice cold PBS pH 7.0. The PBS cell suspension was sorted on a Sony cell sorter (SH800) using a 70-µm chip sorting for cells with highest sfGFP fluorescence intensity. Gating was decided on the basis of the positive control (tryptone resistance screening: wt-oppA, 0.5 mM G-SisoK, 0 g l−1 tryptone, Z library screening: wt-oppA, 2 mM G-AisoK, 0 g l−1 tryptone) and the negative controls (wt-oppA, 0.5 mM G-SisoK, X g l−1 tryptone, with X being the tryptone concentration used in that round of enrichment, and wt-oppA, 0 mM G-SisoK, 0 g l−1 tryptone). For each round, cells with the top 0.5–2% sfGFP fluorescence were sorted. Sorted cells were recovered in SOC medium supplemented with ampicillin (50 µg ml−1) and chloramphenicol (25 µg ml−1) overnight at 37 °C and the process was repeated for further enrichment. After multiple rounds of enrichment, cells were sorted into a 96-well plate containing SOC supplemented with ampicillin (50 µg ml−1) and chloramphenicol (25 µg ml−1) and grown overnight at 37 °C. Cultures grown from single cells were further evaluated via the fluorescence plate reader assay and variants which showed the desired phenotype were sent for Sanger sequencing. The error-prone library was subjected to 5 rounds of enrichment, each time doubling the tryptone concentration from 1 g l−1 (round 1) to 16 g l−1 (round 5). The site-saturation library was directly grown in LB medium (10 g l−1 tryptone) for 2 rounds of enrichment and 2-YT medium (16 g l−1) for 3 rounds of enrichment. The Z library was subjected to 3 rounds of enrichment at 2 mM of Z-AisoK tripeptide 13 or 15.

The uptake assay protocol was adapted from previously published protocols21,36. Relevant E. coli strains were transformed with a pBAD plasmid to prevent contamination of cultures. After recovery in 1 ml SOC for 1 h at 37 °C, cells were cultured in 5 ml of 2-YT or AI medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg ml−1) and grown overnight at 37 °C. Overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.05 in 5 ml of 2-YT or AI medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg ml−1) and ncAA or peptide and grown overnight at 37 °C. The OD600 of the overnight cultures was determined and 12 OD ml were collected by centrifugation at 4,000g for 10 min. Cell pellets were then washed 3 times with 1 ml of cold medium and resuspended in 400 µl of a methanol:water solution (60:40). Cells were lysed via 5 freeze thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen and a 42 °C water bath. Lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 17,900g for 20 min. Five-hundred microlitres of cleared lysate was passed through Amicon centrifugal filter units (Millipore, 3 kDa MWCO) and the flow through was injected onto the LC–MS for analysis. For cultures incubated with BocK, samples were injected onto a Zorbax SB-C18 (Agilent, 4.6 × 150 mm) column and a gradient of 5–95% was used. For cultures incubated with XisoK and G-XisoK peptides, samples were injected on a Poroshell 120 HILIC-Z (Agilent, 2.1 × 100 mm) column using a gradient of 95–10%. The mass spectrometer was set to single ion mode to detect the relevant m/z for each ncAA or peptide.

To determine intracellular concentrations, calibration points of lysate spiked with known ncAA or peptide concentrations were measured. Ion peaks were integrated, and integral values plotted against concentration to determine a linear calibration line. Integral values of unknown samples were interpolated on calibration line to determine lysate concentrations. Intracellular concentrations were estimated assuming 1 OD600 = 8 × 108 cells per ml and the volume of an E. coli cell (0.6 fl).

Microscale thermophoresis was performed on the NanoTemper Monolith NT.115 (NanoTemper Technologies). Wild-type OppA and evolved variants were fluorescently labelled using the Monolith Protein Labeling Kit RED-NHS 2nd Generation (NanoTemper Technologies) and diluted to 100 nM in assay buffer (2× PBS pH 7.0, 0.02% Tween-20). Peptides were diluted to double the highest measured concentration in assay buffer and diluted twofold in a dilution series to give 16 peptide concentrations. Equal volumes of protein and peptide solutions were mixed (final protein concentration of 50 nM) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were loaded into capillaries (Monolith NT.115 Capillaries, NanoTemper Technologies) and measured according to manufacturer's instructions. Three independent replicates were measured for each peptide–protein combination and data analysis was performed with MO.affinity Analysis (v.3.0.5, NanoTemper Technologies).

Primers with 50 bp overhangs homologous to regions upstream and downstream of the OppA locus in E. coli genome were used to amplify oppA-iso from pEVOL_MbPylRS_oppA-iso. (Supplementary Table 2).

A single clone of E. coli K12 ΔoppA cells transformed with a pSIJ8 plasmid (Supplementary Table 2) was cultured in 2-YT medium supplemented with ampicillin (50 µg ml−1) and grown at 30 °C, 200 rpm until an OD600 of 0.3 followed by induction with 15 mM arabinose for the expression of lambda red recombineering genes. After incubation for 45 min at 37 °C the culture was cooled on ice to halt growth and made electrocompetent. The resulting electrocompetent E. coli K12 ΔoppA cells with expressed recombineering genes were then transformed with the linear DNA fragment encoding oppA-iso. After recovery in 1 ml SOC for 2 h at 37 °C, cells were diluted in 2-YT medium and grown overnight at 37 °C for the curing of thermosensitive plasmid pSIJ8. The overnight culture (containing a mix of ΔoppA and knock-in cells) was diluted and grown to an OD600 of 0.6 and made electrocompetent. These cells were then co-transformed with aaRS plasmid pEVOL_MbPylRS and sfGFP reporter pBAD_sfGFP_N150TAG_H6. Transformed cells were recovered in 1 ml SOC for 1 h at 37 °C and diluted in 2-YT medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg ml−1) and chloramphenicol (50 µg ml−1) and grown to an OD600 of 0.6 and sfGFP expression was induced with 0.05% arabinose and 0.5 mM G-SisoK was added. The culture was grown for 4 h, cooled on ice, centrifuged (4,000g, 5 min, 4 °C), and resuspended in ice cold PBS pH 7.0. Cells with the highest sfGFP fluorescence were sorted as single cells into a 96-well plate containing 2-YT medium and grown overnight. Clones with the correct genomic insert were confirmed with sequencing of the genomic locus and whole-genome sequencing. Once confirmed, plasmids were cured from the strain via electroporation.

Knock-in generation was adapted from a previously published protocol39. In brief, a single clone of E. coli K12 ΔoppA cells transformed with pSIMcpf1 was cultured in 2-YT medium supplemented with hygromycin (150 µg ml−1) and grown at 30 °C and 200 rpm until an OD600 of 0.2 was reached. At this point, expression of lambda red recombineering genes was induced by incubation at 42 °C for 15 min. Cultures were then cooled on ice for 20 min to halt the growth and cells were made electrocompetent. The resulting electrocompetent cells were transformed with pTF_oppA-Z1 or pTF_oppA-Z2, which carried a donor DNA with genes for the respective OppA variant along with 50 bp upstream and downstream homologous regions of the oppA locus, as well as a CRISPR array encoding a guide RNA (gRNA) targeting the FRT site present in the knocked out oppA locus (Supplementary Table 7). After electroporation, cells were rescued in SOC medium for 1 h, plated on LB agar with hygromycin (150 µg ml−1) and spectinomycin (120 µg ml−1) and incubated overnight at 30 °C. Successfully knocked-in clones were confirmed via colony PCR and grown in 2-YT medium with 0.05% arabinose for 5 h at 30 °C and then grown overnight at 37 °C to cure the cells of plasmids. To further confirm successful integration, cells were sent for whole-genome sequencing.

Peptidase knockouts were generated analogously to the K12-Z1 and K12-Z2 strains. E. coli K12 ΔpepN cells from the Keio collection38 were transformed with pSIMcpf1 (Supplementary Table 2) and were prepared as previously described. pTF plasmids (Supplementary Table 1), which carry a donor DNA of 50 bp upstream and downstream of the peptidase genomic locus, as well as a CRISPR array encoding two gRNAs that target the corresponding peptidase, were used (Supplementary Table 7). Colonies were confirmed via colony PCR and whole-genome sequencing. Plasmids were cured as previously described.

Chemically competent E. coli K12 cells were co-transformed with pBAD_POI (either pBAD_sfGFP_N40TAA_N150TAG_H6 or pBAD_Ub_K48TAA_TEV_SUMO2_K11TAG_H6) with a C-terminal His6 tag) and pEVOL_AcKRS3(TAA)_RBS_MaPylRS_IP(TAG) (encoding AcKRS3 and MaPylRS_IP polycistronically and their respective tRNAs). After recovery in 1 ml SOC medium for 1 h at 37 °C, cells were cultured in 5 ml of 2-YT medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg ml−1) and chloramphenicol (50 µg ml−1) and incubated overnight at 37 °C, 200 rpm. The overnight culture was then diluted to an OD600 of 0.05 in AI medium19 supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg ml−1), chloramphenicol (50 µg ml−1) and respective ncAA and/or peptide. Cells were grown overnight at 37 °C and the overnight culture was collected by centrifugation at 4,000g for 10 min at 4 °C and the pellets were stored at −20 °C till further use. Ub-K48pLisoK-TEV-SUMO2-K11AcK-H6 was purified as described in ‘Purification of His6-tagged proteins'. For cleavage, Ub-K48pLisoK-TEV-SUMO2-K11AcK-H was diluted into buffer (PBS pH 7.0 with 3 mM DTT) and incubated with TEV protease (0.1 mg ml−1) for 30 min at room temperature.

a. SDS-PAGE analysis (top) and time course fluorescence measurements (bottom) of K12 cells and knockout (KO) cell lines that have individual components of the Opp transporter genomically deleted, expressing sfGFP-N150TAG in the presence of 2 mM BocK, AisoK or G-AisoK using wt-MbPylRS/PylT. Full-length sfGFP expression in presence of G-AisoK is abolished in all KOs (ΔoppA-F), while sfGFP expression in presence of BocK remains comparable between wt-K12 cells and KO cell lines, indicating that the Opp transporter is responsible for G-AisoK uptake and associated amber codon suppression. b. Extracted ion chromatograms of E. coli lysates to determine intracellular concentrations of BocK (left), G-AisoK (middle) and AisoK (right) in wt-K12 and ΔoppA cells. Intracellular BocK concentrations for cells grown with 2 mM BocK are similar between wt-K12 and ΔoppA-K12 (left: dashed, dark grey). Intracellular G-AisoK concentrations were negligible for both cell types (middle). In ΔoppA cells intracellular AisoK concentrations were negligible for cells grown in 2 mM AisoK (dashed, light grey) as well as 2 mM G-AisoK (right, dashed, dark grey). Consistent results were obtained over three distinct replicate experiments.

Source Data

a. Scheme of labeling a protein of interest (POI) bearing PisoK with model substrate p-cresol mediated by tyrosinase. b. Incubation of wt-Ub (10 µM) with p-cresol (200 µM) in the presence of 0.2 µM tyrosinase at pH 6.5, r.t. shows mislabeling at Ub N terminus (green peak) after 120 min, as observed by LC-MS analysis. c. Incubation of 10 µM Ub-K63PisoK with 200 µM p-cresol with 0.2 µM tyrosinase after 120 min gives complete labeling of PisoK and some mislabeling of the N terminus as observed for wt-Ub. d. To confirm quantitative Ub-K63PisoK labeling, Ub bearing an N-terminal 3C protease cleavage site was incubated under the same conditions with 0.4 µM tyrosinase for 120 min, after which the labeled protein was subjected to 3C cleavage to reveal quantitative internal PisoK labeling. Consistent results were obtained over three distinct replicate experiments.

a. CuAAC-based labeling of proteins bearing a terminal alkyne moiety. Purified eGFPNb bearing either PrgisoK or the previously reported ncAA PraK59 at position 75 are labeled with comparable efficiencies with an azide-bearing fluorophore (conditions: 100 µM AF647-Picolyl-Azide, 50 µM CuSO4, 250 µM THPTA and 2.5 mM ascorbic acid in PBS for 30 min at room temperature). BocK-bearing eGFPNb is not labeled under the same conditions, as expected. Consistent results were obtained over three distinct replicate experiments. b. Photo-crosslinking of diazirine-bearing glutathione-transferase (GST) and sfGFP. left: Western blot analysis of cells expressing GST-E51TAG in the presence of G-pLisoK and the previously reported DiazK49. Upon UV365 nm illumination both G-pLisoK and DiazK samples show crosslinked GST dimers. Right: Western blot analysis of cells expressing sfGFP-N150TAG in the presence of G-pLisoK and DiazK. Illumination with UV365 nm for G-pLisoK and DiazK samples show crosslinked sfGFP dimers. (conditions: cells expressing POIs were diluted to OD600 = 1 and irradiated for 15 min at 365 nm, 15 W). Consistent results were obtained over three distinct replicate experiments.

a. Chemical crosslinking of ClAisoK-bearing sfGFP homodimer. Left: X-ray crystal structure of the sfGFP dimeric interface (PDB ID: 1GFL) denoting position N150 (where ncAAs are incorporated) and E173. The distance between the two Cα atoms of these two amino acids is 10.4 Å; the KD of sfGFP dimerization has been determined to be 100 µM60. Right: Western blot analysis of cells expressing sfGFP-N150TAG in the presence of G-AisoK or G-ClAisoK. Crosslinked sfGFP homodimer is observed for samples grown in the presence of G-ClAisoK and with residue 173 mutated to E, C or H. # denotes a sfGFP variant, in which a mutation (V207K) that disrupts the dimerization interface has been introduced. b. Chemical crosslinking of protein Z with selected affibody50. Left: X-ray crystal structure of affibody-protein Z complex (PDB ID: 1LP1) highlighting residues D36 in affibody (position for ncAA incorporation) and N7 in protein Z, which is mutated to cysteine to allow for crosslinking. The distance between the two Cα atoms of these two residues is 8.3 Å; the KD has been determined to be 6 µM50. Middle: In cellulo crosslinking: SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of cells expressing Strep-tagged SUMO2-proteinZ-N7C and affibody-D36TAG-H6 in the presence of either G-AisoK or G-ClAisoK. Crosslinked complex is only observed for the G-ClAisoK sample. Right: SDS-PAGE analysis of in vitro crosslinking with purified binding partners. Crosslinked complex is observed for ClAisoK-bearing affibody after 30 min and near quantitative covalent crosslinking between affibody and protein Z is observed after 16 h. No crosslinking is observed for AisoK-bearing affibody. c. Complete data from Fig. 3i. Chemical crosslinking between ClAisoK-bearing Rab1b GTPase and Legionella effector protein DrrA339–522. Left: X-ray crystal structure of Rab1b-DrrA339–522 complex (PDB ID: 3JZA), highlighting R79 in Rab1b (changed to ncAA) and D512 in DrrA (mutated to cysteine). The distance between the two Cα atoms of these two residues is 11.4 Å; the KD of ternary complex formation in presence of GDP has been determined to be ca. 10–30 µM51. Western blot analysis of cells expressing both binding partners in the presence of either G-AisoK or G-ClAisoK shows crosslinked complex formation only in the presence of G-ClAisoK (middle). Purification via Ni-NTA beads enriches both binding partners for both G-AisoK and G-ClAisoK, but covalently crosslinked complex is only present in G-ClAisoK sample (right). a-c. Consistent results were obtained over three replicate experiments. P = pellet, FT = flow through and E = elution.

a. X-ray crystal structure of OppA:G-SisoK (PDB ID: 9RD1) with mutated positions highlighted as spheres. Left: Positions mutated in error prone OppA variants 1–4. Orange spheres indicate residues that were targeted for site-saturation mutagenesis; grey spheres denote additional mutations in the error prone OppA variants. Middle: Green spheres indicate residues mutated in the final evolved variant OppA-iso. Right: Table summarizing all mutations identified in error prone OppA variants 1–4 and in OppA-iso. Residues in bold were targeted for site saturation mutagenesis. b. Structural comparison of the OppA:G-SisoK complex (PDB ID: 9RD1) with the previously published structure showing OppA bound to endogenous linear peptide ligands (PDB ID: 3TCF) with a focus on binding motifs at the C-terminal end of the bound ligands. In OppA:G-SisoK, the carboxylate of lysine is in hydrogen-bonding distance to the side chains of R439, N392 and H397. In the linear peptide bound complex (OppA:XXX), the C-terminal carboxylate of the tripeptide XXX interacts primarily with the side chain of R439 and residues N392 and H397 are not ideally positioned to contribute to strong hydrogen-bonding, suggesting that the interaction with R439 is most important for linear tripeptides. In constrast, for isopeptide-linked tripeptides such as G-SisoK the hydrogen-bond donors, H397 and N392, are well positioned to interact with the lysine carboxylate, likely stabilizing the complex also in the absence of a positively charged side chain at position 439.

a. SDS-PAGE analysis of sfGFP-N150TAG expression in 2-YT, comparing K12 with IsoK12 cells at different G-SisoK concentrations.

Bottom: SDS-PAGE analysis of amber suppression of RanGTPase activating protein (RanGAP-K524TAG) and human growth hormone (hGH-Y35TAG and hGH-K38TAG) expressed with 1 mM BocK or G-SisoK in IsoK12 cells grown in 2-YT. Full-length protein expression levels are higher with G-SisoK in comparison to BocK. c. Left: SDS-PAGE analysis of eGFPNb-R17TAG expression in the presence of 1 mM G-PrgisoK or PraK59 in AI or 2-YT media comparing wt-K12 with IsoK12.

Consistent results were obtained over three distinct replicate experiments. Arrows indicated full-length POIs, asterisks indicated truncated POIs.

a. X-ray crystal structure of OppA:G-SisoK reveals a cavity around the N-terminal glycine, suggesting that larger sidechains can be accommodated at the ‘Z' position of a generalized Z-XisoK peptide. b. SDS-PAGE analysis of sfGFP-N150TAG expression in the presence of different Z-AisoK peptides with wt-MbPylRS/PylT. Full-length sfGFP expression indicates efficient Z-AisoK transport, intracellular processing into Z and AisoK and AisoK incorporation by the wt- MbPylRS/PylT. Top: sfGFP expression in wt-K12 cells. Z-AisoK tripeptides 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 lead to efficient full-length sfGFP expression comparable to wt-sfGFP expression. Bottom: sfGFP expression in ΔoppA cells. Full-length sfGFP expression in the presence of Z-AisoK peptides is completely abolished, indicating that Z-AisoK transport is dependent on OppA. c. SDS-PAGE analysis of sfGFP-N150TAG expression in evolved Z-strains (as in (b)). Top: Expression in K12-Z1. All Z-AisoK tripeptides, apart from 14 and 15, bearing negatively charged Z-residues lead to efficient AisoK incorporation, indicating that they are successfully imported and cleaved. Bottom: Expression in K12-Z2. All Z-AisoK tripeptides, including those bearing negatively charged Z-residues (14,15) lead to efficient full-length sfGFP expression and AisoK incorporation. b,c.

a. Left: SDS-PAGE analysis of sfGFP-N150TAG expression in the presence of AcK or the corresponding Z-AisoK peptide AcK-AisoK (3) with AcKRS3/PylT53. Full-length sfGFP expression is significantly higher when supplementing 3 instead of AcK. Right: LC-MS analysis of sfGFP purified from cultures grown in the presence of 3. Observed mass indicates AcK incorporation. Consistent results were obtained over three distinct replicates. b. Left: SDS-PAGE analysis of sfGFP-N150TAG expression in the presence of CouK or the corresponding Z-AisoK tripeptide CouK-AisoK (6).

Middle: LC-MS analysis of sfGFP purified from K12-Z2 cells grown in the presence of tripeptide 6. Observed mass indicates incorporation of CouK with a second peak indicating incorporation of lysine likely due to photo-decaging of CouK. Right: SDS-PAGE analysis of sfGFP-N150TAG expression in the presence of ONBK or the corresponding Z-AisoK tripeptide (5). Full-length sfGFP expression is higher in K12-Z2 cells with tripeptide 5 in comparison to the same in wt-K12 cells or with ONBK. Consistent results were obtained over three distinct replicates. c. Left: Chemical structures of ncAAs for dual stop codon suppression to allow for orthogonal incorporation of AcK and pLisoK. Right: SDS-PAGE analysis of sfGFP-N150TAG expression in the presence of 2 mM AcK or 2 mM G-pLisoK and their corresponding PylRS/PylT pairs to confirm substrate orthogonality between the pairs. Full-length sfGFP expression in presence of AcK is only observed with AcKRS3/PylT and in presence of G-pLisoK only with MaPylRS(H227I/Y228P)/PylT, hence confirming orthogonality. d. Left: Scheme of Ub-SUMO fusion construct used to confirm dual and orthogonal incorporation of pLisoK and AcK. SDS-PAGE analysis shows purified full-length construct and products of TEV protease cleavage. Right: LC-MS analysis of full-length construct and cleaved products confirming pLisoK and AcK incorporation at the intended positions.

Recalled memories become transiently labile and require stabilization1,2,3. The mechanism for stabilizing memories of survival-critical experiences, which are often emotionally salient and repeated, remains unclear4. Here we identify an astrocytic ensemble that is transcriptionally primed by emotional experience and functionally triggered by repeated experience to stabilize labile memory. Using a novel brain-wide Fos tagging and imaging method, we found that astrocytic Fos ensembles were preferentially recruited in regions with neuronal engrams5 and were more widespread during fear recall than during conditioning. We established the induction mechanism of the astrocytic ensemble, which involves two steps: (1) an initial fear experience that induces day-long, slow astrocytic state changes with noradrenaline receptor upregulation; and (2) enhanced noradrenaline responses during recall, a repeated experience, enabling astrocytes to integrate coincident signals from local engrams and long-range noradrenergic projections, which induce secondary astrocytic state changes, including the upregulation of Fos and the neuromodulatory molecule IGFBP2. Pharmacological and genetic perturbation of the astrocytic ensemble signalling modulate engrams, and memory stability and precision. The astrocytic ensemble thus acts as a multiday trace in a subset of astrocytes after experience-dependent neural activity, which are eligible to capture future repeated experiences for stabilizing memories.

Recall transiently destabilizes memories, which require re-stabilization to become long-lasting1,2,3. Despite its importance in human cognition and neuropsychiatric disorders6,7, the mechanisms that specifically stabilize memories of critical experiences—those that are essential for survival and frequently marked by emotional salience and repetition—remain incompletely understood. Memory traces are linked to specialized neuronal ensembles (neuronal engrams), which include neuronal populations that become Fos+ during both initial and repeated experiences8. However, neuronal Fos alone, a plasticity marker that indicates circuit remodelling9, is insufficient for memory stabilization, implying the need for additional cellular substrates.

By tiling the entire mammalian central nervous system (CNS), astrocytes structurally and functionally interact with neurons and other glia. Their functions contribute to information processing and animal behaviour, and their dysfunctions are widely implicated in CNS disorders10,11. Astrocytes are known to be developmentally diverse12,13,14 and can adaptively change their molecular programmes in response to physiology11,15,16,17,18 and pathology19,20,21—hereafter referred to as state—in specific ways that suggest flexibly altered functions in a context-dependent manner. This adaptability is akin to experience-dependent neuronal responses (such as Fos upregulation)22 and the subsequent formation of inter-regional neuronal engram network8. However, the manifold nature of astrocyte responses through an extensive array of cell-surface receptors for neuroactive biomolecules19,23,24 have made it challenging to determine whether, when and how multiple inputs are integrated by a subset of astrocytes to generate specific states that form astrocyte ensembles that are responsible for particular cellular outputs15,18,24,25. This is because the field has lacked adequate tools to explore behaviourally relevant astrocyte ensembles (BAEs) in an unbiased manner at the single-cell level as well as in a brain-wide manner, which would enable ensemble-specific molecular dissection and functional perturbation.

To agnostically and holistically identify BAEs, we developed a brain-wide astrocyte Fos tagging tool that enables permanent genetic access to BAEs that express Fos due to a specific experience. Although behaviourally relevant stimuli-induced astrocyte Fos mRNA22 and c-Fos protein18,26 have been observed in selected brain regions, its brain-wide profiling remains largely unexplored. We systematically validated a novel genetic and imaging strategy for whole-brain BAE tagging, demonstrating astrocyte selectivity, Fos sensitivity and temporal regulation (Extended Data Figs. 1–3). First, using a CNS-wide-transducing adenovirus (AAV) vector (AAV-PHP.eB) with an astrocyte-specific GfaABC1D promoter27, we achieved widespread, astrocyte-selective (97.3–99.5%) expression (Extended Data Fig. 1). Second, we tested whether using AAV-PHP.eB to express Cre-dependent mNeonGreen (mNG) can serve as a marker of transient astrocytic Fos induction in Fos-iCreERT2 (TRAP2) mice28. This intersectional approach aimed to drive astrocytic mNG expression only when the Fos promoter was active during fast-acting 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) administration, enabling behaviour epoch-specific astrocyte Fos tagging across the CNS. As a positive control, we virally expressed the astrocytic Gαq-coupled designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) hM3Dq, a strong inducer of astrocyte c-Fos26,29,30, combined with 4-OHT and the hM3Dq agonist clozapine N-oxide (CNO) intraperitoneal injection. hM3Dq stimulation yielded approximately 282 mNG+ astrocytes per mm2, and significantly lower tagging in controls (Extended Data Fig. 2). Third, to probe the temporal dynamics of Fos-mNG tagging, dark-adapted mice were exposed to light at various intervals relative to 4-OHT administration28. Tagging peaked within a 6-h window around 4-OHT administration, with an approximately 22-fold increase in astrocytes in visual cortex compared with those in somatosensory cortex, indicating regional specificity and dependence on local neuronal activity (Extended Data Fig. 3). Collectively, these experiments validated our behaviour epoch-specific, brain-wide BAE tagging strategy.

To broadly explore BAEs in a learning paradigm, we used a contextual fear conditioning and recall task5,28 (Fig. 1a). TRAP2::AAV-PHP.eB-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG mice underwent three days of habituation to minimize contextual novelty and isolate associative components of fear learning and recall28,31. On day 4, one group received 3 foot shocks with immediate 4-OHT (FC), and another received 4-OHT immediately after recall 24 h post-FC (FR). Controls were non-shocked mice (NoFC) or fear-conditioned mice kept in the home cage for 24 h and given 4-OHT without recall (NoFR). Shocked groups exhibited robust freezing in the conditioned chamber, indicating learning and recall (Fig. 1b). One week later, whole-brain serial two-photon tomography (STPT)32 enabled the detection of individual mNG+ astrocytes (BAEs) (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). After excluding ventricular niches for bona fide astrocyte counts (Methods), BAE counts across 677 regions covered approximately 80.7% of the brain (Supplementary Table 2).

Whereas the number of Fos+ neurons increased during both FC and FR, forming networks causally linked to fear memory traces—commonly referred to as engram neurons5,8,28, the density of Fos+ astrocytes during FC (FC-BAE; Fig. 1c) was seldom distinguishable from the NoFC control (NoFC-BAE). However, we found that the number of BAEs during recall (FR-BAE) was augmented across multiple regions (Fig. 1c). This was not simply reflecting delayed Fos upregulation after FC, because Fos induction was significantly higher in FR than in NoFR. Normalized comparisons across engram regions5 (Fig. 1d) showed a significantly greater number of FR-BAEs compared with FC-BAEs, particularly in the amygdala (Fig. 1e), the region long implicated in fear memory across species3,4,33,34,35. Consistently, in the lateral and basolateral amygdala (LA/B), astrocytic c-Fos protein was unchanged after FC or in NoFR versus NoFC, but FR induced a marked increase at 1.5 h with partial decay by 6 h (Extended Data Fig. 4). Consistently, the number of of FR-BAEs in the LA/B (FR-BAELA/B) was robust whether 4-OHT was given immediately or 3 h post-FR (Extended Data Fig. 5). These data indicate that astrocyte Fos promoter activity, and the associated surge in Fos mRNA and c-Fos protein expression, peaks within a biologically plausible window of 0–3 h following FR, but not following FC.

A recent study18 reported an increase in hippocampal astrocytic Fos after FC without habituation, contrasting with our findings (Fig. 1c–f). We hypothesized that this reflects contextual novelty: without prior habituation, novelty strongly drives astrocytic Fos. Supporting this, our ‘FC + novelty' group (FC in novel context with no habituation) showed widespread astrocytic Fos, including in CA1 (Extended Data Fig. 6). Thus, the CA1 astrocytic Fos is likely to signal novelty, whereas our habituated FC protocol reveals astrocytic ensembles that are more selectively engaged in learning and recall.

To holistically compare the anatomical positioning of BAEs with previously reported brain-wide Fos+ neuron distribution during FC and FR5, we analysed subregions from previously defined regions in which Fos+ neuron counts of FC and FR were significantly higher than in non-shocked controls, referred to as neuronal ‘engram significant brain regions'5 (Fig. 1e–g and Methods). The number of Fos+ neurons increased during FC versus non-shocked controls, whereas there was no apparent change in astrocytic Fos counts (Fig. 1f). By contrast, FR elicited a strong correlation between neuronal and astrocytic Fos induction (r = 0.56; Fig. 1g,h), suggesting that local astrocyte–neuron interactions may underlie FR-BAE formation22. Notably, amygdala subregions that displayed selective astrocytic Fos increases during FR (Fig. 1e) also showed parallel neuronal Fos increases (Fig. 1h, yellow dots).

To test whether astrocytic and neuronal ensembles are co-engaged within the same regions, we performed dual-colour Fos tagging in the amygdala of TRAP2 mice (Fig. 1i–k). Neuron-specific DIO-mCherry and astrocyte-specific DIO-mNG AAVs were co-injected, and four groups were analysed: NoFC, FC, NoFR and FR. Neuronal Fos increased after FC or FR, consistent with past reports5,8,22. By contrast, astrocytic tagging was minimal following FC and NoFR but was robustly induced after FR (Fig. 1i–k), replicating our brain-wide observations (Fig. 1c–h). These results confirm that astrocyte Fos induction in the amygdala is recall-specific and distinct from neuronal ensemble dynamics.

To identify mechanisms underlying astrocyte Fos induction, we combined pharmacological screening, circuit genetics, in vivo imaging and transcriptomics (Figs. 2–4). Growth factors that activate c-Fos in neurons36 did not trigger c-Fos signals in primary astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 7), indicating that the induction mechanisms of c-Fos in neurons and astrocytes are distinct. Given the accumulating evidence that astrocyte G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation upregulates c-Fos expression26,29,30, we then stimulated primary astrocytes with a variety of neurotransmitters that bind to GPCRs expressed in astrocytes11,22,23, observing that noradrenaline (NA) increased c-Fos signals (Fig. 2b,c). The astrocyte c-Fos signals induced by NA at 0.1 µM and 1 µM were both abolished by propranolol (Fig. 2d), which antagonizes Gαs-coupled β-adrenergic receptors (β-receptors), but not by prazosin or atipamezole, which antagonize Gαq-coupled α1-adrenoreceptors (α1-receptors) or Gαi-coupled α2-adrenoreceptors, respectively (Fig. 2d). The astrocyte c-Fos induction was resistant to the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM)37. The membrane-permeable Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin did not increase astrocyte c-Fos signals (Fig. 2d). However, the inhibition of cAMP production by the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 attenuated astrocyte c-Fos signals induced by the adenylate cyclase–cAMP activator forskolin, the β-receptor agonist isoproterenol or NA (Fig. 2d). Together, these data show that NA induces c-Fos signals in primary astrocytes mainly through Gαs-coupled β-receptors and subsequent increases in cAMP.

Astrocytes in vivo respond to both local circuits and long-range neuromodulators15. Our data (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 3d) suggest that local activity also contributes to Fos induction in vivo. Given the transcriptional differences between in vitro and in vivo astrocytes, notably the reduced expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3, encoded by Grm3) in cultured astrocytes17,38, which is abundantly expressed in adult in vivo astrocytes39, we heterologously expressed mGluR3 in primary astrocytes via AAVs to mimic the in vivo context (Fig. 2e). In mGluR3-expressing astrocytes, glutamate alone was ineffective, but in combination with NA it strongly enhanced c-Fos intensity (Fig. 2f,g). No such synergy was seen in mGluR3-negative astrocytes. Because Gαi-coupled GPCRs such as mGluR3 can enhance Gβγ–Ca2+ signalling when Gαq–phospholipase Cβ is co-activated29,40, NA may recruit α1-receptors (Gαq) and mGluR3 (Gαi) to cooperate with β-receptor–cAMP pathways (Fig. 2h). Supporting this, ionomycin-induced Ca2+ signals enhanced c-Fos when combined with NA, isoproterenol or forskolin (Fig. 2i). Thus, astrocytic c-Fos is driven primarily by β-receptor–cAMP and is further potentiated by convergent glutamate and NA signalling.

To test this convergence in vivo, we expressed neuron-specific hM3Dq in LA/B and locus coeruleus (LC), which mainly consists of noradrenergic neurons to stimulate them with CNO (Fig. 2j–m). The number of Fos-mNG+ astrocytes remained low when only LA/B or LC neurons were activated, but increased markedly when both were stimulated (Fig. 2j–m). This provides in vivo evidence that coincident local and noradrenergic inputs induce astrocytic Fos.

We next tested the necessity of local and far-reaching NA neural signals during FR-BAE tagging. TRAP2::AAV-PHP.eB-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG mice received one of four perturbations at the time of tagging: β-receptor antagonism with propranolol (Fig. 2n) or hM4Di-mediated silencing of LC neurons (Fig. 2o), amygdalar neurons (Fig. 2p) or amygdalar engram neurons tagged with the robust activity marking (RAM) system41,42 whose hM4Di-based silencing (Extended Data Fig. 8) is known to reduce fear memory recall41 (Fig. 2q). In all conditions, FR-BAE density decreased significantly (Fig. 2r), demonstrating dependence on both LC-NA and local engram activity.

To further test whether FR-BAEs reside in anatomical contexts where they could receive convergent inputs from both noradrenergic projections and local engram neurons, we performed dual-colour Fos tagging with neuron-specific DIO-mCherry and astrocyte-specific DIO-mNG AAVs in TRAP2 mice, combined with noradrenaline transporter (NET) immunostaining to visualize noradrenergic projections (Extended Data Fig. 9). Territories of FR-BAEs showed greater overlap with noradrenergic projections and FR engram neurons than those of non-FR-BAEs, with no change in astrocyte territory size. These findings indicate that FR-BAEs are positioned to integrate convergent inputs from noradrenergic projections and local engram neurons, supporting the model that their coincidence drives FR-BAE induction in the amygdala.

Our data (Fig. 2) support a convergence model in which NA and engram activity induce astrocyte Fos. However, since both activities occur during FC and FR8,43, the stronger astrocyte Fos induction during FR than FC (Fig. 1) raises the question of how astrocytes generate this selective response. To address this, we examined NA release and astrocyte cAMP–Ca2+ signalling dynamics across fear learning and recall using in vivo fibre photometry (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 8). We deployed AAV2/9-hSyn1-GRABNE2h44 to monitor bulk NA signals in the LA/B of freely behaving mice (Fig. 3a,b). During habituation 24 h prior to FC, NA signals were observed when the mice were placed into context A (CtxA; foot shock chamber) (peak ΔF/F = 0.142 ± 0.017), probably reflecting mild stressors and/or locomotion44 (NoFC; Fig. 3b). On top of the contextual NA signals, single foot shocks evoked enhanced and relatively fast (peak ΔF/F = 0.206 ± 0.04; half-decay = 4.3 min) NA responses in LA/B (FC; Fig. 3b). In addition, further enhanced (peak ΔF/F = 0.211 ± 0.022) and prolonged (half-decay = 13.5 min) NA signals were observed during the contextual FR (FR; Fig. 3b). The prolonged NA signals were absent in context B (CtxB) (Extended Data Fig. 10c,d), a neutral, non-conditioned context where mice show no freezing (Extended Data Fig. 10b), indicating that recall of contextual fear drives sustained NA signals.

We next used dual-colour fibre photometry (AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-cAMPinG1 and AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-RCaMP345) to measure astrocyte cAMP and Ca2+ signals (Fig. 3c). Consistent with the NA signals (Fig. 3a,b), cAMPinG1 signals increased during habituation and foot shocks, which fully decayed within about 2 min (NoFC and FC; Fig. 3d). On the FR day, however, astrocytes displayed a progressive increase in cAMP (FR; Fig. 3d), which was absent in CtxB (Extended Data Fig. 10e,f). β-receptor antagonism (propranolol) in vivo abolished the astrocytic cAMP signalling during FR (Fig. 3d), which suppressed FR-BAE induction (Fig. 2n,r) and freezing (Extended Data Fig. 10b′). Foot shock elicited astrocyte Ca2+ signals as reported previously46, and Ca2+ event frequency increased during FR (Fig. 3e). These data collectively indicate that fear experiences induce the enhancement of NA signals within the amygdala, which strongly trigger astrocyte cAMP signals through β-receptors during FR.

The increased astrocyte cAMP–Ca2+ signalling during FR raised the question of how astrocytes mount stronger responses during recall than during conditioning, despite NA release and engram neural activity occurring in both fear experiences. To address this, we examined experience-dependent molecular changes in astrocytes under NoFC, FC, NoFR and FR conditions. We dissected amygdala tissue 90 min after behavioural testing and isolated astrocytes by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using the ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit β2 (ATP1B2)47 antibody ACSA2 (Extended Data Fig. 11a) and performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). After quality control, we obtained profiles of 1,903 astrocytes (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 11b,c) and identified 4 transcriptionally distinct astrocyte clusters (AST1–4; Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 11d,e and Supplementary Table 3). We did not observe any noticeable shifts in the subcluster composition across conditions, suggesting that FC and FR do not alter cluster identity. Fos-positive astrocytes comprised 2.9–4.2% of total astrocytes (Fig. 4b), consistent with earlier data (Extended Data Fig. 4). Of note, FR astrocytes showed the highest Fos levels (Fig. 4b), in line with BAE tagging (Fig. 1). Whereas scRNA-seq provides a snapshot at a single time point (approximately twofold increase in FR versus FC; Fig. 4b), the Fos-TRAP system integrates promoter activity over hours, which is likely to account for the greater fold differences observed with tagging (more than 30-fold in FR versus FC; Fig. 1d,e).

Subsequent analyses revealed that Adra1a (α1-receptor) and Adrb1 (β1-adrenoreceptor) as the two dominant adrenoreceptor genes expressed in amygdalar astrocytes. Notably, both receptors were upregulated in the FC group (1.5 h post-FC) and further elevated in the NoFR group (24 h post-FC without recall), suggesting continued priming of astrocytes over time (Fig. 4c). This data suggests a model in which FC induces a molecular state change in astrocytes, with a latency, increasing adrenoreceptor expression to potentiate NA signalling and enable future repeated fear-evoked Fos induction during FR. The enhancement in astrocytic adrenoreceptor expression is likely to underlie the NA–β-receptor-driven cAMP signals during FR (Fig. 3c,d) and Fos induction in response to recall of strong fear memory a day after conditioning (Fig. 1). To test this model, we explored temporal changes in adrenoreceptor expression, their link to FR-BAE induction, and causal roles in Fos induction.

We examined the time course of Adra1a and Adrb1 expression following FC, using single-cell RNAscope on amygdalar sections collected at 1.5 h, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days and 14 days post-conditioning (Fig. 4d–f). Adrb1 expression was significantly increased from 1.5 h to 3 days post-conditioning (approximately twofold versus NoFC; Fig. 4e), but returned to baseline by 14 days. By contrast, Adra1a expression was increased at 1 day post-conditioning (Fig. 4e), showed partial decay by 2 to 3 days, and peaked again at 14 days. We calculated a co-expression index for each cell (relative Adrb1 expression × relative Adra1a expression; Methods) and found a peak at 1 day post-FC (Fig. 4f), followed by gradual decline. To test whether this molecular profile predicts the degree of astrocyte Fos induction during recall, we performed FR-BAE tagging at multiple time points post-FC (1 day, 2 days, 3 days and 14 days; Fig. 4g,h). Consistent with the adrenoreceptor co-expression time course (Fig. 4f), FR-BAE density peaked at 1 day and declined thereafter (Fig. 4h), suggesting a defined window for FR-BAE induction. Moreover, RNAscope further revealed strong Fos–Adrb1 correlation in FR astrocytes (Fig. 4i–k).

To determine whether these adrenoreceptors are causally required for FR-BAE induction, we performed astrocyte-specific knockdown of Adra1a or Adrb1 in the amygdala (Fig. 4l) using floxed mouse lines48,49,50, AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre-4x6T51 and Flp-based Fos-tagging AAVs (AAV2/5-Fos-FlpoERT2 and AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-fDIO-mNG). Knockdown of either receptor (Fig. 4m,n) significantly reduced FR-BAE density (Fig. 4o,p), indicating that both Gαq-coupled α1-receptors and Gαs-coupled β1-receptors are necessary for FR-BAE induction in vivo. Our earlier finding that the α1-receptor antagonist prazosin did not block NA-induced c-Fos induction in cultured astrocytes (Fig. 2d) probably reflects the downregulation of Adra1a in vitro17, highlighting the importance of in vivo validation. Collectively, our data support a model in which initial fear experience primes astrocytes to upregulate adrenoreceptor expression over time, creating a multiday molecular trace that allows future NA release upon repeated experiences (that is, recall) to selectively recruit the astrocyte ensemble.

Transcriptomics enabled us to probe molecular changes of FR-BAEs linked to functional outputs. We mined differentially expressed genes between Adrb1-positive and Adrb1-negative astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 12a) and identified Igfbp2 as highly upregulated in Adrb1-positive astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 12a,b). Our single-cell RNAscope revealed highly correlated expression of Adrb1 and Igfbp2 (Extended Data Fig. 12c–e), suggesting that astrocytic Adrb1 upregulation could promote Igfbp2 induction. Igfbp2 encodes the secreted protein IGFBP2, which was recently reported to be enriched in ‘peri-neuronal engram' Fos+ astrocytes of the amygdala after fear recall22.

Given that IGFBP2 and its binding partners, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), are crucial for synaptic plasticity52,53 and that chronic deletion of IGFBP2 disrupts synaptic transmission, circuit maturation and memory22,52,54, we hypothesized that IGFBP2 expression in FR-BAELA/B contributes to circuit de-stabilization and re-stabilization upon recall2,3. We tested this hypothesis with a spatiotemporally specific in vivo pharmacological perturbation of IGFBP2 (Extended Data Fig. 12f–h). We bilaterally infused an IGFBP2-neutralizing antibody52 (IGFBP2-Ab; 1 mg ml−1) immediately after FR in CtxA—that is, within the reconsolidation window during which memories become labile to be weakened or strengthened2. Mice received repeated daily infusions and FR sessions for five days (Extended Data Fig. 12f). IGFBP2-Ab treatment reduced freezing compared with controls (Extended Data Fig. 12g,h), indicating impaired memory stabilization; controls infused with IgG showed no change. Combined, our transcriptomics, RNAscope and pharmacological perturbation data indicate that a subset of astrocytes increases adrenoreceptor expression upon fear experiences, enhancing NA responsiveness and recall-driven induction of Fos and Igfbp2 to stabilize fear memory.

To directly examine the causal role of FR-BAE signalling in memory stabilization, we performed a loss-of-function experiment selectively targeting FR-BAEs in LA/B. We used iβARK, a genetically encoded 122-amino acid peptide that binds Gαq–GTP to suppress GPCR signalling26 (Extended Data Fig. 13a). In ex vivo Ca2+ imaging in amygdalar astrocytes, iβARK reduced α1-receptor-evoked Ca2+ responses relative to its mutant control, although some residual oscillatory activity persisted (Extended Data Fig. 13c,f,g), consistent with our prior findings in the striatum26. To improve efficacy, we developed iβARK2 by fusing the original peptide to a membrane-anchoring Lck domain, enabling more effective proximity-based inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 13a,b). iβARK2 showed robust membrane localization across astrocytic compartments, including fine processes (Extended Data Fig. 13d). Astrocytes expressing iβARK2 displayed significantly attenuated Ca2+ responses relative to both iβARK and the control iβARK2mut (Extended Data Fig. 13e–g). We next generated Cre-dependent AAV versions of iβARK2 and iβARK2mut for use in Fos-iCreERT2 TRAP mice to selectively target FR-BAEs (Fig. 5a,b). Remarkably, silencing FR-BAEs with iβARK2 impaired memory stabilization upon repeated recall (Fig. 5c), consistent with the behavioural effects observed upon neutralization of astrocyte-derived IGFBP2 (Extended Data Fig. 12f–h). Moreover, astrocytic IGFBP2 levels were significantly reduced in iβARK2-expressing mice compared with iβARK2mut controls (Fig. 5d), suggesting that suppression of GPCR signalling in FR-BAEs disrupts the recall-dependent transcriptional induction of IGFBP2 and compromises memory stabilization.

To further explore the causal impact of BAE signalling on neuronal engram and memory formation, we performed a gain-of-function experiment targeting astrocytic β1-receptors in LA/B. Astrocytes transduced with AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Adrb1 for Adrb1 overexpression (Adrb1-OE) showed significantly increased Igfbp2 expression compared with controls (Fig. 5f). Adrb1 overexpression also increased the density of FR-BAEs (Fos-mNG+ astrocytes) by around threefold relative to controls (Fig. 5g,h), indicating that astrocyte β1-receptor overexpression amplifies the recall-induced astrocyte ensemble.

We next functionally assessed the behavioural effect of the augmented astrocyte ensembles (Fig. 5i–l and Extended Data Fig. 14). We detected no differences in ambulation in an open arena or time spent in the centre zone during habituation between control and Adrb1-OE mice (Extended Data Fig. 14a,b). We then tested whether Adrb1 overexpression affected memory stabilization. With three-shock conditioning, both groups showed equivalent freezing during initial recall and second recall after reconsolidation (Fig. 5j), potentially owing to a ceiling effect. To create parametric space to detect enhancements in memory, we trained mice to a weak (one-shock) conditioning paradigm (Fig. 5i,k). Adrb1-OE mice did not show altered freezing during FR one day after FC; however, Adrb1-OE mice exhibited significantly increased freezing during the second recall (Fig. 5k), indicating enhanced memory stabilization following the reconsolidation after initial recall. In another cohort with three-shock conditioning, initial recall showed no significant difference in freezing between the groups (Extended Data Fig. 14i,j). However, we observed significantly enhanced freezing in an altered context (CtxB) in mice with Adrb1 overexpression compared with controls (Fig. 5l). These data suggest that overstabilization of the initial fear memory leads to generalization or a loss of memory precision41,55,56,57.

Finally, we explored whether fear generalization is accompanied by activity of engram neurons. We bilaterally injected AAV2/8-hSyn1-DIO-mCherry with and without AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Adrb1, and tagged engram neurons during FR. Mice were euthanized 1.5 h after the CtxB freezing test and the reactivation of FR engram neurons was assessed by c-Fos immunoreactivity (Fig. 5m–o). The overall number of mCherry+ neurons (FR engram neurons) was not significantly different between groups, but the c-Fos levels in FR engram neurons in the Adrb1-OE mice, which showed fear generalization, were significantly higher than those in control mice (Fig. 5o). These findings suggest that the larger astrocyte ensembles contribute to enhance subsequent reactivation of engram neurons, consistent with the view that memory retrievability is not determined during memory formation, but may be regulated after memory retrieval8, and demonstrating that astrocytes are involved in that crucial process.

These data demonstrate that astrocytes can link discrete fear experiences across at least a day-long timescale. As postulated more than a century ago58 and recently implicated in brain computation11,25,59,60, astrocytes may integrate information on slower timescales than neurons. Whereas neurons and astrocytes have been traditionally compared over milliseconds versus seconds-to-minutes, our findings reveal a functionally significant mismatch on the scale of days. Unlike neurons that express the immediate early genes during both FC and FR5,8,28, astrocytes respond to fear conditioning (FC) with rapid Ca2+ and cAMP increases61, but undergo slower transcriptional state changes62. Our single-cell transcriptomics and RNAscope revealed that multiple days post-FC, without recall, astrocytes upregulated Adra1a and Adrb1, marking a learning-dependent state that facilitates heightened responses during repeated experiences (FR). This in turn drives expression of Fos and Igfbp2, supporting memory stabilization. The astrocyte ensembles identified in this study may partially meet the criteria for engram cells8 that undergo enduring biochemical changes upon experiences. However, our findings suggest that the astrocytic ensemble may not serve as a direct memory trace encoding experience-specific information like neurons because its perturbation did not alter initial fear recall. Instead, it may function as an eligibility trace for memory stabilization over days, creating a permissive microenvironment within circuits that supports the stabilization of memories related to repeated experiences. From a computational and bioenergetic perspective, astrocytes may underlie retrospective linking63,64, which benefits from spaced intervals over days between learning sessions65 by providing a slow modulatory trace that complements fast neuronal activity64, thereby offloading the energetically costly task of maintaining firing patterns in neurons across days and enabling more stable circuit transformations60.

Mounting evidence from animal3,4,57 and human imaging6 studies has highlighted the amygdala and NA in modulating long-term memory. Early pharmacological studies targeting protein synthesis66, β-receptors67, PKA35 or cAMP–CREB34 in the amygdala disrupted memory re-stabilization, which our findings indicate could partially be mediated by astrocytes. We show that astrocytes undergo learning-dependent increases in adrenoreceptor expressions, and manipulating these receptors alters memory stability, precision and neuronal engram representations. Notably, both NA input and reactivated neuronal engram activity are required to recruit astrocytic ensembles that stabilize labile memories. These findings imply that astrocyte ensembles may not simply be passive bulk substrates of NA signals, but instead exert behaviourally relevant, circuit-specific regulations through astrocyte-defined microcircuitry15,68. Disrupting the precise NA–astrocyte signalling through β1R overexpression led to fear generalization, suggesting physiological astrocytic roles in selective memory stability that constrain maladaptive updating. In this regard, targeting these astrocyte–neuron interaction mechanisms could be beneficial in treating cognitive and neuropsychiatric dysfunctions, including post-traumatic stress disorder, in which hyperactivity of the NA system is a prominent feature4,69.

Deciphering how diverse astrocyte responses link to multiple circuit outputs has long been a challenge15. Considerable effort has been devoted to probe24 or perturb11 astrocyte Ca2+ signals since they were first reported70, yet causal relationships are usually inferred from separate subjects, leaving input–output links unclear. Astrocyte perturbation in a bulk manner is also incongruent with the heterogeneity of astrocyte identity49,71, state62,72 and response59,73. Our approaches bridge this gap: by exploiting context-specific astrocyte state changes18,20,22, the brain-wide BAE tagging method enables broad exploration of ensembles causal for neural processing and behaviour. This framework facilitates research into astrocytic ensembles across diverse behaviours and disease conditions. Expanding such efforts will accelerate discoveries in computation and pathology that require understanding of multicellular interactions as a core attribute of brain biology.

Young adult (8- to 12-week-old) wild-type C57BL/6NCrSlc mice obtained from the Japan SLC, Fos2A-iCreERT2 (TRAP228, JAX 030323) mice obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, Adra1a flox mice49,74 obtained from RIKEN (RBRC11837) and Adrb1 flox mice50 (accession number CDB1068K, generated by RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research) were used for in vivo experiments. TRAP2 mice were bred and maintained in our animal facility, backcrossed with C57BL/6NCrSlc at least eight times before use for experiments. Wild-type C57BL/6NCrSlc female mice were obtained from the Japan SLC to obtain postnatal day 0–1 (P0–P1) pups. Experiments were done using both male and female mice. Number of mice used in each experiment is listed in the main text and/or figure legends accordingly. Mice were housed in groups of 2–5 in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room (23 ± 3 °C, 45 ± 5% humidity) under a 12-h light:dark cycle (lights on from 07:00 to 19:00) and given ad libitum access to water and laboratory mouse diet at all times. After fibre implantation, the mice were single housed under a 12-h light:dark cycle (lights on from 07:00 to 19:00) and given ad libitum access to water and laboratory mouse diet at all times. After fibre implantation, the mice were singly housed. All experiments were approved by the RIKEN Animal Care and Use Committee.

AAVpro 293T cells (Clontech, 632273) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco, 11995073) with fetal bovine serum (FBS; Cosmo Bio, CCP-FBS-BR-500) and 0.1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, 15240062). Cells were grown in a humidified cell culture incubation with 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

All plasmid constructs were generated using standard molecular biology techniques and the In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Clontech). The pZac2.1 GfaABC1D-Rpl22-HA plasmids (Addgene plasmid #111811) were digested with XhoI and NotI, which removed the Rpl22-HA sequence. Multiple cloning sequences (MCS) comprised of restriction enzyme sites that were absent from the backbone pZac2.1 plasmid were generated via gene synthesis (Eurofins Genomics) and incorporated to produce pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-MCS plasmids. The PCR-amplified DIO-GFP sequence from Addgene plasmid #28304 was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCAG-tdTomato (Addgene #83029) between EcoRI sites to generate pCAG-DIO-EGFP-tdTomato. The PCR-amplified DIO-EGFP-tdTomato was inserted into the XbaI and NotI sites of the pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-MCS plasmid to generate pZac2.1-GfaBC1D-DIO-EGFP-tdTomato plasmids. The PCR-amplified WPRE sequence from pFBAAV-CAG-XCaMP-R-WPRE (a gift from H. Bito12) was inserted into the NotI site of the resulting plasmid to generate pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-DIO-EGFP-tdTomato-WPRE plasmids. The plasmids were digested with NotI and AgeI, which removed the tdTomato sequence, and a PCR-amplified mScarlet-I sequence (Addgene #98816) was incorporated, and the resulting plasmids were digested with XhoI and KpnI, which removed the EGFP sequence, and the mNG sequence from Addgene #99135 was ligated using DNA ligation kit (Takara) to generate pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-mScarlet-I-WPRE plasmids. The mScarlet-I sequence was removed with restriction enzymatic digestion with PspOMI and NotI to generate pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-WPRE plasmids. The PCR-amplified hM4Di-mCherry sequence from Addgene #92286 was cloned into the PmeI site of pAAV-RAM-d2TTA::TRE-MCS-WPRE (Addgene #63931) to generate pAAV-RAM-d2TTA::TRE-hM4Di-mCherry-WPRE plasmids. pAAV-GfaABC1D-Flag-mAdrb1-WPRE, pAAV-GfaABC1D-mGrm3-mCherry-WPRE, pAAV-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A), pAAV-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK, pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A), pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK pAAV-Fos-FlpoERT2 and pAAV-GfaABC1D-FRT-mNG plasmids were designed by the authors and constructed by VectorBuilder. The PCR-amplified DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A) and DIO-Lck-mcherry-iβARK sequence from pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A) and pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK was clone into the EcoRI site of pAAV-GfaABC1D-MCS-4x6T-WPRE (Addgene #196417) to generate pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A)-4x6T and pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK-4x6T. pAAV-GfaABC1D-mGrm3-mCherry-WPRE was digested with EcoNI and AccI to remove mGrm3-mCherry, and PCR-amplified mGrm3 was cloned back to the backbone to generate AAV-GfaABC1D-mGrm3-WPRE plasmids. The PCR-amplified XCaMP-Gf-WPRE from the pFBAAV-CAG-XCaMP-Gf-WPRE plasmid (a gift from H. Bito75) was cloned into the NcoI and HindIII site of pAAV-hSyn1-cyto-mRuby3-iATPSnFR1.0 (Addgene #102557) to generate pAAV-hSyn1-XCaMP-Gf-WPRE plasmids. The mCherry-CAAX sequence digested with EcoRI of the pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-mCherry-CAAX plasmid (a gift from T. Takano76) was ligated into the EcoRI and EcoRV the resultant plasmids to generate pAAV-hSyn1-mCherry-CAAX-WPRE plasmids. All constructs were sequenced before use. All our constructs have been deposited to Addgene in the Nagai Lab repository for unrestricted distribution (http://www.addgene.org/Jun_Nagai, Supplementary Table 4).

Recombinant AAVs were generated by triple transfection of AAVpro 293T cells (Clontech, 632273) using polyethylenimine (PEI; Polysciences inc., 24765-100). Cells were cultured up to 50–70% confluency in DMEM (Gibco, 11995073) with FBS (Cosmo Bio, CCP-FBS-BR-500) and 0.1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, 15240062). The plasmids and PEI were mixed with Opti-MEM (31985-088) and kept for 5 min at room temperature. The mixture was combined with a DNA mix which contained pAAV Capsids, pHelper (Agilent Technologies, 240071-54) and pAAV transgenes. All these plasmids had a concentration of 4.2 μg per dish. The DNA mix was then applied with PEI/Opti-MEM, and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Then, this solution was added to the cells and incubated for 24 h. After incubation, the medium was changed to DMEM with 2% FBS and 0.1% antibiotic-antimycotic. Viral particles were collected from the medium at 120 h post-transfection. Cell pellets were centrifuged (3,500 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was filtered by Setricup (Merc, S2HVU02RE) and pellets were resuspended in FBS-free DMEM and freeze-thawed three times. In the case of PHP.eB capsid virus production, the supernatant was resuspended in DMEM and fractured by harshly pipetting. Thawed pellets were centrifuged (3,500 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) again and the supernatant was filtered by Setricup (Merc, S2HVU02RE). Media containing viral particles were centrifuged (22,000 rpm, 2 h, 4 °C) by Optima XE-100 (Beckman Coulter, A94516). The pellets were collected with 10–50 μl PBS and clarified by centrifugation (4,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant-containing viral particles were stored at 4 °C. AAV titre was analysed by quantitative PCR (QuantStudio 12 K; Applied Biosystems) using primers designed to selectively bind AAV2 inverted terminal repeats (forward: 5′-AACATGCTACGCAGAGAGGGAGTGG-3′, reverse: 5′-CATGAGACAAGGAACCCCTAGTGATGGAG-3′).

All surgical procedures were conducted under general anaesthesia using continuous isoflurane (induction at 5%, maintenance at 1.5% to 2% vol/vol). Depth of anaesthesia was monitored continuously and adjusted when necessary. Intravenous administration of AAV-PHP.eB (50 µl to deliver 2.5 × 1012 genome copies (GCs) per mouse) was performed by injection into the retro-orbital sinus of TRAP2 mice. Two weeks after AAV-PHP.eB GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-WPRE or AAV-PHP.eBGfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-mScaret-I-WPRE injections, mice were administered 4-OHT for inducing Cre recombination under the Fos promoter (Fos tagging) and then returned to their home cage until they were euthanized 7 days after tagging. In some cases, Fos tagging was performed using the FLP–FRT system (fDIO), and mice were euthanized one day after tagging. For stereotaxic microinjection of AAVs, mice were fitted into a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments) with their heads secured by blunt ear bars and their noses placed into a veterinary grade anaesthesia and ventilation system (VetEquip 911103). The surgical incision site was then cleaned with 70% ethanol (vol/vol). Craniotomies (1–2 mm in diameter) were made powered by a high-speed drill at specific coordinates based on the bregma position. Bilateral viral injections were conducted using a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments) to guide the placement of beveled glass pipettes (World Precision Instruments, 1B100-4) into the regions of interest: the basolateral amygdala (anterior–posterior (AP): −1.48 mm, medial–lateral (ML): 3.3 mm, dorsal–ventral (DV): 5.00 mm to bregma) and LC (AP: −5.4 mm, ML: 0.85 mm, DV: 3.7 mm to bregma). Total of 0.3 μl of AAV was delivered at 0.1 μl min−1 using a syringe pump (SmartTouch Pump, World Precision Instruments). The glass pipette was withdrawn 5–10 min after the infusion to prevent the backflow. Mice were then sutured, returned to their home cage, and allowed to rest for at least two to three weeks before any assessments were conducted. AAV titres (GCs per ml) were adjusted with sterile saline to deliver the indicated genome copies into the regions of interest: AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-WPRE (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-hM3Dq-mCherry (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/DJ8-RAM-d2TTA::TRE-hM4Di-WPRE (3.0 × 1013), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Flag-mAdrb1-WPRE (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/9-rTH-Cre (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/8-hSyn1-DIO-hM3Dq (1.0 × 1013), AAV2/8-hSyn1-DIO-hM4Di (1.0 × 1013), AAV2/8-hSyn1-DIO-mCherry (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/DJ8-Ef1a-hM3Dq (4.8 × 1011), AAV2/DJ8-Ef1a-hM4Di (4.0 × 1012), AAV2/5-hSyn1-mCherry-CAXX (3.0 × 1012) AAV2/9-hSyn1-GRABNE2h-WPRE (2.7 × 1012), AAV2/1 GfaABC1D-cAMPinG1-NE (1.3 × 1013), and AAV2/1 GfaABC1D-RCaMP3 (1.5 × 1013), GfaABC1D-GCaMP6f (1.1 × 1013), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-iβARK-mCherry (1.3 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-iβARK(D110A)-mCherry (1.3 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK (1.3 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A) (1.1 × 1013), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK-4x6T (3.0 × 1013), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A) (3.0 × 1013), AAV2/5-Fos-FlpoERT2 (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-fDIO-mNG (1.0 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre-4x6T (1.2 × 1013).

4-OHT (Sigma, H6278) was dissolved at 25 mg ml−1 in 100% ethanol with agitation at 37 °C for 15 min and was then aliquoted and stored at −20 °C for up to several weeks until use. Before use, 4-OHT was redissolved in ethanol by shaking at 37 °C for 15 min and corn oil (Sigma, 259853 and S5007) was added to give a final concentration of 3 mg ml−1 4-OHT. The ethanol was evaporated by incubation at 50 °C. The final 3 mg ml−1 4-OHT solutions were always used on the day they were prepared. All 4-OHT injections were delivered intraperitoneally at 50 mg kg−1 2–4 weeks after AAV injection into TRAP2 mice for inducing Cre recombination under the Fos promoter.

CNO (Tocris, 4936) was administered intraperitoneally 0.5 h before the initiation of behavioural assessments. CNO was administered intraperitoneally 20 min before 4-OHT intraperitoneal injection. Propranolol (MedChemExpress, HY-B0573) was dissolved in dH2O at 100 mM and stored at −20 °C. The final solutions were always used on the day they were prepared.

Mice were placed on doxycycline (40 mg kg−1, Bio-Serv, F4159) chow 24 h prior to and for at least 1 week after viral injection, switched to doxycycline-free chow 48 h before recall, and euthanized 24 h later. IGFBP2 antibody was infused bilaterally through implanted guide cannulas targeting basolateral amygdala. Infusions were performed using an internal cannula connected to a 10-µl Hamiltion syringe. One microgram of IGFBP2 antibody (1 mg ml−1, 1 µl per site) was infused into mice immediately after a fear recall paradigm at 400 nl min−1 using a syringe pump (SmartTouch Pump, World Precision Instruments).

Mice were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for fixation. The dissected brains were post-fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% PFA in PBS, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS. The brains were embedded with OCT compound (Sakura Finetek Japan, 4583) and sliced into coronal sections with a thickness of 50 μm at −20 °C using cryostat (CryoStar NX70, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 956960). The sections were washed with PBS 3 times for 5 min each and stored in 50% glycerol (Fujifilm, 075-00616) in PBS at −20 °C. For staining with c-Fos antibody, the sections were permeabilized with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 (Nacalai tesque, 35501), incubated at room temperature for 3 h, and then incubated with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1% normal donkey serum (NDS, Sigma-Aldrich, D9663) at room temperature for 1 h for blocking, and then incubated at 4 °C overnight in blocking buffer. With the following primary antibodies, Triton X-100 was used at 0.1% for permeabilization and PBS containing 1% NDS was used for blocking and antibody reactions: rat anti-GFAP (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 13-0300), mouse anti-S100β (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich, S2532), goat-Sox9 (1:100, R&D systems, AF3075) mouse anti-RFP (1:500, MBL, M155-3), rabbit anti-RFP (1:500, Rockland, 600-401-379), mouse anti-NET (1:2,000, MAb technologies, NET05-2) and rabbit anti-c-Fos (1:5,000, Synaptic Systems, 226003). After washing with PBS 3 times for 10 min each, the sections were incubated at room temperature for 2 h in blocking buffer with the following secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rat, Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-chicken, Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-goat, Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-chicken (1:1,000, Abcam, ThermoFisher and Jackson ImmunoResearch). The sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight in blocking buffer with secondary antibodies when staining with anti-c-Fos antibody. After washing with PBS 3 times for 10 min each, the sections were mounted on slides (Fluoromount-G, Southern bio, 0100-35) and visualized under a confocal laser microscope (Olympus, FV3000) and a fluorescent microscope (Olympus, VS200). Immunoreactivities were analysed using ImageJ software (NIH). The numbers of c-Fos+ neurons (Fig. 5o and Extended Data Fig. 8b) and astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 4b) were quantified based on a consistent c-Fos intensity threshold for each experiment. This threshold was defined such that the number of c-Fos+ neurons or astrocytes corresponded to the values previously reported18,42,77. Number of cells, field of views, sections and mice used in each analysis is listed in the main text and/or figure legends accordingly.

Mice were singly housed in a light-proof chamber for 48 h. On the day of tagging, mice were exposed to 1 h of light inside the chamber and injected intraperitoneally with 50 mg kg−1 4-OHT either 24 h, 12 h, 6 h or 3 h before or 0 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h or 24 h after the termination of light exposure. Mice were returned to the dark chamber for an additional two days and then returned to a regular light-dark cycle until the time of euthanasia seven days after tagging.

Behavioural tests were performed during the light cycle between 07:00 and 19:00. Temperature and humidity of the experimental rooms were maintained at 23 ± 2 °C and 55 ± 5%, respectively. Background noise (55 dB) was generated by a white noise generator (Ohara). All the experimental mice were transferred to the behaviour testing room at least 1 h before the tests to acclimatize to the environment and to reduce stress. Mice were habituated by freely exploring the conditioning chamber (CtxA) that consisted of a square partition (30 × 30 × 15 cm; 100 lux and no odour) with a grid floor wired to a shock generator (Ohara) for 15 min per day for 3 days. On the fourth day, they were either fear conditioned (1 time or 3 times shock; 2 s, 0.3 mA) (FC group) or presented with no shocks (NoFC group) in the conditioning chamber. One day after the conditioning, mice were either returned to CtxA for 3 min for fear memory recall (FR group) or kept in their home cages (NoFR group). Freezing durations exceeding 70% in the conditioned chamber 1 day post-conditioning with 3 foot shocks or exceeding 50% 1 day post-conditioning with a single foot shock, are considered indicative of sufficient conditioning. All the experimental mice received intraperitoneal injections of 4-OHT (50 mg kg−1) immediately after the task for Fos tagging. Freezing was automatically measured throughout the testing trial by the TimeFZ4 software (version 2021_7_29, Ohara) and subsequently processed by a blinded investigator. The chambers were cleaned with 70% ethanol between tests. In some cases, 10 mg kg−1 Propranolol (MedChemExpress, HY-B0573) was administered by intraperitoneal injection to mice 0.5 h before, and 2.5 h and 5.5 h after 4-OHT-based Fos tagging in order to block β-adrenergic signalling throughout the tagging timeframe. In some experiments using DREADDs, mice were injected with CNO (1 mg kg−1) 10 min before the task in CtxA. For experiments in Fig. 2n in which CNO was used for silencing neuronal activity or propranolol was used for antagonizing β-adrenoreceptor signalling to test their roles in astrocyte Fos induction during fear memory recall, both were administered with consideration of their pharmacokinetics. Propranolol was given both before and after the behavioural session to ensure effective β-receptor blockade throughout the several-hour Fos-tagging window (Extended Data Fig. 3), given its short half-life78 (~1.5–2 h), whereas CNO was given once before the session owing to its prolonged effect79 (>6 h). Freezing was measured for 3 min in the CtxB chamber, which consisted of a rhombic partition (30 cm × 60 cm × 15 cm, 10 lux and 1% acetic acid odour) with a flat floor (Ohara).

Mice were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with PBS, followed by 4% PFA in PBS for fixation of brain tissues. The dissected brains were post-fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% PFA in PBS and stored in PBS at 4 °C until embedding. To oxidize agarose, 2.25 g agarose (A6013, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 100 ml of 10 mM sodium periodate (S1878, Sigma-Aldrich)/50 mM phosphate buffer and stirred gently for 2.5 h at room temperature in the dark. The oxidized agarose was filtered on a bottle-top vacuum filter (0.2 μm, 569-0020, Thermo Scientific) washed 3 times with phosphate buffer and resuspended in 50 ml of phosphate buffer to make 4.5% oxidized agarose solution. The oxidized agarose solution was boiled with a microwave oven to melt the agarose and kept at 60–65 °C. The brains were pat-dried and embedded in oxidized agarose solution with a plastic mould (18646A, Polysciences). For covalent crosslinking between oxidized agarose and the surface of the brain, borate/borohydride solution was prepared the day before use by adding 0.2 g sodium borohydride (452882, Sigma-Aldrich) in 100 ml of prewarmed (40 °C) borate buffer (50 mM borax, 221732, Sigma-Aldrich; 50 mM boric acid, B6768, Sigma-Aldrich; pH 9.0–9.5) in the chemical fume hood. The agarose block was removed from the mould, soaked in borate/borohydride solution to initiate crosslinking and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The block was washed and kept in phosphate buffer at 4 °C until imaging.

The agarose block was mounted on a glass slide using Loctite 401 glue immediately before imaging. STPT was performed with the TissueCyte 1400FC system (TissueVision) equipped with Coherent Chameleon Ultra II laser (Coherent) or Spectra-Physics Insight X3+ laser (MKS Spectra-Physics) and a Nikon 16× water-immersion objective (MRP07220, NA: 0.8). The laser wavelength was tuned at 1,000 nm. Brains were coronally sectioned with a built-in vibrating microtome at 50-μm thickness with a frequency of 60 Hz and a speed of 0.5 mm s−1. Four optical z-planes were taken at 50 μm, 62.5 μm, 75 μm and 87.5 μm below the cut surface of the tissue block. To scan an entire coronal plane, individual tile images were acquired (832 × 832 pixels per frame, resolution at 1.382 μm per pixel) by moving the stage between each tile. Following the full scanning of a coronal plane, a 50-μm section was cut away by vibrating microtome and imaging of a new cut surface repeated to acquire optical sections covering the entire brain from the caudal to the rostral side (~320 coronal sections). The raw image tiles were first trimmed and subjected to flat field correction, then stitched into 2D mosaic coronal section images using the Autostitcher software (TissueVision). The signals from the green channel (500–550 nm, mNG signal) and from the far-red channel (>600 nm, background) were simultaneously acquired, and the latter was used to subtract background from the green channel to enhance the signal to noise ratio. Each region of the whole brain was aligned and segmented according to the Mouse Brain Atlas (NeuroInfo, MBL Bioscience, BN-200). Owing to the high quality preservation of tissue architecture during imaging, we semi-automatically performed alignment to a standard mouse brain atlas, segmentation of 839 brain regions, and detection of single Fos-tagged mNG astrocytes (BAEs), defined by their territories that typically displayed diameters of approximately 40 to 60 μm with ~10-µm-wide cell bodies68 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). Consistent with our intersectional genetic approach, we rarely observed neuron-like mNG-positive cells, with larger cell bodies (>~20-μm diameter) and elongated processes (>~50-μm). We only found these cells in regions nearby ventricles and the midline where well-characterized GFAP-positive neural progenitor cells reside48,80, and they were excluded in subsequent analyses. As a result, using this brain-wide analysis approach we successfully quantified the density of BAEs in 677 brain regions that accounted for 80.7% of the whole brain.

To observe correlation between Fos+ astrocytes and neurons, we used the same TRAP2 (Fos-iCreERT2) system28 used by Roy et al.5, but instead with a Cre-dependent mNG reporter expressed in Fos+ astrocytes, allowing comparison of Fos+ cell counts from anatomically matched regions between studies. The regions of interest were first narrowed to the 117 engram-signifiant regions defined by Roy et al. Then, to ensure analysis of bona fide astrocyte-tagged regions, areas with possible neuronal leakage (mNG+ neuron-like cells), particularly near ventricles were excluded (see above). In addition, high-level hierarchical structure areas (such as midbrain or thalamus) with extremely high total counts that skew correlation analysis were also excluded. In the end, this selection yielded 75 regions for subsequent correlational analyses. Changes in Fos+ astrocyte numbers (FC–NoFC and FR–NoFC) were calculated using the non-foot shocked control group as the baseline, consistent with Roy et al. Supplementary table 1 from Roy et al. provided region-by-region counts of Fos+ neurons in non-foot shocked controls, FC and FR groups, enabling us to extract the corresponding changes in Fos+ neuron numbers for each of the 75 regions. Pearson correlation analyses between these neuronal and astrocytic Fos+ cell count changes were performed.

For image visualization in 3D, low-resolution image stacks were created across all four channels. These stacks were downsampled to 25 μm per pixel resolution in the x and y axes, while the inter-slice distance was maintained at 50 μm, resulting in a voxel resolution of 25 × 25 × 50 μm3. To minimize high-frequency artifacts, median filtering and Gaussian smoothing were applied to the coronal images prior to downscaling. The processed 3D image stacks were stored in the NIfTI format, and the world coordinates were adjusted to align roughly with the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework v.3 (CCFv3)81. For registration to the CCFv3, the Allen STP-1675 template (filename: P56_Atlas.nii.gz; available at https://scalablebrainatlas.incf.org/mouse/ABA_v3#downloads) was used as the reference image. This template, generated from STPT averaged over 1,675 specimens, was combined with corresponding atlas annotations (filename: P56_Annotation.nii.gz). Image alignment was performed using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs)82. An affine registration was first applied at 3 scales (downscaling factors of 4, 2 and 1) with Gaussian smoothing of 2, 1 and 1 voxels and 250, 200 and 50 iterations, respectively. This was followed by deformable (SyN) registration at four scales (downscaling factors of 8, 4, 2 and 1) with Gaussian smoothing of 4, 2, 1 and 1 voxels and 1,000, 500, 100 and 50 iterations, respectively, using mutual information as the metric. After computing the transformation, individual image stacks and atlas labels were mapped to and from the CCFv3 image space. After aligning with the NIfTI world coordinates, cell positions were mapped to the Allen template using the antsApplyTransformsToPoints function from ANTs. Brain regions from the Allen atlas annotations were then assigned to individual cells based on their locations in the CCFv3 image space.

Astrocyte primary cultures were obtained as previously described with some modifications83. In brief, cerebral cortical tissues were isolated from P0–P1 neonatal mice and dissociated with a scalpel, gently agitated in 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, 25300-054), and rapidly strained with a Falcon 100 µm cell strainer (352360). Dissociated cells were seeded at a rate of four brains per bottle on poly-d-lysine-coated bottles. The cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, 11995073) supplemented with FBS (Cosmo Bio, CCP-FBS-BR-500) and penicillin-streptomycin. When the cells reached confluence after several weeks, the culture bottles were gently shaken at 120 rpm overnight at 37 °C to remove non-astrocytic cells. Astrocytes were then detached using Trypsin-EDTA, replated onto poly-d-lysine-coated bottles, and after 1–2 weeks, cultures were shaken again at 120 rpm for 4 h. Astrocytes were then re-seeded on coverslips in 12-well plates at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells per well, which were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, with the medium being changed every 2 to 3 days.

Five days after re-seeding, primary astrocytes were incubated with tetrodotoxin (TTX at 1 µM, Fujifilm, 207-15901) to eliminate the potential effect of neuronal firing, for at least 5 min to allow adequate equilibration, together with the following inhibitors, blockers or chelators indicated for each experiment unless otherwise described: prazosin hydrochloride (MedChemExpress, HY-B0193A), atipamezole hydrochloride (Tokyo Chemical Industry, A2956), propranolol hydrochloride (MedChemExpress, HY-B0573), BAPTA-AM (SIGMA, A1076), and SQ 22536 (Tokyo chemical industry, Q0105). The cultures were then incubated with the following growth factors, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators or neuropeptides in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 1.5 h: l-glutamic acid monosodium salt hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, G5889), GABA (Sigma-Aldrich, A2129), ATP disodium salt hydrate from yeast (Nacalai tesque, 01072-24), l-noradrenaline hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, 74480), dopamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, H8502), acetylcholine chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, A6625), serotonin hydrochloride (Alfa Aesar, B21263.03), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, Fujifilm, 028-16451), neurotrophin-3 (Fujifilm, 146-09231, 50 ng ml−1), neurotrophin-4 (Fujifilm, 142-06634, 100 ng ml−1), forskolin (Fujifilm, 067-02191, 10 μM), nerve growth factor-β (NGFβ, Fujifilm, 141-07601, 100 ng ml−1), epidermal growth factor (EGF, Fujifilm, 059-07873, 100 ng ml−1), PDGF-AA (Fujifilm, 163–19731, 100 ng ml−1), PDGF-BB (Fujifilm, 164–24031, 100 ng ml−1), Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF, Fujifilm, 032-23501, 100 ng ml−1), IGF1 (Fujifilm, 099-04511, 100 ng ml−1). The following agonist and ionophore were used: isoproterenol (MedChemExpress, HY-B0468) and ionomycin (LKT laboratories, I5752). Ninety minutes after incubation, primary astrocytes were fixed in 4% PFA (Nacalai Tesque) for 10 min, washed with PBS 3 times, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Nacalai Tesque) for 10 min and blocked with 1% NDS (Sigma-Aldrich, D9663) for 30 min. Primary astrocytes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-c-Fos (1:1,000, Synaptic Systems, 226003), rat anti-GFAP (1:1,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 13-0300), rabbit anti-IBA1 (1:1,000, Fujifilm, 019-19741), chicken anti-TUJ1 (1:1,000 Novus Biologicals, NB100-1612), mouse anti-OLIG2 (1:100, Millipore, MABN50). The cultures were washed 3 times in PBS for 10 min each, then incubated with DAPI (1:10,000, Sigma-Aldrich, D9542) and the following secondary antibodies (1:1,000) in PBS containing 1% NDS for 1 h at room temperature: Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rat (abcam, ab150153), Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-mouse (abcam, ab175700), Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit (Abcam, ab175692), Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit (abcam, ab150067), Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-chicken (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 703-605-155). Fluorescent images were taken using a 20× objective lens (UPlanXApo 20×, Olympus) with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus, FV3000 with Fluoview). Immunoreactivity quantification of c-Fos was performed using ImageJ. The c-Fos brightness of GFAP-positive astrocytes were measured by the intensity of ROIs that encompassed the cell nuclei. In some experiments involving a heterologous expression of mGluR3, we applied AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Grm3 (800,000 multiplicity of infection) 5 h after re-seeding for expressing mGluR3 in primary astrocytes and incubated for 5 days before pharmacological experiments. Ninety minutes after stimulation with 0.1 µM NA and/or 100 µM glutamate in the presence of 1 µM TTX, primary astrocytes were fixed and stained as described above using primary antibodies: rabbit anti-mGluR3 (1:500, abcam, ab166608) and mouse anti-c-Fos (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc166940). It is noteworthy that the mouse anti-c-Fos antibody, different from the rabbit anti-c-Fos antibody used in other experiments, exhibited overall low immunoreactivity. However, this did not affect the quantification of c-Fos mobilization. Fluorescent imaging and quantification of c-Fos intensity were performed as described above.

AAVs for expressing the noradrenaline biosensor GRABNE2h on the neuronal cell surface, or calcium indicator RCaMP3 in astrocytes with cAMP sensor cAMPinG1 in astrocytes were unilaterally injected into the basolateral amygdala. Optical fibres were implanted above the injection site two weeks post-injection to capture emission of fluorescence signals, with recordings conducted one week after fibre implantation. For fluorescence signal collection, mice were tethered to a patch cable, and a 465 nm LED light (Doric, 40–50 µW at the tip of patch cable) or a 560 nm LED light (Doric, 40–50 µW at the tip of patch cable) was used to excite the signal, with an isosbestic 405 nm LED light used to correct for movement artifacts. Mice tethered to the patch cable were habituated in a testing chamber for 5 min on the day of recording. A time-division multiplexing scheme was used, where the 465 nm, 560 nm and 405 nm LED lights were emitted alternately at 20 Hz (turned on for 24 ms and off for 26 ms), with the timing precisely controlled by a programmable pulse generator (Master-9, AMPI). Each excitation light was reflected by a dichroic mirror and coupled into an optical fibre cable (Doric, 200 μm in diameter, 2 m in length, NA 0.57) through a pinhole (200 μm in diameter). The fluorescence signals were detected by a photomultiplier tube with a GaAsP photocathode (H16722-40; Hamamatsu Photonics) and digitized by a data acquisition module (USB-6341, National Instruments). A custom-written LabVIEW program extracted signals at a sampling frequency of 1 kHz in real time. Fluorescence signals collected during each light pulse were averaged, after dropping the first and last 2 samples (1 ms each) to eliminate potential noise caused during the alternation of LED lights. The data were smoothed using moving average and corrected for bleaching correction by fitting to least-squares linear. The fluorescence response was calculated (fitted 465 + 1)/(fitted 405 + 1) − baseline. The baselines of GRABNE2h and astrocyte cAMPinG1 signals were identified during periods of no spontaneous signals in home cages for 1–2 min before the context exposure. Signal analyses were performed in Python (v.3.0.0) using JupyterLab (v.3.6.7, Project Jupyter). Numerical computations and data handling were conducted using NumPy84 (v.1.26.4) and Pandas (v.2.1.4, NumFOCUS). The area under the curve of fluorescence traces was calculated with scikit-learn (sklearn, v.1.2.2, RRID:SCR_002577), and half-decay times of signal responses were extracted. Astrocytic RCaMP3 signals were bandpass filtered between 0.0003 and 1 Hz with SciPy85 (v.1.11.4). Peaks of Ca2+ signals were defined as data points exceeding 4× s.d. above the baseline mean, with baseline noise estimated from ≥20 s intervals lacking spontaneous activity in home cage recordings before context exposure. Signal traces were visualized with Matplotlib86 (v.3.8.0).

Coronal amygdalar slices were prepared from adult mice with AAV injection26,87. In brief, animals were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated with sharp shears. The brains were placed and sliced in ice-cold modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing the following (in mM): 194 sucrose, 30 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4 and 10 d-glucose, saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. A vibratome (DSK NLS-MT) was used to cut 300-µm brain sections. The slices were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at 32–34 °C in normal ACSF containing (in mM); 124 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4 and 10 d-glucose continuously bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Slices were then stored at 21–23 °C in the same buffer until use. All slices were used within 2–6 h of slicing. Cells for all the experiments were imaged with a 16× water-immersion objective lens (Nikon, N16XLWD-PF, MRP07220, NA: 0.8) with Nikon two-photon laser-scanning microscope (A1R MP) equipped with a 920 nm wavelength laser (Alcor, Spark Lasers). To image GCaMP6f signals, astrocytes located in the LA/B and typically ∼20 to ∼30 µm below the slice surface were selected for imaging. Images were acquired at 1 frame per second. Slices were maintained in ACSF (124 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM d-glucose and 2.0 mM CaCl2) through a perfusion system. Phenylephrine (PE, Tocris Bioscience 2838) was applied in the bath in the presence of 300 nM tetrodotoxin (Cayman Chemical 14964) were applied in the bath at least 5 min prior to recording to allow adequate equilibration. A constant flow of fresh buffer perfused the imaging chamber at all times. Spontaneous Ca2+ activity was recorded for 3 min (0 µM PE), followed by a 2-minute bath application of 1 µM PE, a 5-min washout, a 2-min application of 3 µM PE, and a 5-min washout. Ca2+ signals were processed in ImageJ (NIH) and presented as the relative change in fluorescence (ΔF/F).

Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane 90 min after the initiation of behavioural paradigms and transcardially perfused with PBS (30 ml for 2 min). The amygdala was freshly dissected out using a Brain Matrix (Ted Pella, 15067) and was placed into cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (14025092, Gibco) containing 10 mM HEPES (17514-15, Naclai Tesque), 0.54% glucose (16806-25, Naclai Tesque), 5.0 µg ml−1 actinomycin D (A1410, Sigma-Aldrich), 10 µM triptolide (T3652, Sigma-Aldrich) and 27.1 µg ml−1 anisomycin (A9789, Sigma-Aldrich), as previously described88,89. Then, the tissue block was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 3 ml enzyme solution (HBSS, 10 mM HEPES, 0.54% glucose, 0.5 mM EDTA (15575020, Invitrogen), 1.0 mM l-cysteine (10309-41, Naclai Tesque), 5.0 µg ml−1 actinomycin D, 10 µM triptolide and 27.1 µg ml−1 anisomycin) containing 20 U papain per mouse (LS003127, Worthington Biochemical). The tissue was then homogenized by passing through a 18 G needle and was further incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Following homogenization using a 20 G needle, the resulting cell suspension was centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. The homogenate was separated by gradient centrifugation with 30% Percoll (P1644, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS at 500g for 25 min at 4 °C (no brake). The pellet containing astrocytes at the bottom of the tube was then collected and washed once with PBS containing 2% FBS and 10 mM EDTA before staining. Fc receptors were blocked with Fc block (2.4G2, BD Bioscience) for 10 min at 4 °C before incubation with primary antibodies. Cells were stained with antibodies directed against CD11b-BV786 (1:200, M1/70, BD Bioscience), CD45-APC-Cy7 (1:200, 30-F11, BioLegend), O1-eFluor660 (1:200, 50-6506-82, eBioscience) and ASCA2-PE-Cy7 (1:200, 130-116-246, Miltenyi Biotec) for 40 min at 4 °C. Additionally, cells were treated with hashtag antibodies to label source samples (TotalSeqB0301-B0310, B0312 and B0314, BioLegend). After washing, cells were sorted using a CytoFLEX SRT (Beckman Coulter). Data were acquired with CytExpert software (Beckman Coulter). Post-acquisition analysis was performed using FlowJo software, version 10.9.0. Single-cell libraries were generated and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer. Sequence reads were processed and aligned to the mouse genome (mm10, GENCODE vM23/Ensembl98; https://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A.tar.gz) using CellRanger 3.0. Initially, genes expressed in <3 cells and cells with <100 genes and mitochondrial reads <6% were excluded from the analysis. Pericytes were removed from amygdalar cells based on Pdgfrb. Hashtag oligos (HTOs) were demultiplexed using HTODemux and singlet cells were used for subsequent analysis. Principal component analysis was performed on the expression data matrix using the Seurat. Thirty principal components were used for generating tSNE plots. Transcriptomic clusters were identified from a total 1,903 amygdalar astrocytes with resolution set to 0.4. Differentially expressed gene candidates from a comparison of Adrb1-positive and Adrb1-negative astrocytes were estimated using Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test.

Cryosections were prepared as described above and stored at −80 °C. RNAscope in situ hybridization was performed using RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v.2 with TSA Vivid Dyes (ACDBio, 323270), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sections were washed for 5 min with PBS, and then heated at 60 °C for 30 min before post-fix. After dehydration in an ethanol series, hydrogen peroxide was applied for 10 min at room temperature. The sections were washed with ddH2O twice, and then incubated in Target Retrieval Reagents for 5 min at 90–100 °C. A wash with ddH2O for 15 s was followed by a dehydration with 100% ethanol for 3 min and dried at room temperature. Then, the sections were incubated with Protease III for 30 min at 40 °C. The sections were washed with ddH2O twice and then incubated with probes Mm-Fos (ACDBio, 316921), Mm-Adra1a (ACDBio, 408611), Mm-Adrb1-C2 (ACDBio, 449761-C2), Mm-Igfbp2 (ACDBio, 405951) and Mm-Slc1a3-C3 (ACDBio, 430781-C3) for 2 h at 40 °C. Thereafter, the sections were washed twice with wash buffer for 2 min between incubations at 40 °C. The sections were incubated in AMP1 for 30 min, AMP2 for 30 min and AMP3 for 15 min at 40 °C, then incubated in horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 15 min, fluorophore for 30 min and HRP-blocker for 15 min at 40 °C for each channel. In the staining of mCherry, slices were washed in 0.1 M PBS 3 times for 10 min each, followed by immunohistochemistry that was performed as described above. Following primary and secondary antibodies used: rabbit anti-RFP (1:250, Rockland, 600-401-379), Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit (1:1,000, Abcam, ab175692). Finally, the sections were incubated with DAPI at room temperature, removed DAPI, and mounted in Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen, P36934). Images were obtained in the same way as immunohistochemistry described above except with a step size of 0.5 µm. Images were processed with ImageJ. Astrocyte somata were delineated using Slc1a3 signals. The intensity of Fos, Adra1a, Adrb1 and Igfbp2 signals within the somata were measured. To account for differences in somata sizes, the signals were normalized using Slc1a3. Subsequently, the normalized signals were z-scored within each sample to evaluate gene expression across a heterogeneous cell population. This approach facilitated the robust identification of cells exhibiting high gene expression relative to the population mean. In Fig. 4e,f, adrenoreceptor-positive cells were identified based on scRNA-seq data, selecting the top 50% of cells ranked by Adra1a expression and the top 20% of cells ranked by Adrb1 expression. Co-expression index of Adra1a and Adrb1, calculated by relative expression level of Adra1a to NoFC median multiplied by relative expression level of Adrb1 for each cell. In Fig. 4j, the correlation analysis of Fos and Adrb1, expression levels were evaluated using z-scores of RNAscope signal intensity to assess gene expression across a heterogeneous population of cells, enabling robust identification of cells with high gene expression relative to the population mean. Specifically, we identified astrocytes with z-scores greater than 2 in RNAscope Fos signal intensity as Fos-high astrocytes, capturing 3% of the astrocyte population with significantly elevated Fos expression, consistent with scRNA-seq data in Fig. 4c where Fos-positive astrocytes occupied 4% of the total astrocytes analysed. Similarly, Adrb1-high astrocytes were identified using z-scores greater than 0.5, capturing 26% of astrocytes, also in line with scRNA-seq data in Fig. 4c where Adrb1-positive astrocytes occupied 20% of the total astrocytes analysed. In addition, Igfbp2-high astrocytes were identified using z-scores greater than 0.5, capturing 24% of all astrocytes in Extended Data Fig. 12d,e, which is consistent with scRNA-seq data indicating that Igfbp2-positive astrocytes occupy 24% of the total astrocytes analysed.

Most statistical tests were run in Prism 10.1.2 (GraphPad). The specific tests used are indicated in the figure legends and Supplementary Table 1. All tests were two-sided unless otherwise noted. Astrocyte Fos count analyses across groups for each brain region were run with R v.4.3.2 on RStudio v.2023.12.1.402 and relied on the tidyverse, car, dunn.test and dplyr packages and base R functions aov(), TukeyHSD() and p.adjust(). The data were first analysed with Levene's test for homogeneity of variance. Brain regions that passed Levene's test (P > 0.05) were followed by a one-way ANOVA test with Tukey's honest significant difference test and regions that failed Levene's test (P < 0.05; no homogeneity of variances) were followed by the Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's post hoc test and Bonferroni adjustment. False discovery rates were calculated across groups and brain regions from post hoc P values using the Benjamini–Hochberg method.

Mice were randomly assigned to experimental groups, and mice assigned to different experimental conditions were run in parallel. Mouse experiments and analyses were done blinded to group allocation. Tissue samples that yielded insufficient cell counts (less than 30 cells) during scRNA-seq quality control were excluded from the study. The results of statistical comparisons, n numbers and P values are shown in the figure panels or figure legends along with averages. n is defined as the numbers of cells, sections or mice throughout on a case-by-case basis; the unit of analysis is stated in the text or in each figure legend. In the figures, summarized data are shown as mean ± s.e.m. with a scatter plot and P values are indicated by asterisks: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.

a, Schematics showing the Gαq GPCR signalling cascade and the blocking of which with iβARK.

We report a method for promoting electrochemical stability in garnet Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 solid-state electrolyte based on a composite two-phase oxide–oxide microstructure. Grain boundary precipitation of the controlled distribution of amorphous zirconium oxide microparticles is achieved through the addition of reactive tantalum carbide. During ambient-atmosphere sintering, the carbide decomposes through an in situ reaction, the ‘extra' Ta substituting for Zr within the Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 lattice. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations identify a thermodynamically favourable reaction path and show how substituting Ta5+ at Zr4+ sites affects the crystal structure as well as bulk ionic and electronic conductivities. Quantitative stereology highlights that zirconia also acts as a sintering aid, reducing compact porosity. Cryogenic focused-ion-beam scanning electron microscopy and fractography analysis of cycled solid-state electrolytes illustrates that near-universally observed intergranular Li-metal dendrite propagation is suppressed by the two-phase microstructure, favouring transgranular dendrites instead. Importantly, DFT demonstrates that compared with the Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 surface, the zirconium oxide surface per se is less electronically conductive and does not trap excess electrons to reduce Li ions. This is a key reason for the substantial improvement in the electrochemical properties over the single-phase baseline.

Spatial biology pursues the analysis of cells in their native microenvironment, often with regard to morphology and gene- or protein expression. The spatial analysis of lipid and metabolic profiles by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) can add another layer of molecular information. A seamless integration of MSI data with other (multimodal) methods at a single-cell level is often hampered by insufficient co-registration and resolution. Here, we introduce a MALDI-MSI based method that integrates in-source bright-field and fluorescence microscopy, allowing for a coupled (sub-)cellular investigation of the same sample in both modalities. Presented examples from cell culture and tissue analysis include the visualization of intracellular lipid distributions in macrophages during phagocytosis, and the heterogeneity of lipid profiles of tumor infiltrating neutrophils correlated to their individual microenvironments. The achieved combination of lipid profiling with morphological features and protein expression on the single-cell level constitutes a powerful method for cell biology.

Two cells in a tissue or a cell culture are never exactly identical, even if they share the same genetic heritage and microenvironment. This heterogeneity can be a consequence of differences in age, ontogeny, or tissue imprinting, resulting in alterations of morphology, gene expression, molecular composition, and ultimately function. In living systems, individual cells are part of interdependent multicellular structures, i.e., tissues, and undergo a constant exchange within local regulatory networks as part of the almost inestimable complexity that is life. Thus, to characterize the identity and state of a cell, the description should follow a holistic approach and include information from a wide range of analytical techniques1.

In recent years, single-cell RNAseq and spectral flow cytometry have emerged as valuable tools to profile cellular heterogeneity. Similarly, advances in single-cell proteomics provide information on the heterogeneity on the protein level, albeit with much lower throughput2,3. Under the umbrella of spatial biology, the emergence of spatial-omics technologies including deep visual proteomics, multiplexed immunohistochemistry and spatial RNAseq have added information on morphology and the spatial relationship of cells4,5,6,7.

A complementary addition to these techniques is the analysis by high spatial resolution mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). Importantly, this method can augment information on active transcripts and protein expression with the resulting downstream production of lipids and further metabolites, as well as glycans and peptides8. The most widely used MSI approach is based on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI). Herein, finely focused laser pulses are applied to pre-defined pixel positions on the sample surface, resulting in spatially defined mass spectra that can be processed to reveal signal intensity maps for up to hundreds of analytes differentiated based on their molecular weight. To increase signal intensity for a wide range of analyte classes, the technique can be amended with laser postionization (MALDI-2)9.

Typically, eukaryotic cells stretch over distances between 10 and 100 µm and display a wide variety in shape and form. Prominent sub-cellular structures like the nucleus or other large organelles, but also morphological features, show sizes between 3 and 10 µm. Their spatially resolved analysis, therefore, requires pixel sizes of no more than 1 × 1 µm². The current bench-mark figure on the pixel size of MALDI-MSI, however, is at about 5 × 5 µm². Less established experimental techniques dedicated to high resolving power, such as transmission-mode or inverse geometry (t-)MALDI-2-MSI and others, enables pixel sizes ≤ 1 × 1 µm² and can thus fulfill this criterion10,11,12,13,14,15,16.

Recent applications of MALDI-2 and t-MALDI-2-MSI for single-cell mass spectrometry have revealed a strong molecular heterogeneity for lipids and metabolites within clonal populations of cells and seemingly homogeneous tissue regions, demonstrating its high potential for cell biology research17,18,19,20. To contextualize these metabolic phenotypes with existing knowledge on the single-cell level, however, MALDI-MSI has to be connected to prevalent microscopy techniques conducted on the same slide. To date, the general application of this contextualization on the same slide is strongly limited by three main factors: The spatial resolving power of MALDI-MSI, precise co-registration with optical modalities, and automation of data analysis. Especially in the context of tightly packed cellular systems, such as tissue, shortcomings of the first two factors lead to erroneous or ambiguous assignment of mass spectrometric information to individual cells. To date, this restricts the analysis on the single cell level directly from tissue to laborious manual annotation of comparably low numbers of cells, while automated analysis is limited to cellular neighborhoods rather than single cells17,18,21.

To address these challenges, we here present the development of hard and software solutions on a prototype ion source coupled to an orthogonal time-of-flight (oTOF) mass analyzer. Our approach enables the generation of unambiguous cell-specific molecular and morphometric information of statistically relevant numbers of cells directly from tissue. It utilizes transmission mode for ultra-high spatial resolution and is equipped with laser postionization (MALDI-2) to increase sensitivity for the analysis of lipids and metabolites9,15,22,23. While previous implementations of t-MALDI ion sources have only hinted at the potential to utilize the employed optical components for microscopy of the sample inside the ion source15,24, we here make full use of this option by including in-source bright field (BF) as well as fluorescence microscopy (FM).

A full technical description of the optical setup and preparation protocols is presented in the methods. In short, the ion source of a Bruker timsTOF-fleX MALDI-2 was amended for t-MALDI analysis. Dedicated lighting strategies enable the use of BF as well as FM inside the ion source (Fig. 1a,b). Importantly, laser delivery and in-source microscopy share essential components of the optical beam path and for stage movement. In the xy-plane (sample surface), the site of laser ablation is therefore directly linked to a specific position on the optical microscope image. Different from other instrumentation that combines MALDI-MSI with microscopy in one instrument25,26, this design feature inherently co-registers both modalities by utilizing the same coordinate system for in-source microscopy and MALDI-MSI (Fig. 1a). Next to providing highly resolved orientation to set up imaging runs, FM-images acquired inside the ion source constitute a unique and essential link for precise co-registration to other optical modalities. In the z-direction, the inherent coupling of the focal plane of optical microscopy and laser delivery enables a fast and easy setup of experiments based on autofocusing routines.

a A schematic drawing of the t-MALDI-2 setup illustrates the general layout. The sample is illuminated homogeneously by an LED ring. Light is collected by the microscope objective and focused onto the sensor of a digital camera. The MALDI laser-beam is co-aligned using a dichroic mirror and focused onto the sample by the same objective. Ions generated by the MALDI process with optional MALDI-2 are extracted to a mass analyzer. b A horizontal cut through the schematic displays the fluorescence microscope components. Fluorescence is excited by a fiber-coupled LED and filtered by an excitation filter, a dichroic mirror and an emission filter. ((a) and (b) are renderings created by the authors in Autodesk Fusion 360.) c To enable fluorescence microscopy and t-MALDI-2-MSI on the same sample, different staining steps are performed following a brief fixation. Samples are imaged with an external slide scanning fluorescence microscope, and are then prepared for MALDI-MSI by homogeneous coating with MALDI matrix (Supplementary Fig. 5 A, B, D). To enable high fidelity co-registration of the fluorescence microscopy image, a second fluorescence image is recorded inside the ion source prior to t-MALDI-2-MSI (Supplementary Fig. 1a, d-e).

To enable FM analysis prior to MSI analysis, we have developed dedicated staining protocols optimized to omit or strongly reduce chemical alterations and spatial delocalization of the analyte content of interest. In parts these are based on protocols developed for the analysis of cell culture17,20. To control for the adverse effect of immunofluorescence (IF) staining on overall performance reported in the literature27, the speficially developed methods and pipelines were benchmarked with regard to microscopic image quality, conservation of chemical and morphological integrity, as well as mass spectrometric depth of information.

For this, we conducted combined FM and t-MALDI-2-MSI on coronal cryo-sections of fresh-frozen mouse cerebellum. This tissue exhibits histological features across different lateral scales, each presenting distinct lipid profiles. It has been intensely used as a model system across a wide range of microscopic and MSI methods28,29,30,31 and is well characterized with regard to its lipidome based on the analysis of lipid extracts32. Details on sample preparation and data acquisition are described in the methods.

To inspect and demonstrate the quality of our dedicated staining-based FM analysis on the same tissue section prior to t-MALDI-MSI analysis, we employed small molecule stains, targeting the nuclei and F-actin, as well as IF to target calbindin expressed in Purkinje cell bodies (Fig. 1c). Slide scanning FM recorded prior to matrix application in an external microscope (VS200, Evident) at 50X displays the expected structures and morphology for all three staining methods in high quality and corroborates the feasibility of the employed protocols (Fig. 2a–c).

The different layers of the brain (molecular layer, granular layer, and arbor vitae), as well as the Purkinje cells are well distinguishable. b The external FM image is overlayed with the ion signal intensity distribution of [PC(40:6) + H]+ at m/z 834.60 (gray) revealing a successful co-registration of both modalities. c The overlay of three ion signal intensities of the molecular ion of Hoechst 33342 at m/z 452.23 (cyan), [PC(38:6) + H]+ at m/z 806.57 (magenta) and [PC(40:6) + H]+ at m/z 834.60 (yellow), affirms the ability to produce images of high contrast while preserving and reproducing the biological structure of the sample.

After matrix application by resublimation, the sample was transferred into the MALDI ion source, followed by in-source slide scanning FM (50X, DAPI channel). Utilizing the FM image of the DAPI channel generated inside the ion source as an intermediate enables a straightforward co-registration of external FM images with MALDI-MSI (Supplementary Fig. 1a). In this, our approach omits the use of fiducial markers across modalities, relieving an inherent limitation of conventional methods. Difficulties in the identification of these “cross-modality” markers that need to represent the exact same spatial location in conventional methods have been described to limit the precision and spatial fidelity of co-registration of FM and MSI on a cellular or sub-cellular level, especially for large areas of interest21,33,34.

Subsequently, t-MALDI-2-MSI data at a pixel size of 1 × 1 µm² were acquired in positive ion mode. Equivalent data in the negative ion mode was recorded on a neighboring section. Facilitated by the choice of matrix and the use of MALDI-2, mass spectra in the positive mode produce more depth of information, and this ion mode was used for all further experiments (Supplementary Table 1). Overview and zoomed in regions of the resulting MS images display distinct intensity distributions demonstrated on the example of ion signals of two different phosphatidylcholines (PC) ([PC(38:6) + H]+ at m/z 806.57 and [PC(40:6) + H]+ at m/z 834.60) and the molecular ion signal of the Hoechst stain of the nuclei at m/z 452.23 (Fig. 2c).

Direct comparison of t-MALDI-2-MSI with microscopy confirms that morphological features at the different lateral scales are largely retained during the matrix application step and subsequent MSI analysis (Fig. 2b). The overlay of both modalities reveals a strong correlation with histological features of the white matter and granular layer, discernible based on the F-actin staining and the nuclei. Similarly, signal intensity distribution of PC(40:6), associated with the Purkinje cell layer35 shows good correlation with the IF-based specific staining of these structures (Fig. 2b). Overall, deviations for co-registration were found to be less than 1 µm (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c and Supplementary Note 1), corroborating the precision and fidelity of our approach.

To explore the depth of information for lipid analysis available from pre-stained t-MALDI-2-MSI, mass spectral information was matched against data from an unstained tissue section of the same brain. Overall, the staining protocol does not introduce a decrease in depth of lipid information with regard to the tentatively assigned lipids species (Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 2). While alkali metal cations of lipids dominate the spectra of the naïve tissue sections staining, washing steps that are part of the staining protocols shift the ionization towards protonation (Supplementary Fig. 2). Interestingly, only the naïve tissue produces sizeable signal intensities of phosphatidic acids. Their appearance has been associated with in-source fragmentation of alkali metal cations of other phospholipids36.

In addition, lipid information from t-MALDI-2-MSI was compared to a previously published full lipidomics profile for murine cerebellum derived from bulk32. This analysis reveals that ~82% of the reported molecular lipid content of cerebellum is detected in the t-MALDI-2 measurement (Supplementary Note 2). This amounts to 66 annotated ion species that produce contrast-rich intensity distributions in t-MALDI-2-MSI in positive and/or negative ion mode measurements (Supplementary Table 1). Comparison of the detected signal intensities with the molar content of the different lipoforms of each of the detected lipid classes shows a good agreement with the literature32 (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Note 2). Notably, this includes lipid classes, such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS) that have been described to be affected if more extensive chemical fixation is used during sample preparation37, corroborating the aptitude of our speficially developed protocols.

To demonstrate the potential of histology guided t-MALDI-2-MSI for the analysis of sub-cellular structures, we investigated THP-1-derived macrophages. Cells were cultured and differentiated directly in chamber slides. Freshly differentiated cells were incubated with pHrodo red E. coli bioparticles for 2 h. Upon phagocytosis, these particles become fluorescent and pinpoint acidified phagolysosomes inside the cells. For analysis, cells were briefly fixed and their actin filament and nuclei stained following MALDI compatible protocols previously reported17.

Slide scanning FM on an external slide scanner prior to coating with MALDI matrix reveals heterogeneously pronounced phagocytosis with some cells showing a large number of internalized bioparticles (Fig. 3a).

a Fluorescence image of THP-1 derived macrophages recorded before MALDI matrix application with a slide scanning microscope using Hoechst 33342 (nuclei, DAPI channel, blue), CellMask Green Actin Tracking Stain (actin, FITC channel, green) and pHrodo (phagolysosomes, Cy3 channel, red). b An overlay of three different ion signal intensity distributions measured using t-MALDI-2-MSI with 1.5 × 1.5 µm² pixel size in positive ion mode of the molecular ion of Hoechst 33342 (m/z 452.23, blue), [PE(33:1) + H]+ (m/z 704.52, red) and [PC(34:1) + H]+ (m/z 760.58, green) reveals a strong cell-to-cell heterogeneity. c and d Zoom in from (a) and (b), marked in each as a blue and red square, respectively, demonstrates intracellular differences in lipid distribution. To investigate the intracellular molecular distributions related to phagocytosis, masks for the regions with pHrodo+ (red) and remaining cell (green) are created based on the FM image. The outlines of the masks identified by the pHrodo stain are overlayed with the MSI results to demonstrate the quality of co-registration.

After coating with MALDI matrix using resublimation, in-source FM (50X) and t-MALDI-2-MSI data at 1.5 × 1.5 µm² pixel size in positive ion mode were collected for a few hundred cells (Fig. 3b). Image co-registration between the externally generated FM image and MSI data was performed by using the in-source FM data as an intermediate (Supplementary Fig. 1d). The overlay of both modalities corroborates a high-fidelity co-registration on the level of the employed MALDI pixel size. Areas visualized by the pHrodo red stain in FM accurately co-align with the distribution of specific lipid signal intensities in MSI, revealing little to no leakage or diffusion of lipid content or other preparation artifacts that may compromise (sub-)cellular integrity (Fig. 3c,d)22.

To investigate the molecular distributions specifically related to phagolysosomes, we used subcellular spatial information provided by the fluorescence signal produced by the uptake of pHrodo bioparticles. Utilizing the high-fidelity co-registration, we overlayed this histological information to t-MALDI-2-MSI data and identified those pixels that correlate with phagolysosomes to generate phagolysosome-specific mass spectra. (Fig. 3c,d). Lipid annotation was based on previously published results for THP-1 derived macrophages and E. coli, respectively20,38.

Comparative analysis of the resulting phagolysosome-specific molecular information revealed an increase of signal intensity for numerous lipid species (Fig. 4). Confirmed by the respective MS images, lipids, such as PE(33:1) and PE(34:2) spatially correlate with the phagolysosomes identified by fluorescence (Fig. 3c,d). Both PE species are abundantly expressed in the membrane of E. coli cells38. Notably, PE(33:1) is not detected in non-phagocytosing THP-1 cells at all (Fig. 3b–d, red trace). Its presence, confirmed by additional on-cell MS/MS experiments (described in Methods), provides a direct link to the phagocytized pathogen material and corroborates the highly accurate co-registration of both modalities.

Comparative analysis of the resulting region-specific mass spectral data from masks as shown in Fig. 3c,d reveal an increase of signal intensity for a number of lipid species inside the pHrodo+ regions. Signals with a log2 fold change above 2.8 are marked in red. Identified m/z-values are denoted in a table with tentative assignments, where applicable.

Other tentatively assigned lipid species linked to the phagolysosomes can be attributed to degradation of E. coli-derived phospholipids during phagocytosis39,40. These degradation products are most likely the result of enzymatic activity and reactions with reactive oxygen species inside the phagolysosomes. They include lipid metabolites, such as the diacylglycerol DG(33:1), which can be directly linked to the enzymatic cleavage of PE(33:1) and lipid species tentatively identified as lysophosphatidylglycerols (LPG). The latter can be linked to the enzymatic breakdown of phosphatidylglycerols (PG) and cardiolipins (CL) both highly expressed in the membrane of E.coli 38,40 (Fig. 4).

In a second exemplary study, we applied our methods to the single-cell molecular analysis of tumor tissue. This tissue type typically contains a large number of different cell types in a wide range of states, translating to a wide variety of metabolic microenvironments (tumor microenvironment (TME)) of different size and shape and a highly heterogeneous lipid profile across the tissue41.

The employed 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma model is highly malignant with locally aggressive growth and exhibits metastasis to regional lymph nodes and distant organs, particularly lung, liver, and bone42,43. It has diverse inflammatory TMEs with a large number of infiltrating immune cells, such as T-cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells present44,45. The site and cell-specific molecular profile of these immune cells is of great importance for their fate and function and is believed to be in constant interdependence with their microenvironment46. Consequently, the investigation of this crosstalk not only requires a molecular analysis at the cellular level but also an assessment of the immediate vicinity.

For analysis, a heterogeneous area of interest that includes a broad range of TMEs was selected based on H&E staining and histological annotation (Fig. 5a). A consecutive section was prepared using MALDI-compatible staining that targets cell nuclei, F-actin, and three IF stains that selectively target immune cells, (CD45), neutrophils (Ly6G), and T3 neutrophils (DcTRAIL-R1)46,47. All channels were recorded on the complete section using external slide scanning FM at 50X before matrix application (Fig. 5b). Co-registration with t-MALDI-2-MSI was based on the DAPI channel recorded inside the ion source after matrix application as an intermediate (Supplementary Fig. 1e). After microscopy, t-MALDI-2-MSI data was recorded in positive ion mode in seven separate measurements across the region of interest at a pixel size of 1 × 1 µm² resulting in a total of approx. 7 Mpixels. For data analysis, we selected 63 molecular ion species annotated to individual lipid species based on exact mass ( < 3 ppm) (see Supplementary Fig. 4 for selected images and Supplementary Table 3).

Zooms show cell masks overlaid with FM and MSI. For MSI ion signal intensity of [PC(O 32:0) + H]+ at m/z 720.59 selected exemplarily.

Spatial distribution for a number of glycero- and glycerophospholipids such as [PC(34:1) + H]+ at m/z 760.58 reveal a sizeable heterogeneity across the tumor sample (Fig. 5c, Supplementary Fig. 4). Signal intensity of the ether lipid [PC(O-32:0) + H]+, detected at m/z 720.59, correlates with the neutrophil-specific Ly6G-stain (Fig. 5d–f). This is consistent with a significant overexpression of this lipid species in mouse neutrophils reported previously48,49.

Other specific signal intensity distributions also directly correlate with structures visible in the microscopy data. As expected50, signal intensity for triacylglycerides (TG) such as [TG(52:5) + H]+ correlates with the adipose tissue (Fig. 5c). Acylcarnitine, detected at m/z 428.38 as [ACAR(18:0) + H]+ is an important intermediate in lipid metabolism and a reported marker for hypoxia51. Its signal intensity distribution correlates with the detection of tumor-associated T3 neutrophils identified by the DcTRAIL-R1 staining that have been described to be found in hypoxic areas46,47 (Fig. 5e). Heme B, detected at m/z 616.18, is directly associated with erythrocytes and, hence, serves as marker for hemorrhage or blood vessels52 (Fig. 5f).

While general assignment of lipid profiles to TMEs has been reported previously, the approach described here allows for the analysis of single cells within their tissue environment in statistically relevant numbers. For this we adapted our previously reported workflow for the analysis of single cells in culture to the analysis of tissue sections17,20. Robust and reliable cell segmentation, necessary for automated analysis21, was provided based on the external FM images using Mesmer by DeepCell (Fig. 5g)53. This resulted in segmentation masks for each cell and enabled the calculation of a variety of morphometric parameters using CellProfiler54.

To produce single-cell mass spectra, cell segmentation masks were projected on the t-MALDI-2-MSI data, again taking advantage of the inherent link between in-source FM and the acquired MSI data (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Of note, already small inaccuracies of the co-registration on the order of a few micrometer as well as increased pixel size can lead to larger ambiguities in the assignment of MS data to specific single cells17,21. An overlay of the projected masks with the lipid neutrophil marker [PC(O-32:0) + H]+ and comparison to the specific Ly6G staining demonstrates the high-fidelity co-registration and corroborates the ability of our combined method to deduce single-cell mass spectra (Fig. 5g).

Single-cell molecular data is generated for all 63 annotated lipid species by summing the respective signal intensities over all pixels allocated to a specific cell using the respective mask. Subsequently, all values are normalized to the sum of all signal intensities for the respective cell.

Cell segmentation and subsequent data analysis resulted in combined morphometric and molecular data for 63,408 individual cells. Notably, this analysis retains the histological context of all cells and includes parameters describing location within the tissue and fluorescence intensity for all employed channels. This enables the identification of CD45+, Ly6G+, and DcTRAIL-R1+ cells based on intensity thresholding for each specific channel. For visualization, this information can be projected onto the segmentation canvas, thereby identifying the location and local density of different sub-groups of immune cells in the tissue section (Fig. 6a).

a Cell masks colored corresponding to their FM-based classification are projected onto their original position of the t-MALDI-2-MSI measurement region. Ly6G+ cells are depicted in red, CD45+ cells in yellow, and DcTRAIL-R1+ cells in cyan. All other cells are marked in dark gray. b The 59,998 Ly6G- cells were separated into eight different clusters (tissue microenvironments) using k-means clustering on the standardized single-cell MS data. Cell masks for Ly6G- cells are colored according to their cluster and projected onto their original position of the t-MALDI-2-MSI measurement region. All other cells are marked in dark gray. c 3410 Ly6G+ cells were identified based on FM and selected for analysis. They are plotted in a UMAP based on a list of 63 annotated ion signals. Each dot represents an individual cell, while the distance between dots visualizes the similarity of the standardized lipid profiles of the cells. Using DBSCAN, the UMAP reveals eight clearly discernable clusters (neutrophil subtypes) which are color coded. d Cell masks for Ly6G+ cells are projected onto their original position of the t-MALDI-2-MSI measurement region. All other cells are marked dark gray. The colors of cell masks correlates with the clusters found in (c). e Zoom-in of the region annotated with lymphocyte accumulation (red squares in a, b, and d). f Zoom-in of the region annotated with intratumoral hemorrhage (blue squares in a, b, and d).

Processing of the combined IF and MSI single-cell data enabled spatial biology analysis on the level of lipids and metabolites, by classifying cells based on molecular similarity. In this context, analysis on the single-cell basis is especially important for scarce or isolated cells like specific immune cells because their molecular profile may substantially differ from the surrounding TME. This type of analysis is demonstrated on the example of infiltrating neutrophils inside the 4T1 tumor section.

To classify neutrophils based on their molecular profile independent of their microenvironment and vice versa, single-cell data were split into two groups based on Ly6G staining. The resulting subgroups contained 3410 Ly6G+ neutrophils and 59,998 Ly6G- cells, respectively. Both groups were independently analyzed using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and appropriate clustering algorithms.

To identify molecularly similar cell types within the tissue, all Ly6G- cells were subjected to k-means clustering, resulting in eight discernible clusters. By assigning a specific color to each cluster, the outlines of each cell can be filled in with the respective color and projected back onto their original location (Fig. 6b).

The resulting map of classified cells displays clearly discernible tissue micro-environments where molecularly similar cells cluster in specific areas of the tissue. Clusters IV, V, and VIII contain cells of the skin, the adipose tissue, and the wider tumor periphery, respectively. Inside the viable tumor tissue, a clear separation into TMEs reveals a layer-like structure with frayed edges (clusters II, III, and VI). Cluster VII contains cells directly adjacent to the tumor edges and away from the adipose tissue, but also cells inside the tumor close to its necrotic core. Cluster I contains cells allocated to hypoxic regions of the tumor.

The direct connection to the morphometric data allows to characterize each cluster with regard to immune infiltration. Figure 7, summarizes the total amount of cells as well as the numbers of CD45+, Ly6G+, and DcTRAIL-R1+ cells that are found within the boundaries of the respective cluster.

Data matrix tabulating the number of neutrophil subtypes found in each tissue region. For each subtype, the percentage of DcTRAIL-R1+ cells is calculated. In a neighborhood analysis for all neutrophils, the mean number of cells categorized as CD45+ cells, Ly6G+ cells and DcTRAIL-R1+ cells found in a 15 µm radius are presented. Additionally, for each microenvironment, the total number of contained cells, CD45+, Ly6G+ and DcTRAIL-R1+ is noted.

Next to TMEs, we investigated the molecular heterogeneity of neutrophils. For this, the Ly6G+ cells were analyzed using a UMAP and classified using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) (Fig. 6c). This results in a clear separation of eight clusters. To provide linguistic distinction from clusters described for the tissue microenvironments, results for neutrophils will be referred to as subtypes. Colored respectively and projected onto the cell map, these different subtypes can be found in distinct areas of the tumor (Fig. 6d).

Apparent from the comparison of the images depicted in Fig. 6, some subtypes show a clear spatial correlation with a specific microenvironment and histological features (Fig. 7, Supplementary Fig. 5a). Subtype 6 is almost exclusively located in the skin. Neutrophils are found in skin in comparably high number and have important and specific barrier functions55. Our data suggests a significantly altered lipid profile for these neutrophils. For example, in contrast to all other subtypes, subtype 6 shows a low expression of PC(O-32:0) (Supplementary Fig. 5b,c).

Neutrophils of subtypes 5 and 7 are located in specific tissue microenvironments that correlate with the adipose tissue (clusters IV and V) in the periphery of the tumor. Their lipid profiles show an increase of TG and DG lipid species (Fig. 8). Subtype 4 is predominantly found in non-adipose tissue close to the tumor (cluster VII). Similarly, subtype 2 also populates this peripheral region but is additionally found inside the tumor close to its necrotic core. Lipid profiles for both subtypes are low in DG and TG. While their overall cell density in this area is relatively high, they do not form agglomerates.

A heat map of standardized intensities of 63 ion species for the eight neutrophil subtypes visualizes differences in lipid profiles.

Interestingly, neutrophils in this periphery of the tumor show strong molecular similarities to their respective microenvironment (Supplementary Fig. 5c). This may be explained by an uptake of extracellular vesicles or cell debris produced by the surrounding tissue and “recycling” of the lipid content by the neutrophils. Notably, the expression of lipid species that require specific enzymatic machinery for their synthesis such as PC ether lipids (PC-O) do not show similarities to the surrounding tissue but are upregulated only in the respective neutrophil populations (Supplementary Fig. 5c). The exclusive co-localization of these ion species to Ly6G+-cells also precludes the involvement of measurement artefacts, such as analyte diffusion into this convergence of lipid profiles between neutrophils and their respective TME (Fig. 5).

With the exception of subtype 4, all neutrophils found in the tumor periphery and the adipose tissue show a relatively high density of immune cells in their direct vicinity (Fig. 6a). This observation is corroborated by a neighborhood analysis that counts the average number of immune cells within a distance of 15 µm to the cell edge of each individual neutrophil (Fig. 7).

Inside the tumor, neutrophils of the subtype 1 are found mostly in the viable tumor tissue (clusters II, III, and V) (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 5a). Notably, their lipid profile shows little similarity to their respective surrounding TMEs (Supplementary Fig. 5c). This may indicate a decreased up-take and turnover of lipids or a reduced residence time within the tumor tissue. While the overall density of subtype 1 neutrophils in the tumor increases towards the adjacent adipose tissue, they are mostly isolated with relatively few other immune cells around them (Fig. 7).

In contrast, neutrophils of subtypes 3 and 8 form strong agglomerations (Fig. 6e). These subtypes are located within TME I with subtype 8 being confined to the center of the region. Their neighborhood analysis results in high numbers of overall immune cells in their direct vicinity (Fig. 7). About 90% of subtype 8 neutrophils are identified as DcTRAIL+. The lipid profile of this subtype strongly differs from that of the surrounding hypoxic TME I (Supplementary Fig. 5c). It presents an increased signal for ACAR 18:0 and an increase in signal intensities for lipid metabolites, such as LPCs (Fig. 8) and DGs, while TGs are mostly absent. This may indicate an upregulation of specific lipid metabolism in this subtype.

Similar to subtype 8, neutrophils of the subtype 3 are almost exclusively found in agglomerates inside TME I but are located further away from its center. In contrast to subtype 8, however, only 17% are DcTRAIL-R1+. The lipid profile of subtype 3 also contains high signal intensities for ACAR 18:0 but reduced levels of LPC and DG. Again, in contrast to subtype 8, the lipid profile of subtype 3 neutrophils shows great similarities to its surrounding TME I. This increased molecular crosstalk may indicate a longer residence time of neutrophils within this hypoxic TME as opposed to the viable TMEs II, III, and VI.

In its own right, MSI analysis can provide specific molecular information of single cells, thereby delivering an important puzzle piece towards the understanding of individual cellular behavior. For a more holistic approach, however, the resulting lipidomic or metabolomic information has to be put into the context of the cell type, differentiation status, and state, but also has to regard its current tissue macro- and microenvironment¹. Here, a tight connection to optical microscopy analysis has long since been identified as a key feature in the integration of MALDI-MSI into the “biomedical toolbox”56,57. In this context, high-quality microscopy analysis, including IF, is typically carried out on adjacent tissue sections, introducing well-known challenges in the accuracy of co-registration. Because of their small size in the range of section thickness, this particularly limits the analysis of specifically targeted single cells33,56,58,59. For the microscopic analysis of the same section, staining-based microscopy is conventionally carried out after MALDI-MSI. While impressive progress has been reported very recently in this field, damage or distortion of the tissue introduced during the measurement and the removal of the matrix can impede accurate co-registration on the cellular level, especially for large areas of interest. In addition, cross-reactions with the matrix and laser irradiation that precedes microscopy, can impede binding properties for antibody based analysis12,60,61,62,63. Successful microscopy of the same sample prior to MALDI-MSI has largely been restricted to the limited analytical capabilities offered by unstained tissue, e.g. by autofluorescence or phase-contrast microscopy27,33,64,65. Alternatively, other non-destructive optical methods, such as IR-imaging and micro-Raman imaging, have been employed prior to MSI analysis but have not been utilized for automated cell segmentation66,67.

Exceeding these current limitations, the technique presented here includes slide scanning microscopy outside and inside the ion source of the same sample recorded prior to ultra-high resolving power t-MALDI-2-MSI without compromising performance in either modality. Of note this includes the successful implementation of pre-MALDI IF analysis.

Dedicated staining techniques allow for a robust and automated cell segmentation and retain the full spectral information in MSI. Uniquely, the high fidelity co-registration of both modalities for a large field of view facilitated by in-source FM that omits the need of “cross-modality” fiducial markers, allows for the automated generation of single-cell mass spectra from tissue in large numbers. While previous efforts that relied on manual steps in co-registration and definition of cellular ROIs21,68, this automation lays the groundwork for the reliable and large-scale, generation of information-rich highly resolved data for both modalities on the same tissue sample.

Two exploratory studies highlight the advantages of the described method for the molecular analysis with cellular and even sub-cellular resolution. Using the phagocytosis of E. coli bioparticles by macrophages as an example, we demonstrate how the technique can be used to investigate metabolic processes inside sub-cellular compartments like the phagolysosomes. Assignment of bacterial PE 33:1 and PE 34:2 confirmed the uptake of E.coli bioparticles. The additional identification of increased amounts of the respective DG species suggests their partial degradation. In addition, the tentative identification of several LPG species provides further useful leads to the metabolic breakdown of E. coli derived CL and PG by enzymatic degradation and/or oxidation of lipids inside the phagolysosome69.

Overall, this study illustrates a dedicated approach to analyzing molecular profiles of subcellular compartments. In future applications, this largely untargeted technique may be used to investigate and monitor metabolic turnover on the organelle level of specific single cells.

In our study of the 4T1 tumor model, we demonstrate spatial biology analysis on the lipid level for highly heterogeneous tissue. While previous work on single-cell MSI from tissue sections has been limited by comparatively large pixel size and by the manual annotation of small numbers of cells17,18,19,70, automated segmentation based on slide scanning (immuno-)FM resulted in the identification of more than 63 K cells and allowed for the identification and classification of common immune cells (CD45+, ~ 23.7 K cells; 38% of all cells), relatively rare neutrophils (Ly6G+, ~ 3.4 K cells; 5.4%), and very rare tumor associated T3-neutrophils (DcTRAIL-R1+, 276 cells; 0.4%) within the tissue. Importantly, the segmentation, in combination with highly accurate co-registration of the microscopy with t-MALDI-2-MSI results, allowed for the generation of single-cell mass spectra for each cell.

Using statistical analysis, cells were clustered based on their lipid profile, revealing eight distinct tissue microenvironments inside the tumor and around its periphery. Likewise, an independent clustering of just the Ly6G+ cells revealed eight subtypes of neutrophils inside the investigated tissue region. Comparison of lipid profiles between neutrophils and their direct tissue environment revealed striking similarities in some cases. These results allow for a new perspective on the uptake and recycling of lipids by specific neutrophil subtypes. They also reveal distinctive differences between neutrophils and their direct environment, such as the increased levels of ether lipid species, also described in the literature49. In addition to a general upregulation of these lipid species, we are able to identify subtype and TME-specific differences in their expression. Neighborhood analysis of all investigated immune cells in the direct vicinity of the neutrophils provides a first hint at their swarming behavior. While some of the subtypes represent relatively isolated cells, others are found in agglomeration with neutrophils and other immune cells.

The strength of the molecular investigation at the cellular level becomes especially apparent in the examination of the hypoxic regions of the tumor. This TME shows a signal intensity increase for ACAR 18:0, as well as a high density of immune cells, both described as markers for hypoxia51. The inner core of this TME is populated by densely packed T3-neutrophils (most of them of subtype 8), concurring with the literature46,47. A second group of agglomerated mostly DcTRAIL-R1- neutrophils (subtype 3) is also located inside the same hypoxic area but further away from its center. The subtyping now enables an in-depth analysis of underlying lipid profiles and integration with the state of research. While both subtypes, for example, express increased levels of ACAR 18:0, only subtype 8 (mainly DcTRAIL-R1+ cells) shows increased levels of fully saturated LPCs. These mediator are known to be important in metastasis formation and in the recruitment of phagocytes during apoptosis71,72 and our data points to a previously unknown tentative connection with T3-neutrophils.

While a full investigation of the underlying biological mechanisms is not within the focus of this publication, the presented proof-of-concept studies showcase the great potential of the technique. The seamless integration of morphometric data with (sub-)cellular lipid and possibly metabolite analysis significantly expands the informational space available for each individual cell inside the tissue. Exceeding the current state-of-the art that is largely limited to the analysis of cellular neighborhoods, our approach enables a direct in situ contextualization of single individual cells with their direct tissue microenvironment on the combined molecular and morphometric level.

The presented techniques introduces a versatile set of tools for an improved integration of single-cell MSI into existing workflows. Embedded within a full suite of spatial biology methods, in future applications, it will allow for the combination of IF-based information that may describe the regulation of specific genes and the expression of individual proteins with the expression of lipids and possibly also metabolites in the same cell and its direct surrounding73. This addition of “spatial biology of lipids and metabolites” on the single-cell level provides an important additional layer of information to complete pathway analysis from the transcript and proteome level down to the regulation of the molecular products. It can be a valuable asset to review and validate downstream effects of genetic or transcriptomic variation, as well as protein inhibition, but also help to investigate regulatory functions of small molecules on gene and protein expression. Future developments in t-MALDI-MSI will need to focus on further increasing the sensitivity and analytical depth of the method. E.g., innovative approaches to sample preparation combined with plasma-based ionization approaches, as described by Young et al. in the same issue of this journal, can help to increase sensitivity and assist in the analysis of additional classes of metabolites74.

Overall, the methods described here have great potential to help untangle the influence of endogenous and exogenous factors such as immune cell infiltration, infection, or drug delivery on cellular behavior in a specially resolved manner. They are, however, by no means limited to these applications but can be applied to decipher open biological questions in a wide range of tissues and cell types.

THP-1 ACC-16 cells (DSMZ) were cultured in T25 cell culture flasks at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 Medium (Lonza), which was supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. About 10,000 cells per chamber were sown in Millicell EZ Slide 8-well chamber slides (Sigma-Aldrich). Differentiation to M0 macrophages was induced by exposure to 20 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h followed by a 3-day rest phase in PMA-free medium. Two hours before harvest, pHrodo™ Red E. coli BioParticles (Thermo Fisher) were added to the culture medium resulting in a concentration of 95 µg/mL. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed for 5 min using 4% formaldehyde (low-methanol, Roth). F-Actin and nuclei were stained according to a protocol described by Bien et al. using 1X CellMask Green Actin Tracking Stain (Thermo Fisher) diluted in PBS for 30 min and 1 µg/mL Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in PBS for 5 min17. Cells were washed with PBS after every staining step. After staining, cells were washed using 150 mM ammonium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) and dried at room temperature for 2 h.

All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with local animal welfare guidelines approved by the responsible authorities (North Rhine-Westphalia State Agency for Nature, Environment and Consumer Protection, LANUV, Protocol No. 81-02.04.2018.A010). Female BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories) were used at the age of 8–12 weeks. Mice were housed under a 12 h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. For tumor implantation, 106 4T1 cells were resuspended in 25 µl of DMEM cell culture medium (Thermo Fisher) and then injected orthotopically into the lower left mammary fat pad of the mice. Tumors were allowed to grow for 9 days and tumor size was monitored daily with a digital caliper. The local ethics committee approved a maximum tumor diameter of 8 mm. This limit was strictly adhered to and not exceeded in all experiments conducted within this study. On day 9 after tumor implantation, the animals were sacrificed. Brain tissue was harvested from untreated mice used as the control group for the mentioned study.

Mouse brain and tumor tissue were embedded in Epredia M-1 Embedding Matrix (Thermo Fisher) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. 10 µm (cerebellum) or 8 µm (tumor) thick tissue sections were produced with a cryostat (CM 3050 S, Leica Biosystems) at −20 °C. Sections were thaw-mounted onto SuperFrost glass slides (Thermo Fisher) for H&E-staining or IntelliSlides (Bruker) for t-MALDI-2 MSI measurements. Samples for t-MALDI-2 MSI were vacuum-sealed and stored at −80 °C before further use.

Frozen tissue sections were slowly brought to room temperature in the vacuum-sealed package. After opening the seal, sections were further dried under a gentle nitrogen stream for 10 min. For unstained control tissue the section was directly transferred to the sublimation chamber. For staining, a contour was drawn around each section using a Super PAP Pen (Science Services), followed by another 10 min drying under a gentle nitrogen stream, to create a hydrophobic barrier and thus enabling pipetting aqueous solutions on and off the sample. The following washing, fixation, and staining steps were all performed by pipetting ~100 µl of the accordant solution onto the sample and removing it after the specified time. Slides with tissue sections were placed on a metal plate standing in ice water. Samples were quickly fixed in 4 % formaldehyde (low-methanol, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 5 min and subsequently washed with PBS for 30 s. After tissue fixation, the primary antibody, Ly6G (ab307167, Abcam), DcTRAIL-R1 (130-110-873, Miltenyi Biotec), CD45 (130-110-798, Miltenyi Biotec) or Anti-Calbindin (ab229915, Abcam), diluted 1:500 (v/v) in 1% BSA (Serva) in PBS was applied to the sample and incubated for 60 min. The sample was then washed three times for 30 s in PBS. In case of a dual antibody staining, the secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 594 (ab307167, Abcam), diluted 1:1000 (v/v) in 1% BSA in PBS was applied and incubated for 60 min, followed by three times 30 s washing steps in PBS. 5 µg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1X CellMask Green Actin Tracking Stain (Thermo Fisher) diluted in PBS were applied and incubated for 5 min. After staining, the slide was lifted from the metal plate and parts of the hydrophobic barrier were removed at the bottom of the slide with a pipette tip. Samples were then washed with 2 ml of ammonium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) each, by letting it flow carefully over the section. For final drying, samples were placed under a gentle N2 stream for 20 min.

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains of tissue sections were performed on untreated consecutive sections directly after sectioning. Sections were stained for 30 s with hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich) with subsequent bluing in tap water for 2 min. Afterwards, the tissue was stained for 30 s with eosin (Sigma-Aldrich) and then rinsed with water.

Fluorescence images of cell cultures and tissue sections were recorded at 50X using the DAPI, FITC, TxRed, Cy3, and Cy5 channels of a slide scanning microscope (VS200, Evident) equipped with a SpectraSplit 7 filterset (Kromnigon). For each channel individually, the exposure time was set by performing the auto exposure procedure of the microscope on a region with high signal intensity for the respective fluorophore. This procedure was conducted prior to the imaging run, and the entire slide was subsequently imaged with a constant exposure time, with a maximum exposure of 500 ms. H&E-stained tissues were recorded at 20X in BF mode. Image processing was performed with OlyVIA (Evident). Channel histograms were linearly adjusted for display. Channels are shown with linear LUTs (red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow). For further information please refer to the light microscopy reporting table (Supplementary Table 5).

A schematic of the optical set-up used for material ejection for the t-MALDI-2-MSI analysis and in-source brightfield and FM image generation is depicted in Fig. 1a-c of the main article. The sample is mounted on a three-axis piezo stage (SmarAct) and is illuminated homogeneously by 15 green LEDs (LED528EHP, Thorlabs) mounted on top of a 50X objective (M Plan Apo NUV HR 50X, Mitutoyo) with a custom-designed 3D printed LED ring. Light from the sample is collected by the objective and focused by a tube lens (TTL100-A, Thorlabs) onto the sensor of a digital camera (XCG-CG160, Sony). A simple top-view observation of the sample is in addition possible by the pre-installed camera of the prototype timsTOF fleX MALDI-2 mass spectrometer.

The beam path of the MALDI laser (smartbeam, wavelength 355 nm, pulse duration 7 ns) of the timsTOF fleX MALDI-2 mass spectrometer is re-routed and condensed through a 6:1 telescope optic and co-aligned to the microscopy path with a dichroic mirror (L-07246, Laseroptik Garbsen). For recording FM images, a filter cube (DFM2/M, Thorlabs) with a filter set (DFM2T1, Thorlabs) for the suitable fluorescence channel (MDF-BFP, DAPI; MDF-FITC, FITC; MDF-MCHC, mCherry; all Thorlabs) consisting of excitation and emission filters and a dichroic mirror is mounted in front of the tube lens. In fluorescence mode, the LED ring is turned off and fluorescence is excited by the respective fiber-coupled LED (M385FP1, DAPI; M455F3, FITC; MINTF4, mCherry; all Thorlabs) mounted with a collimating optic directly to the filter cube. The camera is integrated into the software by using the XC-SDK 2018 (Sony). The trigger signal for image acquisition of the camera and fluorescence excitation is provided as a “position reached” event by the controller of the piezo stage and is handled by a digital delay pulse generator (9200 Sapphire Series, Quantum Composers). With this pulse generator, the fluorescence excitation time was set from 10 ms to 2 s per image depending on the sample and fluorescence channel.

To achieve a reproducible and homogeneous coating of the sample slides with MALDI-matrix, a custom-designed resublimation chamber was developed. A schematic of this setup is shown in Supplementary Fig. 6a, b. Under atmospheric pressure conditions, the hot-side is preheated to 80 °C and 0.5 ml of 10 mg/ml CHCA MALDI-matrix (Sigma-Aldrich) in acetone solution is pipetted into the matrix-reservoir. With the acetone evaporating rapidly, the MALDI-matrix is left forming a uniform layer on the bottom of the matrix reservoir. The sample is then clamped onto the cold-side at room temperature and the whole device is sealed and evacuated. After reaching a final pressure of 10-2 mbar, the cold-side is first cooled to -18 °C, then the hot side is heated to 150 °C to start the sublimation and resublimation. After 60 min, the heating of the hot-side is turned off and the cold-side is heated to room temperature before venting the system to prevent condensation of ambient humidity on the sample. The sample is then put onto a room temperature metal block in a saturated atmosphere of 0.5% ethanol in water at 70 °C for 1.5 min for recrystallization. To demonstrate differences in contrast for in-source BF microscopy induced by the choice of matrix, cerebellum samples were coated with DHB and HABA MALDI-matrix (both Sigma-Aldrich) using the same settings as described above for CHCA (Supplementary Fig. 6c).

The MALDI laser and microscope camera utilize the same objective for focusing and observation in the transmission-MALDI setup employed in this work. A schematic of the setup is depicted in Fig. 1a in the main article. The focal plane of the MALDI-laser is adjusted to match that of the camera by fine adjusting the second telescope lens of the laser beam path. After aligning the focal planes, all optics are kept at a constant position. The objective (M Plan Apo NUV HR 50X, Mitutoyo) has a small focal depth of 1.4 µm and samples have to be in focus during optical microscopy and MALDI-MSI. This can be achieved by methodically adjusting the z-position of the sample with regard to the objective while recording sequential optical microscope images at z-increments of 1 µm. For each of these images a Laplacian filter is applied and the variance of the result is calculated, which serves as a measure of image sharpness. The stage is then moved to the z-position corresponding the maximum sharpness image and a fine-scan with 0.1 µm z-distance is performed in the range of +/- 1 µm in the same way as before to find the z-position of highest sharpness at a submicron precision. Since the focal planes of the optical microscope and the MALDI laser are aligned, this optical focusing ensures an optimal focus of the MALDI-laser on the sample. This autofocus routine can be executed both BF and FM mode. The Python code of this program AutoFocusClass.py is provided in Data S1 in the supplementary information.

The scale factor to convert pixel on the camera sensor to position of the stage was calculated by using a 1951 USAF Resolution Test Target (Thorlabs). For selection of a region of interest (ROI) for an optical microscope scan in the ion source, autofocusing points are placed manually on the sample. The ROI is defined as the smallest enveloping rectangle that contains all points. The stage is then moved to each of the autofocusing points and an autofocus routine as described in “Autofocus of optics” is performed, which yields the focal z-offset of that xy-coordinate. Using a radial basis function interpolation, the z-offset is calculated for every coordinate in a 10 x 10 µm mesh inside the ROI and saved to a z-interpolation file. After creating the z-interpolation, the optical microscope image of the ROI is taken. For this an up to 100 µm x 100 µm wide x/y-position mesh is created in the ROI. An optical microscope image is then taken at each mesh point at the z-offset of the closest point to the xy-position from the z-interpolation file. To create a complete image of the ROI, an empty canvas of the correspondent size is created. Using the scale factor of the setup, images are cropped from the edges to a size of 100 x 100 µm and are placed onto the empty canvas using the center coordinates from the xy-position mesh. After creating a z-interpolation file for a ROI once, multiple modalities, such as brightfield or different fluorescence channels can be recorded without creating a new interpolation. ImageJ was used to create overlay images of different modalities. The Python code of this workflow can be found in the files RecordPositions.py, ZforRecordPositions.py, Scanning.py and stitching.py in Data S1 in the supplementary information.

All experiments were carried out in positive ion mode with the exception of one measurement from a brain tissue section. The MALDI-MSI run is set up partly using the proprietary flexImaging software (Bruker). Instead of using an external scan of the sample and teaching that to the stage coordinate system, the (multimodal) image of the ROI (see “In-source microscopy workflow”) is used. In the classic flexImaging workflow, three teaching points would be manually selected on the optical image. The corresponding stage coordinates would then be recorded by driving the sample-stage manually to the respective positions. Since center coordinates and pixel positions on the ROI image are already established from recording the ROI image, three x/y-positions from the 100 x 100 µm mesh (top left, bottom left, bottom right) and their corresponding stage coordinates are automatically deployed as teaching points. With these points, the setup file for the t-MALDI-2 MSI run can be automatically created, defeating any positioning errors introduced by manually selecting teaching points in the classic workflow. When the MALDI-laser is not directed at the exact middle pixel of the in-source optical microscope, fine adjustments of a few pixels offset can be applied at this stage. The automatically created setup file for the t-MALDI-2 MSI run can be opened directly in flexImaging to create measurement regions, select settings like pixel size, and laser shots per pixel. The previously acquired z-interpolation is recognized by timsControl software during t-MALDI-2 MSI measurements by providing the interpolation mesh as a geometry file. The Python code for creating the flexImaging setup files can be found in Createmis.py Data S1 in the supplementary information. All t-MALDI-2 MSI experiments were performed with 25 laser shots per pixel and a pixel size of 1 × 1 µm2 for the cerebellum and tumor sample and 1.5 × 1.5 µm2 for cell culture samples. Signal intensity distributions are visualized using SCiLS Lab software (Bruker) using weak de-noising.

For the THP-1 cells lipid signals were identified as described by Schwenzfeier et al. using shotgun lipidomics by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry on a Q-Exactive Plus orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a dual ion funnel20,75. Lipid extracts of 72 h PMA stimulated THP-1 macrophages were produced by an adapted protocol of Folch et al. 76. Approximately 106 cells were centrifuged at 1000 g to separate them from the medium. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml CHCl3/MeOH (2:1, v/v) and lyzed for 10 min in an ultrasonic bath at room temperature followed by an incubation of 50 min at 4 °C in a cryoshaker at 500 RPM. Phase separation was induced by addition of 240 μl H2O and centrifugation at 9880 g for 10 min. The organic phase was transferred to a glass vial and the solvent was removed using a nitrogen evaporator. Lipid extracts were vacuum sealed and stored at -80 °C. For ESI-MS analysis, extracts were re-dissolved in 500 μl MeOH and measured both in positive and negative ion modes using a flow rate of 5 µl/min. A data dependent analysis workflow (DDA) was applied using tandem MS based on collision-induced dissociation (CID) with stepped normalization collision energies (NCE) of 20, 25, 30 and an exclusion time of 300 s. The mass resolving power was set to 280,000 (at m/z 200) with an AGC target of 1E6 and a maximum injection time of 250 ms. The resulting data was merged with a t-MALDI-2-MSI dataset and imported into LipostarMSI (Molecular Horizons) for annotation. The resulting feature list was hand-curated, which involved removing of isotope peaks and addition of known species from E. coli.

For mouse cerebellum and the 4T1 murine tumor section, annotations were based on accurate mass (< 3 ppm). For this, signals with S/N > 3 were extracted from the mean spectrum and annotated using the LipidMaps “Bulk Structure Search”77. In positive ion-mode sphingolipids, glycerolipids, sterol lipids and glycerophospholipids were selected as possible lipid classes either as [M + H]+- or [M-H2O + H]+-ions. The comparative analysis of untreated tissue also included [M+Na]+ and [M + K]+ ion species. In negative ion-mode only [M-H]--ions were searched for. The resulting annotation lists were manually curated to remove biologically unlikely annotation (e.g., lipids with odd side chains) or lipid classes that are usually not detected in the respective ion-mode (e.g., glycerophosphoinositols in positive ion-mode). Using this method, a total of 66 ion signals for the mouse cerebellum and 63 ion signals for the 4T1 tumor sample were annotated, respectively.

The lipid annotation of mouse cerebellum was subsequently matched with data from a full lipidomics analysis reported in the literature32. Because t-MALDI-2-MSI without the use of additional techniques like OzID or Paternò-Büchi-reactions78,79 is not able to differentiate isomers within a lipid class (e.g., PC(16:0/18:1) and PC(16:1/18:0)) or between lipid classes (e.g., PE(16:0/18:0) and PC(15:0/16:0)) the literature data was reduced to 255 unique lipid species according to the here employed level of specificity. Of the 66 annotated m/z-values, 63 were also detected by Fitzner et al. 32. The remaining unmatched values primarily corresponded to sulfoglycosphingolipids and fatty acids, lipid classes that were not analyzed in the original publication. Overall, the annotation accounted for approximately 82% of the total lipid mass identified by Fitzner et al., calculated by summing all lipids found in both datasets and using the quantitative amounts reported.

Lipid nomenclature and shorthand notation is reported according to Liebisch et al. 80.

The external and in-source fluorescence images were co-registered using SimpleITK 2.3.1 (NumFOCUS)81,82. For initialization a landmark registration was used. Based on the resulting translation matrix an affine image registration was performed using Mattes mutual information as metric and the gradient descent algorithm as optimizer83. The number of bins for the mutual information was set to 50, the parameters for the optimizer were set as follows: learning rate (1), number of iterations (50), convergence minimum value (1E-6) and convergence window (20). The sampling strategy was set to random and 1% of the pixels were sampled. The resulting transformation matrix was combined with the initial translation matrix to result in a global transformation matrix. Due to the inherent link between the t-MALDI-2-MSI measurement and the in-source fluorescence images, the global transformation matrix could be used to resample the external fluorescence images to fit the exact region of the t-MALDI-2-MSI measurement. The precision of the registration was determined by placing pairs of landmarks at distinct features, which are visible in the external fluorescence image as well as the MALDI image of the cerebellum dataset (Supplementary Fig. 1b). While the precision of the placement of each individual landmark is limited by the manual selection process and differences between modalities, overall accuracy is ensured by determining the average over a total of eleven pairs of landmarks. The target registration error (TRE) was then determined by projecting the landmarks of the MALDI image into the coordinate system of the external fluorescence image using the global transformation matrix and calculating the distance to the corresponding landmarks of the external fluorescence image (Supplementary Fig. 1c and Supplementary Note 1). Cell masks for tumor tissue were created by using DeepCell Mesmer 0.12.9 (Van Valen Lab)53 based on the DAPI channel (Hoechst 33342, nuclei) and the FITC channel (CellMask Green Actin Tracking Stain, actin). Outlines for subcellular features were determined by thresholding fluorescence signal intensity. Using FISCAS20, mass spectra were calculated for each cell or subcellular compartment by compiling MSI pixels based on their co-localized masks. MSI pixels assigned to multiple cell masks were scaled according to the hit coverage of the segmentation masks. Morphometric parameters were acquired using CellProfilers 4.2.1 (Cimini Lab)54 measurement modules.

For cell classification, immune cells were identified and divided into three groups (CD45+, LyG6+, DcTRAIL-R1+) based on thresholding the mean intensities of the corresponding antibody stains in their respective fluorescence channels (Cy5, TxRed, Cy7). Ly6G+ cells showed high intensities on the TxRed and Cy5 channel, while DcTRAIL-R1+ cells showed high intensities on all three channels. The clustering of the tumor microenvironment (TME) was done using k-means clustering on the standardized MS data of all Ly6G- cells. The number of clusters was determined by visual inspection of the clustering results for values of k between 6 and 10. The Ly6G+ cells were also clustered using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) with an epsilon of 0.7 and a minimum number of seven neighbors, based on a uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) of their standardized mass spectra. The clusters are visualized both directly on the cell masks as well as in a UMAP of the standardized mass spectra using default parameters. Ly6G+ cells were assigned to a specific tumor region, by identifying the most frequent TME label of all neighbors within 40 µm.

The presented work describes method development and can be considered proof-of-concept. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. For cerebellum and tumor tissues, multiple technical replicates with varying staining and sample preparation conditions were performed, and representative datasets were selected for display. For both tissue types, two additional MSI experiments with optimized sample preparation but varying fluorescence stains yielded comparable results. For the tumor sample, the full staining panel was applied once. For cell experiments, two independent replicates with consistent outcomes were performed, and representative data are shown. No data were excluded from the analyses. The experiments were not randomized, and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

The research presented here complies with all ethical regulations and was approved by the local ethics committee of the University of Münster and the North Rhine-Westphalia State Agency for Nature, Environment and Consumer Protection, LANUV, where applicable.

During the Late Triassic epoch (237–201 million years ago), the terrestrial ecosystems of Pangaea underwent drastic changes1,2 that led to the rise and diversification of mammaliaforms3, crocodylomorphs4 and dinosaurs5. Although the Carnian sedimentary rocks of South America provided much of the available evidence for understanding the early evolution of these clades, key discoveries have remained restricted to the Ischigualasto-Villa Unión6,7 and Paraná basins8 in Argentina and Brazil, respectively. Here we report a Carnian tetrapod assemblage from the previously unrecognized Northern Precordillera Basin in northwestern Argentina. Discoveries at this basin, in the Quebrada Santo Domingo site, include a nearly complete skeleton of the early sauropodomorph Huayracursor jaguensis gen. et sp. nov., and typical components of Late Carnian faunas, such as hyperodapedontine rhynchosaurs, gomphodontosuchine traversodontid cynodonts, and aetosaurs. Compared to its generally small and short-necked Carnian counterparts9,10, Huayracursor is larger and exhibits an incipient elongation of its cervical vertebrae, representing an intermediate condition for size and cervical elongation between known Carnian and Norian sauropodomorphs11. This discovery provides one of the oldest pieces of evidence of increased body mass and neck elongation in early Sauropodomorpha.

Without much fanfare, Apple has unveiled three new flagship products today via a press release—no special event, no prerecorded show. That might be because the new iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and Vision Pro don't change the mold—they're identical to their predecessors—but internally, they're debuting Apple's highly anticipated M5 chip.

All of the devices are available for preorder today and go on sale October 22. Here's everything you need to know.

The M5 processor is the heart of the announcements today, as it powers all the new Apple hardware. It's built on the 3-nanometer process, with a 10-core GPU and a neural accelerator in each core, which Apple claims improves performance in GPU-based AI workloads and provides four times the peak GPU compute performance over the M4 chip.

Graphics performance in general is 30 percent higher than the M4, and the 10-core CPU offers 15 percent faster multithreaded performance. (Apple claims this is the “world's fastest CPU core.”) The 16-core Neural Engine has also been enhanced, which should mean Apple Intelligence and other AI tasks (like transforming a 2D photo to a spatial scene) should be faster. Apple says there's a 30 percent increase in unified memory bandwidth, allowing larger AI models to run on the device, but it also helps deliver better performance for the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine.

It has been roughly a year and a half since the debut of the M4-powered iPad Pro, but the new M5 iPad Pro tablets don't change much outside of the processor. You still have two sizes to choose from: 11 or 13 inches. Both of them feature fast charging—you can get 50 percent in 30 minutes when using a compatible charger—though annoyingly, Apple only includes a 20-watt USB-C power adapter in the box.

Both feature Apple's N1 networking chip that debuted in the iPhone 17, which includes Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread. Also in tow is the C1X 5G modem from the iPhone Air for 50 percent faster cellular performance and 30 percent less power usage than the M4 iPad Pro. Over its predecessor, you'll see a 3.5X boost in AI performance, 1.5X faster 3D rendering with ray tracing, up to 1.2X faster video transcode performance in Final Cut Pro, and 2.3X faster AI video upscaling performance in DaVinci Resolve. The 256- and 512-GB models use 12 GB of unified memory now, twice as much as before, and the faster memory bandwidth means everything gets a speed boost.

Many of the other specs are the same. They're just as thin as before, feature Apple's Tandem OLED display technology, and can hit 1,600 nits at peak brightness. You still get the nano-textured glass upgrade if you want to reduce glare on the screen. Speaking of the screen, Apple says there's a new capability for these iPads to drive external displays at up to 120 Hz; if you already have a 120-Hz screen, a new Adaptive Sync feature will ensure the lowest possible latency between iPad and monitor.

As before, the 11-inch iPad Pro costs $999, and the 13-inch iPad Pro starts at $1,299. They're compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro, Apple Pencil USB-C, Magic Keyboard, and Smart Folio.

Interestingly, Apple did not completely revamp its MacBook Pro lineup with the M5 chip. Instead, there's just one new model: a 14-inch MacBook Pro with four storage options (512 GB, 1 TB, 2 TB, or 4 TB) and three unified memory options (16, 24, or 32 GB). The base version starts at $1,599, like before, but if you max out all of the upgrades, it can cost as much as $3,369. We'll likely see M5 Pro and M5 Max chip options in 2026 alongside a 16-inch MacBook Pro.

You'll see similar speed increases like on the iPad Pro M5—3.5X faster AI performance, 1.6X faster graphics over the prior M4-powered MacBook Pro, and 2X faster SSD performance. Otherwise, this is the same 14-inch MacBook as before, with the claimed “24-hour” battery life, mini-LED display with the nano-texture glass option, a six-speaker system, and a 12-MP webcam. There are three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI, an SDXC slot, a headphone jack, and the MagSafe charging port.

Widely regarded as a miss with consumers, Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset is back but with no major changes to the hardware. Well, there's a new head strap: the Dual Knit Band. It's included in the box, and Apple says it's soft and cushioned, allowing for a comfier fit. The headset is now powered by the M5 chip, which enables faster performance, sharper details throughout visionOS 26, and better battery life. Specifically, Apple says the M5 renders 10 percent more pixels on the micro-OLED displays than before, and the refresh rate can also jump up to 120 Hz.

Battery life is now two and a half hours of general use, as opposed to just two hours on the original Vision Pro. That extends to three hours with video playback.

Unfortunately, the price remains firm at $3,499. It's arriving right before Samsung is expected to unveil its Android XR mixed-reality headset, Project Moohan, which will hopefully come with a lower price tag.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Federal Workers Are Being Used as Pawns in the Shutdown","https://www.wired.com/story/federal-workers-are-being-used-as-pawns-in-the-shutdown/","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

Federal workers have grown accustomed to a specific kind of dread over the past year. 2025 has been nonstop: First came the “fork” email from Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, followed quickly by numerous layoffs from the Trump administration.

As of July, more than 150,000 federal workers had resigned from their roles since president Donald Trump took office for the second time, according to The Washington Post. Tens of thousands were also fired.

For the past few months, it seemed like this bloodletting was over—but that all changed on Friday.

Thousands of employees at eight government agencies were subjected to RIFs, or reductions in force—the government's formal process of laying off federal workers. According to a court filing from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on Friday, this latest round of firings has affected more than 4,000 federal employees. The court filing also claimed that the administration targeted the Treasury and the Department of Health and Human Services the hardest, hacking away at a combined 2,500 jobs across the two agencies and the entire Washington, DC, office of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Department of Education culled nearly its entire team handling special education, CNN reported on Tuesday. At the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, cuts ranged from a few dozen to several hundred jobs, according to the same filing.

“People are scared. Who says their goal is to traumatize people?” says one IRS worker, referencing private speeches given by Russell Vought, the head of OMB and a key architect of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 who has been the public face of the job-cutting. ”If any normal human said ‘My goal is to traumatize families' there should be police at that person's doorstep.”

“It's pretty demoralizing,” a Food and Drug Administration employee tells WIRED. “It's clear this admin will act illegally to try to make agencies or offices they don't like suffer more.” (The Trump administration has used government resources, like websites, to place blame on Democrats for the shutdown in what critics claim is a violation of the Hatch Act, a law forbidding the use of public assets for political messaging.)

“Every day is an adventure: new EOs, new memos,” says one Department of Homeland Security worker. “It's constantly being on watch on where to pivot and what to stop, start, and sustain.” (All of these employees have been granted anonymity so they can speak candidly about their experiences.)

Instead of the haphazard cuts led by DOGE this spring, we've entered a new phase of targeted cuts orchestrated by the Trump administration to reorient the government away from what the president calls “Democrat” priorities.

These RIFs appear to be spelling out a quiet rewrite of the administrative state. The cuts targeted offices and programs focused on public health, housing grants and homelessness programs, special education programs, and environmental cleanup, CNN reported on Tuesday. At the IRS, tech workers were affected, and the cuts “will absolutely impact critical modernization projects we were planning,” one IRS source tells me.

“The majority of our members are working-class people. They don't own summer homes,” AFGE Local 2883 president Yolanda Jacobs said in a press call on Wednesday. “Many of them live paycheck to paycheck. These reckless actions are disrupting and destroying the lives of everyday working people who are constantly being used as bargaining chips.”

Any pretense that these cuts were simply about budget discipline has disappeared. In the weeks since the shutdown began, the administration has hijacked government websites, worker email signatures, and airport TV screens to blame Democrats for possible cuts in an attempt to rebrand them as accountability rather than retribution. In an exhibit attached to that court filing, the OMB emailed agencies to prepare for RIFs, focusing on areas where funding had lapsed on projects that were “not consistent with the President's priorities.”

But President Trump put it more bluntly, speaking with reporters on Friday: “It'll be Democrat-oriented because we figure, you know, they started this thing,” he said. “So they should be Democrat-oriented. It'll be a lot.”

The filing claims that other RIF plans could still be ongoing, “but those assessments remain under deliberation and are not final.”

The White House declined to comment, directing WIRED to OMB. OMB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“OMB is making every preparation to batten down the hatches and ride out the Democrats' intransigence,” the agency wrote on X Wednesday morning. “Pay the troops, pay law enforcement, continue the RIFs, and wait.” (OMB doesn't pay military members. Congress does.)

Vought's goal doesn't seem to be just to define what it is the government is allowed to do, but to strike enough fear into workers to keep them from challenging that definition. By the end of September, when a government shutdown began to seem inevitable, federal employees I had never spoken to before were reaching out to me on LinkedIn and via Signal for some kind of clarity on whether they'd still have a job in the coming weeks, hoping that I had information that hasn't been published regarding whether their agency or department would be on the chopping block.

“I just need a sanity check … are they going to RIF all federal employees if they don't have an agreement?” one federal worker messaged me, asking about a potential shutdown in late September. “If I'm furloughed I won't get back pay?” they said in a second message two weeks later.

The Trump administration continues to insist that these RIFs are about making the government more efficient by trimming bloat, but to federal workers, it feels more like an agonizing game they never agreed to play.

“So tired of being used as a pawn,” one IRS source says. “Is WIRED hiring?”

A handheld Xbox has been rumored since at least the Xbox 360 era, where gaming forums were rife with speculation that Microsoft was about to face off against Nintendo's DS and Sony's PSP. If there was ever anything to the rumor, nothing came of it—until now, 20-odd years later, with Xbox's first genuine foray into portable gaming.

The Redmond giant isn't diving in solo, though—rather than its own dedicated device, Microsoft has partnered with Asus to deliver two distinct units, the entry-grade ROG Xbox Ally at $600, and the more powerful ROG Xbox Ally X at a somewhat staggering $1,000. These aren't so much Xbox handhelds as Xbox-branded handhelds, though, adding recognizable iconography onto what might otherwise be the next generation of Asus' own portables. The team-up delivers top-tier portable play—but a frequently confusing experience.

It's best to start with what the X-ROGs—not official terminology, but good shorthand for the pair—aren't. They're not Microsoft's answer to the Nintendo Switch 2, a bespoke console letting you seamlessly enjoy home-quality gaming on the go. Nor are they a take on the Steam Deck, a portable built around the Xbox ecosystem rather than your Steam library. Despite sporting the same signature “X” icon button as on an Xbox controller, these are handheld gaming PCs in Xbox drag, with all the good and bad that entails.

Both X-ROGs run a full version of Windows 11, with the Xbox app for PC's new “full screen experience” as the default user interface. Because these are PCs at heart, though, even if you're using the same Xbox account as on your Xbox Series X or Series S, your game library on the X-ROGs will only show titles included in the Xbox Play Anywhere program. Since you can only figure out what's not available by their absence, you may find a game you fancied playing on the go isn't an option. Along with the difference in how the library is sorted and filtered, it's not the smoothest transition for console players.

The overall UI also feels more cluttered than a handheld should, with a home screen that shows your recently played games above a bunch of “Featured” offers, a row of titles recently added to Game Pass, and more. It's a far cry from the stark, minimalist elegance of the Switch 2, highlighting how much is left to be desired in optimizing the Xbox for the handheld form.

Unfortunately, Microsoft is also crow-barring AI features in, with a new Gaming Copilot assistant (also coming to the desktop PC Xbox app). It's pitched as “your personal gaming sidekick,” recognizing what's happening onscreen and responding to voice inquiries for help on parts you're stuck on. It speaks in one of four “personalities,” including a cringey “heroic”—it's detestable, but thankfully optional, so I quickly deactivated.

Running Windows under the Xbox hood also means frustrations when it comes to software updates—is it just the Xbox app that needs an update or the whole system? Should you go through the Windows App store or the Windows Update tool? Will a future system update break your games? It's all a lot more convoluted than simply turning a console on and playing a game. And, while you can swap to a full Windows desktop view at any time—and even connect a mouse if you don't fancy battling through Windows' endless menus and submenus with the X-ROGs' thumbsticks or touchscreens—finding exactly what setting may need fiddling with when you just want to play a game can be a chore.

However, because the X-ROGs are fundamentally regular PCs, they're a lot more versatile than Nintendo's or Valve's efforts. Not only can you play media, browse, or do anything else you might do on a PC (even Office tasks, if you hate joy), but you can install any other PC gaming client—Steam, Epic, GOG, and more are all available. Better still, the Xbox app aggregates all games installed on the system into one library view, regardless of where they originate. You can even turn your ROG Xbox into an ersatz Steam Deck by running Steam in Big Picture mode (although some of its controller key bindings may not work).

The big win—pardon the pun—is that you can install mods with ease. While I've gotten a few mods running on my Steam Deck over the years, its Linux underbelly makes things trickier. On the X-ROGs, I've been able to use mods as easily as on my main gaming desktop, with no second-guessing if they'll actually work. It's a great feature that's facilitated by having standard Windows as the base.

But wait, there's a third UI player in the mix: Asus' own Armoury Crate SE software. Broadly, this is more of a device manager, with a dedicated button on both consoles to bring up a Command Center quick menu. This allows you to instantly switch power profiles, create custom control inputs, or set frame rate limits. It also offers a real-time monitor displaying useful system information like temperature, CPU and GPU performance, battery level and power drain, and the current frame rate.

However, fully open Armoury Crate and you'll find an array of far deeper controls, from granular system settings to tweaking color profiles of the LED rings that sit under each thumbstick. It also has its own Update Center—yet another to check—and its own unified library, distinct from the Xbox app's. After a week with the X-ROGs, I'm finally familiar with where functions live, but the learning curve is steep, and having essentially three central interfaces—Xbox, Windows, Armoury Crate—for a single device is ridiculous.

On this at least, the X-ROGs are no different from Asus' original ROG Ally or 2024's ROG Ally X, or even other Windows-based gaming handhelds, such as the Lenovo Legion S Go. Hopping between multiple UIs doing variations of the same thing has become a kind of jank that feels baked into the entire product category. If you're accustomed to that, you'll feel right at home with the X-ROGs, with all their foibles.

However, the Xbox branding here is likely to attract players who, while perhaps more committed than “casual” gamers, still want a slick, pick-up-and-play experience from a handheld. If you stick purely to the Xbox app, the X-ROGs can be close to that, but the more you want to get out of them, the less intuitive they are.

That's a lot to get your head around before getting started, but mercifully, it's worth it. Both the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X are significant improvements on Asus' predecessors. In fact, these might be two of the best handheld gaming PCs I've ever used—although the use case for each ends up being quite different.

At a glance, the X-ROGs might seem separated only by colorways. The ROG Xbox Ally comes in white with multi-colored A/B/X/Y face buttons, while the ROG Xbox Ally X opts for all-black with gray buttons. Both use the same 290.8 x 121.5 x 50.7-millimeter form factor, each subtly decorated with near-microscopic “XBOX ROG” lettering cascading vertically down the shell like The Matrix code. They look and feel distinctly premium, as you'd expect given their prices.

Ergonomics are superb, with angular grips feeling more like holding a conventional Xbox controller than the brick-with-a-screen of many handheld PCs. All inputs are within reach, from the traditionally asymmetrical thumbsticks to the textured shoulder buttons and satisfyingly chunky triggers. At the rear sit two macro buttons with customizable inputs. Despite being nominally heavier than a Steam Deck's 669 grams—the Xbox ROG Ally weighs in at 670 grams, the Ally X at 715 grams—the masterful design means they sit better in the hand and are more comfortable to use for long play periods.

Both models also use the same screen, a 7-inch, 1920 x 1080p, 16:9 IPS touchscreen panel with a 120-Hz refresh rate and 500-nit brightness. Buyers will want to get a screen protector—it's made of Gorilla Glass Victus, but given how often you'll poke or swipe the screen to navigate the system, added protection feels necessary. When it's not covered in finger smudges, this is a great, sharp display at its default settings, and its performance can be further tweaked in Armoury Crate, either manually or with quick-sets tailored to specific gaming genres.

However, at the prices these handhelds are coming in at, it's hard not to feel a bit shortchanged that the screen isn't OLED, even on the higher-priced ROG Xbox Ally X. These are essentially the same screens as on Asus' previous ROG Ally, and despite both X-ROGs offering a higher resolution and refresh rate, the Steam Deck OLED‘s perfect black levels and ability to deliver HDR does still give it a slight edge.

The X-ROGs more clearly diverge in function. Some differences are small—the Ally's triggers incorporate Hall effect tech, while the Ally X uses Microsoft's Impulse Triggers for more nuanced haptics. Both feature two USB-C ports at the top—and you can charge through either—but the Ally's are both USB 3.2 Gen 2 (with DisplayPort 1.4 output and Power Delivery 3.0 support), while the Ally X has one USB 4 port with Thunderbolt 4 compatibility, and one USB 3.2 Gen 2 (both with DisplayPort 2.1 out), giving more versatility.

Major distinctions come down to raw power. The Ally packs in an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor, 16 GB LPDDR5-6400 RAM, and a 512-GB SSD—no slouch, but wildly outclassed by the Ally X. The flagship model's Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme chip is an absolute beast, and it's backed up by 24 GB LPDDR5X-8000 RAM and a 1-TB SSD. The resulting difference is clear to see, both in performance and who each handheld is aimed at.

Installing Forza Horizon 5 on both, the Ally impressed initially, still meeting requirements for the game's “High” quality preset. However, the game automatically set the frame rate cap to 30 fps, while a buried setting within the Xbox app for the Ally itself (absent on the Ally X) was set to “automatically limit games to 720p” resolution. Turning that off and raising the frame rate to the 120 fps the Ally is hypothetically capable of, performance dived, resulting in slightly juddery races around Mexico. Plugging the Ally in, maxing its power profile to the 20-watt “Turbo” setting in Armoury Crate, and boosting just about every other possible metric improved things, reaching a high of 48 fps—eminently playable, but nothing amazing.

On the Ally X, however, Forza ran at a smooth 60 fps straight away, off battery. Again, lifting the frame cap to 120 fps, even the Ally X never quite hit that magic number, but it did hover around 78 to 85 fps, while plugging in and setting the console to its 25-watt Turbo max saw it occasionally crest over 90 fps. Similar performance differentials were observed on other demanding AAA games installed on each handheld, including Gears of War: Reloaded, Avowed, and Halo Infinite—the Ally struggled while the Ally X handled everything I threw at it.

The basic Ally can shine with less technologically demanding games, though. Hollow Knight: Silksong hits a consistent 120 fps, while some retro classics and indies installed via Steam—Final Fantasy IX, Dredge, and Owlboy among them—all ran without a hitch. Much like the Steam Deck itself, the Ally feels best suited to these smaller titles, which also have the benefit of not eating up the entire SSD. Forza alone required a full quarter of the Ally's storage, colossal install sizes being another reminder of a lack of optimization. Both X-ROGs use standard M.2 2280 factor SSDs, though, so they should be easily upgradable, and both support microSD cards too—again better for smaller, less demanding games to be installed on.

There's one other workaround for performance throttles or storage issues, though: cloud gaming, which is surprisingly well implemented here. Testing out Bethesda's DOOM: The Dark Ages through Xbox Cloud Gaming (other platforms such as Nvidia's GeForce Now are also accessible), it connected quickly, played without a single drop-out, and ran at a consistent 60 fps on both X-ROGs. I don't know what witchcraft Xbox has been doing backstage, but this is the best cloud gaming I've ever encountered.

Whatever and however you're playing, battery life is impressive for both X-ROGs. Even though the Ally X again has an advantage—packing an 80-Wh battery versus the Ally's 60-Wh—I regularly got around six hours' play out of both units between charges, depending on the game. Playing an hour of Hollow Knight: Silksong—again, not the most demanding title—on each took the Ally from full to 85 percent, while the Ally X dropped to 88 percent. Cloud gaming saw barely any drain on either, about 7 percent per hour, but locally installed Forza or Gears slurped up around 30 to 35 percent of a full charge on both X-ROGs in around 45 minutes. Even that's far less draining than I expected, rendering both units surprisingly viable for longer play.

Both X-ROGs stand out in the increasingly crowded field of handheld gaming PCs, thanks to strong design, comfort of use, and cross-platform versatility that outpace most of the competition. Neither model is perfect, but for its first venture into the handheld space, Microsoft gets a lot right in its partnership with Asus.

If you want a reasonably powerful gaming PC that can run small to mid-size games with ease, and even some more demanding ones in a playable if not astounding state, the ROG Xbox Ally is a great choice—especially if you're happy to turn to cloud gaming for the most demanding titles.

If you want uncompromising performance and high-end capabilities, though, the ROG Xbox Ally X is a clear winner. It breezes through everything the baseline Ally does, and delivers authentic AAA gaming to boot. It's exceptional. In doing so, it's clearly, unabashedly targeting the “hardcore” gamer—and it's going to financially bleed them for the privilege.

Those prices are by far the biggest obstacle for either model, but if you're able to splash out on a high-end handheld, these can take portable gaming to the next level.

Seattle-area used goods marketplace OfferUp is conducting another round of layoffs as it seeks to simplify its business and get back to focusing on the local user-to-user experience.

In a memo to staff on Wednesday (in full below), CEO Todd Dunlap outlined planned changes that included downplaying shipping as an offering; modernizing the OfferUp app; increasing marketing spend; and consolidating local business offerings.

“As we implement a simpler structure with fewer offerings, we need fewer people to operate,” Dunlap wrote. “And if we're going to maintain profitability while investing more in growth, we need to free up cash flow.”

The company did not disclose the number of employees affected or the number of remaining staff. OfferUp has 435 employees, according to LinkedIn.

The layoffs come less than a year after OfferUp cut 22% of its staff last December, in a move where Dunlap cited macroeconomic trends such as programmatic ad rates that affected some of the company's revenue lines.

Founded in 2011, OfferUp competes against Craigslist, eBay, Facebook and other marketplaces where users buy and sell goods. The company says it facilitates 30 million transactions on its platform annually and is currently ranked No. 24 on the GeekWire 200, our index of Pacific Northwest startups. It generates revenue in part by charging sellers for premium features and broader reach.

Dunlap, a former exec at Xbox and Booking.com, took over for OfferUp from founder and former CEO Nick Huzar in 2021. Huzar now leads EV charging startup Juicer Energy and is co-founder of Gone.com, a logistics-driven marketplace reimagining the secondhand goods economy.

Read Dunlap's complete memo to OfferUp staff:

Team,

Today we made changes no leader wants to make. Earlier this morning, I let some of our colleagues know their roles have been eliminated. For everyone who is still with OfferUp, I want to explain why we did this, how we supported those leaving, and what comes next for us.

Why we made this decision

We are resetting the company to be more focused on reaching and serving the local communities that rely on OfferUp and that helped make OfferUp what it is today.  The work in the last year has provided us with critical signal for a few important principles:

— Our strength is in local;

— We can reach local users and drive engagement with compelling marketing in a new mix of channels;

— Local businesses can be an important part of our platform, but we must be thoughtful about the balance between business offerings and the core user-to-user interactions. 

As a reaction to this signal, we're taking several steps to embrace these principles:

— We are deprecating our shipping offering in order to provide a more focused and specific local experience;

— We are exploring ways to modernize the app experience to meet today's expectations; 

— We are bolstering the capabilities of our marketing team, and we intend to significantly increase our marketing spend to take advantage of the opportunity to reach users in new ways;

— We are consolidating our local business offerings into one group to provide a cohesive strategy that enables auto dealers, storefronts, service providers, employers, and landlords to thrive and provide value to our local users. 

These principles led to the decision to reduce our headcount for two reasons: (1) as we implement a simpler structure with fewer offerings, we need fewer people to operate, and (2) if we're going to maintain profitability while investing more in growth, we need to free up cash flow.  

Our new structure also necessitates a new way of working. At heart, we are a startup—albeit an older, wiser one. In the weeks ahead, we will lean into a leaner operating model built on clear priorities, close collaboration, and shared decision-making principles. I'm energized by what this shift can unlock for us, and I hope you will be, too.

What you can expect next

— Tomorrow's all-team: I will walk through the plan, changes to my leadership team, and how we'll measure progress

— Team-specific follow-ups: Leaders will convene their teams to clarify focus and ownership, and we'll follow up with transparent roadmaps that line up across the org

— Support for teams: We'll work together to define clear goals, make faster decisions, and cut inefficient processes so you can get time back for building

Our departing colleagues

I want to convey our deep gratitude to our departing teammates. They have made many meaningful contributions to our product, our business, and our community, and we have tried to honor those contributions with support through this transition:

— Severance – We are providing severance in an amount equivalent to 10 weeks, plus additional amounts for tenure over 5 years. 

— Healthcare – We will cover the full cost of COBRA coverage through the end of the year. 

— Outplacement Services – Our departing colleagues will have access to career services through a company that provides career transition and job placement services.

— Laptops – Our colleagues will keep their OfferUp-issued computers at no cost. 

For most of those impacted, today is their last day at OfferUp. We have asked a few teammates to stay on to help teams transition over the next few months. Please join me in extending thanks and support to all of these colleagues in the days ahead.

I know this is a difficult day and the work ahead will be hard, but it's the right work. OfferUp belongs in the world. I believe in that, and I believe in this team. A world of local opportunity awaits.

Looking forward to spending time together tomorrow—

Todd

While employees spend much of their day communicating and coordinating amongst themselves on projects, this effort is often undermined by the availability of specific individuals. When a colleague with vital information is away — whether on vacation or in a different time zone — the rest of the team must delay progress until that person responds.

Ashutosh Garg and Varun Kacholia, the co-founders of Eightfold — an AI recruiting startup last valued at $2.1 billion — believe that advances in LLMs and data privacy technologies can help solve some aspects of this costly problem. Earlier this year, they launched Viven, a digital twins startup with a mission to grant employees access to crucial information from teammates even when those colleagues are unavailable.

On Wednesday, Viven emerged out of stealth mode with $35 million in seed funding from Khosla Ventures, Foundation Capital, FPV Ventures, and others.

Viven develops a specialized LLM for each employee, effectively creating a digital twin by accessing their internal electronic documents such as email, Slack, and Google Docs. Other employees in the organization can then query that person's digital twin to get immediate answers related to common projects and shared knowledge.

“When each and every person has a digital twin, you can just talk to their twin as if you're talking to that person and get the response,” Ashutosh Garg told TechCrunch.

One major hurdle is that people just can't share everything with anyone who asks. Employees often handle sensitive  information or have personal files they want to keep private from the rest of the team.

According to Garg, Viven's technology solves that complex problem through a concept known as pairwise context and privacy. This enables the startup's LLMs to precisely determine what information can be shared and with whom across the organization.

Viven's LLMs are smart enough to recognize personal context and know what information needs to stay private — like questions related to an employee's personal life. But perhaps the most important safeguard is that everyone can see the query history of their digital twin, which acts as a deterrent against people asking inappropriate questions.

“It's a very hard problem to solve, and until recently, it was unsolvable,” Ashu Garg, a general partner at Foundation Capital told TechCrunch.

Viven is already in use by several enterprise clients, including Genpact and Eightfold. (Co-founders Ashutosh Garg and Varun Kacholia continue to lead Eightfold, splitting their time between that company and running Viven.)

As for competition, Ashutosh Garg claims that no other company is tackling digital twins for the enterprise yet.

He wasn't sure that there were no competitors when he first started thinking about the idea. So he called Vinod Khosla to ask about it. The legendary investor assured Ashutosh Garg that nobody is doing this and agreed to invest.

Ashu Garg of Foundation Capital was equally excited about Viven.

“When Ashutosh came to me and described the product, the big aha for me was: there's this horizontal problem across all jobs of coordination and communication, which no one is automating,” Ashu Garg told TechCrunch.

But just because there are no direct competitors now, it doesn't mean that other companies won't build digital twins for companies in the future. Ashu Garg said that Anthropic, Google's Gemina, Microsoft Copilot, and OpenAI's enterprise search products have a personalization component. But, if they do enter this market, Viven hopes its “pairwise” context technology will be its moat.

Cybersecurity firm F5 Networks says government-backed hackers had “long-term, persistent access” to its network, which allowed them to steal the company's source code and customer information.

In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, F5 said it now “believes its containment actions have been successful,” after first discovering the hackers in its network on August 9.

The Seattle, Washington-based company, which specializes in providing application security and cybersecurity defenses for large companies and governments, said the hackers had access to its BIG-IP product development environment and its knowledge management systems, which included source code and publicly undisclosed security vulnerabilities.

F5 said it wasn't aware of any modifications to its software while in development, nor was it aware of any exploitation of the vulnerabilities. The company published several updates on Wednesday for its BIG-IP platform to fix the undisclosed security flaws and urged customers to patch them.

The company also said the hackers downloaded configurations and implementation information about some of its customers' systems, files that could help hackers find and exploit potential design weaknesses, and potentially hack into those customers' systems.

F5 said in the notice that the U.S. Department of Justice allowed the company to delay its public disclosure. An F5 spokesperson would not say for what reason the delay was allowed, but the DOJ can allow companies to hold off on notifying the public if there is a “substantial risk to national security or public safety.”

F5 has over 1,000 corporate customers and serves more than 85% of the Fortune 500, the largest public companies by revenue, including banks, tech companies, and critical infrastructure companies.

The U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre warned on Wednesday, following F5's disclosure, that hackers could “enable a threat actor to exploit F5 devices and software.”

CISA said in an email on Wednesday that it has ordered civilian federal agencies under an emergency directive to patch their systems by October 22, citing the security risks.

The company did not attribute the attacks to a particular government or nation-state-affiliated hacking group, and F5 spokesperson Dan Sorensen declined to answer TechCrunch's questions beyond the company's published statement, including how many customers are affected and if it was known how the hackers broke in to begin with. 

F5 is the latest tech company in recent years to have been hacked by government hackers, including Microsoft — by China, and Russia, at least twice; cloud and enterprise technology firm Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and several other companies as part of the broader Russian cyberattack on the software maker SolarWinds.

AI hyperscaler startup Nscale has signed a sizable deal with Microsoft to bring Nvidia AI hardware to multiple data centers.

The AI cloud provider announced on Wednesday that it signed a deal with Microsoft to bring approximately 200,000 Nvidia GB300 GPUs to three data centers in Europe and one in the U.S.

These GPUs will be delivered through Nscale-owned operations and through a joint venture with investment company Aker, one of Nscale's investors.

About half of these GPUs, 104,000, will head to a data center in Texas leased by Ionic Digital, over the next 12 to 18 months. Nscale plans to increase its footprint at this location to 1.2 gigawatts, the company stated.

Nscale will also deploy 12,600 GPUs to the Start Campus data center in Sines, Portugal, starting in the first quarter of 2026.

The deal builds on previous plans with both Microsoft and Aker regarding data centers in Norway and the United Kingdom. Nscale will send 23,000 GPUS to its Loughton, England campus starting in 2027, and send the remaining 52,000 GPUs to Microsoft's AI campus in Narvik, Norway.

“This agreement confirms Nscale's place as a partner of choice for the world's most important technology leaders,” Josh Payne, founder and CEO of Nscale, said in a company press release. “Few companies are equipped to deliver GPU deployments at this scale, but we have the experience and have built the global pipeline to do so.”

It's a bold claim by Payne, considering that Nscale was founded in 2024. Since its launch, the company has raised more than $1.7 billion from strategic partners including Aker, Nokia and Nvidia. Nscale has also raised from investors like Sandton Capital Partners, G Squared and Point72, among others. Payne told the Financial Times that the company is looking at an IPO as early as the end of next year.

“The pace with which we have expanded our capacity demonstrates both our readiness and our commitment to efficiency, sustainability and providing our customers with the most advanced technology available. It's a clear signal that Nscale is setting a new standard for how the next wave of AI infrastructure will be delivered,” Payne said in the release.

GPU deals have picked up in recent weeks. OpenAI announced it was purchasing six gigawatts' worth of chips from AMD last week. OpenAI also recently inked a deal with Nvidia in which Nvidia will invest up to $100 billion in the company in exchange for 10 gigawatts' worth of chips in September.

Google launched its new video model Veo 3.1 with improved audio output, granular editing controls, and better output for image to video. It said that Veo 3.1 builds on May's Veo 3 release and generates more realistic clips and adheres to prompts better.

The model allows users to add an object to the video and have it blend into the clip's style, Google said. Soon, users will be able to remove an existing object from the video in Flow, too.

Veo 3 already has edit features such as adding reference images to drive a character, providing the first and last frame to generate a clip using AI, and the ability to extend an existing video based on the last few frames. With Veo 3.1, Google is adding audio to all these features to make the clips more lively. 

The company is rolling out the model to its video editor Flow, the  Gemini App, along with Vertex and Gemini APIs. It said that since Flow's launch in May, users have created more than 275 million videos on the app.

Branding is the true issue that Anthropic has though. Haiku 4.5 may (not saying it is, far to early to tell) be roughly equivalent in code output quality compared to Sonnet 4, which would serve a lot users amazingly well, but by virtue of the connotations smaller models have, alongside recent performance degradations making users more suspicious than beforehand, getting these do adopt Haiku 4.5 over Sonnet 4.5 even will be challenging. I'd love to know whether Haiku 3, 3.5 and 4.5 are roughly in the same ballpark in terms of parameters and course, nerdy old me would like that to be public information for all models, but in fairness to companies, many would just go for the largest model thinking it serves all use cases best. GPT-5 to me is still most impressive because of its pricing relative to performance and Haiku may end up similar, though with far less adoption. Everyone believes their task requires no less than Opus it seems after all.For reference:Haiku 3: I $0.25/M, O $1.25/MHaiku 4.5: I $1.00/M, O $5.00/MGPT-5: I $1.25/M, O $10.00/MGPT-5-mini: I $0.25/M, O $2.00/MGPT-5-nano: I $0.05/M, O $0.40/MGLM-4.6: I $0.60/M, O $2.20/M

Given that Sonnet is still a popular model for coding despite the much higher cost, I expect Haiku will get traction if the quality is as good as this post claims.

I suppose it depends on how you are using it, but for coding isn't output cost more relevant than input - requirements in, code out ?

Depends on what you're doing, but for modifying an existing project (rather than greenfield), input tokens >> output tokens in my experience.

I spend way to much time waiting for the cutting edge models to return a response.  73% on SWE Bench is plenty good enough for me.

I was hoping Anthropic would introduce something price-competitive with the cheaper models from OpenAI and Gemini, which get as low as $0.05/$0.40 (GPT-5-Nano) and $0.075/$0.30 (Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite).

Usually I'm using GPT-5-mini for that task. Haiku 4.5 runs 3x faster with roughly comparable results (I slightly prefer the GPT-5-mini output but may have just accustomed to it).

We use the smaller models for everything that's not internal high complexity tasks like coding. Although they would do a good enough of a job there as well, we happily pay the uncharge to get something a little better here.Anything user facing or when building workflow functionalities like extracting, converting, translating, merging, evaluating, all of these are mini and nano cases at our company.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","AI is changing how we quantify pain","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/15/1125116/ai-is-changing-how-we-quantify-pain/","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Artificial intelligence is helping health-care providers better assess their patients' discomfort.

For years at Orchard Care Homes, a 23‑facility dementia-care chain in northern England, Cheryl Baird watched nurses fill out the Abbey Pain Scale, an observational methodology used to evaluate pain in those who can't communicate verbally. Baird, a former nurse who was then the facility's director of quality, describes it as “a tick‑box exercise where people weren't truly considering pain indicators.”

As a result, agitated residents were assumed to have behavioral issues, since the scale does not always differentiate well between pain and other forms of suffering or distress. They were often prescribed psychotropic sedatives, while the pain itself went untreated.

Then, in January 2021, Orchard Care Homes began a trial of PainChek, a smartphone app that scans a resident's face for microscopic muscle movements and uses artificial intelligence to output an expected pain score. Within weeks, the pilot unit saw fewer prescriptions and had calmer corridors. “We immediately saw the benefits: ease of use, accuracy, and identifying pain that wouldn't have been spotted using the old scale,” Baird recalls.

In nursing homes, neonatal units, and ICU wards, researchers are racing to turn pain into something a camera or sensor can score as reliably as blood pressure.

This kind of technology-assisted diagnosis hints at a bigger trend. In nursing homes, neonatal units, and ICU wards, researchers are racing to turn pain—medicine's most subjective vital sign—into something a camera or sensor can score as reliably as blood pressure. The push has already produced PainChek, which has been cleared by regulators on three continents and has logged more than 10 million pain assessments. Other startups are beginning to make similar inroads in care settings.

The way we assess pain may finally be shifting, but when algorithms measure our suffering, does that change the way we understand and treat it?

Science already understands certain aspects of pain. We know that when you stub your toe, for example, microscopic alarm bells called nociceptors send electrical impulses toward your spinal cord on “express” wires, delivering the first stab of pain, while a slower convoy follows with the dull throb that lingers. At the spinal cord, the signal meets a microscopic switchboard scientists call the gate. Flood that gate with friendly touches—say, by rubbing the bruise—or let the brain return an instruction born of panic or calm, and the gate might muffle or magnify the message before you even become aware of it.

As the opioid crisis rages, companies are on a hunt for new, nonaddictive pain medicines. A new study offers a glimmer of hope amid a bevy of failures.

The gate can either let pain signals pass through or block them, depending on other nerve activity and instructions from your brain. Only the signals that succeed in getting past this gate travel up to your brain's sensory map to help locate the damage, while others branch out to emotion centers that decide how bad it feels. Within milliseconds, those same hubs in the brain shoot fresh orders back down the line, releasing built-in painkillers or stoking the alarm. In other words, pain isn't a straightforward translation of damage or sensation but a live negotiation between the body and the brain.

But much of how that negotiation plays out is still a mystery. For instance, scientists cannot predict what causes someone to slip from a routine injury into years-long hypersensitivity; the molecular shift from acute to chronic pain is still largely unknown. Phantom-limb pain remains equally puzzling: About two-thirds of amputees feel agony in a part of their body that no longer exists, yet competing theories—cortical remapping, peripheral neuromas, body-schema mismatch—do not explain why they suffer while the other third feel nothing.

The first serious attempt at a system for quantifying pain was introduced in 1921. Patients marked their degree of pain as a point on a blank 10‑centimeter line and clinicians scored the distance in millimeters, converting lived experience into a 0–100 ladder. By 1975, psychologist Ronald Melzack's McGill Pain Questionnaire offered 78 adjectives like “burning,” “stabbing,” and “throbbing,” so that pain's texture could join intensity in the chart. Over the past few decades, hospitals have ultimately settled on the 0–10 Numeric Rating Scale.

Yet pain is stubbornly subjective. Feedback from the brain in the form of your reaction can send instructions back down the spinal cord, meaning that expectation and emotion can change how much the same injury hurts. In one trial, volunteers who believed they had received a pain relief cream reported a stimulus as 22% less painful than those who knew the cream was inactive—and a functional magnetic resonance image of their brains showed that the drop corresponded with decreased activity in the parts of the brain that report pain, meaning they really did feel less hurt.

What's more, pain can also be affected by a slew of external factors. In one study, experimenters applied the same calibrated electrical stimulus to volunteers from Italy, Sweden, and Saudi Arabia, and the ratings varied dramatically. Italian women recorded the highest scores on the 0–10 scale, while Swedish and Saudi participants judged the identical burn several points lower, implying that culture can amplify or dampen the felt intensity of the same experience.

Bias inside the clinic can drive different responses even to the same pain score. A 2024 analysis of discharge notes found that women's scores were recorded 10% less often than men's. At a large pediatric emergency department, Black children presenting with limb fractures were roughly 39% less likely to receive an opioid analgesic than their white non-Hispanic peers, even after the researchers controlled for pain score and other clinical factors. Together these studies make clear that an “8 out of 10” does not always result in the same reaction or treatment. And many patients cannot self-report their pain at all—for example, a review of bedside studies concludes that about 70% of intensive-care patients have pain that goes unrecognized or undertreated, a problem the authors link to their impaired communication due to sedation or intubation.

These issues have prompted a search for a better, more objective way to understand and assess pain. Progress in artificial intelligence has brought a new dimension to that hunt.

Research groups are pursuing two broad routes. The first listens underneath the skin. Electrophysiologists strap electrode nets to volunteers and look for neural signatures that rise and fall with administered stimuli. A 2024 machine-learning study reported that one such algorithm could tell with over 80% accuracy, using a few minutes of resting-state EEG, which subjects experienced chronic pain and which were pain-free control participants. Other researchers combine EEG with galvanic skin response and heart-rate variability, hoping a multisignal “pain fingerprint” will provide more robust measurements.

Immersing patients in virtual worlds can reduce the pain of a needle stick as well as more pernicious chronic pain. 

One example of this method is the PMD-200 patient monitor from Medasense, which uses AI-based tools to output pain scores. The device uses physiological patterns like heart rate, sweating, or peripheral temperature changes as the input and focuses on surgical patients, with the goal of helping anesthesiologists adjust doses during operations. In a 2022 study of 75 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, use of the monitor resulted in lower self-reported pain scores after the operation—a median score of 3 out of 10, versus 5 out of 10 in controls—without an increase in opioid use. The device is authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration and is in use in the United States, the European Union, Canada, and elsewhere.

The second path is behavioral. A grimace, a guarded posture, or a sharp intake of breath correlates with various levels of pain. Computer-vision teams have fed high-speed video of patients' changing expressions into neural networks trained on the Face Action Coding System (FACS), which was introduced in the late 1970s with the goal of creating an objective and universal system to analyze such expressions—it's the Rosetta stone of 44 facial micro-movements. In lab tests, those models can flag frames indicating pain from the data set with over 90% accuracy, edging close to the consistency of expert human assessors. Similar approaches mine posture and even sentence fragments in clinical notes, using natural-language processing, to spot phrases like “curling knees to chest” that often correlate with high pain.

PainChek is one of these behavioral models, and it acts like a camera‑based thermometer, but for pain: A care worker opens the app and holds a phone 30 centimeters from a person's face. For three seconds, a neural network looks for nine particular microscopic movements—upper‑lip raise, brow pinch, cheek tension, and so on—that research has linked most strongly to pain. Then the screen flashes a score of 0 to 42. “There's a catalogue of ‘action‑unit codes'—facial expressions common to all humans. Nine of those are associated with pain,” explains Kreshnik Hoti, a senior research scientist with PainChek and a co-inventor of the device. This system is built directly on the foundation of FACS. After the scan, the app walks the user through a yes‑or‑no checklist of other signs, like groaning, “guarding,” and sleep disruption, and stores the result on a cloud dashboard that can show trends.

Linking the scan to a human‑filled checklist was, Hoti admits, a late design choice. “Initially, we thought AI should automate everything, but now we see [that] hybrid use—AI plus human input—is our major strength,” he says. Care aides, not nurses, complete most assessments, freeing clinicians to act on the data rather than gather it.

PainChek was cleared by Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration in 2017, and national rollout funding from Canberra helped embed it in hundreds of nursing homes in the country. The system has also won authorization in the UK—where expansion began just before covid-19 started spreading and resumed as lockdowns eased—and in Canada and New Zealand, which are running pilot programs. In the US, it's currently awaiting an FDA decision. Company‑wide data show “about a 25% drop in anti­psychotic use and, in Scotland, a 42% reduction in falls,” Hoti says.

Orchard Care Homes is one of its early adopters. Baird, then the facility's director of quality, remembers the pre‑AI routine that was largely done “to prove compliance,” she says.

PainChek added an algorithm to that workflow, and the hybrid approach has paid off. Orchard's internal study of four care homes tracked monthly pain scores, behavioral incidents, and prescriptions. Within weeks, psychotropic scripts fell and residents' behavior calmed. The ripple effects went beyond pharmacy tallies. Residents who had skipped meals because of undetected dental pain “began eating again,” Baird notes, and “those who were isolated due to pain began socializing.”

Inside Orchard facilities, a cultural shift is underway. When Baird trained new staff, she likened pain “to measuring blood pressure or oxygen,” she says. “We wouldn't guess those, so why guess pain?” The analogy lands, but getting people fully on board is still a slog. Some nurses insist their clinical judgment is enough; others balk at another login and audit trail. “The sector has been slow to adopt technology, but it's changing,” Baird says. That's helped by the fact that administering a full Abbey Pain Scale takes 20 minutes, while a PainChek scan and checklist take less than five.

Engineers at PainChek are now adapting the code for the very youngest patients. PainChek Infant targets babies under one year, whose grimaces flicker faster than adults'. The algorithm, retrained on neonatal faces, detects six validated facial action units based on the well-established Baby Facial Action Coding System. PainChek Infant is starting limited testing in Australia while the company pursues a separate regulatory pathway.

Skeptics raise familiar red flags about these devices. Facial‑analysis AI has a history of skin‑tone bias, for example. Facial analysis may also misread grimaces stemming from nausea or fear. The tool is only as good as the yes‑or‑no answers that follow the scan; sloppy data entry can skew results in either direction. Results lack the broader clinical and interpersonal context a caregiver is likely to have from interacting with individual patients regularly and understanding their medical history. It's also possible that clinicians might defer too strongly to the algorithm, over-relying on outside judgment and eroding their own.

If PainChek is approved by the FDA this fall, it will be part of a broader effort to create a system of new pain measurement technology. Other startups are pitching EEG headbands for neuropathic pain, galvanic skin sensors that flag breakthrough cancer pain, and even language models that comb nursing notes for evidence of hidden distress. Still, quantifying pain with an external device could be rife with hidden issues, like bias or inaccuracies, that we will uncover only after significant use.

For Baird, the issue is fairly straightforward nonetheless. “I've lived with chronic pain and had a hard time getting people to believe me. [PainChek] would have made a huge difference,” she says. If artificial intelligence can give silent sufferers a numerical voice—and make clinicians listen—then adding one more line to the vital‑sign chart might be worth the screen time.

Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage can scale faster than other approaches. But some experts are dubious about the climate benefits.

Over the last century, much of the US pulp and paper industry crowded into the southeastern corner of the nation, setting up mills amid sprawling timber forests to strip the fibers from juvenile loblolly, long leaf, and slash pine trees.

Today, after the factories chip the softwood and digest it into pulp, the leftover lignin, spent chemicals, and remaining organic matter form a dark, syrupy by-product known as black liquor. It's then concentrated into a biofuel and burned, which heats the towering boilers that power the facility—and releases carbon dioxide into the air.

Microsoft, JP MorganChase, and a tech company consortium that includes Alphabet, Meta, Shopify, and Stripe have all recently struck multimillion-dollar deals to pay paper mill owners to capture at least hundreds of thousands of tons of this greenhouse gas by installing carbon scrubbing equipment in their facilities.

The captured carbon dioxide will then be piped down into saline aquifers more than a mile underground, where it should be sequestered permanently.

Big Tech is suddenly betting big on this form of carbon removal, known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS. The sector also includes biomass-fueled power plants, waste incinerators, and biofuel refineries that add carbon capturing equipment to their facilities.Since trees and other plants absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and these factories will trap emissions that would have gone into the air, together they can theoretically remove more greenhouse gas from the atmosphere than was released, achieving what's known as “negative emissions.”

The companies that pay for this removal can apply that reduction in carbon dioxide to cancel out a share of their own corporate pollution. BECCS now accounts for nearly 70% of the announced contracts in carbon removal, a popularity due largely to the fact that it can be tacked onto industrial facilities already operating on large scales.

“If we're balancing cost, time to market, and ultimate scale potential, BECCS offers a really attractive value proposition across all three of those,” says Brian Marrs, senior director of energy and carbon removal at Microsoft, which has become by far the largest buyer of carbon removal credits as it races to balance out its ongoing emissions by the end of the decade.

But experts have raised a number of concerns about various approaches to BECCS, stressing they may inflate the climate benefits of the projects, conflate prevented emissions with carbon removal, and extend the life of facilities that pollute in other ways. It could also create greater financial incentives to log forests or convert them to agricultural land. 

When greenhouse-gas sources and sinks are properly tallied across all the fields, forests, and factories involved, it's highly difficult to achieve negative emissions with many approaches to BECCS, says Tim Searchinger, a senior research scholar at Princeton University. That undermines the logic of dedicating more of the world's limited land, crops, and woods to such projects, he argues.

“I call it a ‘BECCS and switch,'” he says, adding later: “It's folly at some level.”

For a biomass-fueled power plant, BECCS works like this:A tree captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as it grows, sequestering the carbon in its bark, trunk, branches, and roots while releasing the oxygen. Someone then cuts it down, converts it into wood pellets, and delivers it to a power plant that, in turn, burns the wood to produce heat or electricity.

Usually, that facility will produce carbon dioxide as the wood incinerates. But under both European Union and US rules, the burning of the wood is generally treated as carbon neutral, so long as the timber forests are managed in sustainable ways and the various operations abide by other regulations. The argument is that the tree pulled CO2 out of the air in the first place, and new plant growth will bring that emissions debt back into balance over time. 

If that same power plant now captures a significant share of the greenhouse gas produced in the process and pumps it underground, the process can potentially go from carbon neutral to carbon negative.

But the starting assumption that biomass is carbon neutral is fundamentally flawed, because it doesn't fully take into account other ways that emissions are released throughout the process, according to Searchinger.

Among other things, a proper analysis must also ask: How much carbon is left behind in roots or branches on the forest floor that will begin to decompose and release greenhouse gases after the plant is removed? How much fossil fuel was burned in the process of cutting, collecting, and distributing the biomass? How much greenhouse gas was produced while converting timber into wood pellets and shipping them elsewhere? And how long will it take to grow back the trees or plants that would have otherwise continued capturing and storing carbon?

“If you're harvesting wood, it's essentially impossible to get negative emissions,” Searchinger says.

Burning biomass, or the biofuels created from it, can also produce other forms of pollution that can harm human health, including particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide.

Preventing carbon dioxide emissions at a given factory may necessitate capturing certain other pollutants as well, notably sulfur dioxide. But it doesn't necessarily filter out all the other pollution floating out of the flue stack, notes Emily Grubert, an associate professor of sustainable energy policy at the University of Notre Dame who focuses on carbon management issues and the transition away from fossil fuels. 

The idea that we might be able to use biomass to generate energy and suck down carbon dates back decades. But as global temperatures and emissions both continued to rise, climate modelers found that more and more BECCS or other types of carbon removal would be needed to prevent the planet from tipping past increasingly dangerous warming thresholds.

In addition to dramatic cuts in emissions, the world may need to suck down 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year by 2050 and 20 billion by 2100 to limit warming to 2 °C over preindustrial levels, according to a 2022 UN climate panel report. That's a threshold we're increasingly likely to blow past.

These grave climate warnings sparked growing interest and investments in ways to draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Companies sprang up offering to sink seaweed, bury biomass, develop carbon-sucking direct air capture factories, and add alkaline substances to agricultural fields or the oceans. 

But BECCS purchases have dwarfed those other approaches.

For companies with fast-approaching climate deadlines, BECCS is one of the few options for removing hundreds of thousands of tons over the next few years, says Robert Höglund, who cofounded CDR.fyi, ​​a public-benefit corporation that analyzes the carbon removal sector.

“If you have a target you want to meet in 2030 and you want durable carbon removal, that's the thing you can buy,” he says.

That's chiefly because these projects can harness the infrastructure of existing industries. At least for now, you don't have to finance, permit, and develop new facilities.

“They're not that hard to build, because it's often a retrofitting of an existing plant,” Höglund says. 

BECCS is also substantially less expensive for buyers than, say, direct air capture, with weighted average prices of $210 a ton compared with $490 among the deals to date, according to CDR.fyi. That's in part because capturing the carbon dioxide from, say, a pulp and paper mill, where it makes up around 15% of flue gas, takes far less energy than plucking CO2 molecules out of the open air, where they account for just 0.04%.

In 2020, Microsoft announced plans to become carbon negative by the end of this decade and, by midcentury, to remove all the emissions the company generated directly and from electricity use throughout its corporate history. 

It's leaning particularly heavily on BECCS to meet those climate commitments, with the category accounting for 76% of its known carbon removal purchases to date.

In April, the company announced it would purchase 3.7 million tons of carbon dioxide that a paper and pulp mill, located at some unspecified site in the southern US, will eventually capture and store over a 12-year period. It reached the deal through CO280, a startup based in Vancouver, British Columbia, that is forming joint ventures with paper and pulp mill companies in the US and Canada, to finance, develop, and operate the projects. 

It was the biggest carbon removal purchase on record—until four days later, when Microsoft revealed it had agreed to buy 6.75 million tons of carbon removal from AtmosClear, CDR.fyi noted. That company is building a biomass power plant at the Port of Greater Baton Rouge in Louisiana, which will run largely on sugarcane bagasse (a by-product of sugar production) and forest trimmings. AtmosClear says the facility will be able to capture 680,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year.

“What we've seen is a lot of these BECCS projects have been very helpful, if not transformational, for providing investment in rural economies,” Marrs says. “We look at our BECCS deals, in Louisiana with AtmosClear and some other Gulf State providers, like CO280, as a real means of helping support these economies, while at the same time promoting sustainable forestry practices.”

In earlier quarters, Microsoft also made substantial purchases from Orsted, which operates power plants that burn wood pellets; Gaia, which runs facilities that convert municipal waste into energy; and Arbor, whose plants are fueled by “overgrown brush, crop residues, and food waste.” 

Notably, at least three of these projects rely on some form of waste, a category distinct from fresh-cut timber or crops grown for the purpose of fueling BECCS projects. Solid waste, agricultural residues, logging leftovers, and plant material removed from forests to prevent fires present some of the ripest opportunities for BECCS—as well as some difficult questions of carbon accounting.

A 2019 report from the National Academy of Sciences estimated that the US could achieve more than 500 million tons of carbon removal a year through BECCS by 2040, while the world could exceed 3.5 billion tons, by relying just on agricultural by-products, logging residues, and organic waste—without needing to grow crops dedicated to energy.

Roger Aines, chief scientist of the energy program at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, argues we should at least be putting these sources to use rather than burning them or leaving them to decompose in fields. (Aines coauthored a similar analysis focused on California's waste biomass and contributed to a 2022 lab report prepared for Microsoft to evaluate costs and options for carbon removal purchases.)

He stresses that the BECCS sector can learn a lot from using that waste material. For example, it should help to provide a sharper sense of whether the carbon math will work if more land, forests, and crops are dedicated to these sorts of purposes.

“The point is you won't grow new material to do this in most cases, and won't have to for a very long time, because there's so much waste available,” Aines says. “If we get to that point, long into the future, we can address that then.”

But the critical question that emerges with waste is: Would it otherwise have been burned or allowed to decompose, or might some of it have been used in some other way that kept the carbon out of the atmosphere? 

Sugarcane bagasse, for instance, is or could also be used to produce recyclable packaging and paper, biodegradable food packaging and cutlery, building materials, or soil amendments that add nutrients back to agricultural fields.

“A lot of the time those materials are being used for something else already, so the accounting gets wonky really quickly,” Grubert says. 

Some fear that the financial incentives to pursue BECCS could also compel companies to trim away more trees and plants than is truly necessary to, say, manage forests or prevent fires—particularly as more and more BECCS plants create greater and greater demand for the limited supplies of such materials.

“Once you start capturing waste, you create an incentive to produce waste, so you have to be very careful about the perverse incentives,” says Danny Cullenward, a researcher and senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania who studies carbon markets.

Like other big tech companies, Microsoft has lost some momentum when it comes to its climate goals, in large part because of the surging energy demands of its AI data centers. 

But the company has generally earned a reputation for striving to clean up its direct emissions where possible and for seeking out high-quality approaches to carbon removal. It has consulted extensively with critically minded researchers at advisory firms like Carbon Direct and demonstrated a willingness to pay higher prices to support more credible projects.

Marrs says the company has extended that scrutiny to its BECCS deals.

“We want as much positive environmental impact as possible from every project,” he says.

“We're doing months and months of technical due diligence with teams that visit the site, that interview stakeholders, that produce a report for us that we go through in depth with a third-party engineering provider or technical perspective provider,” he adds.

In a follow-up statement, Microsoft stressed that it strives to validate that every BECCS project it supports will achieve negative emissions, whatever the fuel source.

“Across all of these projects, we conducted substantial due diligence to ensure that BECCS feedstocks would otherwise return carbon to the atmosphere in a few years,” the company said. 

Likewise, Jonathan Rhone, the cofounder and chief executive of CO280, stresses that they've worked with consultants, carbon market registries, and pulp and paper mills “to make sure we're adopting the best standards.” He says they strive to conservatively assess the release and uptake of greenhouse gases across the supply chain of the mills they work with, taking into account the type of biomass used by a given plant, the growth rate of the forests it's harvested from, the distance trucks drive to ship the timber or sawmill residues, the total emissions of the facility, and more.

Rhone says its typical projects will capture and store away on the order of 850,000 to 900,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. How much that would make up of the plant's total emissions would vary, based in part on how much of the facility's energy comes from by-product biomatter and how much comes from fossil fuels. For its first projects, the company will aim to capture 50% to 65% of the CO2 emissions at the pulp and paper mills, but it eventually hopes to exceed 90%. 

In a follow-up email, Rhone said the carbon capture equipment at the mills it works with will also prevent “substantial levels” of particulate matter and sulfur dioxide emissions and might reduce emissions of other pollutants as well.

The company is in active discussions with 10 pulp and paper mills in the Gulf Coast and Canada. Each carbon capture and storage project could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. 

“What we're trying to do at CO280 is show and demonstrate that we can create a stable, repeatable playbook for developing projects that are low risk and provide the market with what it wants, with what it needs,” Rhone says. 

Proponents of BECCS say we could leverage biomass to deliver substantial volumes of carbon removal, so long as appropriate industry standards are put in place to prevent, or at least minimize, bad behavior.

The question is whether that will be the case—or whether, as the BECCS sector matures, it will veer closer to the pattern of carbon offset markets. 

Studies and investigations have consistently shown that loosely regulated or poorly designed carbon credit and offset programs have allowed, if not invited, companies to significantly exaggerate the climate benefits of tree planting, forest preservation, and similar projects. 

“It appears to me to be something that will be manageable but that we'll always have to keep an eye on,” Aines says. 

Even with all these carbon accounting complexities, BECCS projects can often deliver climate benefits, particularly for existing plants.

Adding carbon capture to an operating paper and pulp mill, power plant, or refinery is at least an improvement over the status quo from a climate perspective, insofar as it prevents emissions that would otherwise have continued.

But ambitions for BECCS are already growing beyond existing plants: Last year Drax, the controversial UK power giant, announced plans to launch a Houston-based division tasked with developing enough new BECCS projects to deliver 6 million tons of carbon removal per year, in the US or elsewhere.

Numerous other companies have also built or proposed biomass power plants in recent years, with or without carbon capture systems—decisions driven in part by policies that classify them as carbon neutral.But if biomass isn't carbon neutral, as Searchinger and others argue it can't be in many applications, then these new unfiltered power plants are just adding more emissions to the atmosphere—and BECCS projects aren't drawing any out of the air. And if that's the case, it raises tough questions about corporate climate claims that depend on its doing so and the societal trade-offs involved in building lots of new plants dedicated to these purposes.

That's because crops grown for energy require land, fertilizer, insecticides, and human labor that might otherwise go toward producing food for an expanding global population. And greater demand for wood invites the timber industry to chop down more and more of the world's forests, which are already sucking up and storing away vast amounts of carbon dioxide and providing homes for immense varieties of plants and animals.

If these projects are merely preventing greenhouse gas from floating into the atmosphere but not drawing any down, we're better off adding carbon capture and storage (CCS) equipment to an existing natural-gas plant instead, Searchinger argues.

Companies may think that harnessing nature to draw carbon dioxide out of the sky sounds better than cutting the emissions of a fossil-fuel turbine. But the electricity from the latter plant would cost dramatically less, the carbon capture system would reduce emissions more for the amount of same energy generated, and it would avoid the added pressures to cut down trees, he says.

“People think some magic happens—this magic combination of using biomass and CCS creates something bigger than its parts,” Searchinger says. “But it's not magic; it's simply the sum of the two.” 

The industry is getting billions, but it's way too early to count on fusion to meet growing electricity demand.

Lilac Solutions is pioneering a new type of lithium extraction that could double US production in two years and shake up the industry. 

Plus, scientists are fighting back against the administration's climate misinformation.

A U.S. Border Patrol video featuring antisemitic lyrics went viral on X on Tuesday after far-right users discovered it had been posted to Facebook and Instagram. The video, which included the lyrics “Jew me” and “kike me,” was deleted from the platforms on Wednesday morning, though it's not clear whether the offensive content was taken down by Border Patrol or Meta.

The 13-second video appears to have been posted to Instagram in August, but was pinned in the Reels section of the official Border Patrol page, making it more visible to a wider audience. The video only gained widespread attention late Tuesday on X, where far-right extremists celebrated a signal that was clearly intended for them. The Instagram video had 3.4 million views when Gizmodo viewed it Tuesday night.

The audio used in the clip comes from Michael Jackson's controversial 1995 song “They Don't Care About Us.” The song includes the lyrics “Jew me, sue me, everybody do me/ Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me.”

The lyrics were criticized at the time for being antisemitic, though Jackson defended his words, insisting he didn't intend for them to be offensive. The singer, who died in 2009, issued an apology and later released an edited version of the song.

The video starts with footage of someone adjusting a bodycam before viewers see Border Patrol agents walking around with guns. Another shot shows a truck hauling Border Patrol dune buggies, and then a shot in the desert where a dune buggy kicks up dust behind it.

Gizmodo saved a copy of the Border Patrol video before it was taken down from Instagram and Facebook.

The video is very short, making it clear that the choice of lyrics was the intentional focus. Viewers are obviously meant to hear the antisemitic aspects, since it's more or less the only audio in the 13 seconds being presented. DHS didn't respond to questions from Gizmodo on Wednesday morning.

Comments on Instagram included people who clearly understood the message of the video as antisemitic. One commenter replied, “based song choice,” which was liked by the Border Patrol account. Another commenter wrote, “if you know you know.”

Comments from the far-right on X were even more explicit, including “This deserves 6 million likes and shares,” a reference to the number of Jews who died in the Holocaust.

Other commenters on X marveled at how mainstream their far-right and antisemitic ideas were becoming, with one person writing, “This movie is taking a strange turn. It's strange to me because I never thought I'd see this in the mainstream—it was always underground.”

And while it's accurate to describe the shift as “strange,” it was entirely predictable after President Donald Trump was inaugurated for a second time in January. Billionaire Elon Musk really kicked off the tone of the era with two Nazi-style salutes. Musk later denied he was making Nazi gestures, but many of his supporters clearly took it as a sign that they could drop the mask. Steve Bannon, a former top advisor to Trump, made the same salute not long after.

Trump himself has also said some extremely antisemitic things, including when he used the term “shylock” at a rally in July.

“No death tax, no estate tax, no going to the banks and borrowing from, in some cases, a fine banker. And in some cases, shylocks and bad people.”

In fact, there's an entire Wikipedia page devoted to collecting examples of Trump's antisemitism.

U.S. Border Patrol is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which has been posting far-right extremist content since Trump took office for a second time. In a tweet on Tuesday, DHS posted just one word, “Remigrate,” a term more popular in Europe among the far-right that refers to ethnic cleansing through deporting non-white people.

DHS also posted a video that included the words “Save America” in a typeface that's clearly meant to evoke Nazi-era imagery.

The dog whistles from DHS are blaring foghorns at this point

DHS has frequently posted fascist propaganda using copyrighted material without permission, something that sometimes gets the content removed from the major social media platforms.

The people of DHS often know they're the bad guys, like when they responded to questions from John Oliver's HBO show by talking about the “heroism” of Darth Vader. The late-night host was asking about a video posted by Gregory Bovino—the new face of anti-immigrant operations in the U.S., with his frequent appearances on TV—where Vader is destroying rebel forces labeled with things like “gang member,” and “fake news.”

Is a lot of this trolling? Sure, that's one defense of it. But at some point, you own the words and images that you push into the world. And if you spend all day, every day saying racist and antisemitic things, people have to start taking you at your word.

Not to mention the fact that DHS has real power in the world to upend lives and has no business joking or “trolling” the American people. Agencies under DHS, like ICE, are currently harassing and arresting people for looking Latino. And that often includes American citizens.

Ironically, DHS said back in April that social media would be screened for “antisemitism” by any foreign nationals in the country. In reality, DHS was looking for anyone who opposed the war in Gaza, falsely equating such a position with antisemitism. The U.S. State Department announced Tuesday it had canceled the visas of six people who had written negative things about Charlie Kirk.

Antisemitism runs deep in the modern Republican Party. Politico published leaked texts from the Young Republicans on Tuesday, which included messages like “I love Hitler.” Vice President JD Vance defended the texts and dismissed criticism as “pearl-clutching.” And guys like Vance know their audience. They can be dismissed as shitposters, but they're some of the most vile racists on the planet, and they're becoming normalized in ways that would've been unthinkable even a decade ago.

Americans who are opposed to Trump plan to stage nationwide protests on Saturday, Oct. 18, for what's being dubbed another No Kings rally. Republicans have tried to characterize the upcoming protests as hate marches, falsely insisting they would be full of “Hamas supporters.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Wednesday that the reason the government hasn't opened yet is because of the upcoming demonstrations, a claim that makes no sense whatsoever.

“This crazy No Kings rally this weekend, which is gonna be the farthest left, the hardest core, the most unhinged in the Democratic Party, which is a big title. No Kings equals no paychecks,” said Bessent.

The No Kings rally, which is likely to include a wide variety of Americans who are opposed to Trump's fascist takeover of the country, has a website that allows people to find their nearest demonstration. It won't just be the “hardest core,” as Bessent puts it, if past protests are any guide.

Everything is an Xbox now, right? If that's the case, why can't we mod our smart fridge or smart toaster with screens to transform them into the rough approximation of an Xbox gaming machine? The hard truth is that there is no unified sense of “Xbox” anymore. That's epitomized by the $1,000 Asus ROG Xbox Ally X handheld. It's the first piece of real gaming hardware with an Xbox name to roll out in five years. Despite the moniker, it's far more of a PC than it is any flavor of Xbox console. And thanks to Microsoft's efforts to fix Windows for a small screen, it's one of the best handheld PCs yet.

The ROG Xbox Ally X can certainly compete with Valve's Steam Deck, and it can do so without worrying about kernel anti-cheat compatibility. The one point it can't compete on is price. At $1,000, the ROG Xbox Ally X will seem like an overindulgent splurge that won't net you the ease or comforts of a true-blue console. And though it has better graphics potential than Valve's handheld, maximizing its capabilities requires coaxing.

If this is what we can expect from “Xbox” going forward, then console gamers had better get used to their new PC playground—whether that means adjusting power and graphics settings or dealing with Windows' penchant for bugs and missing settings. But it also means a cleaner, more gamer-focused experience than any other handheld Windows device released over the past several years can match.

Asus ROG Xbox Ally X

It's the first step on a long road to reinventing the Xbox brand. In the meantime, it's one of the best handheld PCs you can get, despite one glaring bug.

Pros

Cons

The real innovation of the Xbox Ally is the new “full screen experience,” or FSE. The built-in software finally alleviates the excruciating experience of forcing Windows 11 desktop to run on a 7-inch screen. Now, a hit of that newfangled Xbox button pulls up most (but not all) of the features and apps you need. Even better, you can access games across the most popular game launchers with a few quick taps. Plus, the device promises better performance on this version of Windows. In our tests, that proved true compared to devices with similar specs.

The new UI is imperfect, and the software is far from complete. You'll still find game launchers or incongruous settings that require you to muddy your screen with your grubby fingerprints. There are options missing—some are still stuck behind Windows settings—and I've experienced concerning issues with the device depleting standby power, as if leaking juice like sand through an hourglass. Since this handheld has the entire weight of Microsoft's gaming arm behind it, I hope updates come swiftly and that the FSE makes its way to more handhelds than just the one bearing Microsoft's Xbox logo.

Still, this isn't the Nintendo Switch 2 of the Xbox brand. The Xbox Ally is the kind of device to make me imagine what a true merging of PC and Xbox could be. It could prove an expensive disaster—or a glorious (but still expensive) shift to the entire gaming landscape.

Xbox told me that Microsoft and Asus started working together shortly after the launch of the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X to craft the new handheld. What, can't you tell? It's the two prongs on both sides of the device that the two partners in crime claim was modeled directly on the Xbox wireless controller. When you hold the controller and Xbox Ally up together, you'll see the similarity isn't 1-to-1—not that it matters. Each prong holds a rumble motor that feels far more present than those of other unibody handhelds do.

Despite all that, I wouldn't go as far as to say it's more ergonomic than flat body designs. I can curl my digits around a Steam Deck and play comfortably just as well as I can with the ROG Xbox Ally X.

This is still a PC. With that in mind, you have access to two USB-C ports (one being USB-4 compatible, for hooking up external devices like an eGPU) on top alongside a microSD slot and a headphone jack. There's no port on the bottom to enable a Switch-like dock. In fact, all your regular Steam Deck docks you bought for other handhelds may not work as well with the two grips sticking out from the body. My Steam Deck Dock from Gulikit does not fit the Xbox Ally, even though it's perfectly usable with past handhelds.

While I didn't find the grips supremely comfortable, there's another extra benefit to the controller-like design. My wrists never fell asleep as I lost circulation while playing while lying down, like they often do when I'm using my personal Steam Deck or Switch 2. I like to play my handhelds in bed, so the extra grips proved to be a plus despite making the handheld even thicker.

It weighs in at 1.58 pounds, which is barely any more heft than the original $800 ROG Ally X and lighter than other handheld PCs like the Legion Go lineup.

The triggers and bumper buttons also have a feel akin to the Xbox controller and its “Impulse” triggers with individual vibration motors. The sides of the device are sloped more than they are on the ROG Ally X, meaning I don't need to perform any crab claw gestures to access the LB and RB buttons. But if you were expecting the device to feel exactly like an Xbox controller, you'll end up disappointed. The A,B,X,Y layout is the same, but the look and feel of both the buttons and joysticks are far more ROG Ally than Xbox.

In the end, all that matters is if it feels good to play. I can comfortably say: It does.

Beyond the twin menu buttons, the only switch you need to care about for menu navigation is the new Xbox button found next to Asus' own Armoury Crate toggle. Hitting the button once brings up the Game Bar menu, delivering quick access to your game library across all launchers. Hitting the library button will take you to the Xbox app, where you can access Game Pass (you get a three-month Xbox Game Pass Premium subscription with the device; just don't forget to cancel) and Xbox Cloud gaming. It's here you'll also find your library of both games and supported apps, which mostly include game launchers.

Xbox gamers who have never had to even consider their consoles' power draw will now need to start thinking about TDP, or thermal design power. Despite originally telling me it was working on a replacement for power management, Microsoft left Asus' Armoury Crate software in this handheld. You can access the program from the Game Bar to tweak the power draw you're sending to the processor. More TDP means better performance at the cost of battery life. As a rule of thumb, you can stick to lower performance modes for two-dimensional or less intensive games. For everything else, shift it to “Turbo,” which ends up at 25W on battery power, or the max 35W if you have the device plugged in.

How does it fare compared to Valve's SteamOS, the Linux-based operating system made popular by the Steam Deck? Like SteamOS, the Windows FSE is a controller-first layout designed to make accessing the Xbox game store and your game library easier than it is on a desktop. Firms like Asus, Lenovo, and MSI have designed front ends to enable some easy access to your titles, but the FSE has come closest to a “console-like” feel.

When you hold down the Xbox button, you can easily swap between open apps. Want to access Steam's Big Picture Mode? It's a few taps away, with no need to muddy the touchscreen with your fingerprints. It's here you'll also see an option to open up desktop mode if there are platforms you can't access through the Xbox app.

Asus originally described the FSE to me as the system dual booting Windows. However, the improved performance is available in either variation.

As if you needed another reminder, this is a PC, not an Xbox console. A 2023 update redesigned the Xbox app so it could be navigated with a controller. There's still more work to be done on this front. You can't use the right stick to scroll. There isn't enough use of the RB and LB buttons for navigating through side-by-side menus. Beyond those hangups, what's particularly egregious is just how limited Microsoft made its first-party software. On the Linux-based SteamOS, I can drop into the desktop mode, install Emulation Station, and access it from the Steam Deck's home menu. The Xbox app will recognize apps like GOG Galaxy, Epic Games Store, Battle.net, and Ubisoft Connect, but it won't enable other apps you may load on. Accessing them requires entering the Desktop Mode. SteamOS can be tweaked to allow third-party apps to appear on the home screen, but Microsoft, being Microsoft, won't let you do the same with the FSE.

What's often lost in the rat race for better performance is the fact that small improvements mean a lot on a power-sipping device like a handheld: A 5 fps difference can determine whether a game is playable or not.

AMD's Ryzen Z2 Extreme offers only a marginal bump in performance compared with the Ryzen Z1 Extreme that hit the scene two years ago. However, the updates Microsoft made to Windows 11 also supposedly limit background tasks and boost performance. From what I experienced comparing the Lenovo Legion Go 2 to the ROG Xbox Ally X, that seems to check out. Asus' device displayed small performance gains (the delta varied by title, of course) at the same resolution and TDP.

There are areas in which Lenovo's handheld wins, of course. The Legion Go 2 contains 32GB of RAM; the Ally sports just 24 alongside its 1TB of SSD storage. The Legion also sports a massive 8.8-inch OLED display. After spending more than a week with the Xbox Ally's 7-inch IPS LCD, I miss those deeper black levels and contrast.

But for that specific upgrade, you have to drop the price equivalent of a new Nintendo Switch—$350 after recent price hikes. Lenovo's Legion Go 2 held the price record among AMD Ryzen Z-series devices with the astronomical $1,350 launch price of its AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme model. The same APU—or accelerated processing unit—can be found in the much more affordable ROG Xbox Ally.

At 1080p resolution and 35W when plugged in, I could get around 52 frames per second in Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam Deck settings. In actual gameplay, you'll see frame rates at just under 50 fps in most scenarios. At 30W, last year's ROG Ally hits around 46 fps. Other games, like Shadow of the Tomb Raider, see better uplift, with the new Xbox Ally X netting around 10 fps more than its predecessor.

Synthetic benchmarks may help us get a better idea of how much the device has improved. The Xbox Ally X netted around 400 points more than its predecessor did on 3DMark Steel Nomad Light and did 600 points better on 3DMark Time Spy. In actual gameplay, the difference is more minute, especially at the highest wattage. On some tests, notably 3DMark and games like Baldur's Gate III, the device didn't perform exceptionally better than the MSI Claw 8 AI+ running an Intel Core Ultra 258V. On others, the Ryzen Z2 Extreme underperformed Intel's mobile chip.

But the Z2 Extreme's secret weapon is that it performs better at lower wattages than previous generations did. When testing multiple games at 15-25W, relying often on AMD's FSR upscaling, I could finally achieve playable frame rates on titles like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Star Wars Outlaws. (Even on the “Turbo” profile, the device defaults to 25W when running on battery.) I found that I could run multiple current AAA games, and a few unreleased Xbox titles, at playable frame rates with just a bit of finagling in the graphics settings.

And here's another secret: You don't even need the FSE to get this boost. Xbox claimed the latest Windows build (which includes the FSE) would separately enhance the Ally's performance, and that has more than panned out. I updated the Lenovo Legion Go 2 to the latest Windows Insider Update without bothering to install the updated user interface. It displayed bigger performance improvements than the Ally had (perhaps influenced by the Legion's additional memory, which is the most significant difference between the two systems). The update moved the needle by 5 fps or more in games like Cyberpunk 2077 and up to 3 fps in Shadow of the Tomb Raider.

There's a voice in the back of my brain that's hard to ignore. It tells me to shake my fist at Microsoft in a “man yells at cloud” fashion over how simple this fix seems to have been. Are you telling me we could have had this level of gaming performance on Windows this whole time?

There's a “just fine” quality to the ROG Xbox Ally's 1080p display. It's a semi-glossy IPS LCD that lacks the “inky” qualities of OLED. I eventually tired of the large bezels surrounding the display, and the size makes it difficult to read text in RPGs like Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader and other RPGs. The screen is plenty bright indoors and in ambient light, but it's still not enough to survive direct sunlight. It didn't help that I was moving between the Asus model and the Legion Go 2 in quick succession; for some, the larger screen will probably be worth the extra heft. Still, the Ally's panel is serviceable in the same way that Apple's MacBook displays get the job done, even if it's the same damn screen every damn year and there's a big notch.

The 120Hz refresh rate, now a constant throughout three Ally generations, is more than enough for 3D titles. However, when you opt to play a game like Hollow Knight: Silksong or Hades II, and your game can easily net over 160 fps on the lowest power settings, you may start to feel a little cheated after paying $1,000 for a handheld like this.

Sound quality through the dual speakers was nothing to write home about either. Audio got plenty loud, but unlike when using the Legion Go 2, I wanted to reach for a pair of gaming headphones or earbuds more often. It wasn't terrible, and neither were the visuals, but the whole affair did feel a bit lackluster for a third-generation device in the Ally's price category.

Handhelds don't have great battery life. The Xbox Ally X, with its 80Wh battery, can claim more playable time than most other handhelds. The Lenovo Legion Go 2 and MSI Claw 8 AI+, with their larger screens and higher resolution, will sap energy faster. The Switch 2 has notoriously poor battery life, and you'll be lucky to get two hours out of that. Still, don't count on the Ally to get you through long-haul flights. I eked out around three and half playable hours of Hades II at low power before the device was begging for the sweet embrace of a power cable. More intense titles could cut another hour off that span.

The Xbox Ally X has other problems when trying to go to sleep. There were times I tried to put it to bed by hitting the power button, only to receive a gray screen and be prompted to restart my game.

There were also multiple instances in which I thought I'd successfully put my review unit to sleep via the power button, only to later find it had been sucking power for hours and eventually died. The fans would occasionally kick in while asleep, which indicates to me there's an issue Microsoft needs to fix before I can safely store the device away after a quick gaming session.

It's clear Microsoft was working on this software until the last minute, and that means there's still work needed to clear up these glitches. The issues were enough to diminish what would otherwise have been a glowing review.

High-end handhelds now cost more than $1,000. Sorry, but that's what we should expect from now until Sony releases a handheld PlayStation 6. The base ROG Xbox Ally, available in in white, features a lower-end Ryzen Z2A chip that I have not yet had the opportunity to fully test. That system is positioned to compete with the $550 Steam Deck OLED and Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS. Inevitably, because of tariffs and trade retaliations from China, we shouldn't expect many budget handheld releases aside from Nintendo's more restrictive hybrid console.

There's a part of me that believes prospective handheld buyers should hold off for the next generation. Today's Z2 Extreme devices are running on an RDNA 3.5 GPU. Tomorrow's may instead include a chip based on AMD's RDNA 4 architecture, which would mean access to AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution 4. That would offer improved AI upscaling, making games appear to run at higher resolutions than they actually are. The technology may be a staple of future consoles, and Microsoft and Sony will likely push developers to use it. The Xbox Ally X will be left out of the loop.

On the other hand, Microsoft seems keen to improve the FSE in preparation for a next-gen Xbox console. Hopefully, that means Xbox has enough incentive to fix what's broken and polish the experience to a squeaky-clean shine. Is that enough to make me abandon the Steam Deck? Maybe one day. Is it enough to give Xbox gamers the new hardware they're looking for? It'll depend on their tolerance for the PC gaming lifestyle.

'We clarify that MSI has never officially sold or distributed the GeForce RTX 5090 in China'

MSI has issued a statement clarifying that it does not sell Nvidia's RTX 5090 GPU, following a spate of rumors and a photograph circulating online depicting hundreds of MSI-branded cards at an unspecified location in the country.

Three days ago, a user on Reddit posted an image showing unattended pallets of RTX 5090 GPUs lying in a street in China. This prompted online chatter pertaining to a lack of enforcement for export controls, as the RTX 5090 is one of many high-end cards that are banned from export to China. Aware of the PR connotations of getting caught, or even accused, of dealing the GPUs in the region, MSI was quick to issue a rebuttal.

In a new statement posted on its site, the company has clarified that it had nothing to do with the RTX 5090 shipments spotted in China, and claims the global serial number tracking has confirmed they are parallel imports — when a genuine product is imported through questionable means, without the explicit permission of the parent company.

Dealers skirting export controls on high-demand GPUs remains a headache for Washington. Just recently, a Singaporean company was accused of helping smuggle $2 billion worth of Nvidia GPUs into the country. We've known for a while now that underground markets exist in the region, where cards are regularly modded with increased VRAM to make them better for AI applications.

All of this leads to a precedent where, even though Beijing shouldn't be the recipient of high-end AI cards on paper, reality begs to differ. Nvidia has made region-specific RTX 5090D and 5090D V2 models for China, but they carry neutered specs, which leads to shady, black-market shipments thriving. Nvidia has always held the position that China is an important market for the chipmaker, but that it, too, has nothing to do with how the region keeps getting its hands on banned GPUs.

 




MSI reiterated that it only sells its RTX 5090 in the U.S., Europe, and some Asia-Pacific markets, and that any unauthorized units obtained via grey channels are not covered under warranty. These illicit GPUs allegedly arrived in China through third-party resellers and retailers in overseas markets who bypassed regulations and illegally imported the cards.

While there was no word on any active investigations or whether the hardware manufacturer plans to take action, MSI did note that any products bought through non-official channels may have been resold or tampered with, and aren't eligible for warranty, repair services, or technical support. MSI is a Taiwanese company, a country that remains imperative in the ongoing U.S.–China trade war, and is an extremely sensitive region geopolitically. A significant portion of MSI's production facilities is located in Mainland China.

The GPU shortage during COVID could soon look like child's play.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AI datacenters are eating up the world's supply standard DRAM memory, NAND flash for SSDs, and hard drives. Adata chairman Simon Chen just made it extremely clear that in his three-decade tenure in the industry, he's never witnessed a simultaneous shortage of all of the aforementioned components, via a DigiTimes Asia report.

Chen goes on to explicitly state that Adata and its usual competitors aren't fighting between themselves for supply in what would be businesss as usual. Instead, cloud service providers (CSPs) — almost always AI datacenters in this day and age — are now gobbling up all available capacity of these components.

As if all that wasn't enough, Chen believes that the shortage of hard drives is incentivizing customers to try and purchase SSDs for non-volatile storage needs instead, further twisting the spiral of storage scarcity. Adata's sales team has purportedly gotten instructions to ""sell sparingly"" and ""give priority to loyal customers"" in turn.

Additionally, the inventory at upstream suppliers is charitably described as barebones, with only two to three weeks' worth of supply, down from the usual two-to-three months of capacity. In other words, that means that SK hynix, Samsung, Micron, Kioxia, and Western Digital are selling most everything they make to AI projects.

In case you're not entirely convinced of how big a deal Chen's suspicion-confirming statements are, Adata had a 11% share in the SSD market in 2024, and holds a 5% slice of the memory market. Those are small percentages, but they're for the entire world, meaning that Adata purchases memory and flash chips at large volumes and careful negotiated prices. The deals are likely done multiple months in advance, and Adata certainly would otherwise have far bigger negotiation power than, say, Joe's Discount Memory.

The company's stock price has climbed sky-high since August, and it hit a 15-year revenue high in Q2 2025. That's keeping in tandem with the general industry trend, with DRAM revenue jumping 17.1% in the past fiscal quarter, and enterprise SSD revenue boosting by 12.7%. Even CPU/GPU chipmakers are charging gigantic premiums for their top-shelf wares, too.

All of this AI-fueled demand is now affecting the supply chain for all modern consumer electronics. Most any advanced device, including phones, TVs, consoles, and cars, all need one or more of the components that are now in high demand. If you're on the fence on whether to purchase a new handset, computer, or television, you'd be wise to consider moving sooner rather than later. Even if AI isn't taking all of our jobs, it seems poised to take all of our silicon.

A greater proportion of physicians left clinical practice in 2019 than in 2013, across regions and specialties, with higher risks for exit among female and rural physicians.

“This evidence can help facilitate clinical operations and policy efforts to maintain the physician workforce, and accordingly, patients' access to physician care,” the study authors wrote.

This study was led by Lisa S. Rotenstein, MD, MBA, MSc, of the University of California, San Francisco. It was published online on October 07, 2025, in Annals of Internal Medicine.

The results may not represent physicians who did not take Medicare. Physicians were classified by the specialty they billed most often. The outcome measured complete exit from practice rather than drops in time spent working.

This study received funding from the Physicians Foundation. One author reported receiving support from the funding agency.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

John M. Mandrola, MD: Hi, everyone. This is John Mandrola, from theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology. I'm here in Madrid, Spain, at the ESC meeting. I have my friend Prash Sanders, who is a full professor and luminary in electrophysiology. He's at the University of Adelaide, and he presented in the late-breaking science session today a trial called CAAN-AF. 

This is a trial dealing with one of the things that we don't often talk about in the AFib community, which is AV node ablation. I was really excited to hear the results of this trial. Prash, tell us about the trial and what happened.

Prashanthan Sanders, MBBS, PhD: This is a trial that looks at patients who have cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator devices and permanent atrial ablation. The question is, should we be medically rate-controlling them or should we undertake an AV node ablation? There are some data to say that patients, if you ablate the AV node, do better. These are observational data. 

Here's a randomized study with one-to-one randomization of patients to medical rate control or to AV node ablation, and we found no difference over a 2-year period on a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and nonfatal heart failure events.

That's a big deal because our current guidelines actually say that we should be considering AV node ablation in anyone who's not pacing more than 95% biventricularly. This argues that that shouldn't be an empirical decision for us to be making. 

Mandrola: This is a remarkable finding because it's a trial that found no difference, so a negative trial, that disrupts the guidelines. It's usually the other way around, right? It's usually a positive trial disrupting guidelines. This is the beautiful thing about evidence. Evidence is evidence. It doesn't matter how it comes out. 

For the audience, the CRT devices: CRT, cardiac resynchronization therapy, biventricular pacing, usually. The idea is that if you are going to resynchronize the heart with pacing, the device has to pace all the time. The more it paces, the more the benefit. If the patient's in atrial fibrillation, oftentimes the rate is higher than the paced rate. Then if they're conducting with that ugly left bundle branch block, they're not getting benefit from the device. Is this correct?

Sanders: That was our conventional thinking.

Mandrola: There are two ways to make this device pace. One is to lower the rate with medications, or to ablate the AV node. Then patients often, with an AV node ablation, have a decreased medication burden. 

In real life, when we do AV node ablation and someone has a very high AFib rate and we pace, we usually can take them off their medications and they get dramatically better. I went to your presentation thinking that this would be a highly positive trial because my experience and your observational data suggest that AV node ablation is really a remarkable thing to do for these patients. 

Sanders: Totally. Actually, the observational data would suggest that ablating the AV node improves these patients' mortality by 58%. That's dramatic. All-cause mortality improved, driven mainly by cardiovascular mortality. We went into this study expecting a positive result. With that 58% mortality benefit, we actually needed only a small study. 

When we planned the study, although we used a composite endpoint, not just all-cause mortality, we also assumed only a 25% reduction rather than a 58% reduction. We gave ourselves some space, but we did allow ourselves an interim analysis at every quarter of recruitment. 

Mandrola: Let me ask you about that interim analysis. Did you do the interim analysis because you were afraid it would be positive and you thought you would be terminating early?

Sanders: That's exactly why we gave that opportunity. We prespecified that we would look at the data because we fully expected this to be a positive result by the first quarter of patients.

Mandrola: Not only did we expect it, but the guidelines say that if a CRT device is not pacing, what, 90% or more? 

Sanders: 90%-95%. 

Mandrola: They recommend…

Sanders: AV junction ablation. 

Mandrola: Is it a level I recommendation?

Sanders: It's a level IIa with a B, nonrandomized, level of evidence. 

Mandrola: A very strong push and 90% biventricular pacing. That's a pretty strict number. 

Sanders: It's a very strict number. Importantly, in this population we studied, at baseline, it was 74% pacing in both groups when we monitored them by Holter monitoring to determine biventricular pacing amount. This would fit into that criteria where AV node ablation would've had to have a benefit.

Mandrola: If they were 74% biventricular pacing, you're well under the 90%. 

Sanders: Totally. 

Mandrola: Then what happened? 

Sanders: We did the analysis, and to our surprise, the event rates were almost identical. This was presented to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board who said, well, it's time for us to do a futility analysis on this.

We did a futility analysis, and it really showed that there was a 2.7% chance of us finding a difference with full recruitment, and that means a 97% chance that we will never find a difference. I think that's kind of important. 

There are a few points to recognize. We used an event rate from the COMPANION trial, which was 50 events per 100 years of monitoring. Our incidence was actually 34. Basically, since the COMPANION study, what's happened is our medical therapy has gotten much better and so the event rate has reduced significantly. 

If we now redo the power analysis, you need about 4300 patients per arm. As I mentioned in my presentation, if you then look at that in terms of futility based on the difference in the event rate between the two groups, you still had an 83% chance of being a futile study despite that large number. This is fairly definitive in terms of saying there is no difference between these two treatment arms for the population of patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and having CRT. 

Mandrola: I noticed from your presentation that there was 74% biventricular pacing. I would certainly get a message from our pacing center if a patient with a CRT was only biventricular pacing at 74%. I would worry about that. I also noticed in the trial that your heart rates were not very elevated, 

Sanders: That's a baseline heart rate. When they come in for their resting first visit, their heart rates were 72 beats/min in both groups. That was actually pretty good rate control at baseline. During the course of this study, with AV node ablation, the biventricular pacing increased to 98%, which is what we'd like to see. With medical rate control, it increased to 89%.

There was a significant difference in the true biventricular pacing that these patients achieved. Despite that, we didn't see the translation in any change in event rates. 

Mandrola: This maybe should change our thinking about what the best number or reasonable number of biventricular pacing percentage would be. Maybe we don't have to have 90%-95%. Maybe 89% or 85% or something along those lines is fine. 

Sanders: Absolutely. We really have to look at it on a case-by-case basis as opposed to saying everyone should be receiving AV junction ablation. I think that's what the message of the paper has to be, and it really should not be that guideline recommendation at such a high percentage.

Mandrola: This is a really important clinical trial that comes up showing no difference, and I think it should change guidelines and our thinking about what we're aiming for with biventricular pacing. 

Sanders: I totally agree. We have enough evidence here to say we need to change the way we are thinking. Sometimes you get these in trials. It certainly was a surprise to us. It was unexpected, but that's why we do trials. 

Mandrola: Excellent. Prash, thanks for talking with us. I really appreciate it. 

Sanders: Thanks, John.

A low-fat vegan diet that doesn't limit calories or carbohydrates could help people with type 1 diabetes reduce insulin use and insulin costs, according to new research by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine published in BMC Nutrition.

Insulin is a hormone that helps move glucose (sugar) from the blood into muscle and liver cells to be used as energy. People with type 1 diabetes must take insulin because their body doesn't produce enough. Some people with type 1 diabetes may need to take additional insulin, because they have insulin resistance, a condition in which cells don't respond well to insulin and glucose remains in the blood. Insulin resistance is strongly influenced by dietary fat, which can inhibit glucose from entering the cells.

The new research, which is a secondary analysis of a 2024 Physicians Committee study, compared the effect of a low-fat vegan diet to a portion-controlled diet on insulin use and insulin costs in people with type 1 diabetes. The analysis found that the total dose of insulin decreased by 28%, or 12.1 units, per day in the vegan group, compared to no significant change in the portion-controlled group. The reductions in insulin use in the vegan group likely reflect improved insulin sensitivity, or how well the body responds to insulin. Total insulin costs decreased by 27%, or $1.08 per day, in the vegan group, compared to no significant change in the portion-controlled group.

The 2024 study found that a vegan diet also led to an average weight loss of 11 pounds, improved insulin sensitivity and glycemic control, and improved cholesterol levels and kidney function in people with type 1 diabetes.

The new research comes as insulin prices in the United States continue to rise. Spending on insulin in the United States tripled in the past 10 years, reaching $22.3 billion in 2022, due to the increased usage and higher price of insulin, according to the American Diabetes Association. The inflation-adjusted cost of insulin increased by 24% from 2017 to 2022.

As insulin prices continue to rise, people with type 1 diabetes should consider a low-fat vegan diet, which can help improve their insulin sensitivity and reduce the amount of insulin they need, potentially saving them hundreds of dollars a year.""

Rodney Scott, MBChB, MRCP, DipStat, PhD, Division Chief of Neurology, Nemours Children's Health, Delaware Valley, has received a prestigious National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director's Transformative Research Award. Dr. Scott will use the $2.6 million, five-year grant to investigate malfunctions in the brain's hippocampal region, aiming to identify patterns that could lead to shared therapies for patients with autism, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease.

""In disorders like autism, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's, the part of the brain called the hippocampus doesn't function properly. Current treatments target each disease separately, often with limited success,"" Dr. Scott explained.

Instead, our research will look for shared abnormal brain activity patterns across conditions. If found, we will develop novel methods of brain stimulation that could restore healthy hippocampal function across a range of disorders.""

Dr. Rodney Scott, MBChB, MRCP, DipStat, PhD, Division Chief of Neurology, Nemours Children's Health, Delaware Valley

The NIH Transformative Research Awards promote cross-cutting, interdisciplinary approaches, supporting high-risk, high-reward research that could potentially create new paradigms for understanding disease and developing new therapies and preventive strategies.

Dr. Scott's project will analyze patterns of dysfunction in the hippocampus, the region of the brain that regulates memory and emotions. The research is based on the theory that autism, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's may share the same faulty mechanism-specifically, a disruption in the brain's neural networks. Through his NIH award, Dr. Scott and co-principal investigator Matt Mahoney, PhD, Principal Computational Scientist with the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, will devise living and computer models to pinpoint the disruption. Dr. Scott's research team will collect biological data, while Dr. Mahoney and colleagues will lead the effort to develop mathematical models. Together, the investigators will be able to examine a high volume of data and potentially accelerate the pace of discovery.

Dr. Scott joined Nemours Children's in 2021, continuing an accomplished career that has spanned hospitals in Zimbabwe, England, and the United States. He has made groundbreaking advances in the treatment and management of epilepsy, as well as the application of complex adaptive systems theories to neurological disease. In addition to his post at Nemours Children's, he is a Professor of Neurology and Pediatrics at Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University; and a Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Delaware.

""This high-risk, high-reward support from the NIH allows investigators like Dr. Scott to develop and rigorously test innovative ideas that are not in the mainstream,"" said Matthew M. Davis, MD, MAPP, Executive Vice President, Enterprise Physician-in-Chief, and Chief Scientific Officer, Nemours Children's Health. ""Through this research, it may be possible to improve cognitive function and quality of life for patients with a broad range of neurological conditions, in childhood and adulthood. This project demonstrates Nemours Children's commitment to research and academic excellence in the pursuit of advancing science and improving health outcomes for generations to come.""

After a remarkable career that includes two FIFA Women's World Cup titles and recognition across multiple club leagues, U.S. women's national team and Angel City FC forward Christen Press has announced she will retire following the conclusion of the NWSL season. 

""It's hard to find the words to say goodbye to a sport that has defined my life for over three decades. Football has given me everything, and I will miss being on the pitch so very much. Thank you to my family, friends, teammates, coaches, and community for this beautiful ride. I promise we will continue to reimagine sports in this next life,"" Press said in a statement.

The long-time attacker, known for her iconic cut-backs and clinical finishing, leaves a profound impact on and off the field. As she closes her playing career with Angel City FC, the 36-year-old closes a chapter on an influential tenure in women's soccer. The California native built the beginning of her career at Stanford University and broke school records.

She became the all-time leading scorer with 71 goals, while also setting new benchmarks for career points (183), assists (41), and shots (500). She left the University as a Mac Hermann trophy winner and two-time runner-up at the NCAA Women's College Cup.

Press is part of a larger group of players who helped domestic league soccer grow in the United States. She was part of Magicjack in the WPS and was named 2011 Rookie of the Year. After the league folded, Press was among a wave of U.S. players who continued their club careers in Europe, and played in Sweden with Goteborg FC and Tyreso FF where she became the first American to win the Damallsvenskan Golden Boot (2013) and scored 25 goals in 26 games for Tyreso.

As the NWSL launched, Press returned to the states in 2014 to play in the new American league. She became the Chicago Red Stars' leading goal scorer with goals (35) during her time with the club. She later joined Utah Royals FC in 2018 after a brief return in Sweden, and also played in England's Women's Super League with Manchester United in 2021 before returning to her hometown, Los Angeles, and became Angel City's first player signing. 

The success across club performances led to titles at the international level. Press leaves the U.S. women's national team with 155 appearances and 64 goals, while being a key member of the USWNT's iconic era, winning back-to-back World Cups in 2015 and 2019, and a 2020 Olympic bronze medal. She was an integral part of the USWNT's legal battle against U.S. Soccer for equal pay.

Her impact had a ripple effect on and off the pitch and forever changed women's soccer in the United States when she came forward alongside former teammates and anonymous sources with her early experiences in NWSL. She discussed her time in Chicago and the conditions of a toxic workplace and abusive environment. The reporting led to more investigations into player wellness across women's American soccer, including the Sally Yates report and the NWSL and NWSL Players Association joint investigation report. 

Press' legacy will continue through advocacy, entrepreneurship, media, and philanthropy. She's been a long-time global ambassador and board Member for Grassroot Soccer, an adolescent health organization that uses soccer as a tool to educate and inspire youth in developing countries.

In 2019, she launched RE-INC, a gender-neutral lifestyle brand that aims to reimagine the status quo and create a more inclusive landscape in sports media. The RE-CAP Show she hosts alongside her wife, Tobin Heath, has become a platform to center female athletes and champion inclusivity. She's been vocal about the importance of visibility and respect for LGBTQ and Black players and communities. 

Her final season with Angel City has been a powerful comeback story. Press returned in 2024 following a grueling two-year journey that included four surgeries after tearing her ACL in 2022. She scored her first home goal since her injury in May 2025.

Press's career is an inspiring story of a great goalscorer who ultimately became a builder of greater things. As she savors her final moments on the field, she leaves the game in a far better position than she inherited. She'll be remembered not only for the records she broke or titles she won, but for the many she inspired along the way and the barriers she helped tear down.

Trinity Rodman, one of the scoring stars of the Olympic gold medal run in Paris last year, is returning to the U.S. women's national soccer team in time for its match at Rentschler Field Oct. 26.

Rodman, who scored three goals at the Olympics, including a game-winner in the knock-out stage against Japan, has been sidelined much of the last 15 months managing recurring back injuries. But she has returned to her pro team and was called up to the 26-player USWNT roster announced Wednesday by coach Emma Hayes.

“We are extremely excited to get back together with the team,” Hayes said, upon the roster reveal. “There has been a big gap from July until now and we've watched many club games. Now, it's time to start the build towards qualifying for the 2027 World Cup. We want to maximize every minute we have together, push the players, and keep the momentum going. These three fantastic games ahead of us will help us do that.”

From a modest beginning in CT, Patrick Agyemang is returning home a soccer sensation with USMNT



The U.S. team has three friendly matches lined up, against Portugal on Oct. 23 in Pennsylvania and again in East Hartford on Oct. 26, then vs. New Zealand in Kansas City on Oct. 29.

Stratford's Alyssa Naeher, who retired after an history-making career as America's goalkeeper, will be honored before the game at Rentschler at 4 p.m., following the U.S. men's deaf national team's friendly match against Germany, which starts at 1 p.m.

Rodman, 23, the daughter of former NBA star Dennis Rodman, turned pro in 2021, joining the Washington Spirit in 2021. She has been with the USWNT since 2022, making the 18-player roster for the Olympics.

Her back injuries kept her out until April 2025, when she scored a goal for the U.S. in a win over Brazil, and a recurrence kept her out until recently. But Rodman has five goals in 11 games since returning to the Spirit.

“When she came in in April, I think she really felt she was in a good place, but the reality was having so much adrenaline got us through that game,” Hayes told reporters on a Zoom call Wednesday. “But afterwards, that reality hit home that there were some issues in her back that were unresolved and, collectively with club and country, we took the time to say, look, we've got to get it right for the long term. And I think that club and country collaboration has really put her in the position she's in right now.”

CT's Alyssa Naeher posts third straight shutout as US women's soccer team clinches gold



Over her career, Rodman has played 47 games with USWNT, scoring 11 goals.

Hayes gave many of her European pro players a break from action during the summer, but has reassembled most of her top players for this game in East Hartford, in which she will probably have 23 active. The rest of her roster:

Forwards: Michelle Cooper, Catarina Macario, Trinity Rodman, Yazmeen Ryan, Emma Sears, Ally Sentnor, Alyssa Thompson.

Midfielders: Sam Coffey, Lindsey Heaps, Claire Hutton, Rose Lavelle, Sam Meza, Olivia Moultrie, Jaedyn Shaw, Lily Yohannes.

Defenders: Jordyn Bugg, Emily Fox, Lilly Reale, Tara McKeown, Avery Patterson, Emily Sams, Emily Sonnett, Kennedy Wesley.

Goalkeepers: Claudia Dickey, Mandy McGlynn, Phallon Tullis-Joyce.

The U.S. women's national team will be back in action after 113 days. The program will play a three-game series in October against Portugal and New Zealand, and head coach Emma Hayes has named a 26-player roster for the upcoming matches. Two of the three games will feature retirement celebrations for Alex Morgan and Alyssa Naeher as the group aims to build off their previous meeting, a 3-0 win over Canada, in July.

""We are extremely excited to get back together with the team,"" said Hayes. ""There has been a big gap from July until now and we've watched many club games. Now, it's time to start the build towards qualifying for the 2027 World Cup. We want to maximize every minute we have together, push the players, and keep the momentum going. These three fantastic games ahead of us will help us do that.""

The three game window will begin against Portugal on Oct. 23 and Oct. 26 before concluding against New Zealand on Oct. 29. The expanded roster is to help manage player minutes and match load with the upcoming NWSL playoffs set to begin in November, and Hayes will only name 23 players on matchdays.

Forward Trinity Rodman returns to the USWNT camps for the first time since April. The lengthy absence was due to a back injury, and she has since returned to play with her club, Washington Spirit. Rodman scored the game-winner in her last USWNT appearance, a 2-0 win against Brazil. Gotham FC midfielder Jaedyn Shaw also marks her return to the senior team after featuring with the U-23 team since April. 

While Hayes is narrowing down her pool of players ahead of FIFA Women's World Cup qualifiers in 2026, there are still players earning first-time callups. Second-year San Diego Wave defender Kennedy Wesley was named to the roster and could make her senior debut over the three friendlies after spending time with the U-23 program earlier this year.

The October international window will have continued training camps running alongside the senior team. The U-23 program will be in Philadelphia, and the U-20 team will be in Kansas City, concurrent with the USWNT. The dual camps are an example of the U.S. Soccer's development philosophy, the U.S. Way, which focuses on and encourages increased opportunities for youth national teams.

Also returning to the roster are several Americans who play abroad. Five players, midfielder Lindsey Heaps, defender Emily Fox, forward Catarina Macario, midfielder Lily Yohannes, and goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, were given the summer window off. Alyssa Thompson joins the roster from Chelsea FC, her first call-up since moving to Europe. Each player is currently playing in the UEFA Champions League. Fans can watch every UWCL match across CBS Sports platforms , Paramount+, CBS Sports Network , and CBS Sports Golazo Network.

Take a look at the official roster:

Goalkeepers (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 2), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 4), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United, ENG; 3)

Defenders (8): Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC; 2/0), Emily Fox (Arsenal FC, ENG; 67/1), Lilly Reale (Gotham FC; 2/0), Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit; 8/0), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash; 6/1), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride; 5/0), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC; 110/2), Kennedy Wesley (San Diego Wave; 0/0)

Midfielders (8): Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC; 38/4), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 167/38), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current; 6/1), Rose Lavelle (Gotham FC; 113/25), Sam Meza (Seattle Reign FC; 2/0), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC; 9/2), Jaedyn Shaw (Gotham FC; 26/8), Lily Yohannes (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 8/1)

Forwards (7): Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current; 8/1), Catarina Macario (Chelsea FC, ENG; 24/11), Trinity Rodman (Washington Spirit; 47/11), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston Dash; 12/2), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville; 8/1), Ally Sentnor (Kansas City Current; 12/4), Alyssa Thompson (Chelsea FC, ENG; 22/3)

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — A bittersweet result for the U.S. men's team as the march toward next summer's World Cup continues.

The good news? Haji Wright scored twice to secure the first come-from-behind win under coach Mauricio Pochettino. The bad? USMNT star Christian Pulisic was forced to leave the friendly in the first half because of what appeared to be an injury to his right hamstring. 

Here are my takeaways:

The country's best attacking player came into this two-match window nursing a hamstring problem that Pochettino said has been bothering him since AC Milan's preseason. It swelled up following last Wednesday's training session in Austin, Texas — ruling Pulisic out of Thursday's practice and limiting him to less than 20 minutes off the bench a day later.

But there Pulisic was back in the starting lineup at Dick's Sporting Good Park — much to the delight of the home fans. That feeling didn't last. After being on the receiving end of two crunching early tackles, Pulisic — wearing the captain's armband in Tim Ream's absence — limped to the U.S. dressing room after being replaced by Diego Luna. There was no immediate word on Pulisic's condition, but it was a worrying sight nonetheless.

""He is still being assessed,"" a USMNT spokesperson said. ""We'll have an update after the game.""

Wright made his first career start under Pochettino and just his his fifth overall. Two of those came at the 2022 World Cup. But his last five appearances had all been off the bench. So had 14 of his previous 18.

Playing the center forward role Folarin Balogun excelled in over the last three games, Wright took advantage of the opportunity. Fourteen minutes after the visitors opened the scored, the rangy Los Angeles native pulled the Americans level by finishing off a passing sequence that included Richards, Weston McKennie and Roldan, who sprung Wright and was rewarded with the assist:

Wright's second goal was even better. Roldan again set up the strike by taking a quick free kick following a foul about 80 yards from the Aussies' goal. Wright ran onto the service, then turned center-back Cameron Burgess inside out with a cutback before curling his shot inside the far post:

For the second match in a row, sloppy play by the Americans allowed their opponent to score first, leaving the hosts chasing the game against a stout defensive foe. In last week's 1-1 tie against Ecuador, an Aidan Morris turnover sprung a counterattack that finished with U.S. keeper Matt Fresse picking the ball out the back of his net.

On Tuesday, the USMNT committed an even more egregious error, as the Socceroos opener came following a throw-in deep in their own half — a cardinal sin at any level, let alone the highest one. Defender Chris Richards and defensive midfielder Cristian Roldan were both slow to react when James Sands got a toe on the throw by Australia's Jordan Bos. Roldan eventually stepped to the ball, but he was only able to deflect it into the midsection of Bos. The Feyenoord left back controlled, then blasted home a shot that Freese had no chance of saving:

With just two training camps remaining before Mauricio Pochettino names his roster for the 2026 World Cup, the tournament co-hosts must tighten that up in short order to hav any chance of making a deep run on home soil next summer. ""We conceded a goal,"" Pochettino told TNT's Melissa Ortiz at halftime, ""that we shouldn't concede.""

During his pregame press conference on Monday, the former Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham Hotspur manager suggested that he would rotate players for the back end of the two-contest set given the cooler temperatures and mile-high altitude in the greater Denver area. He ended up switching out more than half of his starting lineup, making six changes in all. 

Along with Balogun, Ream was also on the subs bench along with Morris, Max Arfsten, Tanner Tessmann and Malik Tillman, who wasn't even in uniform. (Arfsten, Balogun and Tessmann entered in the second half, as did Brenden Aaronson, who didn't feature last week.)

In their places were Roldan, Wright, Alex Freeman, Mark McKenzie and defensive midfielder James Sands, who won his first cap in more than two years. All acquitted themselves well, with center back McKenzie teaming with Richards and Miles Robinson for the first time. That's a high-quality problem for Pochettino to have going forward.

Driving through the Highway 99 tunnel in Seattle could be pricier during next summer's FIFA World Cup.

With traffic expected to surge when the city hosts several matches, the Washington State Transportation Commission may temporarily hike tolls for the two-mile tunnel to defray additional costs associated with the international sporting event.

Commissioners heard Tuesday that their staff are evaluating potential increases of 50 cents and $1 that would be imposed between June 1 and July 15, 2026, the period in which six World Cup contests are scheduled at Lumen Field in downtown Seattle. 

State lawmakers directed the commission to consider a temporary increase and use the money to cover added costs of managing traffic around the stadium and throughout the Puget Sound when fans flood the region in those six weeks.

Doing nothing is an option too, said Carl See, the commission deputy director. While commissioners need to keep in mind the impact of the influx of visitors, they also need to remember any increase “may have an impact on those who have no interest” in taking part in what will be a “monumental event” for the state, he told the panel.

The Pacific Northwest will host 13 World Cup matches — six in Seattle and seven in Vancouver, B.C. Conversations have been underway for months on how to avert monumental backups at the U.S.-Canada border and assist fans moving between the host cities.

About 750,000 people are anticipated to come to Washington state in the course of six weeks. In addition to matches, teams will be practicing at the University of Washington in Seattle and Gonzaga University in Spokane. There will be training locations and fan zones in the state, too.

State lawmakers earmarked roughly $24 million in the current transportation budget for World Cup-related expenses. Additional dollars were cribbed into the operating and capital budgets for security and field upgrades.

With transportation, there's $14 million for transit, including $5 million for expanding intercity bus service in the state, and another $8.25 million for operational improvements aimed at keeping people moving. 

There's $2 million for maintenance in the vicinity of the tunnel. Those dollars will come out of the tunnel toll revenue account. Lawmakers assumed that sum could be covered from a temporary toll rate increase but didn't mandate one.

Roughly 47,000 vehicles travel through the tunnel each day based on a July 2024 analysis.

Tolls vary based on time of day with higher rates in peak commute hours and lower rates on nights and weekends. They are collected in both directions as one exits the tunnel. 

Weekdays, the cost ranges from $1.25 to $1.85 per trip with a Good to Go pass. It is $1.25 on weekends. Drivers pay an extra 25 cents per trip with the Pay By Plate option, in which they register their license plate on a Good To Go! account without a pass. There is a $2 fee tacked on if you pay by mail.

What will be studied are potential increases of 50 cents per trip and $1 per trip that would be imposed at all times, including on weekends.

In December, staff will present the commission with projections of how much money might be generated from those assessments and how many drivers might choose to use local roads and Interstate 5 to avoid higher tolls.

See cautioned that he didn't want to “overpromise” what data would be delivered. If approved, this would be the first such temporary toll-rate hike, he said. Given the short six-week duration and uniqueness of the sporting event, it will be hard to model for every possible factor with precision, he said.

If the commission decides to proceed with a one-time temporary toll rate increase, it would conduct a rate-setting process including gathering public input on potential rate options.

Trump claimed Fifa president could ‘easily' move games

Wu says Trump comments are ‘targeting Boston values'

The mayor of Boston, Michelle Wu, implied the city was ready for a face-off with the US president Donald Trump over his claim he could order Fifa to remove World Cup games from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, 22 miles south-west of the city.

Wu appeared on local podcast “Java with Jimmy” on Wednesday to respond to Tuesday's criticism from the White House, which labeled the Democrat as “radical left”. Trump threatened he would make a call to the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, if Boston did not “clean up its act”.

“Much of it is locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it,” Wu said. “We're in a world where for drama, for control, for pushing the boundaries … ongoing threats … are issued to individuals and communities who refuse to back down and comply or be obedient to a hateful agenda.

“We are going to continue to be who we are and that means, unfortunately, we are going to be in a conversation in a way that is targeting Boston's values,” Wu added. “Ten toes down for Boston.”

Infantino appeared in photographs alongside Trump at the Gaza summit earlier this week. The Fifa president has also visited the Oval Office and presented World Cup and Club World Cup trophies to Trump as gifts.

On Tuesday, Trump was asked about recent disturbances in South Boston that included a police vehicle being set on fire. “If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni [Infantino] – the head of Fifa, who's phenomenal,” Trump replied.

“I would say: ‘Let's move into another location' and they would do that. He wouldn't love to do it. But he would do it very easily.” Trump also directly criticised Wu, saying: “Their mayor is not good … she's radical left, and they're taking over parts of Boston. That's a pretty big statement, right?”

Trump has made previous comments suggesting he would take up the same conversation with Infantino about moving games from Seattle and San Francisco, which are among the 16 host cities across North America.

The United States are joint hosts of the 2026 World Cup, alongside Mexico and Canada. The 48-team event is scheduled to be played from 11 June to 19 July next summer.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

James Taylor

FIFA has issued a statement after US President Donald Trump threatened to change the host cities for next summer's World Cup.

The tournament will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada, with the final set to take place at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on July 19.

However, despite the competition being just nine months away, Trump has warned that he could intervene and change the host cities.

He claims he could contact FIFA President Gianni Infantino to pressure Democrat-run cities to take a tougher stance on crime.

At a cabinet meeting on Sunday, he said: “If somebody is doing a bad job and I feel there are unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location.'

""He wouldn't love to do it, but he would do it very easily.”

In response, a FIFA spokesperson told POLITICO: “Safety and security are of the utmost importance at all FIFA events worldwide.

Advert

""And it is ultimately the government's responsibility to decide what's in the best interest of public safety.

""We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to fulfill all necessary requirements for a successful 2026 World Cup.”

The United States are set to host two of the world's biggest sporting events in the coming years.

After next summer's World Cup, Los Angeles will stage the Summer Olympics in 2028.

Advert

Trump's latest comments are now the second time he has threatened to change World Cup venues.

City officials have since spoken out against Trump, stressing that they have spent several years preparing to host matches.

Lisa Gillmor, the mayor of Santa Clara, California, said: “Any suggestion that Santa Clara is unsafe is simply not based in fact.

Advert

""We have been preparing for these games for nearly 3 years, and we will be proud to welcome the world to Santa Clara for the World Cup next year.""

Another official from a host city added that the agreements over which locations would stage matches were finalised back in 2017 and 2018.

The controversy is just the latest difficulty ahead of the World Cup.

Fans have already hit out at the prices, with the cheapest seats for the final starting out at $2,030 (£1,510), and the most expensive reaching $6,000 (£4,462).

Advert

FIFA has also adopted a 'dynamic pricing' system for the tournament, allowing ticket prices to rise sharply in response to higher demand.

And weather conditions could also pose a logistical challenge, with extreme heat likely to force later kick-off times.

Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed he could take World Cup matches away from US cities he deems “unsafe”. Here's what he said – and what powers he does and doesn't have

Which time? Tuesday was the second time Trump has threatened to take away World Cup games from US host cities on the basis of their political leadership or opposition to his policies. However, it's important to note that this suggestion of moving games is not something Trump has suggested organically, of his own volition. In both cases, the US president was responding to leading questions centered around the idea of moving games. 

On 25 September in an Oval Office event, a member of the White House press corps asked Trump about cities that have demonstrated against Trump's use of federal agencies for immigration and crime crackdowns. The reporter mentioned Seattle and San Francisco as two cities that have seen demonstrations, and pointed out that both cities are World Cup hosts (though San Francisco is not a host city, but part of the San Francisco Bay Area that will host games at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara). The reporter then asked Trump if the demonstrations could result in the loss of World Cup games from those host venues. 

“I guess, but we're going to make sure they're safe,” Trump said. “They're run by radical left lunatics and that don't know what they're doing.” 

Later Trump said that Chicago would be safe for the World Cup after he sends in federal agencies in a similar manner as Washington DC. Chicago is not a 2026 World Cup host city. 

“If any city we think is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup … we won't allow it to go to it. We'll move it around a little bit,” Trump said. 

Three weeks later, on 14 October, Trump was asked about another host city, Boston, even though the games themselves will be held in suburban Foxborough, Massachusetts. Towards the end of that day's press event, a reporter asked Trump about a recent “street takeover” in Boston that saw police officers attacked and a police car set aflame, and if the concerns raised by the incident could result in the revocation of hosting duties for next year's expanded 48-team soccer tournament. The reporter also asked if Trump would work with Michelle Wu, the Democratic mayor of Boston, to address the issue.

“We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. “Their mayor is not good … She's radical left, and they're taking over parts of Boston. That's a pretty big statement, right?”

Street takeovers, a social media-driven phenomenon that sees large crowds of people gather on city streets late at night to perform stunts in cars, have been a repeated nuisance in American cities since the Covid-19 pandemic shutdowns. Recent such gatherings have turned violent in Massachusetts, including in Boston. However, the gatherings are generally not seen as being tied to any particular political ideology, nor have they been touted as a large-scale safety concern for World Cup attendees. 

“If someone is doing a bad job, and I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni [Infantino], the head of Fifa, who is phenomenal, and say let's move it to another location,” Trump said on Tuesday. “And he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it. Very easily, he'd do it.”

Later in that same event, Trump for the first time broached the possibility of moving the 2028 Olympics from Los Angeles as well. 

“If I thought LA was not going to be prepared properly, I would move it to another location if I had to,” he said. “On that one I'd probably have to get a different kind of a permission, but we would do that.”

In short: No. At least not unilaterally. In the World Cup's case, the host city agreements are signed between Fifa, soccer's global governing body, and the local municipalities. Though the deal involves a public government, it is essentially a private business deal, and the US president does not have authority to cancel it on his own.

That said, Trump can apply pressure to the various parties to back out of the deal if he is truly committed to removing games from the cities in question. That could include withholding federal funding from the cities as he has for various other aspects of American life. It could also include an appeal to Fifa president Gianni Infantino, who has carefully cultivated a close relationship with Trump since the US president's return to office.

Theoretically, yes. We can say this with relative surety thanks to Seattle, which released the host city agreement it signed with Fifa. Within that agreement there is a clause (4.5, to be exact) that addresses the possible revocation of host city selection. The clause essentially states that by agreeing to be a World Cup host city, Seattle also agrees to do a number of different (and often expensive) things to increase public safety, including the deployment of additional security measures and transportation methods, plus the assumption of various financial liabilities.

Fifa could in theory point to that clause as reasoning for revoking Seattle's status as a World Cup host city if it feels like safety standards are woefully behind. It's hard to imagine it being all that likely, though. Any World Cup is a gigantic logistical affair, let alone one spread across three countries and 16 host cities featuring more teams than ever before. It's hard enough for Fifa to create the match schedule and oversee teams' travel. Introducing a reduction in venues, or a change in venues, or multiple of them, would be a gargantuan undertaking so close to the actual event. It's easy to assume it would be the subject of legal action on behalf of the host city as well. 

So far, it has been mostly promotional and/or threatening in nature. Trump convened a World Cup task force earlier this year headed by Andrew Giuliani, with a stated mission of “facilitat[ing] comprehensive planning, organization, and execution of the largest sporting events in the history of mankind.”

The federal government also has a role in approving visas for visitors from other countries, but processing times for those have ballooned to such a level that many fear that they won't have visas approved in time for the games themselves. 

There is also the public safety aspect. One can presume that FBI agents and potentially those from Homeland Security and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) will be dispatched to World Cup host cities with the stated intention of providing an additional layer of security on top of local police.

So far, Fifa president Gianni Infantino has said nothing publicly about Trump's threat. He did, however, find time to travel to Egypt to be alongside Trump at the Gaza summit – a curious move for someone whose role in the world is nominally about sports. 

Fifa vice-president Victor Montagliani, a Canadian, was far more direct speaking at a London conference in early October, responding to Trump's comments about Seattle and San Francisco. 

“It's Fifa's tournament, Fifa's jurisdiction, Fifa makes those decisions,” Montagliani said. “With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans. That's the beauty of our game, that it is bigger than any individual and bigger than any country.”

A Fifa spokesperson told Politico “Safety and security are of the utmost importance at all FIFA events worldwide and it is ultimately the government's responsibility to decide what's in the best interest of public safety. We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to fulfill all necessary requirements for a successful 2026 World Cup.”

Outside of Fifa, Wu responded to Trump's threat by pointing out that much of Fifa's host city agreements are “locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it.

“We're in a world where for drama, for control, for pushing the boundaries … ongoing threats … are issued to individuals and communities who refuse to back down and comply or be obedient to a hateful agenda.”

Only in cases of extreme and/or unexpected health and safety concerns, war, or other political disturbance. The 2003 Women's World Cup was the last senior-level tournament with that name to be moved – it was originally due to be held in China but was shifted to the US due to that year's Sars outbreak. 

Fifa also pulled the 2023 Under-20 World Cup from Indonesia after several members of that country's government and large sections of the populace opposed the inclusion of Israel in the tournament. Indonesia does not maintain formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has broadly supported Palestine. Indonesia later hosted that year's U-17 World Cup after Peru pulled out of hosting. 

The Olympics have been canceled due to wars or postponed a year in the case of Covid-19 and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but they have not changed host cities since 1908, when the eruption of Mount Vesuvius forced the Rome games to decamp to London.

Likely because he has made that topic a feature of his administration. It is the guise under which he has deployed the national guard, Ice, and other federal agencies to Washington DC, Chicago and other cities. The fact that safety is a genuine and justified concern at any major gathering of people – especially one as vast as the World Cup – makes it an easy line to fall back on for his administration.

That'll be the real test, won't it? When Washington has intervened in many other aspects of American life, the targeted institutions have often complied or tried to negotiate. It remains to be seen if Fifa or the IOC will take that path – if indeed Trump decides to pursue this at all.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Donald Trump says he could call up the head of FIFA, Gianni Infantino, and he would do what he suggested.

Wednesday 15 October 2025 19:11, UK

FIFA has told Sky News the US government does have the right to determine if cities are safe for the World Cup - after Donald Trump threatened to remove the Boston area from hosting.

The US president stepped up his criticism of crime in Democrat-run cities at the White House after previously claiming California could be stripped of matches at the FIFA event next year, and at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino is a close ally of President Trump's - attending his Gaza peace summit in Egypt this week - and is not pushing back on his World Cup interventions.

In a statement to Sky News, FIFA said: ""Safety and security are the top priorities at all FIFA events worldwide.

""Safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety.

""We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfill all necessary requirements.""

FIFA did not directly comment on changing any of the 11 venues in the US for the expanded 48-team men's football World Cup which will see the Americans host 78 of the 104 fixtures, including the final in New Jersey.

The remaining games are in Canada and Mexico.

Boston does not have matches itself, but the home of the NFL's New England Patriots is being used by FIFA for seven matches, 30 miles away in Foxborough, Massachusetts.

President Trump said: ""If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni - the head of FIFA who's phenomenal - and I would say, 'Let's move into another location,' and they would do that.

""He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.""

President Trump and Mr Infantino first encountered each other during Mr Trump's first term in office, when the US was awarded the right to host next year's tournament.

They have popped up together at summits and meetings across the world since.

The FIFA president was even among those in attendance as Mr Trump and world leaders signed the recent Israel-Gaza peace deal.

Earlier this week, President Trump slammed Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu, and said the ""radical left"" was taking over Boston.

He made the comments while hosting Argentine president Javier Milei.

Massachusetts Democratic leaders on Wednesday questioned, if not outright scoffed at, President Trump's threat that he could “take away” the 2026 World Cup matches scheduled to be played in Massachusetts over public safety concerns in Boston, and instead suggested the Republican should pull out a map.

“First of all, he's talking about the crime rate in Boston. The World Cup is going to be played in Foxborough, so he should check his geography before he does anything else,” Massachusetts House Speaker Ron Mariano told reporters Wednesday at the State House. 

“I don't know where the crime is high in Foxborough,” the Quincy Democrat added of the 18,000-person community 30 miles south of Boston. The crime rate dropped in the town between 2023 and 2024, data show. “So I don't know what basis he's got to make a statement like that.”

Trump said Tuesday that if he felt there were “unsafe conditions” in Boston, he would ask FIFA president Gianni Infantino to move the matches to another location.

There are currently seven matches scheduled to be played at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough next year. Eleven U.S. cities — plus others in Mexico and Canada — are under contract with FIFA to play host to the tournament, meaning Trump has no direct control over where matches are played.

Trump on Tuesday suggested that Infantino “wouldn't love” to move matches, “but he'd do it very easily.”

Trump made his comments in response to a question about the so-called “street takeovers” in Boston and several communities in Eastern Massachusetts in recent weeks. An Oct. 5 incident in Boston's South End included images of a police car being attacked and resulted in two arrests.

“We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup matches. “I love the people of Boston and I know the games are sold out. But your mayor [Michelle Wu] is not good.”

“There are worse than her,” Trump continued. “At least she's intelligent.”

Wu, speaking during an appearance Wednesday on the “Java With Jimmy” show, waved off concerns that Trump could jeopardize the state's host status for the World Cup.

She said officials have undergone months of planning and preparation to host matches in the region, including fan festivities in Boston, and that “no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it.” 

“There's no ability to take away the World Cup games,” said Wu, who is running unopposed for another term in November's election. “There's no real threat when it comes to saying cities are so unsafe that they can't host the Games.”

Massachusetts House leaders have proposed setting aside at least $10 million for costs related to hosting the 2026 World Cup matches as part of a supplemental spending bill.

State Representative Aaron Michlewitz, the chamber's budget chief and a North End Democrat, said Boston is one of the country's safest major cities and framed Trump's comments as reacting to “a video or two” showing crime in Boston.

“You can get any video to show anything at any point in time and point it out and make it out to be something that it's not,” Michlewitz said. “What does one have to do with soccer games being played in Foxborough? I don't know.”

Boston has been a regular target for the president and other top administration officials, including given the city's stance on immigration. Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox said cars and unruly crowds have been descending on intersections across the country for the past few years, and called it a “culture trend” fueled largely by social media.

Governor Maura Healey last week dismissed a question about whether she was concerned that Trump would consider deploying the National Guard in Massachusetts, as he has done in other Democrat-leaning states and cities, in light of the so-called street takeovers.

“He absolutely shouldn't,” she said. “There's no need for that here.”

President Donald Trump says he has the authority to ""take away"" 2026 World Cup soccer matches scheduled in Boston if he feels the city is unsafe.

Suggesting that parts of Boston had been ""taken over"" by recent unrest, Trump criticized mayor Michelle Wu and said on Tuesday, Oct. 14, that Boston – which is set to stage seven matches at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough during next summer's tournament – could have its games relocated with a phone call to FIFA president Gianni Infantino.

""If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who's phenomenal – and I would say, ‘Let's move into another location,' and they would do that,"" Trump said. ""He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.""

Trump's remarks came during a White House appearance with Argentine President Javier Milei, days after Boston police reported multiple arrests tied to a late-night street gathering that turned violent. 

Boston was one of 11 U.S. cities, along with three in Mexico and two in Canada, selected three years ago to host matches for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Making changes to plans already in place just eight months before the tournament kicks off June 11 would create severe logistical hurdles.

""We could take them away,"" Trump said. ""I love the people of Boston, and I know the games are sold out. But your mayor is not good.""

Wu's office issued a statement that read: ""Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions.""

Trump also suggested that he would consider moving the 2028 Summer Olympics out of Los Angeles for similar reasons.

""If I thought L.A. was not going to be prepared properly, I would move it to another location if I had to.""

The cuts come ahead of Comcast's Versant spinoff, which will see MSNBC and CNBC cleaved off from the rest of the NBC News Group.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	Layoffs hit NBC News on Wednesday, with the network news division facing cuts ahead of Comcast's spinoff of Versant. About 150 jobs were eliminated, representing about 2 percent of the workforce of the NBC News Group.


	The cuts were across the News Group, without specific teams being targeted.




	The Versant spin will see MSNBC and CNBC separated from NBC News. NBC News, MSNBC and CNBC are currently all part of the NBC News Group, led by Cesar Conde.


	Per a source, the cuts were driven by the fact that NBC News will no longer be providing newsgathering capabilities for CNBC and MSNBC, as well as broader concerns around the overall economic environment for the media sector.

	That said, NBC News is shifting resources to other areas, including the forthcoming subscription offering, and new areas of coverage like sports. The division currently has about 140 open job postings, and impacted staff are being encouraged to apply for those roles.

	“Coming off the successful creation of our new daily podcast Here's the Scoop, we are preparing to launch our NBC News subscription service later this year that will feature the best of our coverage and include new premium offerings,” Conde wrote in a note to staff last week. “NBC News is expanding its new Sports Hub, in partnership with NBC Sports, with the NBA returning to NBC, as well as the Milan Olympics, the Super Bowl, and the World Cup on Telemundo. And to support the leading position of NBC News, we will be launching a marketing campaign soon that will reinforce our reputation for rigorous fact-based reporting that is indispensable and accessible across all platforms for all, the first such campaign in modern memory.”

	











	NBC News employees impacted by the cuts are being given 60 days' notice, as well as a severance package and outplacement services.

The rapper paid loving tribute to the neo soul icon who died at 51 on Tuesday (Oc. 14) following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



Lauryn Hill and D'Angelo were like twin stars birthing a new R&B universe in the late 1990s. The pair released just one collaboration, 1998's sensual, seductive “Nothing Even Matters” from Hill's Grammy-winning debut solo album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, but the song, and their friendship, clearly made a huge impression on the former Fugees rapper/singer.

	











	In an emotional post paying homage to D'Angelo in the wake of the singer's death at 51 on Tuesday (Oct. 14) due to pancreatic cancer, Hill lavished praise on D'Angelo for being a beacon of light for music, and fellow Black men, while lamenting that she didn't have more precious moments with the enigmatic “Brown Sugar” star.


	“People need reflection. I regret not having more time with you. Your undeniable beauty and talent were not of this world, and a presence not of this world needs protection in a world that covets light and the anointing of God,” Hill wrote. “You sir, moved us, stirred us, inspired and even intimidated others to action with your genius.”


	She added, “Thank you for being a beacon of light to a generation and beyond who had no remembrance of the legacy that preceded us. Thank you for charting the course and for making space during a time when no similar space really existed.”


	Though D'Angelo only released three albums in his lifetime, his beloved 1995 debut, Brown Sugar, followed by 2000's Voodoo and 2014's Black Messiah, Hill wrote that the singer's aching vulnerability and incomparable passion moved, and inspired, the culture. “You imaged a unity of strength and sensitivity in Black manhood to a generation that only saw itself as having to be one or the other,” Hill wrote. 

	











	“It is my earnest prayer that you are in peace, far away from selfishness, fear and/or controlling interests,” she added. “Far from possessiveness, far from greed, far from manipulation, far from exploitation, far from intentionally designed chaos and that you Brother are in peace, in bliss and in eternal light and fulfillment with our Father in heaven. I Love you and I miss you. May God grant peace and shelter to your family, true friends and genuine appreciators, Brother, King.”


	The post included a series of pictures of D'Angelo in the studio, as well as a snap of the two musicians in which D is giving one of his classic pensive, knowing looks and Hill is smiling as the pair lean their heads together. In a 2008 interview with Rolling Stone, D'Angelo reflected on his studio time with Hill, calling her “warm and sweet” and revealing that the original plan was to show up on each other's projects.


	“Originally, we were going to swap tunes for each other's projects because I was working on Voodoo at the same time and my keyboardist James Poyser was also working with her,” he said at the time of the producer/songwriter who has been a member of the Roots since 2009 and who has produced and written songs for a constellation of neo soul giants including Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Common and others. “I went to her house in New Jersey, she played a lot of songs for me and gave me a rough copy to listen to. When Lauryn and I went into in the studio together, I laid down my vocals in the course of an hour.


	Hill joined an emotional chorus of friends, fans and fellow musicians who paid tribute to D'Angelo on Tuesday, a roster that included Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Tyler, the Creator, Missy Elliott, Doja Cat, DJ Premiere and many more.

Political Editor


NBC News went through a round of layoffs on Wednesday, impacting about 150 staffers, as the network cuts costs as it prepares for the split of most of Comcast's cable networks into Versant.


	The job reductions are scattered throughout NBC News. They represent about 2% of the NBCU News Group workforce and a single-digit percentage of NBC News, according to a source familiar with the plans. Status newsletter, the first to report on the pending cuts, put the figure at 7% of the network's workforce.


	Staffers are being told that the layoffs are taking place because NBC News no longer will be providing newsgathering for two networks, not just MSNBC but CNBC. The two networks will be part of the collection of cable channels under the Versant umbrella. Also cited is the economic climate, as linear networks have been trimming staffs amid advertising shifts to other platforms.

	The impacted employees, who are being informed of the elimination of their roles on Wednesday, will receive severance and outplacement services, and 60 days notification and benefits support, per the source. They will be able to apply for 140 openings across the newsgroup. About a dozen of the eliminated positions are being repurposed into new roles, and those laid off also can apply for those jobs.

	The NBC Digital News Guild, which represents staffers including reporters, editors and video journalists, has not received any official notice from management, a spokesperson said. In a statement, Susan DeCarava, president of The NewsGuild of New York, said, “What's clear: NBC management is prioritizing corporate profits at the expense of our hard-working members, without whom there would be no NBC News.”


	Comcast announced last year that it would spin off most of its cable networks, including MSNBC and CNBC, into a new company, later branded as Versant. The spinoff is expected to be completed by the end of the year, with MSNBC building up its own newsroom given that it no longer will have NBC News as a sister network.

	











	On Oct. 6, MSNBC no longer relied on NBC News correspondents and crews in their coverage, with the exception of Washington, D.C. operations. Those ties are expected to be severed next week, on Oct. 20. MSNBC also will be taking on a new name, MS NOW, or My Source, News-Opinion-World.


	In a memo to employees last week, Cesar Conde, chairman of the NBCU News Group, said that a planned NBC News subscription service will launch later this year, while NBC News will expand its sports hub as events like the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics and World Cup approach. He also said that NBC News would be launching a new marketing campaign.

If the layoffs were due to no longer needing to provide services for CNBC and MSNBC, then shouldnt there be growth jobs available at CNBC and MSNBC to manage those same functions?

Because CNBC and MSNBC are being phased out. Versant wasn't spun off to save legacy media, it was to manage the decline so Comcast could focus resources on new media acquisitions like CBS is doing with Bari Weiss.

	The eight-episode first season follows a mercenary (Sy) who embarks on a dangerous mission to rescue hostages in Libya. Trapped between warring factions and ruthless killers, he must navigate life-or-death choices while confronting deep emotional wounds. 


	The 2020 action thriller Extraction, directed by Sam Hargrave, was based on the graphic novel Ciudad by Ande Parks, with art by Fernando León González, and co-written by Joe and Anthony Russo. Hemsworth stars as an Australian black ops mercenary who takes on a mission to save an Indian drug lord's kidnapped son in Dhaka, Bangladesh, but the mission goes awry when he is double-crossed.

	











	A sequel, Extraction 2, was released in 2023, with the main cast reprising their roles. The movie brings back Hemsworth's Rake, who is tasked with a new mission — rescuing the battered family of a ruthless Georgian gangster from the prison where they are being held. AGBO produced both films.


	In addition to the Russo Brothers and Mazzara, executive producers include Angela Russo-Otstot, Scott Nemes, and Chris Castaldi for AGBO, Sam Hargrave, Eric Gitter, and Peter Schwerin, Netflix & AGBO: A Proven Partnership. Ari Costa produces for AGBO.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Andy Muschietti says IT: Welcome To Derry ""will take things to the edge""","https://www.avclub.com/it-welcome-to-derry-preview-andy-muschietti-interview-hbo-tv","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 18:38:34 GMT","

The lasting effects of Stephen King's horror novel It can be felt almost 40 years after the book was published, thanks to its traumatizing villain. And now Pennywise's origin story makes its way to the small screen in HBO's Welcome To Derry, which premieres October 26. The prequel series brings It‘s Bill Skarsgård back into the fold as the maniacal clown who gleefully terrorizes and attacks children. But the show also delves deep into the eerie lore of  its titular small Maine town, with stories inspired by the interludes in King's novel. Series co-creator Andy Muschietti, who helmed 2017's It and Chapter Two, tells The A.V. Club that he's been itching to get back to this franchise since the latter film was released in 2019. 

Set in 1962—a whole 27 years before the Losers initially encountered Pennywise in the recent films—Welcome To Derry introduces a new group of kids who become the creature's targets. Muschietti dubs them the “new Losers,” who investigate the disappearance of a friend in the sewers while confronting some of their darkest fears. Meanwhile, the adults (played by the likes of Jovan Adepo, Taylour Paige, Chris Chalk, and James Remar) embark on their own secret missions that unwittingly put them on the same dangerous path as the kids. All roads, of course, lead to Pennywise. 

The A.V. Club spoke to Muschietti about establishing Welcome To Derry‘s “intense” tone and aesthetic, bringing in a major King character, crafting a new narrative that ties into the Native American community, and how much we'll get to see of Skarsgård in that darn clown costume. 

The A.V. Club: What was it about the interludes in Stephen King's books that felt like compelling entry points for an It spin-off? 

Andy Muschietti: So there are two things here. One was we all shared a desire to go into the origins of Pennywise or the monster who became the clown. And part of that equation was the conversations I had with Bill Skarsgård while filming It Chapter Two. Both of us were excited about the prospect. We thought it would be a movie at first. But then life happened, and we went into different projects. But this idea kept coming back to me and took shape into something deeper and more extended. It was my curiosity that made me dig into the other parts of Stephen King's book, particularly the research and investigation done by Losers Club member Mike Hanlon that form the interludes that are shrouded in mystery. Mike just gets bits and pieces of information, and he tries to build this puzzle, but never gets to put all the pieces together. In a way, I desired to put those pieces together and create an expanded story about everything that happened in Derry before the events of the movies, and hopefully create a compelling, emotional story. 

AVC: The show takes place in 1962. How does this specific time period affect the arc and aesthetics of the show? 

AM: 1962 is the Pennywise cycle previous to the story in the movie, but in the book, the main story happens in 1958 with the kids. So that was exciting to us right away because even if it's not the same characters, we're going into a similar cultural era covered in the book. We wanted to capitalize on the fear of being in the Cold War and the panic of possibly being bombed by Russia. There's also another range of fears from this era I wanted to tap into from the kids' perspective, which is things like radioactive mutations. Using both those angles to help with the creation of this world, aesthetically speaking, was appealing. I treated this season as if it were a movie, in the sense that we got Chapter Two‘s production designer [Paul D. Austerberry] and costume designer [Luis Sequeira] because I wanted to preserve that cinematic feel. Everybody was very excited to jump into the early '60s and embrace not only the aesthetic parts but the deeper idiosyncrasies of what an American small town at that time was like.

AVC: Does the show match the film's tone in terms of creepiness, or did you get to change things since you have eight hourlong episodes? 

AM: I wanted to maintain the same tone of the movie because I wanted the movies themselves to maintain the tone of the book, which is terribly scary and graphically violent. There are heightened emotions, but there's also a lot of humor. The mandate for me was always being faithful to all that, but I will say the show does get more intense. We had the opportunity to make it creepier because it's a bigger canvas with more characters and more of their fears to explore. The intention is to take things to the edge and give audiences more than what they've experienced in the movies before. 

AVC: You directed the opening scene of the premiere, which is quite gnarly and further helps establish that creepy tone. 

AM: Yeah, I wanted to establish a sense of how no one is really safe in this world, which is a little bit of the same idea that we expressed in the first movie's opening with Georgie's death, which is pretty gruesome, and also with Adrian Mellon's death at the beginning of Chapter Two. In general, as an opening for the show, I wanted to create an augmented feeling that nothing is sacred or safe in Derry. The challenge was how to do it and make it more spectacular, especially for people who have seen the movies and understand how effective a graphic incident like the show's opening scene is. It all comes from what I mentioned before about my desire to make a creature that stems from what a kid's fear in the early '60s was, which is a mutant of some sort. 

AVC: Did you always sign up to direct four installments, or did that choice come about naturally while working on the scripts? 

AM: That part evolved a bit. I knew I wanted to develop and create the show with other writers, but I knew I couldn't direct all eight because that's a big task. I also wanted time to make other movies. But over the course of the first few months, as the drafts were happening, I realized that I wanted to do more, so I thought I'd direct episodes one and two for the specific reason of establishing certain new characters. I was committed to that. And then I said, “Well, of course I'll do the finale, too.” But the lead-up to our finale is so great that I didn't want to not be part of the penultimate episode. So then I committed to doing those four, and I love and respect the other directors who came aboard.



AVC: A huge source of tension in It is the disconnect between the kids experiencing Pennywise's terrors and the adults not necessarily believing them. How does that aspect factor into Welcome To Derry? 

AM: Yeah, that's the fog in Derry, when adults don't seem to see or pay attention to what's going on. It's mostly about the kids suffering. Kids are gifted with the ability to imagine things that don't exist, for good and for bad. Our monster is a creature made of belief and will obviously target and use that as bait, which is more effective on younger people. That's one of the reasons we wanted to go back to his origins, to understand more the how and why of It becoming a clown. This fog is based on what Stephen King perceives as a sort of real-life behavior and a larger reflection about childhood versus adulthood. There are moments when you become an adult where your imagination fades away, unless you carry the child that you were within you. We absolutely use it in our show as a love letter to memory and the child inside who keeps the imagination alive. The fog is the end of childhood. Adults don't pay attention to everything in the world of children; that's impossible to do when you're occupied with life stuff. When we don't listen to kids to the full extent that we should, things can get forgotten or overlooked, or brushed under the carpet. 

AVC: Another important arc seems to be about the Native American rituals and beliefs about the monster and how they tie into what the adults are doing.

AM: The intervention of Native characters in the book is very important, and we wanted to grab it and extend it. In the interludes, it unlocks the investigations of the Losers and makes them face reality differently. I was always very attentive to that in the book. Natives were the first people on this land and so the first people who encountered It. In many ways, their story is as or more important than the story that our Losers go through. But it's a big question mark in the book about how this happened. So we basically go into that in the show and open the drawer to create a story that might be unfamiliar to readers as well. It's a new narrative that connects to the Indigenous community. 

AVC: One of the main characters is Dick Hallorann, played by Chris Chalk, who fans of The Shining will be familiar with. What was the idea behind bringing him into Welcome To Derry in such a big way? 

AM: Dick has a very predominant role in this story. In the book, he's part of the Black Spot tragedy when it burned down, but that story is told in fragmented pieces. We don't know the full extent of Dick's participation, and that's what we wanted to find out here. We realized he plays a much larger role. Chris Chalk is exceptional in this. I hadn't known him before in person before casting him, and when I saw his tape, it blew my mind. He brought a great deal of mysticism, but he's also grounded. His character goes on a weird journey as someone who has “the shine” and is in conflict with that throughout.

AVC: We can't end without a tease of just how much we'll see of Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise.

AM: I cannot say when and how Pennywise appears because it would be a spoiler. Of course, we're going to see him incarnated in different ways, but eventually, we will see the clown that we all love to hate. There was an attempt to keep Bill not in the proximity of the new young actors to preserve that aura that he has when he's in costume and in character, at least just to preserve the first scene when they all see each other. But then, after that, everyone quickly became friends with Bill. He's very careful about the effect he has on people when he's in costume, but all the actors were very excited about Pennywise showing up on set.

In yet another installment of “How are tech billionaires carrying water for Donald Trump today?” Meta has removed a Facebook group that tracked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in Chicago. The move was made at the urging of Attorney General Pam Bondi, and supposedly in keeping with company policy. Specifically, “This Group was removed for violating our policies against coordinated harm,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement (via NBC News). 

This is the same company that had policies allowing for chatbots to have “sensual” conversations with kids, but discussing local law enforcement among neighbors is a bridge too far, huh? Of course, Bondi characterized the page as “being used to dox and target” ICE agents in Chicago. “The wave of violence against ICE has been driven by online apps and social media campaigns designed to put ICE officers at risk just for doing their jobs,” she wrote on Twitter/X. “The Department of Justice will continue engaging tech companies to eliminate platforms where radicals can incite imminent violence against federal law enforcement.”

The biggest names in the tech sector have all aligned themselves with Trump and his agenda. Elon Musk was once an active member of the administration; Oracle's Larry Ellison is a Trump advisor (who now has a major stake in Paramount, which has done Trump some favors lately). Tim Cook from Apple—which similarly pulled down an ICE tracking app earlier this month—gave the president a plaque with a 24-karat gold base, for some reason. And Meta's Mark Zuckerberg is no less of an ass kisser, recently caught on a hot mic saying he “wasn't sure what number” Trump wanted him to announce for U.S. investment into artificial intelligence. 

It sure seems like these guys are cozying up to Trump in order to continue building their tech empires unfettered by government regulation, but these latest concessions are done under the guise that the safety of ICE agents is being put at “risk.” On the other side of the argument, Joshua Aaron (who created the ICEBlock app removed by Apple) told CNBC, “This is about our fundamental constitutional rights in this country being stripped away by this administration, and the powers that be who are capitulating to their requests.”

After more than 20 years of hosting country music shows on SiriusXM, beloved on-air personality and singer-songwriter Dallas Wayne has signed off — temporarily, he hopes — as he battles a blood cancer called multiple myeloma.

Wayne, a mainstay on SiriusXM channels Willie's Roadhouse (61) and Outlaw Country (62) revealed via a social media post on October 14, 2025, that he received the diagnosis “a while back” and has been in treatment, but now needs to undergo an autologous stem cell transplant, which will require him to step away from the mic. 

“I've been undergoing treatment for some time now,” he wrote, “and while there is no ‘cure' for this type of cancer, it looks like I'm well on my way to remission. My prognosis is promising — I am hopeful.”

A post shared by Dallas Wayne (@dallas.wayne)

Wayne shared his news “in the spirit of transparency,” noting that “in the coming weeks, I'll be taking some time off my radio show” to undergo his upcoming procedure. 

“Rest assured that I'm surrounded by a team of excellent doctors and medical professionals that are taking great care of me, and I have complete faith in their expertise,” Wayne told his fans. “But I'll need a little time to rest and recover.”

“In the meantime,” he continued, “thank you all for your support and understanding. I look forward to seeing you on the radio, and on the road, again very soon! As we say on the radio every day, ‘Be safe, and be good to each other; it's the right thing to do.'”

An autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), according to Mayo Clinic, is an intense process that “uses healthy blood stem cells from your own body to replace bone marrow that's not working properly.” It's typically performed on patients whose bone marrow has been damaged due to high doses of chemotherapy and radiation. 

A typical ASCT patient spends around six weeks in a hospital or transplant facility, per the International Myeloma Foundation, and the average recovery takes three to six months. 

Fans flooded Wayne's social media post with love, wishing him well and sharing success stories of loved ones who've undergone similar cancer treatments. 

One wrote, “Hoss – I've spent many an hour listening to you and Willie's roadhouse and always enjoyed your good cheer and company. Just know that every country music fan enjoy your radio shows is behind you 100%. You're gonna beat this – sending all my ❤️”

“Dallas, I will be praying for you,” one wrote on Instagram. “Thanks for sharing this. I really enjoy your show on Sirius XM and pray you get needed rest. I have a niece in Missouri who is 44 and fighting cancer also. Doctors can do so much but I believe God can do much more. More than any of us can fathom.”

Another shared, “I love your work, I'm a regular OUTLAW listener. I wish you a healthy recovery. Thank you for what you do. All the best Brother.”

Among thousands who shared their well-wishes on Facebook, one chimed in, “Battling cancer does take a team of professionals. Take all the time you need, we'll still be here when you're back on the radio.”

In addition to his on-air work for SiriusXM, Wayne is also an accomplished singer-songwriter who's released 13 albums and is a member of the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame, according to Country Insider.

Karl Marx himself may have written that “history repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.” Still, not even the most dedicated members of Japan's Red Army Faction — a militant, “Communist Manifesto”-carrying group most famous for hijacking a JAL flight in the spring of 1970 — could have imagined their signature action would eventually be restaged as a slick and sprawling Netflix comedy combining the smirking political satire of “Burn After Reading” with the cold-blooded visual dynamism of a Park Chan-wook film. 

 










Sure, the Yodogo Hijacking Incident wasn't quite a tragedy, and “Good News” is just a bit too grounded to feel like a true farce, but the disconnect between the severity of what happened and the blitheness with which Korean director Byun Sung-hyun (“The Merciless”) has re-imagined it is striking enough to affirm Marx's point. I have to imagine that the hijackers would've been happy about that; bumbling and inept as they appear in Byun's movie, their conviction smacks of courage when compared to the spinelessness of the bureaucrats tasked with solving the crisis, all of whom care more about their own egos and careers than they do the 130 passengers whose lives are at stake.

Just droll, twisty, and stylish enough to forgive this 136-minute film for using a lot more runway than it needs to be airborne, “Good News” is a veritable caricature of middle-management — an epic parody of passing the buck. That so few of the actual facts have been changed, despite an impishly self-conflicting disclaimer that insists it was “inspired by real events” but also that “all of the characters and events portrayed are fictional,” only serves to strengthen Byun's damning portrayal of political cowardice.

For all of the lip service that Byun and Lee Jin-seong's knotted script pays to the relative nature of truth, however, “Good News” initially makes it easy to separate fact from fiction. Did heavily armed hijackers commandeer a Boeing 727 as part of their plan to further a worldwide revolution against the United States and its allies? Indeed, and an opening flurry of newsreel footage helps to confirm that we aren't completely outside of history. Did the Communists obsessively quote the boxing manga “Ashita no Joe” as a source of inspiration? Was their leader as handsome as “Tokyo Vice” star Show Kasamatsu, or their youngest member barely old enough to fly without parental supervision? Probably not. 

 










Did the crisis highlight the Kafkaesque absurdity of Cold War politics by sparking an international circle-jerk between various representatives from South Korea, North Korea, Japan, America, and the Soviet Union? You bet. Did the South Koreans rely on the help of a rumpled and mysterious fixer called “Nobody” (a Lupin the III-esque Sul Kyung-gu, his character wise enough to treat the whole situation like a cosmic joke) to goad everyone into action? I highly doubt it, but history tends to forget the people who refuse to accept credit for it. Ditto those who manage to avoid taking the blame.

“Good News” has plenty of fun exaggerating the personas of the different parties involved in the situation, from the violent JAL chairman who only cares about his brand, to the veteran airplane pilot who can't stop complaining about his hemorrhoids, and the Korean Central Intelligence Agency Director (Ryoo Seung-bum) who tries to wash his hands of this entire shitshow like a used car salesman desperate to move an old lemon off the lot. But the movie only really takes flight after the line between “tragedy” and “farce” begins to blur, like when a proactive air force “double parks” a jet in front of the 727 as it stops to refuel. (The visual of the two planes facing each other on the tarmac as the pilot scampers away from his vehicle is a real laugh-out-loud moment in a movie that tends to fall back on knowing smiles.) 

 










Funny as it is, that sequence pales in comparison to what happens later, when a young Korean Air Force lieutenant named Seo (Hong Kyung) has the bright idea of executing a double hijack. The Red Army Faction believes they're flying into Pyongyang, but Seo — in a standoff that's shot like a Sergio Leone spaghetti western, complete with ultra-wide framing, skintight leather chaps, and a few errant tumbleweeds for good measure — wrests control of the radio frequency from his North Korean counterparts and fools the hijackers into landing in Seoul's Gimpo International Airport instead. 

Remarkably, this part of the story is rooted in truth. Gimpo really was hastily outfitted to resemble Pyongyang in the hopes that the hijackers would believe they'd succeeded. Byun simply “yes ands” the record by imagining that an overweight local movie director was recruited to complete the illusion with a fleet of costumed extras waiting for the Red Army Faction on the “North Korean” runway. Like everyone else in this movie, however, the director wants to frame this story on his own terms (“If I can't capture this historical moment on film, I at least want to participate in it!”), and his eagerness to control the action risks creating new conflict. 

 










Not only does this display of egomaniacal buffoonery make for “Good News”' most effective setpiece, the sheer absurdity of the situation embellished by Byun's arch framing and previously unknown flair for dry comedy, it also epitomizes the core ethos of a film in which shaping the narrative is always more important than saving the hostages. Even the relatively noble and clear-headed Seo is motivated by the legacy of his father's sacrifice, which complicates his feelings about the value of heroism even as it pushes him to make the most of his moment in the limelight. 

“Good News” has no compunctions about depicting its characters — even and especially the South Korean ones — as narcissistic dolts. But these larger-than-life figures are as broad as their context is hyper-specific. That functional mismatch saps away at the comedy of a film clearly made to be enjoyed by a global audience. (Netflix is releasing it around the world at the same time, and the multi-language audio track will unhelpfully default to English for anyone who tries to stream the movie from America.) Pointed gestures toward the lingering tension between Japan and Korea — and between those two countries and the rest of the planet — are drowned out by tiresome bickering and exaggerated gags, like a meaningful conversation swallowed into the sound of an airplane engine screaming overhead.

 










Byun's visual playfulness is likewise compelling enough to compensate for the shortcuts in his storytelling — active camerawork and inventive CGI combine with Jo Hyoung-rae's heightened cinematography to imbue the film's airplane cabins and flight control towers with a vivid sense of theatricality. Yet the director is so eager to make a spectacle out of this scenario that “Good News” begins to feel as self-insistent as its characters. 

Perhaps that's by design, and Byun is bending his own form towards a damning commentary on universal self-interest — even in the face of a crisis. But the movie's soft-hearted underbelly fails to support that reading, and by the time the story finally arrives at its final moments, the unsparing cynicism that supplied its initial lift has been dragged back down to Earth by the weight of bland truisms. In a rich but increasingly disappointing film where everyone is trying so hard to pass the buck, it's only fitting that viewers end up holding the bag.

“Good News” will be available to stream on Netflix starting Friday, October 17.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","In the Time of D'Angelo","https://pitchfork.com/features/afterword/dangelo-obituary/","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 18:09:23 GMT","

In January of 2000, a snowstorm blanketed the Washington, D.C., area—up to 17 inches, unexpectedly. But I didn't care about any of that: D'Angelo's Voodoo was set to come out that week, and I needed the roads to be clear enough to drive my mom's silver Dodge Dynasty up the street to buy the CD. Come hell, high water, or black ice, and with enough cash for the album and nothing else, I needed to hear “Untitled (How Does It Feel)” on blast. The radio rip on cassette had run its course.

This was the era when album releases were kinetic, when you had to physically show up at the record store, put the money down, and tear the plastic off the case. And it didn't get more dynamic than D'Angelo, the singer, multi-instrumentalist, and producer born Michael Eugene Archer, who died earlier this week at 51.

Reluctantly, D'Angelo had become a star. He had already helped pioneer the neo-soul genre as a blend of classic R&B and hip-hop. The anticipation for his next work only heightened when “Untitled”—with its sultry and audacious video, featuring only a warm light on a naked D'Angelo—made him a sex symbol. But he wasn't just that: Co-produced with Raphael Saadiq, “Untitled” was an extraordinary song, a seven-minute implosion of desire and transcendence, on which the divine and the erotic co-mingled until they were indistinguishable. Voodoo was rife with moments like these: A planet unto itself, with its own gravity and humidity—staggering, murky, and gorgeous.

Five years prior, D'Angelo had already altered the music landscape with his debut album Brown Sugar, which sounded like a nod to the past and a declaration of the future. Because Voodoo dominates much of the conversation around D'Angelo, it's easy to forget how radical Brown Sugar was upon its release in 1995. Radio R&B sounded slick with drum machines tuned to perfection. The singers themselves were adorned in silk suits or white linen, singing on beaches or in mansions somewhere. Then here comes D'Angelo with his straight-back cornrows and baggy jeans, singing about the pleasures of weed through a honeyed voice, his timbre somewhat rough as if this 21-year-old kid had lived a lifetime.

All smoke and sweat, full of gospel phrasing and hip-hop undertones, Brown Sugar introduced D'Angelo as an emotive, smooth-talking vocalist, a thinking, feeling performer in the likeness of Marvin Gaye, Donny Hathaway, and Curtis Mayfield without borrowing too heavily from any of them. It was clear that he had lived and breathed those luminaries and exhaled something new. D'Angelo had cracked the door to a different kind of masculinity: laid-back yet attentive, stoic yet loving, a confessional tone conveying lust, romance, heartbreak, and devotion.

By the time Voodoo arrived, D'Angelo had gone inward, reeling from the attention he received after Brown Sugar, burrowing into the very DNA of Black soul and rock music. “I sort of went through this tunnel, through gospel, blues, and a lot of old soul, old James Brown, early, early Sly and the Family Stone, and a lot of Jimi Hendrix,” he told Interview Magazine in 1999. “It's been a journey doing this album. I learned a lot about music, myself, and where I want to go musically.”

Recorded at Electric Lady Studios—a space built by Jimi Hendrix—Voodoo was the product of the Soulquarians movement: Questlove on drums, Pino Palladino on bass, Saadiq dropping in, Roy Hargrove tracing trumpet lines through the ether. They weren't chasing a sound so much as conjuring it. Voodoo wasn't just a great album; it was seismic and revolutionary, a study in sonic texture as world-building. It was the way the music seemed to lag just a touch, the bass wobbling, the intent behind it.

Analog by design, the album's imperfections became the groove; listening to it felt like eavesdropping on a jam session between the musical ancestors D'Angelo coveted so much. In 2001, Voodoo won Best R&B Album at the 43rd annual Grammy Awards, then a decade of silence followed. Weary from the public fixation on his body, which threatened to overshadow the music itself, D'Angelo disappeared into years of grief and addiction, popping up for the occasional feature, though remaining very much in the bunker. In that silence, the aura of D'Angelo only grew wider. Indirectly, he taught his peers that groove could be elastic, that blemishes are fine.

I still remember that random night in December 2014 when D'Angelo's third album, Black Messiah, dropped without warning during another period of national unrest. Michael Brown and Eric Garner had been killed by law enforcement that summer, and the streets were thick with protest. Once again, America was showing how it's always felt about Black people, and here came D'Angelo with a work that sounded like a dispatch from both the front lines and the spirit realm. “1000 Deaths,” with all its distortion and chaos, leapt quickly into motion, supplanting D'Angelo's voice beneath the weight of its dense mix. “The Charade” was all reflection, opening with the flicker of a guitar, a Prince-inspired rhythm, and lyrics that cut straight to it. “All we wanted was a chance to talk,” D'Angelo sang, his falsetto hovering above the funk, “instead we only got outlined in chalk.”

This was a new guitar-wielding D'Angelo, in a bandana or a top hat, more Sly and George Clinton than seductive soul crooner. That he titled the album Black Messiah was no small thing: eschewing the slow-burn sensuality of Voodoo and the gospel-soul of Brown Sugar, D'Angelo aimed for something sentimental and prayerful, a resurrection of sorts. He came back weathered and scarred. I could hear the years in his voice, the gravel and the tenderness. But I could also hear resilience. I could see the armor of a man who'd wrestled with demons and the industry and lived to testify.

“I don't know if I'm comfortable being quote-unquote a leader,” he told the Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale in 2015. “But I do realize and understand that my role as a musician, and in the medium that I am, that people are listening to me. Kids are listening to me. We have power to influence minds and influence lives. So I respect that power. I really do. I'm not putting myself on a pedestal or anything like that. I think that's dangerous. When you start playing with that, and you're not careful, you can get yourself into trouble.”

Still, D'Angelo's declaration mattered. His survival mattered. Because so much about being Black in America is about endurance, the daily negotiation between visibility and erasure, between power and stillness. D'Angelo traced that journey on his own terms, from youthful bravado to hard-earned grace, temptation to ultimate salvation.

Occasionally over the years, I would think about that drive in my mom's old car—the transmission slipping in and out, the heat on high—and I would consider the communion I had with D'Angelo's music. Then and always, it's a conversation about art and endurance, how we love and lose and rebuild ourselves. D'Angelo's impact on soul music can't be measured by charts or sales. It's in the way his songs linger, how he inverted the genre and expanded its vocabulary. That, to me, is the heart of his genius: his ability to draw upon decades of genealogy, giving us the permission to feel everything—on its own time.

Jason Kelce, brother of Travis and former star of the Philadelphia Eagles, has issued a statement after a fake quote of him appearing to criticize those unhappy with the selection of Bad Bunny for the Super Bowl Halftime Show went viral. 


	“I normally don't comment on things like this, but I feel I need to address that there are a number of accounts posting fake quotes and attributing them to me on this platform right now,” Kelce wrote on X yesterday, Oct. 14. 


	The phony quote attributed to Kelce was: “If Bad Bunny is a bad fit for the Super Bowl, then maybe the people making these comments are a bad fit for America's future.” While the veracity of the quote was debunked even before Kelce addressed the matter, it still went viral on social media. Its spread was fueled, too, by conservative activists like Dinesh D'Souza and David Harris Jr., whose posts are still up as of publication (via Snopes). 


	On X, Kelce said he appreciated the placement of community notes on several posts boosting the fake quote. He also said, “I will not address the other accounts specifically, because I do not want to amplify their engagement. But please know, unless you hear something directly from me via one of my platforms, it is not real.”

	The fact that the fake quote went so viral speaks to the extent of the conservative melt down over Bad Bunny's Super Bowl performance. Right-wing commentators have complained about Bad Bunny's stance on immigration enforcement, as well as the fact that he sings in Spanish. Turning Point USA even announced their plan to “counter program” Bad Bunny's performance with their own “All American Halftime Show.” (A performer has yet to be announced.)

	











	The Trump administration fueled the culture war outrage further, with Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem saying that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will be “all over” the 2026 Super Bowl. And Trump himself said, “I don't know why they're doing it, it's crazy, and then they blame it on some promoter that they hired to pick up entertainment. I think it's absolutely ridiculous.”

	Bad Bunny, for his part, has brushed off the backlash. While hosting the season premiere of Saturday Night Live, he joked during his monologue that “everyone is happy” about the show, “even Fox News.” 


	“I'm very excited to be doing the Super Bowl, and I know that people all around the world who love my music are also happy,” he said before continuing in Spanish. “Especially all the Latinos and Latinas in the whole world, and here in the United States, all the people who have worked to open doors, more than I have achieved, who have achieved everything, demonstrating that our way, our carrying of this country, no one can ever remove nor erase.”

	Aniyah Saint-Surin was about to live her dream. A lifelong Billie Eilish fan, Saint-Surin was finally able to see the Hit Me Hard and Soft singer for the first time in concert when Eilish began her tour at Kaseya Center in Miami on Oct. 9. The tickets had come together at the last minute, and with the help of her aunt, Saint-Surin had thrown together a serviceable outfit, complete with a red bandana that had been gathering dust in the corner of her room. The clothes didn't matter — she was there to see her Billie. Saint-Surin has seen countless Eilish concerts through her phone screen, so she knew what was going to happen next. After hearing Eilish sing “Guess,” her hit collab with Charli XCX, Saint-Surin could see Eilish getting ready to run past the crowded barricade. This was what she had been waiting for, when Eilish would hop down from her stage and speed past a hoard of waiting fans, arms all outstretched for a second of contact. This was her moment. Eilish had just touched Saint-Surin's fingertips when everything went haywire. A fan grabbed Eilish, and the singer went down hard — slamming into the metal barricade. 

	











	“Instantly, something clicked,” Saint-Surin tells Rolling Stone. Before she even realized what she was doing, she was pushing the fan away, leaving her coveted spot at the barricade — and her chance to interact with Eilish again — to loudly berate the man for grabbing Eilish so roughly. A few minutes later, she was back in her spot, shaken up but convinced no one had noticed her actions. 

	











	Saint-Surin has been listening to Billie Eilish for as long as she can remember — at least six years — which for an 18-year-old, is a substantial chunk of her life. Since Eilish released her debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? in 2019, Saint-Surin has been a self-proclaimed stan, following the Los-Angeles based singer as she went from an industry newcomer to a Grammy and Academy Award-winning powerhouse. She watched Eilish's concerts via TikToks, streamed interviews on YouTube, and of course played her music constantly. “When tickets dropped, I got everyone, my brother, my sister, everybody on their Ticketmaster app,” she says. “I just kept saying ‘I need these Billie tickets.' I need them!” She was still overwhelmed to be at her first ever Eilish concert, so she regaled her family with the story later that night, but went to bed thinking it would be forgotten by the time she woke up. When she fell asleep, she had about 70 followers on TikTok. Five days later, she's reached half a million.

she deserves infinite free tickets bro 😭 #billieeilish #redbandanagirl #billieeilishconcert #ae #edit 


	What Surin didn't know was that the night of her concert, several clips of her yelling at the fan that grabbed Eilish slowly went viral online, garnering posts from Finneas and Renee Rapp. Ticket reselling company StubHub got her tickets to the next show, making sure she could finally live her dream of touching hand with Eilish. Through her tour manager, Eilish got Saint-Surin's brother a ticket to a show — and even sent Saint-Surin several pieces of merch to thank her for her actions. (The fan who grabbed Eilish has not been identified.) The viral video comes as artists have become more vocal about fan behavior at concerts can put them in danger. In a 2023 interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Eilish herself noted that when fans are excited, trying to grab her or throw things, it can get scary. “People just get excited and it can be dangerous. I have mixed feelings about it, because when you're up there it blows,” Eilish said. “But you know it's out of love and they're just trying to give you something. You're in a vulnerable position, but I've been getting hit with stuff for like years.”


	Now Saint-Surin is a hero online, dubbed with the moniker “Red Bandana Girl” for the red headscarf that was on her head when she went after the fan who grabbed Eilish. For her first public interview, Saint-Surin spoke to Rolling Stone about her love for Eilish, the deterioration of concert etiquette, and why it might be time for fandoms to have a reckoning in their ranks.

How long have you been a music lover? Do you have a preferred genre? I love this question. It all depends what mood I'm in. I've been listening since I can remember, and I'm so deeply in love with all the genres and the feelings they give me. From pop to hip hop, and K Pop, I love it all. I love music so much. Like, what would I do without it?


As someone who loves so many different genres, what draws you in about Billie Eilish as an artist? I've been a Billie stan for six years. It feels like I watched her grow — Well, I did watch her grow — but it's like this connection that she has with us. Call stans crazy, but I swear it's real. What really connected me to Billie's music was the way she puts her stories and experiences and traumas into something so beautiful that helps millions of other girls like me also get through obstacles in their lives. From watching her interviews and personality, everything about her character is so captivating to me. When you're a fan and you find your artists, it's like… they just get it. 


How many Billie concerts have you been to before this viral incident?Thursday was my very first time. 


As someone who's been a fan for so many years, that must have felt a bit overwhelming. Oh my gosh. As I walked into that arena and I grabbed that barricade, it felt like every time I closed my eyes, I was going to be in bed, and I've never felt that way before, like it's more than a dream, one, like this is not even real. I've watched her do this show online. But to really look at that stage and look at everybody excited around me, and I'm talking to people about her, It did not feel real. Yeah, I kept falling to the ground. I kept falling to the ground.


Walk me through the incident with the fan. Okay, so Billie has two stages, a small stage and the main stage, which is a long rectangle. So she sings “Guess” and then “Everything I Wanted” and I realized, “Wait, this is when Billie does the crowd walk.” So I rushed back to my barricade spot, and my girls saved my spot. So I get there and I just hold on. I'm like, “This is it.” This was my dream. This is every stan's dream, just to be able to have that second of contact with their favorite artists. It just means so much. So Billie's walking down. I have my phone [tight to my chest]  because I want to remember this, but  I don't want the phone in my face. But the second our fingers touch, Billie goes down. It didn't look right at all, because her head was down and she was smashed against the barricade. I try to pull her arm up and I feel a pull on me, so I turn around and it's this guy. And instantly, something clicked. It was immediate. All I thought was, “You just put your hands on this little lady? Now it's me and you.” 

	











What did you do? All I saw was his face and I just started rushing him. I was screaming and honestly, it was a lot of cussing. “What are you doing? What are you doing? Don't mess with Billie! Get him out of here!” And then next thing I remember, what felt like six police officers were on top of him. I don't even remember the police kind of grabbing me as well, but they were actually really nice and ended up being on my side. 


Were you able to enjoy the concert after the incident? After the security guards questioned me, and they were very nice, I went to my spot by the barricade. Everyone there was so nice. They kept my purse for me. They were asking if I was OK. They're the sweetest people ever. I love them forever. But I was so angry I couldn't really just enjoy the moment. Like in all my concert videos after that, you can hear me screaming “I can't even believe this happened! This is insane!” By the end of the concert, everyone was smiling, filling their hands with confetti and because I went by myself, I was just walking around the arena solo trying to find the exit, just yelling “I can't believe that!” to myself. I know I looked insane.


Did you expect the incident to go as viral as it did? No, I was still very heated, so I didn't even go on social media. The first thing I did was call my aunt, and tell her this guy just attacked Billie and that I rushed him. I thought I was really the only one with the video. I called my mom and she was immediately like, “No more solo concerts. That's a grown man. You could have gotten hurt.” I did see one video about it by the end of the night, but I thought it would be gone by morning. So I go to sleep and when I wake up, I have 2,000 new followers on TikTok. 


Were you concerned when you realized just how viral the clips were getting, especially the ones focused on you? So when I first saw the video on Twitter, I gasped. I was like, “Oh my goodness, all people are going to see is an angry Black woman. Many Black women before me dealt with showcasing their emotions to disrespect, even if you're trying to defend someone that you care about. So I was really worried that I would be taken out of context and treated like that. But I'm glad that people understood and I'm very thankful for the opportunity to be seen as justified, because a lot of women did not get that same grace.


How do you think fandom and obsession plays a part in incidents like this? That connection with stan and artist, your favorite artists — you care so deeply about them. And they care about all of the people that support them, too. I'm a woman. Billie is a woman. And it felt like this man just abused his power. Billie even has a song that is about that. So to forcefully grab her for no reason, just to be aggressive, you're just out of your mind. But I feel like I would have done the same for anybody in that pit. I don't play about putting hands on people and overstepping boundaries. It was just so disrespectful. I couldn't fathom how that all went down so it led to so much anger in me. I've never ran up on nobody before. Yes, you could call me confrontational with my words, but it was just something about that situation. I had to do something. And I see a lot of comments like, “You saved Billie. You saved Billie.” Well, Mr. Police and Mr. Security — they saved Billie. But I was definitely going to give that man a piece of my mind.

As someone who identifies as a stan, do you think concert etiquette like this has gotten worse because of parasocial relationships? One thousand percent. People see artists in the industry and think, “You owe me.” And I'm even guilty of this. When I first started getting into music I'm like, “Oh my gosh, if I see them I'll run up and ask for a picture, give them a hug.” It's because I know them, but they're looking at me and being nice but I'm a stranger. It's reached a certain level of creepy, like now people are crossing boundaries. It's getting weird. It's getting invasive. And I think it's really important to keep understanding that you are strangers to your favorite artists. Yes, you have that relationship through their music, but you don't know them personally. Yes, you watch them on live, yes, you watch all their interviews, and yes, you know every song, but you don't know anything about that person. I think that's something people really need to understand. 


Do you think stans are aware of when this kind of love and obsession gets disrespectful? I think so. I like to call them real stans, people who respect those boundaries. It's the people who aren't googling into their business and trying to find out what's going on in their personal life. When headlines come out about Billie — that's none of my business.  Something I keep in mind is Billie saying something along the lines of she wishes she could tell us everything, but then it would be all over the internet. If it was only Billie stans and my girl, we'd have so much fun. But I understand that when she disappears for months, I just know my girl is probably vibing because she needed that space. And I tell myself that she'll come back again. She always does.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — On Oct. 29 and Oct. 30, visitors to the Amway Grand Plaza hotel can attend Ghosts of the Grand, guided ghost tours of the building's restricted areas that are rumored to be haunted.

“Hear the ghost stories inside the rooms where they happen,” Candice Smith, founder of Tours Around Michigan, said. “It's a very rare occurrence.”

The event is organized by Tours Around Michigan, a Grand Rapids group that frequently hosts haunted tours and “ghost hunting” experiences.

“On ninety-five percent of the tours I run, somebody has a (paranormal) experience,” Smith said. “Sometimes, it's the whole entire group.”

In the hallways and hotel rooms of the historic Amway Grand Plaza, Smith promises an entertaining experience for adults that's just in time for Halloween.

“It sold out very quickly last year,” Smith said.

Prior to a tour, registered participants can arrive half an hour early for a chance to order specialty cocktails and meet Rick Waid, a local paranormal author.

Some specially-designed “ghost hunting” equipment may be available to participants during the tour, too.

“It's just a way to hyperfocus on certain locations,” Smith said. “To get more of a real-time experience for people.”

The Big Bang and the age of the universe have plenty of evidence behind them, from the temperature of the cosmic microwave background to the measured expansion of the universe. Through a lot of work over the last century, we now believe the universe to be around 13.8 billion years old.

But it would not take much to refute this idea. If we were to find a star that is definitively older than this, it would show that the universe was around before 13.8 billion years ago. Enter star HD 140283, looking suspiciously non-metallic.

HD 140283, better known as the Methuselah star, is around 200 light-years from Earth, in the constellation of Libra. It is known to be a high-velocity, sub-giant star, and one of the closest metal-poor stars to our Solar System. 

""The high rate of motion is evidence that the star is simply a visitor to our stellar neighborhood,"" NASA's Hubble Mission team explains of the star. ""Its orbit carries it down through the plane of our galaxy from the ancient halo of stars that encircle the Milky Way, and will eventually slingshot back to the galactic halo.""

In the 1950s, astronomers found HD 140283 to be very metal-poor compared to other stars in the neighborhood, suggesting that the star was formed earlier in the universe, before it had become ""polluted"" by heavier elements fused in the center of other stars. In the early 2000s, astronomers attempted to age it, and came up with an even more surprising result. According to their observations and analysis using stellar evolution models, the Methuselah star's age was possibly around 16 billion years old.

The age of stars is pretty difficult to pin down, relying on measurements of their absolute brightness as well as their chemical abundances, and this was far from the final word on the topic. 

""Maybe the cosmology is wrong, stellar physics is wrong, or the star's distance is wrong,"" Howard Bond of Pennsylvania State University in University Park and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore said in a 2013 statement, after new measurements by the Hubble Space Telescope. ""So we set out to refine the distance.""

That team refined distance measurements to the star, an important step in figuring out a star's intrinsic brightness, which is fundamental in determining its age. Think of it like not knowing if you are seeing a torch held by an approaching stranger, or a very distant lighthouse. Placing the star's distance at a refined 190.1 light-years, and finding that it had a higher-than-predicted oxygen to iron ratio, the team aged the star to be a much less universe model-breaking star.

""Put all of those ingredients together and you get an age of 14.5 billion years, with a residual uncertainty that makes the star's age compatible with the age of the universe,"" Bond said, adding, ""This is the best star in the sky to do precision age calculations by virtue of its closeness and brightness.""

With uncertainty of around 0.8 billion years, at the lower end of the age estimate, it is at least not older than the universe is believed to be. Further studies have placed the star's age between 13.7 billion and 12.2 billion years, with another suggesting between 11.5 billion years and 12.5 billion years. 

The Methuselah star, named for the Biblical Noah's grandfather, described as dying at the age of 969, is likely not older than the universe, nor evidence that we have the age of the universe horribly wrong. But it remains the oldest star we have found in the universe so far. There are other candidates, such as J22132050-5137385, which is thought to be around 13.6 billion years old, give or take 2.6 billion years. Further measurements of this and others could knock the Methuselah star off the top spot, or else refine the age estimate downwards.

Ever checked into an old hotel and felt… off? According to celebrity psychic JusstineK, that feeling might not be your imagination. “We're all intuitive,” she says. “If you feel something that doesn't seem normal to you, trust it—there's a reason your body is sounding an alarm.” With 35 years of experience helping clients (including A-listers like the cast of Friends and Eva Longoria), Jusstine has investigated some of Hollywood's most haunted hotels—including the infamous Sunset Marquis and Chateau Marmont. “They're beautiful,” she admits, “but they're full of energy. At night, those places just eat me up.” So how can you tell if your hotel is haunted—and what should you do if it is? Jusstine shares her psychic guide to reading the room.

According to Jusstine, every object and space holds the energy of those who've passed through it. “All objects absorb energy,” she explains. “Think about how many people have stayed in one hotel room. Their thoughts, emotions and experiences linger in that space.”That doesn't necessarily mean ghosts are stuck there—but the energy can still affect you. “If you're feeling anxious, sad or just unsettled for no reason, you might be picking up on the emotions left behind by others,” she says. “Energy is real. Our thoughts are things.”Her first rule of thumb? Don't dismiss what you feel. “People will say, ‘It's just my imagination.' But how do you know that? If you feel it, it's real.”

While not every flickering light is a spirit trying to say hello, Jusstine says intuition is a powerful guide. “If something doesn't feel like rainbows and butterflies, pay attention,” she says. “That's your body warning you that the energy isn't good.” Classic signs may include:

Lights that flicker or electronics turning on and off

Sudden temperature drops or heaviness in the air

Unexplained feelings of sadness or unease

Dreams that feel too vivid to ignore

Still, she emphasizes that awareness—not fear—is the goal. “This isn't about doom or gloom,” she says. “It's about recognizing energy so you can protect yourself and move through it.”

Jusstine swears by a few unconventional rituals to clear a space. “Forget sage,” she says. “It just pisses spirits off. The true smell that clears energy is cinnamon.” Here's her psychic-approved hotel cleanse:

Visualize light: “Imagine a million suns filling the room, melting away anything that doesn't belong.”

Burn or spray cinnamon: “A candle or spray with real cinnamon helps shift the energy.”

Take a shower: “If you feel off, imagine all the energy washing down the drain.”

Avoid drinking too much: “When you're drunk or overtired, you open yourself up to outside energy.”

“Energy hygiene is as important as physical hygiene,” she adds. “You wouldn't sleep in a dirty bed—so why sleep in dirty energy?”

“For Trump, the leader of Argentina is more important than American families struggling with rising costs,” said Warren.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Republican Sen. Tim Scott (South Carolina) blocked a bill seeking to stop President Donald Trump's unprecedented $20 billion bailout of Argentina and its far right government on Tuesday, with Democrats criticizing Republicans' priorities as Americans languish under GOP cuts to social programs.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) tried to pass the No Argentina Bailout Act on Tuesday afternoon via unanimous consent.

In a speech on the Senate floor, she sharply criticized the Trump administration for giving far right Argentinian President Javier Milei a massive handout while gutting health care benefits for millions of Americans, causing prices to soar due to tariffs, and firing thousands of Americans working in key government agencies.

“[Treasury] Secretary [Scott] Bessent seems to be saying that the American economy can tank, and Americans can pay higher prices, but there will be no end to using American taxpayer dollars to bail out Argentina,” said Warren. “For Trump, the leader of Argentina is more important than American families struggling with rising costs for health care.”

The bill was blocked by Scott, who defended the bailout as backing “an important ally in South America” — an ally that, as Democrats pointed out, has been undercutting the U.S. on soybean exports and harming American farmers. 

As Democrats pointed out, however, Trump and Republicans may have ulterior motives for the bailout. Popular Information reported last month that hedge fund manager Rob Citrone, a billionaire ally of Bessent, has significant investments in Argentina — and thus has a large financial stake in the success of the country's economy.

The Trump administration also has political motivations for supporting Milei, a libertarian Trump supporter whose austerity measures caused poverty to skyrocket to above 50 percent in Argentina in his first six months in office.

Warren pointed out that the bailout is seemingly timed with Argentinian midterm elections coming up on October 26 which may lose Milei a majority in the country's legislature. 

“With global investors pulling their money from the country, trying to get off his sinking ship, and destabilizing its financial markets, his party's electoral chances looked really slim. So, Trump is sending 20 billion U.S. taxpayer dollars to bail out Argentina and prop up Milei so he can stay in power,” she said. 

Democrats also lambasted Republicans for supporting the bailout at the outset of the third week of the government shutdown, which is keeping thousands of federal workers in limbo and suspending crucial services supported by American taxpayers.

“Trump refuses to negotiate to keep the government open or prevent a massive spike in health care costs for Americans, but he's eager to shell out $20 billion of taxpayer money to bail out his authoritarian buddy in Argentina,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland), a cosponsor of the bill, when Democrats introduced the legislation last week. 

“All the while, Americans are stuck facing higher prices at the grocery store and higher premiums on their health insurance. We must put a stop to Trump's brazen scheme to put himself and his cronies ahead of the needs of the American people,” Van Hollen said.

“It's day 13 of the shutdown. What's Trump doing? Negotiating a budget deal? No. Preventing premiums from doubling? No. Stopping 15 million Americans from losing health care? No,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), another bill cosponsor. “He's meeting the Pres. of Argentina to reward him with a $20 billion bailout.”

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed US military leaders to verify that every member of the department watched the speech he delivered at an unusual gathering of senior officers in Quantico, Virginia, last month and reviews the policy changes he announced in the wake of that event, according to a memo reviewed by CNN.
    


            “Leaders at every level will ensure all personnel will either watch the full recording or read the official transcript of the speech, and review the policy changes no later than 31 October 2025,” the October 6 memo from Hegseth states.
    


            Hegseth's memo comes after he ordered senior officers to travel to Quantico for what amounted to a largely political speech that asserted his vision for how the military will physically look and act.
    


            He also offered a stark ultimatum during his speech: If you don't agree, resign.
    


            While Hegseth delivered his speech, in person, to hundreds of senior officers, the subsequent memo makes clear he wants to make sure the message reaches defense personnel at every level.
    


            Leaders “must inculcate our cultural shift and ensure every member of the Department of War understands my guidance,” Hegseth wrote in the memo, using the Trump administration's preferred name for the Defense Department.
    


            Asked about the new memo, a Pentagon spokesperson said that “The Secretary's speech was for the whole force and this memo just reinforces that guidance.”
    


            The directives that accompanied the speech largely roll back efforts made over the last decade focused on eradicating toxic culture in the military, both to decrease harmful behaviors like harassment, but also to meet practical needs of getting people in uniform and keeping them there longer.
    


            There was also a significant emphasis in Hegseth's speech on the fitness and appearance of service members. Hegseth told the room of senior officers he did not want to see any “fat” generals walking the halls of the Pentagon.
    


            Following Hegseth's speech in Quantico, the Texas Military Department removed seven National Guard troops that had been deployed to Chicago because they “did not meet mission requirements,” a Texas National Guard spokesperson told CNN.
    


            “These service members were returned to home station. The Texas National Guard echoes Secretary Hegseth's message to the force: ‘Our standards will be high, uncompromising, and clear,'” the spokesperson said.
    


            The troops, sent to Chicago as part of President Donald Trump's domestic-facing mission focused on crime, were replaced amid criticism on social media over pictures that showed some of the Guard members appearing to be overweight.

Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich joins 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss the ongoing government shutdown and his take on Operation Arctic Frost that reportedly targeted Republican lawmakers' phone records.

A federal judge in San Francisco on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration from continuing government furloughs, granting a temporary restraining order sought by labor unions that argued layoffs were unlawful during the ongoing government shutdown.

U.S. District Court Judge Susan Illston, a Clinton appointee, ordered the administration not to issue any reduction in force notices to federal employees in ""any program, project or activity,"" including any bargaining unit or member represented by the unions during, or because of, the shutdown.

""The evidence suggests OMB and OPM have taken advantage of the lapse in government spending–function to assume all bets are off and that the laws don't apply to them,"" Illston said.

Arguments just began for the 2025 U.S. Supreme Court term, and there is a case that conservatives should be tracking because it could bring the first Supreme Court rebuke of the Left's ongoing campaign of woke lawfare.

Chevron v. Plaquemines Parish is a case that arises from a Louisiana parish's effort to impose massive liability on energy companies such as Chevron and Exxon for crude oil production in the Louisiana coastal zone during World War II. It is part of a cohort of related Louisiana cases, one of which already delivered a judgment for $745 million. The question Plaquemines Parish presents to the court is, on its face, very technical: whether state or federal courts have jurisdiction to handle this type of lawsuit. But what matters most about the case is what is just below the surface.

SUPREME COURT ASKED TO WEIGH IN ON WHETHER SCHOOLS CAN SECRETLY TRANSITION STUDENTS

Plaquemines Parish is representative of a growing wave of state court cases that serve as a key avenue for local governments and left-wing activists to try and obtain policy outcomes by judicial edict or because of massive monetary judgments. This aspect of the case likely was a key part of what triggered multiple Republican state attorneys general to file a brief at the Supreme Court, in which the states warned that “[t]his case exemplifies a vast and troubling trend: state courts positioning themselves as forums to override national policy through nuclear verdicts, onerous injunctions, and more.”

Said differently, Plaquemines Parish is largely indistinguishable from the rest of the Left's lawfare campaign because it uses the same tactics and seeks the same end goal from the litigation: punishment of the energy sector with massive monetary judgments alongside erasure of on-the-ground energy company operations within the pertinent jurisdictions.

This campaign of woke lawfare is a major threat to conservatives who are just trying to live a normal life free from liberal influence. It includes left-wing trial lawyers, nonprofits, and local governments, all of whom are trying to use injunctions, monetary judgments, and other court orders to control what companies can produce and what consumers can buy. While liberals might be losing at the ballot box, they see hope in this woke lawfare campaign, which can bring the Green New Deal to your home no matter what happens in Congress, reshaping our economy through the courtroom when liberals are losing influence elsewhere.

Other cases from this woke lawfare campaign have come up to the Supreme Court in connection with procedural skirmishes, but Plaquemines Parish is the first to reach the court in a posture where a loss would produce a real setback for the Left's campaign. To be sure, if the court holds that this cohort of cases properly belongs in federal court, the immediate result will be the wipeout of the $745 million judgment, alone a huge setback. But there is also a strong indication that federal courts would dismiss all the Louisiana cases under binding precedent, sending the lawfare crowd packing. And a loss on the merits would have serious implications for the Left's woke lawfare strategy overall, coming on the heels of a string of losses for the campaign in state courts in recent years. 

EIGHT CASES TO WATCH IN THE NEW SUPREME COURT TERM

If you are a follower of lawfare, or you care about who gets to decide which products you can find on store shelves, you should keep your eye on Plaquemines Parish, with oral arguments coming up, likely in December, and a final decision this spring.

Plaquemines Parish will surely attract some independent attention for the fact that it involves large energy companies that make for click-worthy headlines or because it implicates a $745 million state court judgment. But the case is far more interesting for how it serves as a stalking horse for the rest of the campaign of woke lawfare that is coursing through state courts across the country. It is that stalking horse aspect of Plaquemines Parish that should pique the interest of most conservatives and lead all of us on the ideological Right to pull for the energy companies to win in a decisive fashion before the court. Because when woke lawfare loses, we all win.

Bitcoin mining stock prices have been rising rapidly over the last week, as market enthusiasm continues to reward bitcoin miners venturing into AI.

Get these headlines directly to your inbox: subscribe to Blockspace.

Over the last day, Bitdeer (NASDAQ: BTDR), Bitfarms (NASDAQ: BITF) Hut 8 (NASDAQ: HUT), CleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK), and Core Scientific (NASDAQ: CORZ) led price increases among major bitcoin miners, with each closing today up 27%, 8.8%, 7.5%, 5.3%, and 5.2% respectively.

Zooming out to the weekly timeframe, Bitfarms leads the pack, up 66% week-over-week as its valuation catches up to other AI-pivoting peers. Bitdeer, TeraWulf (NASDAQ: WULF), Hut 8, CleanSpark, and Cipher (NASDAQ: CIFR) followed Bitfarms, rising 29.5%, 23.2%, 21.4%, 20.4%, and 17.5%.

IREN lagged the above peers on the weekly time frame, but the company has been firmly in the investor spotlight recently and has outperformed the sector in 2025 and is up 1,100% over the last 6 months.

IREN announced today that it closed a $1 billion convertible note to advance its AI business, and Cantor Fitzgerald has issued a $100 price target for the miner, citing its neocloud business and the potential of its Sweetwater campus to hot AI/HPC loads.

All too often, when advisors and investors look to add crypto exposure to their portfolio, they'll add bitcoin exposure and stop there. To be fair, it's understandable why many traditional advisors and investors go about gaining crypto access this way. For them, bitcoin likely comes off as the most legitimized cryptocurrency of its kind. They don't even think to look deeper within the crypto space. However, there are plenty of rewards waiting for those who are willing to do so. Take altcoins, for example.

Altcoins are cryptocurrencies created by crypto developers to help craft new decentralized finance (DeFi) systems or enhance ongoing projects. Many have networks coming online, like Solana, Sui, and Sei, all of which are powered by altcoin innovation. 

This, in part, is how altcoins can offer something different than what you would get from a spot bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin is employed as a store of value, but altcoins can be used to tap into returns from crypto innovation. 

Best of all, it's easier than ever for advisors and investors to gain access to the world of altcoins. Recently, CoinShares launched the CoinShares Altcoins ETF (DIME). This is an actively managed fund that looks to provide exposure to a number of different altcoins. 

Crucially, DIME's index, the CoinShares-Compass Altcoins Index, tracks 10 different altcoins, as of October 15, 2025. This can be largely beneficial for folks looking to use DIME to gain access to the broader altcoin market. The fund could be in a strong position to benefit from long-term crypto innovation and altcoin momentum. But it isn't beholden to any specific altcoin to see beneficial results. 

DIME is just one of many compelling crypto strategies within the CoinShares fund library. One of the largest CoinShares ETFs, the CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF (WGMI A-), has well over $380 million in assets under management.

SEC filings show Bitmain gave firm partially owned by Eric Trump unusually generous terms on equipment

A private Chinese company is giving preferential access to its technology and providing unusually beneficial payment terms on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of specialized equipment to a firm partially owned by Eric Trump, according to industry sources and Securities and Exchange Commission records.

The company, Bitmain, has faced concerns over the potential national security risks of its technology, with one Republican congressman asking the treasury department to review some of its business dealings in the United States.

American Bitcoin Corporation was founded in March, just two months after Donald Trump's inauguration. Eric Trump currently has a 7.5% stake in the company, SEC filings show. Created through a daisy chain of mergers, and majority owned by a company called Hut 8, American Bitcoin went public with overwhelming publicity on 3 September on the Nasdaq exchange. Though the phenomenal stock profits of the Trump venture have been previously reported, the fact that Bitmain appears to be providing preferential access and payment terms to the operation has not been previously reported.

Filings by American Bitcoin with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that the company is purchasing more than 16,000 advanced mining machines – servers that process complex math problems to earn Bitcoin – from Bitmain.

The SEC filings indicate that American Bitcoin is paying Bitmain in “pledged” bitcoin – rather than cash – which could be redeemed up to two years from now, at a current price. An industry expert said he was briefed on the American Bitcoin deals and that Bitmain was offering the company unique and favorable terms, with little money down, and such a long period of time for redeeming their collateral.

In May, at a Las Vegas bitcoin conference sponsored by Bitmain, the president of American Bitcoin, Matt Prusak, underscored the political nature of the bitcoin industry. “If you think you're in the energy business or compute business or bitcoin business you're half right,” he told the audience. “Underneath it all you're in the business of politics, in the politics business.”

Favorable treatment by Bitmain is a main ingredient of the American Bitcoin venture. “Preferential access” to the technology it buys from Bitmain is “central to American Bitcoin's ability to maintain a structural cost advantage”, according to an American Bitcoin press release last month.

In a statement to the Guardian, Bitmain said “technical cooperation” with American Bitcoin's majority owner Hut 8 was specific to one type of mining machine, and was with Hut 8 rather than American Bitcoin. Hut 8 and American both list the same address in Miami on filings with the US government, and Hut 8 handles all of American Bitcoin's operations and infrastructure.

Bitmain, in its statement to the Guardian, said it offers “pledged bitcoin” to other customers. But in a May announcement the company said it would offer a six-month redemption period for these pledges, not a 24-month term, as it offers American Bitcoin.

Experts say American Bitcoin's special access to Bitmain's technology and financing terms raise concerns that the Chinese entity views business with the Trump sons as an opportunity to try to influence the Trump administration on a variety of issues: crypto regulation, energy, or China policy.

“The disclosed terms are pretty unusual,” said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. “It's one thing to extend credit. But the weird part is: ‘you have the option to buy back when you're mining at a discount,'” he said. “If the president's family was involved it brings up the obvious question of whether Bitmain is trying to get special treatment.”

Even the appearance of impropriety can be problematic, said Eric Chaffee, a professor of law at Case Western, who cautioned that at the same time all the facts are not known. “This does look a bit like a sweetheart deal where the reason they are doing this is to curry some influence with the Trump administration,” he said. “This looks bad but at the same time there could be underlying facts that make it a fair deal.”

A spokesperson for Hut 8, Gautier Lemyze-Young, did not dispute the financing terms involved bitcoin with a 24-month window but said the terms were agreed to “in September 2024 long before the launch of American Bitcoin”.

The transaction at issue, though, was done by American Bitcoin, and was revealed in August 2025.

On the day American Bitcoin went public a company executive posted a photo of the team, including Eric and Don Jr, on X, with the phrase “And we are off to the races.”

Lemyze-Young said in the statement that the close work with the Chinese company stemmed from a longstanding relationship and was due to “results, not politics or external affiliations”.

Eric Trump did not respond to detailed requests for comment emailed to American Bitcoin and the Trump Organization, where he is executive vice-president.

A former company executive who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Guardian that the Trump family involvement, announced publicly in March, was known months earlier to insiders as the mergers were organized to form American Bitcoin. “We knew well in advance that they were involved. That's why we wanted to do it,” he said, referring to a merger. “They have some access at the White House. Better than not having it. That's certainly a bonus.”

It is not the first crypto venture of the Trump family to raise questions about foreign influence. An entirely separate Trump cryptocurrency business, World Liberty Financial, which has no ties to American Bitcoin except the Eric Trump ownership, announced in May that the United Arab Emirates would use its stablecoin in a transaction in which it made a $2bn investment involving a separate cryptocurrency exchange.

But American Bitcoin stands out in part because so many threads intersect with US policy: Trump has announced a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve”, which may help drive up bitcoin's price; has loosened regulations on energy, which is key to cheap bitcoin mining; and has launched policies on China that often seem to pivot back and forth between aggressive economic confrontation and conciliation.

Eric Trump has been promoting American Bitcoin and the stock, appearing with company executives at investor forums and business news broadcasts, repeating that the Trump family had turned to cryptocurrency because it was “debanked” following the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol.

“We developed a company named American Bitcoin. We are one of the biggest bitcoin mining companies on Earth,” he told a conference last month, claiming the price of bitcoin would shoot to a million dollars, an eightfold increase from the present.

Bitmain is not regulated by US agencies but there have been concerns about the company's technology. Last month the Republican congressman Zachary Nunn, of Iowa, pressed the treasury department to review Bitmain and another Chinese bitcoin company. In a statement to the Guardian, Nunn wrote: “American families deserve to know that our power grid, digital infrastructure, and national security aren't being compromised by foreign entities with opaque ownership and ties to hostile regimes.”

In Bitmain's statement to the Guardian, the company said it responded to his office, and said it “strictly complies with US and applicable laws and regulations and has never engaged in activities that pose risks to US national security”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Trump Crypto News: Eric Trump Confirms Real Estate Tokenization Plans With WLFI","https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/10/10/eric-trump-confirms-plans-to-tokenize-real-estate-with-world-liberty-financial","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 19:30:16 GMT","

Eric Trump, son of U.S. President Donald Trump and a co-founder of decentralized finance protocol WLFI$0.1394, said he is actively working on a real estate tokenization project tied to a building currently under development.

Teasing the plan in an interview with CoinDesk TV coming next week, he said the effort may offer fractional ownership to the public, potentially using the crypto rails built by World Liberty Financial.

""We are working on it as it pertains to one specific building that I'm doing right now,"" Trump said in the interview. ""I think it's going to be absolutely incredible.""

His comments followed Zach Witkoff, another WLFI co-founder, who floated plans to bring the Trump real estate portfolio onchain during a panel discussion at the Token2049 event in Singapore in early October.

Tokenization refers to the process of turning traditional assets such as bonds, credit, equity – or, as in this case – real estate into digital tokens that can be bought, sold and transferred on blockchain rails. It's a model increasingly explored by global banks and asset managers as a way to unlock liquidity and broaden investor access to traditionally exclusive asset classes.

Trump suggested in the interview on Wednesday that applying the tokenization model could open investment opportunities to his family's global base of supporters. He said he envisions offering micro-shares in ""high-profile properties"" directly to retail investors, instead of getting financing through traditional lenders.

""If I decided to build a hotel in Washington, D.C. or in Dubai or in New York, why do I have to go out using Deutsche Bank?"" he said. ""Why can't I go out to the masses?""

He described a model where investors might contribute as little as $1,000 to gain partial ownership of a building, with added benefits like hotel perks or exclusive access.

While details remain scarce, he indicated the initiative would be integrated with World Liberty Financial and its U.S. dollar stablecoin USD1. World Liberty Financial launched last year with a focus on merging crypto infrastructure with traditional financial services.

The protocol announced plans last month to roll out a debit card and retail application soon, a move that would make the USD1 stablecoin available for everyday payments, CoinDesk reported.

The full interview will air on October 21 on CoinDesk's YouTube channel.

Men's Brains Shrink Faster than Women's. What That Means for Alzheimer's

Women's brains age more slowly than men's, but they still have higher rates of Alzheimer's disease

During ageing, men experience a greater reduction in volume across more regions of the brain than women do, according to a longitudinal study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The authors suggest this means that age-related brain changes do not explain why women are more frequently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease than men are.

“It's really important that we understand what happens in the healthy brain so that we can better understand what happens when people get these neurodegenerative conditions,” says Fiona Kumfor, a clinical neuropsychologist at the University of Sydney, Australia. This study adds to scientists' understanding of typical brain ageing, she adds.

Nearly twice as many women are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease as men, and ageing is the biggest risk factor for the disease. This has prompted research into age-related sex differences in the brain. “If women's brains declined more, that could have helped explain their higher Alzheimer's prevalence,” says co-author Anne Ravndal, a PhD student at the University of Oslo.

Previous research investigating sex differences in brain ageing has shown mixed results, Ravndal adds. Several studies have found that men experience greater loss of total grey matter and hippocampus size compared with women, whereas other work has reported a sharper decline of grey matter in women.

The latest study included more than 12,500 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans from 4,726 people — at least two scans per person, taken an average of three years apart — who did not have Alzheimer's disease or any cognitive impairments and were control participants in 14 larger data sets. The researchers compared how the individuals' brain structures changed over time, looking at factors including the thickness of grey matter and the size of areas that are associated with Alzheimer's disease, such as the hippocampus, which is essential to memory.

Overall, men experienced a greater reduction in volume across more regions of the brain than women did. For example, the postcentral cortex, which is responsible for processing sensations of touch, pain and temperature, as well as the body's own position and movements, declined by 2.0% per year in men and by 1.2% annually in women.

Kumfor says the results suggest that men age faster than women do. Men also have a shorter life expectancy.

If these changes did have a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, the study would have shown that women experience a greater decline in areas associated with the disease, such as the hippocampus and precuneus, which are involved in memory, says Amy Brodtmann, a clinician researcher in cognitive health at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.

Ravndal says the results point to other possible explanations for the sex differences in prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, such as differences in survival or susceptibility to the disease.

That sex differences in brain volume don't seem to play a part in the condition is not entirely surprising, says Kumfor, because neurodegenerative conditions are complex. Understanding the disorders will require longitudinal studies involving people with Alzheimer's disease, to compare how their brains change over time. “Just looking at age-related changes in brain atrophy is unlikely to explain the complexities behind it,” she adds.

Although the study is robust, further investigations with more diverse data sets are needed, says Brodtmann. For example, people included in the study had high levels of education — a protective factor against Alzheimer's disease — meaning that they were not fully representative of the general population. The data sets also lacked information about other factors that influence a person's risk of Alzheimer's disease, such as ethnicity and the age at which women experience menopause.

The authors say that when they adjusted their analysis for education level, some parts of men's brains no longer showed a steeper decline than occurred in women. When they compared men and women who were predicted to live for the same number of years, rather than those of the same age, the two groups' brains declined at similar rates.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This European treatment for joint pain just passed a major scientific test","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251015032316.htm","Wed, 15 Oct 2025 14:47:55 GMT","

A new randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial suggests that a single round of low-dose radiation therapy could offer a safe and effective alternative for people suffering from painful knee osteoarthritis.

Participants with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis experienced notable pain reduction and improved mobility within four months of receiving the treatment. The radiation exposure was only a tiny fraction of what is used in cancer therapy. Because the study included a control group that underwent a simulated treatment, researchers were able to clearly separate genuine treatment effects from placebo responses, which are common in osteoarthritis trials. Early results from this Korean study were presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Annual Meeting.

""People with painful knee osteoarthritis often face a difficult choice between the risks of side effects from pain medications and the risks of joint replacement surgery,"" said Byoung Hyuck Kim, MD, PhD, principal investigator on the trial and an assistant professor of radiation oncology at Seoul National University College of Medicine, Boramae Medical Center. ""There's a clinical need for moderate interventions between weak pain medications and aggressive surgery, and we think radiation may be a suitable option for those patients especially when drugs and injections are poorly tolerated.""

Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting an estimated 32.5 million adults in the United States. It develops as the cartilage that cushions bone ends wears away over time. The condition often targets the knees and hips, limiting mobility and diminishing quality of life. Typical treatment begins with lifestyle adjustments and pain-relief medications, with surgery considered when symptoms become severe.

Low-dose radiation therapy has long been used in European countries such as Germany and Spain to treat joint pain, where it is widely accepted. However, Dr. Kim noted that before this study, rigorous placebo-controlled evidence was scarce, and awareness of the treatment remained low among clinicians in other parts of the world.

""There is a misconception that medicinal, or therapeutic, radiation is always delivered in high doses,"" he said. ""But for osteoarthritis, the doses are only a small fraction of what we use for cancer, and the treatment targets joints that are positioned away from vital organs, which lowers the likelihood of side effects."" In this study, he explained, the radiation dose was less than 5% of what is typically used in cancer therapy, and no radiation-related side effects were observed.

The multicenter study included 114 participants with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis, recruited from three academic hospitals in Korea. They were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a very low dose (0.3 Gy), a low dose (3 Gy), or a control group that received simulated (sham) radiation. In the placebo group, patients went through the same setup as those receiving treatment, but no radiation was actually delivered. Each participant underwent six treatment sessions without knowing which group they were assigned to.

To ensure the results reflected the true effects of radiation, the researchers restricted the use of additional pain relievers, allowing only acetaminophen as needed during the four-month follow-up period. The effectiveness of treatment was evaluated using internationally recognized standards, identifying a participant as a ""responder"" if they achieved meaningful improvement in at least two of three measures: pain, physical function, and overall assessment of their condition. Participants also completed separate questionnaires addressing pain, stiffness, and mobility. No treatment-related side effects were reported.

After four months, 70% of patients in the 3 Gy group met responder criteria, compared to 42% in the placebo group (p=0.014). Outcomes in the 0.3 Gy group were not significantly different from the control group (58.3% improved, p=0.157), indicating the 3 Gy regimen drove relief beyond placebo effects.

Meaningful improvements in the composite score of pain, stiffness and physical function were reported more often in the 3 Gy group (56.8%) than in the placebo group (30.6%, p=0.024). For other secondary outcomes, including the amount of pain medication needed, there were no significant differences.

Dr. Kim said this trial differed from previous research in two critical ways. ""The sham-controlled design helped rule out placebo effects, and we limited stronger analgesics, which made differences between groups more clearly attributable to the radiation itself,"" he said.

""In previous studies, drugs such as NSAIDs or opioids were also used during the intervention or follow-up period. But using these pain relievers could mask the effects of radiation therapy,"" he said. Because analgesic use was limited to acetaminophen only during the four months of follow-up in this trial, ""that means the differences between treatment groups are more clearly attributable to the low-dose radiation therapy itself.""

Responses in the placebo arms were substantial -- about 40% met the criteria for treatment response without true radiation -- but are consistent with rates reported in prior osteoarthritis trials of injections or medications and in at least one similar European study, Dr. Kim said. ""It was surprising, and it underscores how important placebo-controlled designs are in osteoarthritis research. We need to examine this more closely in future studies.""

Radiation therapy may be best suited for patients with underlying inflammation and preserved joint structure, he explained. ""For severe osteoarthritis, where the joint is physically destroyed and cartilage is already gone, radiation will not regenerate tissue,"" Dr. Kim said. ""But for people with mild to moderate disease, this approach could delay the need for joint replacement.""

He emphasized that low-dose radiation should be considered as part of shared decision-making alongside standard measures such as weight loss, physiotherapy, and medications. ""In clinical practice, responses could be even stronger when radiation is properly combined with other treatments, and patient satisfaction may be higher than with current options alone.""

The research team is completing 12-month follow-up to assess durability of benefits and to correlate symptom relief with imaging-based measures of joint structure. Planned studies also include larger, pragmatic trials to evaluate outcomes in specific subgroups and health-economic analyses comparing low-dose radiation with injections and medication regimens.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

Seattle University President Eduardo Peñalver — credited with “a legacy of growth and innovation” — is leaving to become president of Georgetown University, the two Catholic Jesuit institutions announced Wednesday.

Peñalver, who has led Seattle U. since 2021, will step down March 31, 2026, and start in his new role at Georgetown in Washington, D.C., on July 1.

During his tenure, Seattle U. launched a “Technology Ethics Initiative,” designed to “convene and inspire productive discussions about the role of transformative technologies for a just society.” The initiative is led by political science professor Onur Bakiner, whose current research examines AI governance models.

Last year, the university welcomed Father Paolo Benanti, an advisor to Pope Francis on artificial intelligence and technology ethics, as a distinguished visiting professor. Peñalver moderated a conversation between Benanti and Microsoft President Brad Smith for employees on the company's campus in Redmond, Wash.

Like many institutions, Seattle U. has experienced increased enrollment demand in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines. It has also partnered with local tech corporations, including Amazon and Microsoft, which helped fund the $100 million Center for Science and Innovation.

At Seattle U., Peñalver helped launch new academic programs and integrated Cornish College of the Arts into the Seattle U. community.

“This was not an easy decision,” Peñalver said in a message to the university community, “but one I make with gratitude for all that we have accomplished together and confidence in the university's continued momentum. While I am excited about the opportunity to continue my work in Jesuit higher education at such a pivotal moment, I am also sad to be leaving Seattle University and the Pacific Northwest, which will always be my home.”

Peñalver was raised in Puyallup, Wash., and attended Henry Foss High School in Tacoma before he went on to graduate magna cum laude from Cornell University in 1994.

He studied philosophy and theology at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar and earned his bachelor's degree from Cornell University and law degree from Yale Law School. He also clerked for former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, and prior to Seattle U., was dean of Cornell Law School.

“President Peñalver is an exceptional leader steeped in the Catholic and Jesuit tradition who brings a wealth of experience in higher education, a global mindset, a commitment to social justice and academic excellence, and a bold vision for Georgetown's future,” said Thomas Reynolds, chair of Georgetown's board of directors, in a news release.

Peñalver will succeed Interim President Robert Groves, who has led Georgetown for the past year after former President John DeGioia stepped down from his role in 2024 to recover from a stroke.

On Wednesday, Anthropic released Claude Haiku 4.5, the newest version of its smallest model, billed as offering similar performance to Sonnet 4 “at one-third the cost and more than twice the speed,” per a company blog post. 

Anthropic cites a range of new benchmark results to back up those performance claims. In the company's testing, Haiku scored 73% on SWE-Bench verified and 41% on the command-line-focused Terminal-Bench — below Sonnet 4.5, but on par with Sonnet 4, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 in each case. Tests show similar results on benchmarks for tool use, computer use, and visual reasoning.

The new version of Haiku will be immediately available under all free Anthropic plans and the company believes it will be particularly appealing for free versions of AI products, where it can provide significant capabilities while minimizing server loads. The lightweight nature of the model also means it's easier to deploy multiple Haiku agents in parallel or in combination with a more sophisticated model.

In a statement to press, Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger said the Haiku would make new styles of deployment possible in production for the first time. “It's opening up entirely new categories of what's possible with AI in production environments – with Sonnet handling complex planning while Haiku-powered sub-agents execute at speed,” Krieger said. “We're giving people a complete agent toolbox where each model has the right combination of intelligence, speed, and cost for different parts of the job.” 

The most immediate applications are likely to come in software development tools, where Claude Code is already commonly used and latency is often a critical factor. In statements provided by Anthropic, Zencoder CEO Andrew Filev described the new version of Haiku as “unlocking an entirely new set of use cases.” 

Haiku 4.5 comes after a string of high-profile launches for Anthropic: just two weeks after the launch of Sonnet 4.5 and two months after the launch of Opus 4.1, both of which were hailed as state-of-the-art on release. The previous version of Haiku was released in October 2024.

I actually designed a PCB / custom keyboard (well, it's just a copy of the Canon Cat layout) with the Leap, Use Front, etc keys (using an ARM dev board called Black Pill, which is probably overkill, to scan the rows/columns for key up/down events) for this reason. Right now I have it sending key codes over a serial connection to another microcontroller with a display module so you can now type on it, but I really need to get started on the actual Canon Cat style software. I'm not really planning to make it USB compatible or use any existing OS though.> Maybe predictably, early on I found myself wanting more than one text stream. I fought that inclination to discover what's in store down the pure Canon Cat path.I think the Cat would let you do that if you used multiple disks? I haven't used a Canon Cat, but only read the documentation. It used a single DISK button for loading and saving, based on context. The following quote is copied from the manual for reference. I think the ""beep"" option is for if you've made an edit in memory but don't have the correct disk in for saving that same text stream.[quote]The Cat has two storage places for your text: memory and disk. Memory is the area inside the Cat where the text is stored while you are working on it. The on-screen text is a portion of the text stored in memory. The memory is kept alive by the electric current coming from the wall. If the power were cut, the text in the memory would be lost, so you need to record the text more or less permanently on a disk with the help of the disk drive.One command, [DISK], handles all operations involving disk and memory. When you use [DISK], the Cat does one of three things:-Plays back the disk in the drive. This means copying the information from the disk into the memory, and putting a portion of it up on the screen where you can see it and work on it.-Records the text in memory. This means transferring the information in memory to the disk for safe storage.-Beeps. This means the Cat makes a warning sound and does nothing, because recording or playing back might lose information.A DISK sign appears on the ruler while the Cat is recording or playing back.[unquote]

How much does location actually play a role in where you want to go to residency? 

As a doctor who's currently in residency, this was a huge factor for me because I knew that my quality of life outside of work was going to drastically affect how I was going to perform at work. 

I wanted to be in a location where I felt I had a good support system and like I could be outside and have good physical activity. I also knew that I did not want to take public transportation. 

I prioritized all of these things to formulate my rank list of different residency programs where I wanted to ultimately practice. 

If this is something that you feel will drastically affect your mental health, I would highly recommend considering it before you make your rank list for residency.

Alejandro Bedoya believes the USMNT's 2-1 win over Australia was ""a good exercise"" for Mauricio Pochettino's squad. (2:14)

A little more than a month ago, the U.S. men's national team seemed to be in disarray. The results were poor, the individual performances offered little in the way of hope, and the push for competition within the team seemed based more on wishful thinking than reality.

Yet with the October window now concluded, it's clear that the recent gathering of USMNT players was a success, and there has been discernible progress made in terms of the team's preparations for next summer's FIFA World Cup. The team's momentum has never been higher this cycle. Granted, that's a low bar given where they've been, but they're evolving nonetheless.

The results have improved to the point that the U.S. is now unbeaten in its past three games, two of them wins, all against teams who have punched their ticket to the World Cup. More importantly, there is competition for places everywhere on the field.

At forward, Haji Wright has emerged to challenge Folarin Balogun, even as the latter still has an edge in terms of securing a starting spot.

The midfield seems jumbled, but in a good way. Before there didn't seem to be many candidates actually making a strong case for inclusion on a World Cup roster; now the likes of Tanner Tessmann, Aidan Morris and Cristian Roldan -- the ultimate late bloomer if there ever was one -- all look capable of making a contribution on the biggest stage.

The attackers sitting behind the central striker are making cases as well. Weston McKennie looks to have come in from the cold after being frozen out by manager Mauricio Pochettino in September. Against Australia, Diego Luna reminded everyone why he's a Pochettino favorite, with his high-energy and incisive play giving the USMNT a boost. Malik Tillman looked sharp against Ecuador.

The backline, with the help of a 3-4-3 system (at times) looks to be more stable than what was on display in the sobering 2-0 defeat to South Korea barely a month ago.

Yet for all the progress made, in some respects, the October window left one wanting more.

Christian Pulisic was a bit-part player, limited to a total of 45 minutes over two games due to an ankle injury and a hamstring ailment sustained against Australia. Tillman was limited as well, unable to take the field against Australia due to a tender hamstring of his own. Alejandro Zendejas, one of the heroes of September, was sidelined with a knee issue. Left back Antonee Robinson, whose return from offseason knee surgery had been hugely anticipated, never made it onto the field, with his recovery from the aforementioned procedure dragging on and on. This is on top of players like Tyler Adams, Ricardo Pepi and Johnny Cardoso also being absent, with the latter two ruled out with injury.

Getting all of the U.S. teams' best players on the field at the same time -- or even most of them -- remains an elusive goal, and there aren't many more opportunities to see what that looks like prior to the start of the World Cup.

The positive is that despite these absences, the U.S. was still able to not only get results, but for the most part look good doing it. The competitiveness within the squad has also reached a point where those who were absent -- besides Adams and perhaps Robinson -- have fallen down the depth chart, and are at risk of being left behind.

Harder to overlook is the USMNT's maddening habit of slow starts that have resulted in conceding the first goal -- something that has happened seven times in 16 matches in 2025 -- which was the case this window against both Ecuador and Australia. Even aside from the goal against the Socceroos, the USMNT seemed flummoxed by Australia's high defensive line. The U.S. recovered in both matches, even securing a comeback win against the Socceroos, the first come-from-behind win of the Pochettino era.

The U.S. manager alluded to the ""good and not-so-good"" of the team's comeback ability. When the World Cup starts for real in June, the Americans won't be able to afford to make the kind of defensive mistakes that led to them falling behind in these matches.

But the USMNT's resolve, oftentimes suspect this cycle, now seems to possess more solidity. Pochettino noted that ""it's no coincidence"" that the U.S. recorded a comeback win now that the team's culture is in a better place. ""Culture"" has long been one of those squishy, imprecise words that gets thrown around a lot to explain both successes and failures, but when Pochettino talks about it, the picture conjured up in the mind's eye is more like razor wire than a down pillow. There is steel behind his words and actions.

The U.S. manager's message appears to have been received loud and clear by the players, with McKennie among those who have taken it to heart the most. The Juventus midfielder was active in both matches, and against Ecuador seemed especially adept at finding Balogun in behind the defense. The question now is whether he fends off the likes of Tillman and Zendejas to keep his spot on the field as an attacking midfielder. McKennie at his peak would be hard to displace from the lineup.

That is the kind of battle that adds plenty of intrigue to the November window, which will include matches against Paraguay and Uruguay. The battle for the two double-pivot spots in midfield will be intense, too, as will the starting striker position.

Health will play a part in determining who rises and falls. No team enters a World Cup completely injury-free. There are always players who miss out. All the more reason why the sight of performers stepping up -- be it Roldan or Luna or Wright -- is encouraging.

Now the U.S. finds itself on an upward trajectory again. The looming World Cup, once looked at with a certain level of dread, is generating excitement again. There is a greater sense that this team can do the country proud.

Credit Pochettino for the turnaround, although he knows better than anyone there is still work to be done.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

ALMATY—It's all in the details, some say.Daniil Medvedev is buying into that notion, as he continues settling into his new coaching team of Thomas Johansson and Rohan Goetzke.The 2021 US Open champion is coming off a semifinal showing at the Rolex Shanghai Masters, his first run to the last four of a 1000-level event in more than six months. As he describes the early goings of the collaboration, it's one that is honing in on touching up his existing brand of tennis.“I think my game is complete enough, but it needs a lot of small details to add here and there and that's what we're looking for,” he told press Wednesday in Almaty during the English portion of his pre-tournament press conference.“It's everything: forehand, backhand, volley, serve. It's already good enough because I was number one, but small details needs to be improved.”

Medvedev mutually ended an eight-year partnership with coach Gilles Cervara after his first-round loss to Benjamin Bonzi at the US Open. There wasn't much time to get acquainted with Johansson and Goetzke ahead of an encouraging Asian swing, where he also advanced to the Beijing semifinals after dismissing Alexander Zverev.“It's just a start. We made good results in China for sure. When you start playing better, you want to do more, and I know how to do more, but it's a step by step process for sure,” said Medvedev.“It's not also easy to judge because there are tournaments, so we had like a week in Monaco and then it's tournament after tournament. There is no time to really do something big, but so far it has been working well, so we'll see how it goes later.”

The Russian is seeded second this week in Almaty, behind Wednesday's practice partner and defending champion Karen Khachanov. He's well-acquainted with Kazakhstan, though this marks his first trip to the Apple City. Needless to say, Medvedev's liked what he's seen with the operation so far at Almaty Arena.“They do a great job, the federation and the tournament itself. For a 250, it's a really, really good one. Everyone who came here for the first time is telling this,” he shared.“I heard a lot of good things about Almaty. Getting in a bit late from Shanghai, I'm not gonna have much time to see the city. I went to the center once already.”

At some point during the past turbulent months, as he searched for purpose and faced the pressures of a very public divorce that engulfed both his personal and professional life, the music stopped for Raymond Ayala.


	“For the first time in my life, the muse shut down,” says the man long known as Daddy Yankee. “That had never happened to me before. Ever.”

	











	It wasn't supposed to be like this. In 2022, Daddy Yankee — that rare artist who has garnered both vast commercial success and respect from artists and the industry alike — surprised the world when he announced his retirement from music. He released what was supposed to be his last studio album, Legendaddy, and performed what was set to be his last tour, grossing $197.8 million and selling 1.9 million tickets, then the second-highest-grossing Latin tour in Billboard Boxscore history. But Ayala was spent.


	Then, on Dec. 3, 2023, at the tour's final date at Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot in San Juan, he made yet another shocking revelation: “Tonight, I recognize, and I'm not ashamed to tell the whole world, that Jesus lives in me and I live for him,” he told the 15,000 fans that packed his hometown venue. “A story ends and a new story begins.”


	Ayala immediately started spreading the word of the Lord, in music and in deed. He released songs brimming with positivity, traveled on missions to Africa, made impromptu appearances in churches in Puerto Rico and other Latin countries and saw firsthand the reaction to his new brand of “music with a purpose,” culminating with a Latin Grammy win for best urban song for “Bonita” (Pretty), a non-album single released in 2023.

	











	But in December 2024, Ayala's wife of nearly 30 years filed for divorce, and an initially amicable split turned sour amid a spate of legal disputes over his many businesses and assets, including his past catalog negotiations. Making music became even more difficult.


	“But it was part of the process to arrive at a total dependency on God,” Ayala now says. “He said, ‘Even if your muse is gone, remember, I am your muse. I am your inspiration.' Today, I'm making music and I'm building a new catalog.”


	I'm chatting with Ayala in a private dining room at a Brooklyn hotel — his first interview with the press since he announced his conversion to Christianity — over tea and fruit. He is 49 years old, but his trim physique (later, he'll go to the gym with pal J Balvin) and youthful, unlined face display none of the travails of an artist who grew up in Puerto Rico's housing projects and whose music career was jump-started by a gunshot to the leg that ended a promising baseball run.


	As Daddy Yankee, Ayala is widely recognized as the man who catapulted reggaetón from underground genre to global movement, in large part thanks to his 2004 smash, “Gasolina,” and the relentless string of global hits that followed. Today, he has 105 entries — including seven No. 1s — on the Hot Latin Songs chart, among them “Despacito” alongside Luis Fonsi and his most recent, “Sonríele” (Smile), which is currently charting. At the time of publication, Daddy Yankee was the No. 37 most listened-to artist on Spotify despite the fact that he has released only a few singles in the past two years.


	That is a testament to the power of the name and the man. “Without Daddy Yankee, there would be no J Balvin,” Balvin says. “He was, and continues to be, the source of inspiration that has so propelled me to elevate urban music to a global level.”

	











	Now Ayala has embarked on a dramatically different second act, with Jesus as a centerpiece and the goal of releasing music that's commercially successful but is “music with a purpose,” as he calls it, rather than religious music with evangelical lyrics.


	“Having a life of success is different from having a life of purpose,” Ayala replies when I ask what prompted his conversion and the ensuing shift in direction. “Before, my interest was transforming the industry [through music], and that purpose had to do more with business and money, influence, success. Now my purpose is to transform lives with that same instrument. They're very different purposes.”


	But the vehicle is still the same. On Oct. 23, Ayala will perform as Daddy Yankee at the Billboard Latin Music Awards, his first televised performance in three years. And he will release Lamento En Baile (Mourning Into Dancing), his first album since 2022 — and his first since publicly converting – on Oct. 16. The title comes from Psalm 30:11, which says, “You have turned my mourning into dancing,” and dovetails with its first focus track, “Sonríele,” a peppy merengue brimming with optimism.


	It's the first track Ayala has released under DY Publishing, as well as the first step in rebuilding his catalog. In October 2024, Concord purchased key elements of his music publishing and master-recording catalog, including chart-topping hits “Gasolina,” “Con Calma” and “Despacito.” According to Concord's website and Billboard reports, the agreement encompasses work from 2002 through 2019 and includes certain name, image and likeness rights. Prior to that acquisition, Billboard reported that parts of his catalog had been quietly acquired around 2021 by Cinq Music and a private fund that asked not to be named, which then sold those assets to Concord. (Concord, Cinq and Ayala himself decline to comment about specifics of the deals.)

	











	“Someone like [Daddy Yankee], someone who is as prolific as he is productive, we imagine it will happen fairly quickly,” says Jorge Mejía, president/CEO of Sony Music Publishing Latin America and U.S. Latin, which continues to administer all songs written by Ayala for the world. “This is not an unusual situation for us. Artists inevitably evolve throughout their careers — growth, change and reinvention are all part of the creative journey.”


	Ayala is releasing his new music on his own DY Records through a license deal with HYBE Latin America, which announced the signing in July in tandem with the release of “Sonríele” and is betting big on Daddy Yankee as its first major and established artist. “Obviously, partnering with [Daddy Yankee] is extremely important for us,” HYBE Latin America COO Juan Sebastián Arenas says. “We're partnering with a music icon, supporting a new project. Our goal is to tell the industry we're here to do something new. There's no one better than [him] to accomplish that.”


	Likewise, in HYBE, Ayala found a label partner that's young (HYBE Latin America launched in 2023), inquisitive and eager to break molds. This summer, Ayala, who has a big following in Asia, went to South Korea for the first time and shot the video to his upcoming single “El Toque,” incorporating elements of Korean dance.


	“I am my own manager now and I'm managing myself 100% alone, and I have good allies,” Ayala says. “HYBE is a good ally. They have a progressive mentality and they're in constant reinvention. That's very compatible with my new vision.”


If you listen closely, it's clear the seeds of Ayala's conversion were planted in his music long ago. On 2007's “Coraza Divina” (Divine Shield), for example, an autobiographic rap set over salsa tumbao that narrates his rise from the hood, he named a higher power: “Evil realized he was the chosen child and sought to destroy him/But you know what? I have a divine shield, the power to light my path,” he says in the chorus.


	“Many people don't know that I converted to the Lord for the first time at 19 years old,” Ayala says. “But I diverged from the path. My lyrics were clean, but I knew they belonged to the world, [not to God].”

	











	Still, in a genre rife with sexually graphic lyrics that often glorify drugs and violence, Ayala always stood out as a rapper with a conscience who delivered mostly G-rated material, but nevertheless oozed swagger and braggadocio. The strategy let him open the door for reggaetón to find success among mainstream Latin audiences and beyond: He was the first Latin urban artist to consistently place hit songs on radio when that medium was the key driver to success.


	But clearly, the content of Ayala's music went deeper than a commercial play. On 2004's Barrio Fino, the breakout album that includes “Gasolina,” there were tracks that referenced God and resilience. It's a theme that appears again and again in his work — through to 2016, when, unbeknown to the public, he privately converted. He didn't announce it, he says, “because I had many agreements I had signed and committed to” — label deals, recordings with other artists, brand deals, a major tour — “and I had to deliver.”


	Ayala is known for keeping his word. He's a man of habit and discipline: makes his bed every morning, works out, reads, eats healthy, goes to the studio, repeats. As the “Big Boss” of reggaetón and the urban movement itself, he couldn't conceive of not fulfilling his contractual obligations. So he kept his allegiance to Christ to himself, until that 2023 show where he told the world about his new path.


	“I wanted to get to where I am now and not owe anything to anyone,” he says. “I wanted to be in peace and complete liberty.”

	











	And he was, for a while.


Daddy Yankee's reentry into the world of music as an artist led by faith in Jesus initially appeared seamless. He returned with the single “Bonita,” an uptempo reggaetón fused with horns and merengue that was all about positivity and happiness.


	It was the first of a handful of tracks distributed through SoundOn, TikTok's distribution and marketing platform, prior to his HYBE deal, and it benefited from TikTok support and exposure. Users have created over 1.2 million videos with “Bonita,” which generated over 1.1 billion views, and Daddy Yankee-posted content got more than 48.5 million likes, 1.7 million comments and over 3.8 million shares.


	The fact was, Ayala had announced his retirement from music in 2022. “The perception was that Yankee had retired and [now] we wanted to say he hadn't,” says Gabriel Llano, head of artist services for U.S. Latin and Latin America at SoundOn at TikTok. “When he made this musical shift, we wanted users to take those songs of his with positive messages to tell their own stories.”


	After “Bonita,” Ayala released “Donante de Sangre,” a rap track where he addressed his conversion head-on for the first time. The song, which was also a metaphor for life, was used for a Red Cross blood donation campaign in Mexico, adding a dimension of social good to his new music.


	Other like-minded singles trickled out, even as, in October 2024, Concord announced its purchase of parts of Daddy Yankee's catalog. Then, on Dec. 2, 2024, Ayala made yet another surprise announcement.


	“After more than two decades of marriage and after many months of trying to save my marriage, which my wife and I share, today my lawyers respond to the divorce petition received [from] Mireddys,” he wrote in a letter shared to Instagram, referring to Mireddys González, his longtime wife and high school sweetheart. “I'm grateful for the time we shared, full of blessings and values, of love and with a beautiful family that will continue to be our priority.”


	González was not only Ayala's wife but also the president of his label, El Cartel Records, and a member of its board of directors. Within weeks of the divorce announcement, on Dec. 17, Ayala filed two legal motions seeking an injunction against González and her sister Ayeicha González-Castellanos (El Cartel's secretary/treasurer), alleging they withdrew tens of millions of dollars from his business bank accounts without authorization, according to court documents.

	











	It was the first of a series of back-and-forth complaints, some of which are still in litigation, that have been reported widely by the press and touch many aspects of Ayala's career and assets, including information surrounding the initial sale of catalog assets in 2021.


	Although the cases are public, Ayala has not spoken about them — save for perfunctory comments as he's gone in and out of court in Puerto Rico — and he declined to answer questions now. But he has definitely learned some things.


	“Be on top of everything, even if you have lawyers and accountants,” Ayala says. “Now I'm alone, so I have to be 100% [involved]. Things I used to delegate, I don't delegate anymore. It's my responsibility, and I feel good and I feel I've learned so much more. You think you know everything about the music business and the rules keep changing. The smallest things can make a great difference.”


	And, he cautions new artists, male and female: “Even if you're not famous or successful and your career is only beginning, get married with a prenup. Music is unpredictable.”


Whatever challenges Ayala has faced over the course of his lengthy career, they've been impossible to discern from the outside. Through the years he's been unflappable, even-keeled, scandal-free. He has never even been attacked on social media — a feat in this day and age. But the past year shook him up.

	











	“I've always taken good care of myself, [but now] I've learned to give myself more self-love,” he muses when I ask what he has taken from this experience. “It's very important to be clear on what self-love is and establish limits. All kinds of healthy limits. Learn how to say no. I learned that we sacrifice ourselves for many people, and you do it so much that you normalize it. And that's not the way it should be. You need to set limits. I've learned to be more assertive.”


	When I point out I always found him assertive, he nods. “I've always been assertive with those outside my close circle. But you also need to set limits on those close to you.”


	And eventually, Ayala learned how to make music again.


	“I never thought I'd be in this situation, but I found myself in it,” he says. “And the strength I found to record an album full of joy in the most unexpected moment of my life is what helped me regain my strength. When we're in the middle of a crisis, one of our biggest fortitudes lies in adoring and praising the Lord because it brings joy.”


	Despite the change in content and the change in purpose, Ayala intends to tackle the marketing and promotion of his “music with a purpose” with every tool at his disposal, something that has proved tricky in the Latin world for religious artists who previously made secular music. Many Latin acts, particularly from Puerto Rico, are devout Christians but don't share their beliefs in their music. And many others have publicly announced their conversions and released evangelical music with mixed results.


	“From a programming perspective … it will all depend on the lyrics,” iHeartLatino senior vp of programming Pedro Javier González says. “Yankee is being smart in how he's handling it. He knows he has global impact and is looking for the best way to take the message without alienating anyone. Up to now, it's been positive lyrics that don't sound religious. A lot of people are looking for this kind of content.”


	HYBE's Arenas agrees. “HYBE likes to send positive messages to the world, and I do see a trend coming with inspirational music, music that has undertones of faith,” he says. “We've seen it in the Anglo world, and we're starting to see it in Latin as well. I think there's an audience for these fans, but the right platform for the music hasn't existed before.”


	For Ayala, it's simply part of who he is now.

	











	“Everyone who's inside the faith has to go to the world and preach the gospel,” he says, an obligation that applies to all, not just pastors or evangelizers. “I can't simply convert and stay silent, you know? This isn't simply making Christian music; the challenge is to make the kingdom part of pop culture. My vision [in the past] was to transform the industry when they told me I couldn't. Now I'm in the same situation with a different purpose: revolutionize and reinvent.”

IAG founder Irving Azoff announced the news at a Bloomberg summit.

	Iconic Artists Group (IAG) has acquired a portion of the Frank Sinatra estate.


	IAG founder Irving Azoff revealed the news about the legendary singer while speaking at Bloomberg's Screentime Conference, held Oct. 8-9 in Los Angeles. As first reported by Bloomberg on Sunday (Oct. 12), Azoff said Iconic “recently acquired a chunk of the Sinatra estate.”  


	Frank Sinatra Enterprises (FSE) confirmed the deal in a statement to Billboard: “Frank Sinatra Enterprises, Tina Sinatra, and Warner Music Group are delighted to welcome Irving Azoff and Iconic to the dedicated team serving the life's work and legacy of Frank Sinatra.” 


	In 2007, Sinatra's family and Warner Music Group (WMG) formed Frank Sinatra Enterprises, a global partnership to manage all aspects of Sinatra's career, as well as his name and likeness. The deal also included ownership of Sinatra's recordings from his Reprise era. Sinatra started Reprise, which is now owned by WMG, in 1960. FSE also represents Sinatra's rights to his Columbia and Capitol catalogs.


	It is unclear how much of the estate IAG acquired. Azoff declined to comment beyond his Screentime remarks, as did FSE beyond its statement. WMG also declined to comment.


	The deal comes nearly three years after Iconic made an agreement with the Dean Martin Family Trust to manage and expand the fellow Rat Packer's legacy. The deal included name, image and likeness, as well as the trust's share of Martin's Capitol and Reprise Records sound recordings, feature films, and Martin's variety shows and specials.


	During Azoff's Q&A at Bloomberg, moderator Lucas Shaw, Bloomberg's managing editor of media and entertainment, also asked Azoff what he considers the most valuable catalog in the world. “I normally would have said The Beatles, but I'm not sure that's true anymore,” Azoff said. “You maybe gotta say Taylor [Swift] at this point.”


	IAG works with a number of other artists and estates, including The Beach Boys, Linda Ronstadt, Cher, Rod Stewart and Nat King Cole, among others. Azoff told Bloomberg‘s Shaw that The Beach Boys' revenue has doubled since IAG got involved in their business.

	A bombshell report detailing virulently racist and antisemitic text messages shared among members of Young Republicans groups from across the nation has pulled back the veil on how the next generation of GOP leaders talk when they think no one is watching. 


	“Can we fix the showers? Gas chambers don't fit the Hitler aesthetic.” 


	“I'd go to the zoo if I wanted to watch monkey play ball.”


	“You're giving nationals [too] much credit and expecting the Jew to be honest.”


	“I love Hitler.” 


Politico's investigation, published Tuesday, found hundreds of text messages disparaging minorities, women, and religious groups. The report counted 251 uses of slurs like the n-word, and f****t. The report was met by widespread revulsion — by most.


	The chat's members were distributed across Young Republicans chapters from New York, Kansas, and Vermont. Many have already established footholds in the politics of their state and beyond. These include 27-year-old Vermont state Senator Samuel Douglass, Trump administration employee Michael Bartels, and Bobby Walker, who once worked for New York state Senate Minority Leader Rob Ortt.

	Unsurprisingly — given the generally caustic tone taken by the Republican party towards minorities and migrants — some prominent conservative lawmakers and commentators jumped to defend the participants. 


	Perhaps most notable among the white knights was Vice President J.D. Vance, who downplayed the texts by comparing them to a leaked message from Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for Virginia attorney general. Jones has come under fire this month after 2022 text messages in which he expressed a desire to shoot the former Virginia House speaker were made public. 

	











	“This is far worse than anything said in a college group chat, and the guy who said it could become the AG of Virginia. I refuse to join the pearl clutching when powerful people call for political violence,” Vance wrote Tuesday on social media. Jones has, in fact, been condemned by members of his own party. Jones is also one man, making condemnable statements, not a large group of politically minded individuals producing, sharing, and celebrating the very hate they claim to revile.

	Vance addressed the texts on The Charlie Kirk Show later on Wednesday. “Focus on the real issues,” he said. “Don't focus on what kids say in group chats.” He then suggested that whoever leaked the racist messages is a “scumbag.”


	“Kids do stupid things,” he continued. “Especially young boys. They tell edgy, offensive jokes. That's what kids do.”


	It also bears noting that while “Young Republicans” may sound like a group composed of baby-fresh, underdeveloped prefrontal cortexes, the national organization accepts members of the Republican Party between the ages of 18 and 40. Some of those in the chat were not only well past their collegiate career, but held leadership positions within Young Republicans and had  cultivated relationships with members of the Trump administration. Regardless, Vance and others are pretending that those implicated should be given the benefit of childhood naivete for fantasizing about putting their opponents in gas chambers. 


	“I literally do not care what a bunch of magger college kids said in a group chat,” right-wing streamer and commentator Tim Pool wrote on  X.

	Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich took a similar tact, writing that “Young Republicans blowing off steam in immature group texts isn't in the same universe as a powerful Democrat fantasizing about killing kids. Couldn't give a crap less about that nonsense.” 


	The Daily Wire's Matt Walsh also seized on Jones' texts to excuse the chat's participants. “The Virginia AG candidate fantasized about murdering children and no Democrat at any level called for him to resign or denounced him in any serious way. Meanwhile a few college kids make edgy jokes in a group chat and conservatives are tripping over themselves to denounce and disavow and call for firings and resignations,” he wrote. 


	Several members of the chat have already been forced out of their jobs in Republican politics amid the fallout. Peter Giunta, former Chair of the New York State Young Republicans, has left his position in New York Assemblymember Mike Reilly's office.  Joseph Maligno, former General Counsel for the New York Young Republicans, has left his position in the New York State Unified Court System, per Politico. 












	In a statement issued on social media, Young Republicans wrote that they “are appalled by the vile and inexcusable language” used by their members. “Such behavior is disgraceful, unbecoming of any Republican, and stands in direct opposition to the values our movement represents. Those involved must immediately resign from all positions within their state and local Young Republican organizations. We must hold ourselves to the highest standards of integrity, respect, and professionalism,” they wrote. 


	Really, though, the racist messages and the corresponding minimization by Republicans speak to a conservative culture that clings to bigotry as a unifying force of identity — a pattern that has only been reinforced in the Trump era. 


	On Wednesday, the official Facebook and Instagram accounts of the U.S. Border Patrol posted  — and later deleted — videos using the original version and lyrics of Michael Jackson's “They Don't Care About Us.” The song, which was rerecorded in 1995, originally included the lyrics “Jew me, sue me.”


	On Tuesday, the official X account for the Department of Homeland Security posted “Remigrate” on X. Remigration is a fascist concept developed in the mid-20th Century by European white nationalists advocating for the mass expulsion of minorities and immigrants to their nations of origin.

	And of course there is the bullhorn of anti-minority, xenophobic rhetoric emanating from the resident himself, who just over the course of the last year has described migrants as pet-eating terrorists who are poisoning the blood of the nation. 


	It's no wonder the up-and-coming ranks of politically active youngish Republicans feel emboldened to speak in the way that they did to each other in the leaked messages. They have a mirror in the White House, and defenders all around them.
