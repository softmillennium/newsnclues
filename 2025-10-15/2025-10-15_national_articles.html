Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich joins 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss the ongoing government shutdown and his take on Operation Arctic Frost that reportedly targeted Republican lawmakers' phone records. A federal judge in San Francisco on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration from continuing government furloughs, granting a temporary restraining order sought by labor unions that argued layoffs were unlawful during the ongoing government shutdown. U.S. District Court Judge Susan Illston, a Clinton appointee, ordered the administration not to issue any reduction in force notices to federal employees in "any program, project or activity," including any bargaining unit or member represented by the unions during, or because of, the shutdown. "The evidence suggests OMB and OPM have taken advantage of the lapse in government spending–function to assume all bets are off and that the laws don't apply to them," Illston said. A sign that reads "Closed due to federal government shutdown," is seen outside the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., Oct. 6. In a court filing Tuesday night, an official with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said more than 4,000 government workers had already received reduction in force notices.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US District Judge Karin Immergut has ruled to extend her temporary restraining orders barring the deployment of the National Guard troops to Portland, keeping President Donald Trump's federalization efforts in limbo as legal challenges unfold. The orders were originally set to expire this weekend. The extension comes as the federal government challenges the judge's earlier ruling on deployment in a higher court as it works to crack down on Democratic-led cities it claims are stricken by crime and disorder. The president has cited  protests outside Portland's Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility to justify the callups of troops in the deep blue city. Leaders in Oregon have emphatically disputed the president's characterizations of their cities as “war-ravaged” and uncontrollably violent, arguing in court that the situation on the ground in Portland is nowhere as extreme as federal officials portray it to be. The scene was largely calm until Trump had declared late September he was sending 200 Oregon National Guard troops to the city. Oregon and Portland officials jointly sued following the announcement, and Immergut granted a temporary order barring the federalization of those Oregon troops. The federal judge then expanded that ruling a day later to include barring the deployment of any US troops when the Trump administration reassigned federalized guard troops in Los Angeles to Portland in an apparent effort to get around the initial order. A three-judge panel with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is still weighing whether the Trump administration should be blocked from deploying the Oregon National Guard to respond to ICE protests in Portland. They have yet to release a decision. As Trump continues efforts to federalize National Guard members across the US for deployment to Democratic-led cities, the administration faces mounting legal pushback from states saying they don't need — or want — any federal help. After the state of Illinois and its largest city sued the administration last week, calling plans to move troops from the Illinois and Texas National Guards into Chicago “illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional,” a federal appeals court ruled that the troops in Illinois can remain under federal control but can't be deployed as the appeals process continues in the ongoing showdown between the Trump administration and the state. This is a developing story and will be updated.</p>

The San Antonio Police Department (SAPD) confirmed to Fox News Digital that officers responded to a Whataburger on Oct. 5 at 3 a.m. to reports of an assault in progress. Police said that the brawl began after "two parties were arguing over a mix-up of orders." Then, several men piled on, joining the brawl. Video by Rebecca Noel captured the wild brawl that started at a Whataburger fast-food chain in San Antonio, Texas, on Oct. 5. The scene continued to devolve into chaos with additional individuals joining in, with fists flying. At least three others were seen recording the altercation. One female bystander was heard attempting to break up the fight, yelling, "Stop. What the f--- is wrong with y'all?" The SAPD said that no major injuries were reported at the scene and all seven suspects were booked for assault causing bodily injury. Deontae Tolliver, Andres Garcia Cardenas, Meili Torres and Tyrone Tolliver were arrested for their alleged involvement in the brawl at Whataburger in San Antonio, Texas. The seven arrested were identified as Andres Garcia Cardenas, 21; Tyrone Tolliver, 21; Miguel Torres, 57; Meili Torres, 21; Andrew Lopez, 21; Deontae Tolliver, 23; and Veronica Valdez, 53. Miguel Torres, Andrew Lopez and Veronica Valdez were arrested for their alleged involvement in the brawl at Whataburger in San Antonio, Texas. Noel wrote that the families involved will be pressing charges against the individuals, and they "will not stop until justice is served!!!" Fox News Digital has reached out to Noel for comment. "Instead of the staff acknowledging their error, they reportedly told the other customers, ‘They have your food,'" wrote Noel. "Moments later, those individuals confronted my son and his friends, and within seconds, the situation escalated far beyond a simple misunderstanding — to a violent assault." In a statement to Fox News Digital, Whataburger's media relations team said: "At Whataburger, the safety of our Guests and employees is our top priority. We are cooperating fully with the authorities." The SAPD said that this is an active investigation. You can follow her on Twitter and LinkedIn.

Democratic lawmakers stormed House Speaker Mike Johnson's office on Tuesday, demanding that he swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz. Democratic lawmakers stormed House Speaker Mike Johnson's office on Tuesday night, demanding that he swear in a newly-elected representative. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., joined arms and chanted "swear her in" with Reps. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M., and Nanette Barragan, D-Calif., as well as Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., as they marched on Johnson's office with members of their staff. Footage from various angles shows Jayapal and Stansbury messing with the sign in front of the speaker's office and getting into an altercation with one of the officers. Grijalva won her special election on Sept. 23, but she still has not been sworn into office. Her vote would be the final vote needed for the House to approve a discharge petition relating to the Epstein files, put forward by Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky. Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., has vowed to vote in favor of a discharge petition regarding the Jeffrey Epstein files. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., led her fellow lawmakers in storming House Speaker Mike Johnson's office. Maybe you saw some of the video online that they themselves shared or someone did, they berated a Capitol Police officer, screamed at him. He was just merely standing at his post," Johnson said. "It shows again their disdain for law enforcement, as we see all around the country, the Democrats and everyone in that party screaming, assaulting ICE officers. They did it right here in the Capitol last night. A few members of Congress went into the little foyer of my office and tore down a sign that I had up and, and just engaged in all sorts of political stunts and antics," he added.

Fox News correspondent Madeleine Rivera reports on President Donald Trump working to fund troops during the government shutdown. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., weighs in on the shutdown and his state's gubernatorial race. An aircraft carrying War Secretary Pete Hegseth made an "unscheduled landing" Wednesday afternoon in the United Kingdom. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell announced on social media that on the way back to the U.S. from NATO's Defense Ministers meeting, Hegseth's "plane made an unscheduled landing in the United Kingdom due to a crack in the aircraft windshield." The plane landed based on standard procedures and everyone onboard, including Hegseth, was safe, according to Parnell. Thank God," Hegseth wrote in an X post. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth arrives to the NATO Ministers of Defence Summit at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday. The Boeing aircraft descended to 10,000 feet, a standard emergency altitude, following a possible cabin depressurization, according to flight tracking data. The plane made an "unscheduled landing" Wednesday, according to Pentagon officials. Less than a month ago, President Donald Trump and the first lady had to transfer from Marine One to a support helicopter after a hydraulic issue forced an unscheduled landing at a local airfield on the way to Stansted Airport in England. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Sept. 18 the switch was due to a "minor hydraulic issue," and the president and first lady safely boarded the support helicopter. No injuries were immediately reported, according to the Pentagon. In February, Secretary of State Marco Rubio was on his way to Munich, Germany from Washington, D.C. for the Munich Security Conference, when the plane he was traveling in experienced a mechanical issue involving the cockpit windshield. About 90 minutes into the flight, the C-32, a converted Boeing 757, turned around and landed at Joint Base Andrews. Rubio continued his travel to Germany and the Middle East on a different aircraft.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed US military leaders to verify that every member of the department watched the speech he delivered at an unusual gathering of senior officers in Quantico, Virginia, last month and reviews the policy changes he announced in the wake of that event, according to a memo reviewed by CNN. Hegseth's memo comes after he ordered senior officers to travel to Quantico for what amounted to a largely political speech that asserted his vision for how the military will physically look and act. He also offered a stark ultimatum during his speech: If you don't agree, resign. While Hegseth delivered his speech, in person, to hundreds of senior officers, the subsequent memo makes clear he wants to make sure the message reaches defense personnel at every level. The directives that accompanied the speech largely roll back efforts made over the last decade focused on eradicating toxic culture in the military, both to decrease harmful behaviors like harassment, but also to meet practical needs of getting people in uniform and keeping them there longer. There was also a significant emphasis in Hegseth's speech on the fitness and appearance of service members. Following Hegseth's speech in Quantico, the Texas Military Department removed seven National Guard troops that had been deployed to Chicago because they “did not meet mission requirements,” a Texas National Guard spokesperson told CNN. “These service members were returned to home station. The troops, sent to Chicago as part of President Donald Trump's domestic-facing mission focused on crime, were replaced amid criticism on social media over pictures that showed some of the Guard members appearing to be overweight.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A sign that reads “Closed due to federal government shutdown,” is seen outside of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, Oct. 6, 2025. From left, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., talk to reporters as a government shutdown begins its tenth day, in Washington, Friday, Oct. 10, 2025. A Transportation Security Administration worker heads into the east security checkpoint in Denver International Airport Thursday, Oct. 2, 2025, in Denver. And now they are confronting new uncertainty with the Trump administration's promised layoffs. Little progress has been made to end the shutdown as it enters its third week, with Republicans and Democrats digging in and convinced their messaging is resonating with voters. “Luckily I was able to pay rent this month,” said Peter Farruggia, a furloughed federal worker. “But for sure I am going to have bills that are going to go unpaid this month, and I really don't have many options.” The shutdown has a familiar feel for many federal employees who endured past stalemates — including during President Donald Trump's first term — but this time, the stakes are higher. The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Trump and other Republican leaders have said the government must reopen before they will negotiate with Democrats on the health subsidies. What questions do you have for them? Like 8,000 other CDC employees who have been furloughed from the agency, he was already living paycheck to paycheck, and the partial pay that arrived Friday was his last until the government comes back online. With the agency's leadership in turmoil and still rattled from a shooting, the shutdown and new firings mean “people are scared, nervous, anxious, but also really just exasperated,” Farruggia said. The layoffs have begun across federal agencies. Labor unions have already filed a lawsuit to stop the move by Trump's budget office. In a court filing on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget said well over 4,000 federal employees from eight departments and agencies would be fired in conjunction with the shutdown. Jessica Sweet, an Albany, New York, Social Security claims specialist who is a union steward of AFGE Local 3343 in New York, said, “I, myself, have a backup plan” in case she is fired during the shutdown, “but I know most people don't.” She says the Social Security Administration is already so short-staffed from layoffs earlier this year brought on by the Department of Government Efficiency, she doesn't fear a massive layoff during the shutdown. “The one thing this administration has taught me is that nothing is ever for certain, even if it's codified into law,” she said. Having received a partial payment in her last paycheck, Sweet has begun reaching out to her local power companies to request that she not get charged late fees, since “my bills won't wait for me to eventually get paid.” A sign that reads “Closed due to federal government shutdown,” is seen outside of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, Oct. 6, 2025. For some federal workers, this isn't their first shutdown — the last one, during Trump's first term in 2019, stretched a record 34 days. But this time, federal employees are being used more directly as leverage in the political fight over government funding. The Republican administration last week warned that there would be no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a shutdown — a reversal of long-standing policy affecting roughly 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a White House memo. The move, which Trump later backtracked on, was widely seen as a strong-arm tactic. Adam Pelletier, a National Labor Relations Board field examiner whose agency furloughed nearly all of its workforce on Oct. 1, going from roughly 1,100 workers to fewer than a dozen people, said he wouldn't mind if the shutdown continued if it meant meaningful progress toward gaining health care protections for Americans across the country — a key demand by Democrats for ending the stalemate. Pelletier, a union leader for NLRB local 3, said “right now, nothing is being investigated at the NLRB. As for the financial strain on workers, he said workers can't even find alternate employment to weather the shutdown because “the ethics office that would approve of those requests is not staffed now.” From left, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., talk to reporters as a government shutdown begins its tenth day, in Washington, Friday, Oct. 10, 2025. National Treasury Employees Union President Doreen Greenwald, which represents workers across dozens of federal agencies, said several of the union's members had been laid off as of Friday. Greenwald said it was unfortunate that the Trump administration was using “federal employees as political pawns by furloughing and proposing to fire them all to try to cause pressure in a political game of chicken.” A Transportation Security Administration worker heads into the east security checkpoint in Denver International Airport Thursday, Oct. 2, 2025, in Denver. “This isn't about one party or the other. “The correction officer worrying about his next paycheck. The TSA officer who still shows up to work because he or she loves their country, even though they're not getting paid. No American should ever have to choose between serving their country and feeding their family,” Kelley said. Kelley and other major federal worker union leaders gathered blocks from the Capitol last week, urging congressional leaders to find a solution and put “people over politics.” The event grew emotional at times, with union heads outlining the difficulties facing their members and the stakes growing daily.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Major case: The Supreme Court heard oral arguments this morning in a major case that threatens to undermine the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Voting rights groups who warn that undermining some of the law's protections for redistricting risks “wiping out minority representation and re-segregating legislatures, city councils, and school boards.” The Supreme Court's conservative majority signaled deep skepticism today over a second majority Black district drawn in Louisiana, despite a lower court ruling that found the district was likely necessary to respect the landmark Voting Rights Act. At issue is a second majority Black district drawn in Louisiana following the 2020 census that elected Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat, to the House. This time around, Kavanaugh repeatedly leaned into two points suggesting he had reservations with Louisiana's map. Kavanaugh also returned to an argument about whether the Voting Rights Act can indefinitely require the drawing of “remedial” majority-minority districts. In other contexts, including college admissions, the court has ruled that such race-based decision making must have some sort of time limit. At one point, Kavanaugh quoted from earlier decisions suggesting that “race-based districting” embarks the nation on a “most dangerous course.” Early on, Chief Justice John Roberts – who joined with Kavanaugh and the court's liberals in the Alabama case two years ago – quickly sought to draw a distinction between that outcome and the Louisiana case, suggesting he didn't see the earlier precedent as controlling this case. The court's three-justice liberal wing focused much of its fire on Congress's intent in enacting the landmark Voting Rights Act in 1965: to root out discrimination that targeted African American voters. They have questioned the Trump administration's approach, suggesting it would require plaintiffs to meet a much higher standard than is required by the Voting Rights Act to find discriminatory maps. The Supreme Court's decision to hear arguments Wednesday on Louisiana's congressional map is highly unusual: It is a rare instance in which the justices are engaging in a do-over. Instead of handing down a decision in June, the court announced on its final day that it intended to schedule a new set of arguments in the case. Such re-arguments have often occurred in high-profile cases. Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark case that found school segregation unconstitutional, was argued in 1952 and then argued again in 1953. More recently, the high court argued the landmark campaign finance case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2009 and then again in 2010. Voting rights groups warn that a ruling in Louisiana's favor risks “wiping out minority representation and re-segregating legislatures, city councils, and school boards.” That would be most immediately apparent for Rep. Cleo Fields, a Black Democrat from Louisiana who represents the state's disputed 6th Congressional District. And because it's Louisiana, the case could also affect the districts of key House leaders, notably Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise – both Republicans who represent the state in Congress. A 39-year-old precedent, Thornburg v. Gingles, is playing a central role in the Supreme Court's oral arguments today over the Voting Rights Act. As part of its argument before the court, Louisiana officials have specifically called for the Gingles precedent to be overturned. The case dealt with North Carolina's legislative districts that were challenged by Black voters as violating the Voting Rights Act. Congress specifically declined to endorse the idea of “proportionality” – the idea that a third of districts should be available to Black candidates if African Americans make up a third of the population. Second, plaintiffs must show that the group at issue is “politically cohesive.” Then, plaintiffs must demonstrate that the majority group (i.e. White voters) vote sufficiently together to defeat a minority group's preferred candidate. If a plaintiff challenging a map can meet those requirements, courts then look to what's known as the “totality of the circumstances” to determine if the district boundaries leave minority voters with “less opportunity than White voters to elect representatives of their choice.” Those can include factors like how much success minority candidates have in state elections as well as the state's past history of racial discrimination. Hashim Mooppan, a veteran attorney who has taken on several high-profile Supreme Court cases at the Justice Department this year, is now speaking on behalf of the Trump administration. Even casual court observers may be familiar with Mooppan, a rising star who just argued another case before the high court involving “conversion therapy.” In that case, the administration sided with a licensed counselor in Colorado who is challenging the state's ban on the discredited practice. The Trump administration has suggested that race might still be used in a limited way to redraw district boundaries in some circumstances. Louisiana has argued, by comparison, that race cannot be used at all. Just how that delta might play out in practice is not entirely clear but, at least in this case, Louisiana's current map would need to be redrawn under the Trump administration's approach. Because Louisiana switched its position – and no longer supports its own map – only one attorney stood before the justices to defend the current map, which includes a second Black majority district. That attorney was Janai Nelson, with the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund. Subsequent attorneys all believe that Louisiana's map should be tossed – based on different legal reasons. And now it is likely to be the court's three-justice liberal wing – Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson – who will likely do the most speaking. Greim, a Missouri native and 2002 Harvard Law graduate, argued the same case when the justices heard it previously in March. Greim represented a group of Tea Party advocates in a high-profile, class action legal case alleging the IRS aggressively scrutinized conservative groups during the Obama administration. Greim is arguing on behalf of a group of “non-Black” plaintiffs who alleged Louisiana's updated map violated the 14th and 15th Amendments, which were ratified after the Civil War. Justice Sonia Sotomayor stressed at one point that race has traditionally been used lawfully in the redistricting process as she pushed back on Louisiana's argument that it cannot be used to remedy violations of the Voting Rights Act. “Race is a part of redistricting always… Race is always a part of these decisions, and my colleagues are trying to tease it out in this intellectual way that doesn't deal with the fact that race is used to help people,” Sotomayor, the court's senior liberal member, told Louisiana Solicitor General Ben Aguiñaga. “Legislators might try to keep an ethnic community in one district. They might use it to inform partisan goals,” she said. You can use it to help yourself achieve goals that reduce a particular group's electoral participation, but you can't use it to remedy that situation.' The congressional district that kicked off the current Supreme Court case is Louisiana's 6th District, currently held by Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat. Earlier this year, Chief Justice John Roberts referred to it as a “snake.” That's important because one of the traditional goals for mapmakers is to draw congressional districts that are “compact.” “If you look at CD6, what does ‘reasonably compact' mean?” Roberts said during the first arguments in March. Several conservative Supreme Court justices signaled skepticism over the creation of a second majority Black district in Louisiana in the early stages of oral arguments Wednesday. In a mostly subdued series of questions, the conservative justices – notably Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh – asked questions that at least suggested concerns with Louisiana's drawing of a second Black majority district. At one point, he quoted from earlier decisions suggesting that “race-based districting” embarks the nation on a “most dangerous course.” A former clerk to Justice Samuel Alito and a Texas native, Aguiñaga has argued at the Supreme Court twice before, including once when justices heard this same case in March. He also argued on behalf of states who last year alleged that the government's efforts to combat online misinformation amounted to a form of unconstitutional censorship. Aguiñaga received his law degree from Louisiana State University in 2015 and clerked for US Circuit Judge Edith Jones on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals. He was an attorney at Jones Day for nearly five years before joining the Louisiana attorney general's office in early 2024. “I think the results would be pretty catastrophic,” Nelson responded quickly. She continued: “If we take Louisiana as one example, every congressional member who is Black was elected from a VRA opportunity district.” Justice Brett Kavanaugh is pressing on a point that is central to the case: Whether redistricting that takes race into account should be allowed to carry on indefinitely. It's potentially a signal that Kavanaugh is skeptical of the position raised by Black voters. “This court's cases, in a variety of contexts, has said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time,” the conservative justice asked. What exactly do you think the end point should be?” Janai Nelson, representing the Black voters in Louisiana, has argued that the Voting Rights Act has a time limit built in, because states must redraw their maps with a new census every decade. One of the arguments Louisiana and critics of the Voting Rights Act is making is that the confusion around how to apply the law in redistricting has spurred a bevy of lawsuits, even as minority representation has increased and housing segregation has decreased. That line of attack has drawn some interest from conservative justices in the past. According to that brief, the number of Section 2 vote claims has almost halved over recent decades. “Courts today adjudicate far fewer Section 2 vote dilution claims, and find far fewer Section 2 violations, than in prior decades,” the brief claims. In his typical understated way, Chief Justice John Roberts threw some early shade in his opening question on the idea that Supreme Court already decided this case in favor of the Voting Rights Act two years ago. His vote is likely up for grabs in the Louisiana appeal. In that case, Roberts said, the court “considered Alabama's particular challenge” not necessarily one that would apply to Louisiana. Way back in 2023, a 5-4 majority of the high court ordered Alabama officials to redraw that state's congressional map to allow an additional Black majority district. And some of the language in that opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, is particularly striking when viewed alongside the arguments Louisiana is making in its appeal. Louisiana, for instance, has come out strong for the prospect that the Constitution requires a colorblind approach to redistricting. “The contention that mapmakers must be entirely ‘blind' to race has no footing” in the court's Voting Rights Act precedents, Roberts wrote in 2023. “The line that we have long drawn is between consciousness and predominance.” It would take only one justice to switch votes in that case, Allen v.Milligan, to land on a different outcome for Louisiana. Justice Clarence Thomas, a member of the court's conservative wing and its most senior associate justice, is asking the first question – which he almost always does these days during oral arguments at the Supreme Court. Thomas started off with a series of technical questions about the original court order striking down Louisiana's first map. Previously, the conservative justice has expressed skepticism about that court's decision – and he reiterated some of that skepticism on Wednesday. “There was never a full merits determination,” Thomas said. When the court declined to decide the Louisiana redistricting appeal earlier this year – holding it over for a second set of arguments – Thomas wrote separately to say he would have decided right then and there that the Voting Rights Act could not be used to justify creating another majority Black district. It's a point Thomas has been making for years. He has been joined at various times by fellow conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. That task fell to Janai Nelson as oral arguments began just after 10 a.m. Nelson, a Fulbright scholar and former law professor, is the president and director-counsel of the storied NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Nelson is representing a group of Black voters who challenged Louisiana's first map under the Voting Rights Act. Nelson received her law degree from UCLA and clerked for US Circuit Judge Theodore McMillian on the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals and US District Judge David Coar in Illinois.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An American tourist was fatally stabbed and another wounded during an attempted robbery early Wednesday in the coastal town of Cascais, west of Lisbon, according to authorities. The incident happened near the Church of the Navigators, with emergency services receiving an alert at around 3:16 a.m., CNN Portugal reported. Investigators say one of the tourists was returning to his hotel when three suspects confronted him and tried to rob him. The victim resisted, was punched, and attempted to flee while calling a friend for help. The three suspects have been arrested and are now being questioned by police. The victim's death was first reported by Correio da Manhã and later confirmed by CNN Portugal. Emergency medical teams from the National Institute of Medical Emergency (INEM) attempted to resuscitate the man, but the stab wounds were deep and struck vital areas, authorities said. The second victim was taken to Santa Maria Hospital in Lisbon. Despite suffering deep cuts to his face and arms, he is no longer in critical condition, according to hospital officials. The State Department told CNN it is aware of reports of an attack on two US tourists in Cascais, and stands ready to provide consular assistance. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to relocate World Cup matches set to be played next year in suburban Boston, after suggesting that parts of the city had been “taken over” by unrest. Trump was asked about Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu, a Democrat whom he called “intelligent” but “radical left.” “We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. He suggested “they're taking over parts of Boston” without offering details, but added “we could get them back in about two seconds.” Wu's office did not react directly to Trump's threat, issuing a statement that read, “Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions.” Trump's comments came during his meeting with Argentina President Javier Milei and it wasn't immediately clear what he was referring to by parts of Boston having been seized. Earlier this month, however, there were multiple arrests in connection with a pro-Palestinian protest that turned violent on Boston Common. Trump has previously suggested he could declare cities “not safe” for the 104-game soccer tournament and alter a detailed hosting plan that FIFA confirmed in 2022. It includes games at NFL stadiums near New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. World Cup host sites aren't up to Trump. Trump nonetheless said, “If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who's phenomenal -- and I would say, ‘Let's move into another location' and they would do that.” The president meant FIFA head Gianni Infantino, a close ally. Associated Press writer Michael Casey in Boston contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — A senior adviser at the State Department and expert on Indian and South Asian affairs is accused by the Justice Department of printing out classified documents and storing more than 1,000 pages of highly sensitive government records in filing cabinets and trash bags at home. Ashley Tellis, who has also worked as a contractor in the Defense Department's Office of Net Assessment, was charged in federal court in Virginia with the unlawful retention of national defense information after FBI agents who searched his home over the weekend found what they said was a trove of records marked as classified at the secret and top secret levels. He was ordered detained Tuesday pending a detention hearing next week. One of his lawyers, Deborah Curtis, told The Associated Press that “we look forward to the hearing, where we'll be able to present evidence” but declined to comment further. An FBI affidavit cites several instances over the last month in which Tellis is alleged to have printed on government computers, or asked a colleague to print, classified documents on topics including U.S. military aircraft capabilities. Surveillance video shows him on several occasions exiting the State Department and a Defense Department facility with a briefcase in which he was believed to have stashed the printed-out papers, according to court documents. Tellis also met multiple times with Chinese government officials in recent years, according to the affidavit. The affidavit says Tellis did not appear to have the manila folder in his possession when he left the restaurant, but does not accuse him of providing any classified information during his meetings with the Chinese. Tellis is a prominent foreign policy expert with a specialty in Indian and South Asian affairs. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace lists him as a senior fellow and the Tata Chair for Strategic Affairs. He also served on the White House National Security Council staff under Republican President George W. Bush. This story has been corrected to reflect that Tellis is an expert on Indian and South Asian affairs, not Indian and South affairs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Why A House of Dynamite is so damn scary. There's no shortage of things that could end the world. But between climate change, risks from AI, and biological threats like pandemics, we seem to be forgetting about one human-made existential risk that has been with us for 80 years: the ever-present possibility of nuclear warfare. But nuclear war hasn't forgotten about us. “Because of extraordinary luck over 80 years, despite many close calls and near-misses, there hasn't been a detonation of nuclear weapons,” Elise Rowan, the deputy vice president of communications at the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), told me over email. “Every concern that is top of mind for Americans right now…could be eclipsed by a snap decision under pressure or even an accident.” They make small talk about sports, kids, and snacking habits. A senior officer (Rebecca Ferguson) in the White House Situation Room, which provides 24/7 intelligence updates and decision support to US national security officials, chides a colleague for waiting until that night to propose marriage to his longtime girlfriend. Soldiers in a remote Alaska base initially think it's a North Korean missile test that will land harmlessly in the Pacific. After all, a real nuclear attack would probably involve hundreds of missiles, including decoys. That's how the Soviet air force officer Stanislov Petrov realized that the five American nuclear missiles heading toward the Soviet Union in 1983 were actually a false alarm caused by malfunctioning early-warning satellites. Petrov's good judgment — he decided not to report the finding up the military chain, which would have led to retaliation per Soviet doctrine — is how we avoided all-out nuclear war by way of Soviet retaliation. The US launches its anti-missile defense system from that base in Alaska. But the interceptor fails to destroy the missile, which remains inbound for Chicago and its metro population of 10 million people. It's only after the fact that top officials learn that the defense systems charged with keeping the homeland safe from just such a strike have just a 61 percent chance of success. In real life, it's around a 55 percent success rate — and that's under controlled conditions. “So it's a fucking coin toss?” the defense secretary (Jared Harris) exclaims. And when it fails, there's no plan B. What this shows, Rowan told me, is that the nuclear defense system “demands perfection from people and machines 100 percent of the time. (Disclosure: I worked at NTI for two years on the Global Biological Policy and Programs team. I learned a lot about nuclear risks through osmosis, but my focus was on pandemic prevention, bioweapons deterrence, and biotechnology governance. I did not work on “nuclear pandemics,” as my uncle once asked me.) But it almost certainly wouldn't end there. Further retaliations could lead to the death of billions, perhaps spark nuclear winter, and potentially spell humanity's end. While it's impossible not to watch the film without nauseously picturing Donald Trump, who has the sole power to order a nuclear attack as the president, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in charge, it may not make a difference. It's not a matter of skill or nerve; nearly everyone does their job as best they can. North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran are floated as possibilities. The movie doesn't tell us if the launch was a purposeful attack or an accident, an isolated incident or part of a coordinated campaign. I don't see my childhood home in the Chicago suburbs get vaporized. It's not possible for us to know all of this in just the 18 minutes the intercontinental ballistic missile allows, just as it's not possible for the president to make a meaningfully informed decision on how to respond in that time. When presented with a menu of escalating retaliation options — “rare, medium, and well-done,” someone quips darkly — the president says he's ready to give the order. Things were simpler in those “us versus them” Cold War days, if not any less dangerous. There are (at least) nine nuclear powers to keep track of, and emerging technologies like AI enhance the risks. “I hope this film gets a new generation interested and engaged in nuclear issues,” Heather Williams, the director of the Project on Nuclear Issues at the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), told me by email. “There are still thousands of nuclear weapons in the world and some countries are still engaging in nuclear saber-rattling — the threat hasn't gone away.” It's not all doom and gloom, though: In 1986, there were 70,000 nuclear weapons. There are 12,000 today — an 80 percent reduction of the world's total nukes. But for the first time in 40 years, that number is expected to increase. So things are heading in the wrong direction. “We need the same level of public outcry that led to reductions and [nuclear weapon] verification measures that have made the world safer,” Rowan said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats are using a $20 billion lifeline to Argentina to claim Republicans care more about bailing out foreign governments than helping Americans at home. The messaging, a riff on President Donald Trump's “America First” policy agenda, intensified ahead of a White House visit by Argentinian President Javier Milei on Tuesday, where Trump said the United States would “be there” for Argentina, so long as Milei succeeds in midterm elections set to take place later this month. “If this administration has $20 billion to spare for a MAGA-friendly foreign government, how can they say we don't have the money to lower healthcare costs?” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said on the Senate floor. The Democratic talking point, made in the halls of Congress and a Democratic National Committee press call on Tuesday, reflects an attempt to turn Trump's signature policy doctrine against him. But the financial assistance for Argentina, structured in the form of a currency swap, has torn at the president's MAGA support and frustrated business groups that noted Argentina, an agricultural rival, sold shipments of soybeans to China as talk of a bailout became public. He represents a libertarian break from the socialist policies of other regional governments and has forged a closer relationship with the White House. Democrats nonetheless see the issue as a liability for Trump, whose strikes on Iran and loose commitment to Ukraine have also rankled supporters. On Tuesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) attempted to pass a bill, the “No Argentina Bailout Act,” to keep the Treasury Department from performing the currency swap, before her attempt was blocked by Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC). “It is shameful that President Trump is propping up a foreign government, while he shuts down our own,” Warren said in a floor speech. The message represents the latest attempt to move Republicans off their shutdown position – a clean funding extension with no policy changes attached. His tariffs, in particular, have been wrapped into a broader critique that Republicans will send prices higher for consumers. Trump and congressional Republicans made the same case successfully in November, when Democrats were swept out of power in the face of decades-high inflation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He mentioned recent violent car meets in Boston earlier this month, one of which left a police department cruiser destroyed by fire. The car meetups have been deemed “staged attacks” and organized through social media and group messaging platforms, local prosecutors said. “These street takeovers are not spontaneous events but are preplanned and coordinated through social media platforms and group messaging applications,” said Lisa Deacutis, assistant district attorney at the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office. “Participants share meeting points, times, and driving routes in advance to allow large numbers to join intersections before police arrive.” The president claimed that “they're taking over parts of Boston” before stating, “But we could get them back in about two seconds.” Trump was also critical of Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, calling her “radical left” and saying he was not pleased with her response to the violence. ​​”I think she is hurting Boston,” Trump said. If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, let's move it to another location, if I thought Boston was going to cause safety conditions for the World Cup. Wu's office issued a statement in response to Trump's comments. “Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions,” the statement read.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Workers prepare an oil containment boom at Refugio State Beach, north of Goleta, Calif., May 21, 2015. Clean up crews remove oil-laden sand on the beach at Refugio State Beach, site of an oil spill, north of Goleta, Calif., May 20, 2015. A worker removes oil from the sand at Refugio State Beach, north of Goleta, Calif., May 21, 2015. More than 140,000 gallons (3,300 barrels) of oil gushed out, blackening beaches for 150 miles (240 kilometers) from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles, polluting a biologically rich habitat for endangered whales and sea turtles, killing scores of pelicans, seals and dolphins, and decimating the fishing industry. Plains All American Pipeline in 2022 agreed to a $230 million settlement with fishers and coastal property owners without admitting liability. It faced an uphill battle to build a new pipeline. Sable Offshore Corp., headquartered in Houston, is facing a slew of legal challenges but is determined to restart production, even if that means confining it to federal waters, where state regulators have virtually no say. California controls the 3 miles (5 kilometers) nearest to shore. President Donald Trump has directed Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to undo his predecessor's ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts. “This project risks another environmental disaster in California at a time when demand for oil is going down and the climate crisis is escalating,” said Alex Katz, executive director of Environmental Defense Center, the Santa Barbara group formed in response to a massive spill in 1969. The environmental organization is among several suing Sable. “Our concern is that there is no way to make this pipeline safe and that this company has proven that it cannot be trusted to operate safely, responsibly or even legally,” he said. Actor and activist Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who lives in the area, has implored officials to stop Sable, saying at a March protest: “I can smell a rat. The California Coastal Commission fined Sable a record $18 million for ignoring cease-and-desist orders over repair work it says was done without permits. The commission and Sable are due back in court Wednesday. “This fly-by-night oil company has repeatedly abused the public's trust, racking up millions of dollars in fines and causing environmental damage along the treasured Gaviota Coast,” a state park south of Santa Barbara, said Joshua Smith, the commission's spokesman. The California Attorney General's office sued Sable this month, saying it illegally discharged waste into waterways, and disregarded state law requiring permits before work along the pipeline route that crosses sensitive wildlife habitat. “Sable placed profits over environmental protection in its rush to get oil on the market,” the agency said in its lawsuit. Last month, the Santa Barbara District Attorney filed felony criminal charges against Sable, also accusing it of polluting waterways and harming wildlife. Interior Department's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said in July it was working with Sable to bring a second rig online. “President Trump made it clear that American energy should come from American resources,” the agency's deputy director Kenny Stevens said in a statement then, heralding the “comeback story for Pacific production.” The agency said there are an estimated 190 million barrels (6 billion gallons) of recoverable oil reserves in the area, nearly 80% of residual Pacific reserves. It noted advancements in preventing and preparing for oil spills and said the failed pipeline has been rigorously tested. On May 19 — the 10th anniversary of the disaster — CEO Jim Flores announced that Sable “is proud to have safely and responsibly achieved first production at the Santa Ynez Unit” — which includes three rigs in federal waters, offshore and onshore pipelines, and the Las Flores Canyon Processing Facility. State officials countered that the company had only conducted testing and not commercial production. Sable's stock price dropped and some investors sued, alleging they were misled. Sable purchased the Santa Ynez Unit from Exxon Mobil in 2024 for nearly $650 million primarily with a loan from Exxon. Flores said well tests at the Platform Harmony rig indicate there is much oil to be extracted and that it will relieve California's gas prices — among the nation's highest — by stabilizing supplies. “Sable is very concerned about the crumbling energy complex in California,” Flores said in a statement to The Associated Press. The movement has been spearheaded partly by Santa Barbara County, where elected officials voted in May to begin taking steps to phase out onshore oil and gas operations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) took aim at Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) on Tuesday for refusing to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva amid the prolonged government shutdown. “Speaker Johnson is just a little creep, and he's acting like a creep when it comes to this,” Gallego said on MSNBC, adding that the Republican leader is constantly changing his reasoning for not swearing in the Democratic congresswoman-elect. “He is doing this because he wants to cover up for the president and the pedophiles on Epstein's list,” Gallego said, “and the only way that he can do that is to make sure that Adelita Grijalva doesn't become the 218th person to sign this discharge petition. Earlier Tuesday, Gallego and Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) approached Johnson on Capitol Hill to discuss Grijalva's situation. “You just keep coming up with excuses,” Gallego told Johnson while reporters recorded the encounter. Arizona state officials certified her victory on Tuesday, and they threatened to pursue legal action against Johnson if he fails to swear in Adelita Grijalva or provide a “reasonable explanation” as to when the ceremony will occur. Grijalva was elected with nearly 70% of the vote, and unofficial results were provided to you by the Arizona Secretary of State,” Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes wrote in a letter. Grijalva and the State expected that you would follow your usual practice and swear her into office at the earliest opportunity, just as you had done with five previous members elected in special elections.” “You and your staff have provided ever-shifting, unsatisfactory, and sometimes absurd stories as to why Ms. Grijalva has not been sworn in,” she added. “Arizona's right to a full delegation, and the right of the residents of [Arizona's 7th congressional district] to representation from the person they recently voted for, are not up for debate and may not be delayed or used as leverage in negotiations about unrelated legislation.” Other Democrats beyond those in Arizona are also calling on Johnson to act. “Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva should be sworn in now,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) previously told reporters. Notably, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) took 25 days to swear in Rep. Julia Letlow (R-LA), who won a 2021 special election to replace her late husband. It's been 21 days since Adelita Grijalva won her special election.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Florida judge ruled on Tuesday to temporarily block the transfer of land in downtown Miami to be used for President Donald Trump's future presidential library. The decision stems from a lawsuit filed last week by a Miami historian and racial activist who took issue with the Miami Dade College Board of Trustees' Sept. 23 vote to hand over 2.63 acres of land worth more than $67 million to Florida. The meeting also wasn't livestreamed, unlike previous meetings this year. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) and his Cabinet voted to transfer the land to the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Foundation. An attorney for the college maintained the Board of Trustees complied with state law and questioned Dunn's political motivations in filing the case, considering it is related to Trump. Tuesday's preliminary injunction comes one day after Ruiz declined to immediately bar Miami Dade College from deeding the land. She was concerned that Dunn had not yet established the right to sue by demonstrating his citizenship in Florida. On Monday, Dunn's legal team said their client's paperwork had not been fully processed due to office closures on Columbus Day. There is no set time frame for the presidential library's construction or opening, but a more concrete plan is expected to be finalized in the next four years. The National Archives and Records Administration will launch a website dedicated to the presidential library on Jan. 20, 2029, when Trump's second term will end.</p>
