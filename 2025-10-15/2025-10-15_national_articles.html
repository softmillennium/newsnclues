Jon Fetherston, a former Massachusetts migrant shelter director, revealed that he was grabbed and attacked by an immigrant after Fetherston and a state official confronted him about raping and impregnating his own daughter. Haitian illegal alien Cory Alvarez, 27, was found guilty of aggravated rape of a child at a migrant shelter in Rockland, Massachusetts, and sentenced to 10 to 12 years in prison, according to NBC 10 Boston. Alvarez was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in August. Haitian illegal Cory Bernard Alvarez was sentenced for rape of a child at a state-run shelter in Massachusetts. In response, Fetherston, who ran a similar migrant shelter in Marlborough, Massachusetts, from 2023 to 2024, said Alvarez's sentencing "exposes a much bigger problem." "Call it what you will, but this is total government failure," he said. "You have documented cases now of these girls being assaulted in shelters run with taxpayer dollars. Fetherston has previously blown the whistle on "rampant" sexual abuse of children taking place in the Massachusetts-run shelter system. Speaking with Fox News Digital in February, he detailed the case of another Haitian illegal alien, Ronald Joseph, who raped and impregnated his own 14-year-old daughter at the Marlborough shelter. Fetherston said that when he and the authorities confronted Joseph about the rape, he became agitated and threatened him. Despite the gravity of the crime, Fetherston said he was instructed to order Joseph a ride to another state-run shelter. Joseph was not arrested until months later. Fetherston said that these two cases are not isolated but rather part of a larger disturbing pattern of child sexual abuse that has largely gone unpunished. "The state didn't protect these children, and when you don't protect children, you have no moral authority to run these programs," he said, adding, "If you're not going to protect children, you shouldn't be in office." Earlier this year, a Healey spokesperson told the Boston Herald that the governor "inherited a disaster of a shelter system" and that Healey "is the one who took action to implement a length of stay limit, mandate criminal background checks, require residents to prove Massachusetts residency and lawful immigration status, and get families out of hotels." Fetherston said that despite claims that shelter residents had all been vetted through criminal background checks, "not a single one of these people was vetted" and "nobody knows who they are." "The governor opened up the doors wide open and didn't vet anybody, and that is on her," he said. He also noted that "98 percent of the people that I was dealing with were really good people and they were just here to make a better life for themselves. He emphasized that "all of these shelters are paid for with taxpayer dollars." "The taxpayers need to realize that essentially, and horribly, you're funding these rapes and assaults of little girls," he said, adding, "Nobody wants that." In August, Healey ordered the closure of the state's shelter system and made some of the residents eligible to receive at least $30,000 in state housing assistance over a two-year period. Since then, Fetherston said that local police have told him there has been an uptick in auto accidents. He also said that school districts, especially in small-town communities, have been overwhelmed by the influx of foreign students. Maura Healey visit the Melnea A. Cass Recreational Complex, which was being used to house more than 300 migrants. Do you not fix the roads that year? Because you do have to educate these children. So, I mean it has devastating effects on small communities." Fox News Digital previously reported that Alvarez arrived in June under the parole process for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans (CHNV) instituted by the Biden administration. The policy was first announced for Venezuelans in October 2022, which allowed a limited number to fly directly into the U.S. as long as they had not entered illegally, had a sponsor in the U.S. already and passed certain checks. Fox News Digital reached out to Healey's office for comment but did not immediately receive a response. Peter Pinedo is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani discusses President Donald Trump's peace deal in the Middle East and addresses his prior claims about having the Israeli prime minister arrested on 'The Story.' New York City Democratic Socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani said the city should honor the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant issued for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he were to visit the city. "I've said that this is a city that believes international law, and this is a city that wants to uplift and uphold those beliefs," Mamdani told Fox News' Martha MacCallum on "The Story" on Wednesday. New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani speaks during a Wednesday interview on Fox News' "The Story with Martha MacCallum," where he discussed the Gaza ceasefire and said he would uphold an International Criminal Court warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. "The Criminal Court, however, has issued a warrant for the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu, as it has for Vladimir Putin," he continued. "I've said that I believe that we should uphold arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court and that we would… do so only in abiding with all of the laws in front of us." Mamdani said he would not make a new law to ensure Netanyahu could be arrested. MacCallum then asked Mamdani if he thinks NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch would allow him to arrest Netanyahu in the city. Netanyahu faces an ICC warrant tied to alleged war crimes in Gaza.

(Chen Mengtong/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images) Additionally, Mamdani did not respond to MacCallum's direct questioning on Hamas "lay[ing] down their arms" in Gaza. New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani defended New York Attorney General Letitia James during a press conference Oct. 10, 2025, after James was indicted by a grand jury in Virginia. "I don't really have opinions about the future of Hamas and Israel beyond the question of justice and safety and the fact that anything has to abide by international law, and that applies to Hamas, that applies to Israeli military, applies to anyone you could ask me about," Mamdani said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Mamdani will debate Democrat Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa on Thursday night in the first head-to-head matchup of the campaign.

'Dancing with the Stars' contestants Brooks Nader and Gleb Savchenko tell Fox News Digital that they got ‘secret' matching tattoos together. Brooks Nader stepped out in another head-turning look this week. The 28-year-old model was photographed in New York City wearing a sheer black turtleneck top, tucked into a black mini skirt and worn with a black blazer over it, barely covering the adhesive silicone covers on her chest. She opted for a more dramatic makeup look, with glossy red lipstick, a subtle smoky eye and bold lashes. Nader was photographed alongside her sisters Sarah Jane and Grace Ann as they exited the "Sherri" talk show. Brooks Nader was photographed with her sisters in a sheer black top while out in New York. The trio appeared on the talk show to promote their reality show, "Love Thy Nader," which follows their journey as sisters as they leave their home in Louisiana to pursue a career in fashion and media in New York. Brooks' daring fashion choices have led to several wardrobe malfunctions, the most recent one taking place earlier this month during the Marquee Las Vegas grand reveal weekend at Marquee Nightclub. While in the process of taking a video of herself dancing inside the event, Nader's low-cut dress slipped lower, briefly exposing her chest. She was at the event with her three sisters, this time including the third sister, Mary Holland. Nader had a wardrobe malfunction while on the red carpet in Las Vegas. In a recent interview with Maxim magazine, Nader discussed her upbringing in Baton Rouge, explaining she was raised in an "extremely Christian and extremely conservative" household, but said she always had dreams of moving to a big city. "For the majority of our childhood, my dad was working for a non-profit, and my mom was at home with the babies," Nader said. "We didn't have a lot of money. I wouldn't trade that upbringing for the world." "I fantasized about living in LA or New York, but it seemed worlds away. She said her parents were "totally against" her decision to drop out of school and move to New York City to pursue modeling, telling her, "This is the dumbest thing you could ever do." Despite that, Nader found an agent and launched her career. Nader always dreamed of being a model. After her agents refused to help her land a spot within the pages of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, Nader took things into her own hands and attended an open casting call. "You can't wait for other people. It's all up to you," she said. Lori Bashian is an entertainment production assistant for Fox News Digital.

"Saleh's martyrdom is a testament to the fact that the fight against Zionism in all its manifestations — from the IOF to its collaborators — must continue," it wrote, using the acronym for "Israeli Occupation Forces." Hamas has signed onto President Donald Trump's plan as IDF forces start withdrawing from the enclave. Death to all collaborators," the post concluded. The group has organized protests across college campuses following Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. With a truce in place between Hamas and Israel following two years of fighting, the terror group has cracked down on its rivals. Violent clashes and public executions have erupted in Gaza as Hamas seeks to reassert control of the territory. Hamas terrorists marching in Gaza during a parade. Videos circulating on social media appear to show the executions, which an Israeli military official told Fox News Digital are "Hamas's deliberate attempt to show the killing publicly and reestablish its rule by terrorizing civilians."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court's conservative supermajority signaled deep skepticism Wednesday over the creation of a second majority Black district in Louisiana and appeared open to at least weakening the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 in a way that could limit minority representation in Congress. On one level, the case is about a single congressional district in Louisiana – drawn after the 2020 census to ensure African American voters could elect a candidate of their choice. More fundamentally, the case is about whether governments may actively address discrimination – current or historic – by taking an action that is intended to help racial minorities. It could potentially reduce minority representation not only in Congress but also in state legislatures and school boards across the country. At issue is a protracted court case that started when Louisiana drew only one congressional district out of six with an opportunity to election a Black member of Congress, despite the fact that African Americans make up about a third of the state's population. A group of Black plaintiffs sued over that district, and a lower court found the maps likely violated the Voting Rights Act. When the state responded by drawing a second majority Black district, a group of White plaintiffs argued state lawmakers had impermissibly considered race in violation of the 14th and 15th Amendments. At the time, however, he raised concerns about race-based remedies – that is, using race as a factor to address discrimination – that were in place indefinitely. JD Vance epitomizes the GOP's move from morals to whataboutism “The issue, as you know, is that this court's cases in a variety of contexts have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period time – sometimes for a long period of time, decades in some cases – but that they should not be indefinite and should have an end point,” Kavanaugh told the attorney representing a group of Black voters who successfully challenged Louisiana's first map. Chief Justice John Roberts, another important vote, also quickly tried to draw a distinction between the Louisiana case and the court's surprising decision two years ago to order Alabama to redraw its map. That case, Roberts said, took the “existing precedent as a given” and considered “Alabama's particular challenge.” The parties pushing back on Louisiana's second Black congressional district brought slightly different legal arguments into the Supreme Court's ornate chamber on Wednesday. Louisiana, which initially defended the new map and now rejects it, wants a broad ruling that the Constitution bars states from ever considering race when fixing a violation of the Voting Rights Act. Such a ruling would gut the landmark 1965 law. But there appeared to be interest, including from Kavanaugh and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in taking a more nuanced approach. Under that approach, if Black voters in a district heavily favor Democrats and White voters heavily favor Republicans, a decision not to create a Black-majority district would be based on partisan rather than motivations. It is a point that Kavanaugh repeatedly pressed attorneys to address. “I would have thought that solves a lot of the concerns that you've identified,” Kavanaugh told Benjamin Anguiñaga, Louisiana's solicitor general. Anguiñaga described that idea as a “half solution.” But while perhaps less aggressive than gutting the law entirely, DOJ's proposal would likely make it much harder to prove violations of the law, critics say. “The standard that you're setting,” she said, “is a much different one.” They focused much of their fire on Congress' intent in enacting the Voting Rights Act: to root out discrimination that targeted African American voters. They questioned the Trump administration's approach, suggesting it would require plaintiffs to meet a much higher standard than is required by the law currently to find discriminatory maps. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the opinion legalizing same-sex marriage. Here's why he says it won't be overturned “Are you walking that back?” Sotomayor asked pointedly. On the other hand, Louisiana had always represented that it redrew its map because of a court order finding that it likely violated the Voting Rights Act. The Voting Rights Act fight involves what has become a familiar – and increasingly fought – debate over race in recent years: whether the Constitution is colorblind, or whether policies may try to make up for past racism. That complicated question is at the heart of much of Trump's rejection of diversity and inclusion programs, for instance, as well as efforts to reform police departments and the judicial system generally. “There is no safe harbor for racial discrimination the government deems good discrimination,” Louisiana told the Supreme Court in written arguments. “These violations of basic equal protection principles ended race-based admissions programs. Voting rights groups counter that courts and Congress have explicitly carved out an exception for race-conscious remedies for “ongoing unlawful” discriminatory policies. And that, those groups said, is precisely what happened with Louisiana's first congressional map.</p>

Michael Randrianirina, who led the rebellion that ousted President Andry Rajoelina on Tuesday following weeks of youth-led protests, said in his first interview with a global news outlet since taking power that he expects to be sworn in as the country's new leader in the next few days. “There must be an oath-taking” to make his position official, Randrianirina said at his unit's barracks while flanked by fellow officers. Soldiers are greeted by people gathering for a ceremony in tribute to demonstrators killed during recent anti-government protest in Antananarivo, Madagascar, Sunday, Oct. 12, 2025. Randrianirina announced Tuesday that the armed forces were taking power in Madagascar, a sprawling country of about 30 million people off of Africa's east coast that is the world's leading vanilla producer and is known for its unique biodiversity. Since gaining independence from France in 1960, it also has a history of coups and political crises. The latest military takeover capped weeks of protests against Rajoelina and his government led by youth groups calling themselves “Gen Z Madagascar.” The protesters, who also included labor unions and civic groups, have demanded better government and job opportunities, echoing youth-led protests elsewhere in the world. Among other things, the Madagascar protesters have railed against chronic water and electricity outages, limited access to higher education, government corruption and poverty, which affects roughly three out of every four Madagascans, according to the World Bank. Shaniah Rakotohania, 18-year-old university student at Lycee Technique Alarabia, gestures during a protest calling for President Andry Rajoelina to step down in Antananarivo, Madagascar, Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2025. Randrianirina explained that he is taking over as Madagascar's head of state because the country's High Constitutional Court invited him to do so in the absence of Rajoelina. He fired his government last month in an attempt to appease the protesters after a crackdown by security forces left 22 people dead and more than 100 injured, according to the United Nations.

We have an order from the High Constitutional Court. We did not force the HCC or point a gun at it to issue this.” In a statement, Rajoelina's office claimed that some of the high court's judges had been threatened so they would sign off on the colonel's ascendency. The African Union announced Wednesday that it had suspended Madagascar from its bodies with immediate effect “until constitutional order is restored in the country.” The group previously suspended several other member states after military coups, including Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea. U.N. Secretary General António Guterres, meanwhile, is “deeply concerned by the unconstitutional change of power in Madagascar” and hopes all stakeholders there can “work together to reach a peaceful settlement to the ongoing crisis and its root causes,” his spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said in a statement, noting that the U.N. will continue to work to “restore peace and stability in the country.” Some analysts have described Madagascar's youth movement as an expression of understandable grievances over government failures, and condemned the military takeover. “Gen-Zers in Madagascar have been on the streets of the country protesting the lack of essential services, especially water and electricity, and the negative impact on their lives for almost a month,” said Olufemi Taiwo, professor of Africana studies at Cornell University. “This is a civil society uprising and its resolution should not involve the military.” Imray reported from Cape Town, South Africa.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is involved in planning for a major new monument in Washington, DC: a triumphal arch to commemorate the country's 250th anniversary, marking his latest effort to impose his style and tastes on the nation's capital. A senior White House official told CNN the arch was Trump's idea. From flag poles to a $200 million ballroom: Inside Trump's ‘legacy project' at the White House Trump remains deeply attuned to his background as a real estate developer and has taken major steps since returning to office to apply his aesthetic vision to Washington, DC: paving over the White House Rose Garden and decorating it to mirror his Mar-a-Lago patio; adorning the Oval Office, Cabinet Room, and West Colonnade with gilded features; and launching a major ballroom expansion. Last week, AFP photographer Jim Watson captured images of a pair of three-dimensional models of the proposed arch atop Trump's desk in the Oval Office as the president met with his Finnish counterpart, President Alexander Stubb. The White House, Harrison Design and America250 did not respond to CNN's request for comment. It is similar to France's Arc de Triomphe. Trump memorably visited Paris in 2017, where he delightedly observed a Bastille Day parade from a viewing stand near the iconic arch – and soon called on his aides to deliver his own military parade, which came to fruition eight years later. The proposed monument would be situated near the Virginia side of the Arlington Memorial Bridge – atop a grassy traffic circle directly between Arlington National Cemetery and the Lincoln Memorial, according to architect Nicolas Leo Charbonneau, a partner at Harrison Design. America needs a triumphal arch!” Charbonneau posted on social media alongside a watercolor rendering of the arch by artist Christopher Draper. It was not immediately clear how the arch would be paid for. “Washington, DC, is the only major Western capital that lacks an arch. Catesby Leigh, a co-founder of the National Civil Art Society, has made multiple appeals for a triumphal arch to commemorate the country's anniversary. He suggested in a December 2024 piece for urban policy magazine City Journal that any initial structure should be temporary – but could be eventually made permanent. “There isn't enough time to build a permanent arch for the 250th. But temporary arches have a long history in this country. And there's also a noteworthy precedent for a temporary arch being rebuilt in permanent form after winning public acclaim: the Washington Arch in Manhattan, which celebrated the centennial of George Washington's first inauguration,” Leigh wrote. The plans come months after the president signed an executive order mandating that all federal buildings embrace classical architecture, noting that any designs that depart from the “preferred style,” including Brutalist-style buildings, must be run directly by the president. On Wednesday, as reporters departed an Oval Office event, Trump was asked about the model on his desk. “It's an Arc, take a look,” he said, according to pool reports. Correction: This headline and story have been updated to correct the proposed location for the triumphal arch inside Washington, DC.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A sign that reads “Closed due to federal government shutdown,” is seen outside of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, Oct. 6, 2025. From left, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., talk to reporters as a government shutdown begins its tenth day, in Washington, Friday, Oct. 10, 2025. A Transportation Security Administration worker heads into the east security checkpoint in Denver International Airport Thursday, Oct. 2, 2025, in Denver. And now they are confronting new uncertainty with the Trump administration's promised layoffs. Little progress has been made to end the shutdown as it enters its third week, with Republicans and Democrats digging in and convinced their messaging is resonating with voters. “Luckily I was able to pay rent this month,” said Peter Farruggia, a furloughed federal worker. “But for sure I am going to have bills that are going to go unpaid this month, and I really don't have many options.” The shutdown has a familiar feel for many federal employees who endured past stalemates — including during President Donald Trump's first term — but this time, the stakes are higher. The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Trump and other Republican leaders have said the government must reopen before they will negotiate with Democrats on the health subsidies. What questions do you have for them? Like 8,000 other CDC employees who have been furloughed from the agency, he was already living paycheck to paycheck, and the partial pay that arrived Friday was his last until the government comes back online. With the agency's leadership in turmoil and still rattled from a shooting, the shutdown and new firings mean “people are scared, nervous, anxious, but also really just exasperated,” Farruggia said. The layoffs have begun across federal agencies. Labor unions have already filed a lawsuit to stop the move by Trump's budget office. In a court filing on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget said well over 4,000 federal employees from eight departments and agencies would be fired in conjunction with the shutdown. Jessica Sweet, an Albany, New York, Social Security claims specialist who is a union steward of AFGE Local 3343 in New York, said, “I, myself, have a backup plan” in case she is fired during the shutdown, “but I know most people don't.” She says the Social Security Administration is already so short-staffed from layoffs earlier this year brought on by the Department of Government Efficiency, she doesn't fear a massive layoff during the shutdown. “The one thing this administration has taught me is that nothing is ever for certain, even if it's codified into law,” she said. Having received a partial payment in her last paycheck, Sweet has begun reaching out to her local power companies to request that she not get charged late fees, since “my bills won't wait for me to eventually get paid.” A sign that reads “Closed due to federal government shutdown,” is seen outside of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, Oct. 6, 2025. For some federal workers, this isn't their first shutdown — the last one, during Trump's first term in 2019, stretched a record 34 days. But this time, federal employees are being used more directly as leverage in the political fight over government funding. The Republican administration last week warned that there would be no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a shutdown — a reversal of long-standing policy affecting roughly 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a White House memo. The move, which Trump later backtracked on, was widely seen as a strong-arm tactic. Adam Pelletier, a National Labor Relations Board field examiner whose agency furloughed nearly all of its workforce on Oct. 1, going from roughly 1,100 workers to fewer than a dozen people, said he wouldn't mind if the shutdown continued if it meant meaningful progress toward gaining health care protections for Americans across the country — a key demand by Democrats for ending the stalemate. Pelletier, a union leader for NLRB local 3, said “right now, nothing is being investigated at the NLRB. As for the financial strain on workers, he said workers can't even find alternate employment to weather the shutdown because “the ethics office that would approve of those requests is not staffed now.” From left, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., talk to reporters as a government shutdown begins its tenth day, in Washington, Friday, Oct. 10, 2025. National Treasury Employees Union President Doreen Greenwald, which represents workers across dozens of federal agencies, said several of the union's members had been laid off as of Friday. Greenwald said it was unfortunate that the Trump administration was using “federal employees as political pawns by furloughing and proposing to fire them all to try to cause pressure in a political game of chicken.” A Transportation Security Administration worker heads into the east security checkpoint in Denver International Airport Thursday, Oct. 2, 2025, in Denver. “This isn't about one party or the other. “The correction officer worrying about his next paycheck. The TSA officer who still shows up to work because he or she loves their country, even though they're not getting paid. No American should ever have to choose between serving their country and feeding their family,” Kelley said. Kelley and other major federal worker union leaders gathered blocks from the Capitol last week, urging congressional leaders to find a solution and put “people over politics.” The event grew emotional at times, with union heads outlining the difficulties facing their members and the stakes growing daily.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US District Judge Karin Immergut has ruled to extend her temporary restraining orders barring the deployment of the National Guard troops to Portland, keeping President Donald Trump's federalization efforts in limbo as legal challenges unfold. The orders were originally set to expire this weekend. The extension comes as the federal government challenges the judge's earlier ruling on deployment in a higher court as it works to crack down on Democratic-led cities it claims are stricken by crime and disorder. “Regardless of what happens next, Oregon (Department of Justice) will continue to fight to uphold Oregon's laws and the Constitution,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a social media post Wednesday. Leaders in Oregon have emphatically disputed the president's characterizations of their cities as “war-ravaged” and uncontrollably violent, arguing in court that the situation on the ground in Portland is nowhere as extreme as federal officials portray it to be. The scene was largely calm until Trump had declared late September he was sending 200 Oregon National Guard troops to the city. Oregon and Portland officials jointly sued following the announcement, and Immergut granted a temporary order barring the federalization of those Oregon troops. The federal judge then expanded that ruling a day later to include barring the deployment of any US troops when the Trump administration reassigned federalized guard troops in Los Angeles to Portland in an apparent effort to get around the initial order. A three-judge panel with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is still weighing whether the Trump administration should be blocked from deploying the Oregon National Guard to respond to ICE protests in Portland. They have yet to release a decision. If the Ninth Circuit rules against the temporary order on deployment, Immergut said during the hearing Wednesday that she will file an order to end her extension. Trump has had his sights on Portland, Oregon, for years. This is how we got here As Trump continues efforts to federalize National Guard members across the US for deployment to Democratic-led cities, the administration faces mounting legal pushback from states saying they don't need — or want — any federal help. After the state of Illinois and its largest city sued the administration last week, calling plans to move troops from the Illinois and Texas National Guards into Chicago “illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional,” a federal appeals court ruled that the troops in Illinois can remain under federal control but can't be deployed as the appeals process continues in the ongoing showdown between the Trump administration and the state.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Janet Dufek, a professor at the School of Integrated Health Sciences at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, poses at the school, Sept. 8, 2025, in Las Vegas. But like any workout, hoofing it for your health may feel repetitive and even boring after a while. Turning around not only provides a change of view, but also puts different demands on your body. Janet Dufek, a biomechanist and faculty member at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, has researched the mechanics of both walking and landing from jumps to identify ways of preventing injuries and improving physical performance. And as a former college basketball player and a regular exerciser, she's also done her fair share of backward walking. In humans, reverse locomotion can increase hamstring flexibility, strengthen underused muscles and challenges the mind as the body adjusts to a new movement and posture. “I see a lot of people in my neighborhood and they walk, and that's good,” she said. Walking backward introduces an element of cross-training, a subtly different activity.” Kevin Patterson, a personal trainer in Nashville, Tennessee, recommends the treadmill as the safest place to retro walk. You can adjust it to a slow speed. Patterson said he uses backward walking with all his clients as an “accessory exercise” — a weight-training term for add-on movements designed to work a specific muscle group — or during warm-ups. Dufek suggests working a one-minute segment of backward walking into a 10-minute walk and adding time and distance as you get comfortable. You can also do it with a partner; face each other, perhaps clasp hands. “At first, you start really, really slowly because there's a balance accommodation and there is brain retraining. You are learning a new skill,” Dufek said. If you work your way up to running and get really good at it, you can try running a marathon backward — 26.2 miles or 42.2 kilometers. Doing a range of exercises can help prevent overuse injuries, which can occur after repeatedly using the same muscle groups. For many people, cross-training involves different activities and types of exercise: for example, running one day, swimming the next, and strength training on a third day. But the modifications required to walk backward work in the same way, but on a micro level. Do small tweaks make much of a difference? Once an avid runner, Dufek said she had several pairs of running shoes and did not wear the same pair two days in a row. “Just by changing that one element, in this case footwear, it would provide a slightly different stress to the system.” Physical therapists instruct some of their clients to reverse walk, which can be useful after knee injuries or for people in rehabilitation or recovering from surgery. “Backward walking is very different than forward walking from a force perspective, from a movement pattern perspective,” Dufek explained. Dufek is interested in finding out if it improves balance and reduces fall risks in older adults by activating more senses of the body. There is nothing unnatural about backward walking. In fact, backward running is a key skill for top athletes. American football players — particularly the defensive backs — do it continually. “I played basketball and I probably spent 40% of my time playing defense and running backwards,” Dufek said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed US military leaders to verify that every member of the department watched the speech he delivered at an unusual gathering of senior officers in Quantico, Virginia, last month and reviews the policy changes he announced in the wake of that event, according to a memo reviewed by CNN. Hegseth's memo comes after he ordered senior officers to travel to Quantico for what amounted to a largely political speech that asserted his vision for how the military will physically look and act. He also offered a stark ultimatum during his speech: If you don't agree, resign. While Hegseth delivered his speech, in person, to hundreds of senior officers, the subsequent memo makes clear he wants to make sure the message reaches defense personnel at every level. The directives that accompanied the speech largely roll back efforts made over the last decade focused on eradicating toxic culture in the military, both to decrease harmful behaviors like harassment, but also to meet practical needs of getting people in uniform and keeping them there longer. There was also a significant emphasis in Hegseth's speech on the fitness and appearance of service members. Following Hegseth's speech in Quantico, the Texas Military Department removed seven National Guard troops that had been deployed to Chicago because they “did not meet mission requirements,” a Texas National Guard spokesperson told CNN. “These service members were returned to home station. The troops, sent to Chicago as part of President Donald Trump's domestic-facing mission focused on crime, were replaced amid criticism on social media over pictures that showed some of the Guard members appearing to be overweight.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That single expenditure was more than the $400 million the Illinois Department of Transportation was given for its Road Fund that pays for transportation-related projects in towns, cities, and counties; $55.3 million to cook and deliver meals to the elderly; $22.1 million to increase foster homes and specialized care of children; and $24.6 million to fund the Illinois Arts Council — combined. Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, said programs like Illinois' incentivize illegal immigration and take away from other deserving programs. “States have to balance their budgets, unlike the federal government, so when these costs of services to illegal aliens explode, as has happened with the population of people in the country illegally, generally, then that directly takes away from programs that serve Americans.” In 2020, Illinois politicians moved to make healthcare coverage available for people who had no legal basis to be in the United States. Then in July 2022, adults 42 to 54 years old became eligible. Both groups under 65 years old were wrapped into a new program, Health Benefits for Adults. Between 2021 and 2024, Illinois spent $1.6 billion covering healthcare costs for illegal immigrants over the age of 42, according to a February 2025 report by the auditor general. The massive spending was due, in part, to the state's allowing approximately twice as many people to get covered as it had planned for. Around 30,000 illegal immigrants in Illinois were covered by the state plan. As of July 1, only senior citizens in the country illegally would be eligible for healthcare coverage. Thirteen other states and Washington, D.C., also provide healthcare to illegal immigrants: California, New York, Washington, New Jersey, Oregon, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Rhode Island, Maine, and Vermont. Vaughan said healthcare programs for illegal immigrants “can serve as a reason that these people don't go home,” knowing that their healthcare in blue states is better than in the country they are from. Immigrant advocates have argued that the healthcare program was beneficial. “Notably, we did not observe similar reductions in Wisconsin and Indiana, our control states, suggesting that these changes may have been linked to the implementation of HBIA/HBIS,” the Embodying Race(ism) Project's website states.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Why A House of Dynamite is so damn scary. There's no shortage of things that could end the world. But between climate change, risks from AI, and biological threats like pandemics, we seem to be forgetting about one human-made existential risk that has been with us for 80 years: the ever-present possibility of nuclear warfare. But nuclear war hasn't forgotten about us. “Because of extraordinary luck over 80 years, despite many close calls and near-misses, there hasn't been a detonation of nuclear weapons,” Elise Rowan, the deputy vice president of communications at the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), told me over email. “Every concern that is top of mind for Americans right now…could be eclipsed by a snap decision under pressure or even an accident.” They make small talk about sports, kids, and snacking habits. A senior officer (Rebecca Ferguson) in the White House Situation Room, which provides 24/7 intelligence updates and decision support to US national security officials, chides a colleague for waiting until that night to propose marriage to his longtime girlfriend. Soldiers in a remote Alaska base initially think it's a North Korean missile test that will land harmlessly in the Pacific. After all, a real nuclear attack would probably involve hundreds of missiles, including decoys. That's how the Soviet air force officer Stanislov Petrov realized that the five American nuclear missiles heading toward the Soviet Union in 1983 were actually a false alarm caused by malfunctioning early-warning satellites. Petrov's good judgment — he decided not to report the finding up the military chain, which would have led to retaliation per Soviet doctrine — is how we avoided all-out nuclear war by way of Soviet retaliation. The US launches its anti-missile defense system from that base in Alaska. But the interceptor fails to destroy the missile, which remains inbound for Chicago and its metro population of 10 million people. It's only after the fact that top officials learn that the defense systems charged with keeping the homeland safe from just such a strike have just a 61 percent chance of success. In real life, it's around a 55 percent success rate — and that's under controlled conditions. “So it's a fucking coin toss?” the defense secretary (Jared Harris) exclaims. And when it fails, there's no plan B. What this shows, Rowan told me, is that the nuclear defense system “demands perfection from people and machines 100 percent of the time. (Disclosure: I worked at NTI for two years on the Global Biological Policy and Programs team. I learned a lot about nuclear risks through osmosis, but my focus was on pandemic prevention, bioweapons deterrence, and biotechnology governance. I did not work on “nuclear pandemics,” as my uncle once asked me.) But it almost certainly wouldn't end there. Further retaliations could lead to the death of billions, perhaps spark nuclear winter, and potentially spell humanity's end. While it's impossible not to watch the film without nauseously picturing Donald Trump, who has the sole power to order a nuclear attack as the president, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in charge, it may not make a difference. It's not a matter of skill or nerve; nearly everyone does their job as best they can. North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran are floated as possibilities. The movie doesn't tell us if the launch was a purposeful attack or an accident, an isolated incident or part of a coordinated campaign. I don't see my childhood home in the Chicago suburbs get vaporized. It's not possible for us to know all of this in just the 18 minutes the intercontinental ballistic missile allows, just as it's not possible for the president to make a meaningfully informed decision on how to respond in that time. When presented with a menu of escalating retaliation options — “rare, medium, and well-done,” someone quips darkly — the president says he's ready to give the order. Things were simpler in those “us versus them” Cold War days, if not any less dangerous. There are (at least) nine nuclear powers to keep track of, and emerging technologies like AI enhance the risks. “I hope this film gets a new generation interested and engaged in nuclear issues,” Heather Williams, the director of the Project on Nuclear Issues at the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), told me by email. “There are still thousands of nuclear weapons in the world and some countries are still engaging in nuclear saber-rattling — the threat hasn't gone away.” It's not all doom and gloom, though: In 1986, there were 70,000 nuclear weapons. There are 12,000 today — an 80 percent reduction of the world's total nukes. But for the first time in 40 years, that number is expected to increase. So things are heading in the wrong direction. “We need the same level of public outcry that led to reductions and [nuclear weapon] verification measures that have made the world safer,” Rowan said. But you can't have deterrence in a world wiped out by nuclear apocalypse.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats are using a $20 billion lifeline to Argentina to claim Republicans care more about bailing out foreign governments than helping Americans at home. The messaging, a riff on President Donald Trump's “America First” policy agenda, intensified ahead of a White House visit by Argentinian President Javier Milei on Tuesday, where Trump said the United States would “be there” for Argentina, so long as Milei succeeds in midterm elections set to take place later this month. “If this administration has $20 billion to spare for a MAGA-friendly foreign government, how can they say we don't have the money to lower healthcare costs?” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said on the Senate floor. The Democratic talking point, made in the halls of Congress and a Democratic National Committee press call on Tuesday, reflects an attempt to turn Trump's signature policy doctrine against him. But the financial assistance for Argentina, structured in the form of a currency swap, has torn at the president's MAGA support and frustrated business groups that noted Argentina, an agricultural rival, sold shipments of soybeans to China as talk of a bailout became public. He represents a libertarian break from the socialist policies of other regional governments and has forged a closer relationship with the White House. Democrats nonetheless see the issue as a liability for Trump, whose strikes on Iran and loose commitment to Ukraine have also rankled supporters. On Tuesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) attempted to pass a bill, the “No Argentina Bailout Act,” to keep the Treasury Department from performing the currency swap, before her attempt was blocked by Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC). “It is shameful that President Trump is propping up a foreign government, while he shuts down our own,” Warren said in a floor speech. The message represents the latest attempt to move Republicans off their shutdown position – a clean funding extension with no policy changes attached. His tariffs, in particular, have been wrapped into a broader critique that Republicans will send prices higher for consumers. Trump and congressional Republicans made the same case successfully in November, when Democrats were swept out of power in the face of decades-high inflation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He mentioned recent violent car meets in Boston earlier this month, one of which left a police department cruiser destroyed by fire. The car meetups have been deemed “staged attacks” and organized through social media and group messaging platforms, local prosecutors said. “These street takeovers are not spontaneous events but are preplanned and coordinated through social media platforms and group messaging applications,” said Lisa Deacutis, assistant district attorney at the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office. “Participants share meeting points, times, and driving routes in advance to allow large numbers to join intersections before police arrive.” The president claimed that “they're taking over parts of Boston” before stating, “But we could get them back in about two seconds.” Trump was also critical of Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, calling her “radical left” and saying he was not pleased with her response to the violence. ​​”I think she is hurting Boston,” Trump said. If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, let's move it to another location, if I thought Boston was going to cause safety conditions for the World Cup. Wu's office issued a statement in response to Trump's comments. “Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions,” the statement read.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Workers prepare an oil containment boom at Refugio State Beach, north of Goleta, Calif., May 21, 2015. Clean up crews remove oil-laden sand on the beach at Refugio State Beach, site of an oil spill, north of Goleta, Calif., May 20, 2015. A worker removes oil from the sand at Refugio State Beach, north of Goleta, Calif., May 21, 2015. More than 140,000 gallons (3,300 barrels) of oil gushed out, blackening beaches for 150 miles (240 kilometers) from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles, polluting a biologically rich habitat for endangered whales and sea turtles, killing scores of pelicans, seals and dolphins, and decimating the fishing industry. Plains All American Pipeline in 2022 agreed to a $230 million settlement with fishers and coastal property owners without admitting liability. It faced an uphill battle to build a new pipeline. Sable Offshore Corp., headquartered in Houston, is facing a slew of legal challenges but is determined to restart production, even if that means confining it to federal waters, where state regulators have virtually no say. California controls the 3 miles (5 kilometers) nearest to shore. President Donald Trump has directed Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to undo his predecessor's ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts. “This project risks another environmental disaster in California at a time when demand for oil is going down and the climate crisis is escalating,” said Alex Katz, executive director of Environmental Defense Center, the Santa Barbara group formed in response to a massive spill in 1969. The environmental organization is among several suing Sable. “Our concern is that there is no way to make this pipeline safe and that this company has proven that it cannot be trusted to operate safely, responsibly or even legally,” he said. Actor and activist Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who lives in the area, has implored officials to stop Sable, saying at a March protest: “I can smell a rat. The California Coastal Commission fined Sable a record $18 million for ignoring cease-and-desist orders over repair work it says was done without permits. The commission and Sable are due back in court Wednesday. “This fly-by-night oil company has repeatedly abused the public's trust, racking up millions of dollars in fines and causing environmental damage along the treasured Gaviota Coast,” a state park south of Santa Barbara, said Joshua Smith, the commission's spokesman. The California Attorney General's office sued Sable this month, saying it illegally discharged waste into waterways, and disregarded state law requiring permits before work along the pipeline route that crosses sensitive wildlife habitat. “Sable placed profits over environmental protection in its rush to get oil on the market,” the agency said in its lawsuit. Last month, the Santa Barbara District Attorney filed felony criminal charges against Sable, also accusing it of polluting waterways and harming wildlife. Interior Department's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said in July it was working with Sable to bring a second rig online. “President Trump made it clear that American energy should come from American resources,” the agency's deputy director Kenny Stevens said in a statement then, heralding the “comeback story for Pacific production.” The agency said there are an estimated 190 million barrels (6 billion gallons) of recoverable oil reserves in the area, nearly 80% of residual Pacific reserves. It noted advancements in preventing and preparing for oil spills and said the failed pipeline has been rigorously tested. On May 19 — the 10th anniversary of the disaster — CEO Jim Flores announced that Sable “is proud to have safely and responsibly achieved first production at the Santa Ynez Unit” — which includes three rigs in federal waters, offshore and onshore pipelines, and the Las Flores Canyon Processing Facility. State officials countered that the company had only conducted testing and not commercial production. Sable's stock price dropped and some investors sued, alleging they were misled. Sable purchased the Santa Ynez Unit from Exxon Mobil in 2024 for nearly $650 million primarily with a loan from Exxon. Flores said well tests at the Platform Harmony rig indicate there is much oil to be extracted and that it will relieve California's gas prices — among the nation's highest — by stabilizing supplies. “Sable is very concerned about the crumbling energy complex in California,” Flores said in a statement to The Associated Press. The movement has been spearheaded partly by Santa Barbara County, where elected officials voted in May to begin taking steps to phase out onshore oil and gas operations. Associated Press writer Matthew Brown in Billings, Montana contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Telegram messages, first reported by Politico, highlighted messages written by Young Republicans in New York, Kansas, Arizona, and Vermont. In one instance, one of the group's leaders said, “I love Hitler,” and mused about placing their enemies in gas chambers. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) denounced the messages and Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) over her previous praise of the state's Young Republicans. Stefanik and other New York Republicans have condemned the messages. When asked by a reporter whether the messages reflect “some bad apples,” Hochul excoriated Republicans and suggested they are condoning the behavior. “This is so vile it is hard to find the words to put into context that these are people who are part of a political party — one of two major parties — and they believe in gas chambers and rape and discrimination based on the color of people's skin. Hochul then criticized Stefanik for labeling New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani a “jihadist” and “terrorist,” called on Republicans to do a “reexamination” of their rhetoric, and floated possible punishments for the Young Republican leaders who wrote the hateful messages. Stop using them as campaign advisers,” she said. Bobby Walker and Peter Giunta were two of the leaders who exchanged some of the texts that are now under scrutiny. “Elise Stefanik can't hide behind staff to denounce the antisemitic, racist, hateful individuals she endorsed, funded, and praised as the ‘backbone' of the Republican Party,” a spokesperson for Hochul's campaign said, per Politico. “These are her people who said ‘I love Hitler' and named her their congresswoman of the year — an award she still hasn't returned. In response to her connections to the group, Stefanik's campaign committee noted she has never employed any member of the group chat. Alex deGrasse, a senior adviser to Stefanik, told the Washington Examiner, “Kathy Hochul's endorsed candidate Zohran Mamdani is an Antisemite Defund the Police Communist who embraces and campaigns with terrorists who say 9/11 was justified, say Israel doesn't have the right to exist as a Jewish state, and say he will arrest Netanyahu. On the subject of the Young Republicans group chat, deGrasse continued, “Congresswoman Stefanik was absolutely appalled to learn about the alleged comments made by leaders of the New York State Young Republicans and other state YRs in a large national group chat. While none have ever been employed  by Congresswoman Stefanik, if the description by Politico is accurate, Congresswoman Stefanik calls for any NY Young Republicans responsible for these horrific comments in this chat to step down immediately. Unlike Kathy Hochul who bends the knee and refuses to condemn the vile antisemitism spewed by leading NY Democrat candidates like Mamdani every single day, Congresswoman Stefanik will call out vile hate and demand accountability.” Stefanik hasn't yet entered next year's race for governor of New York, although she is expected to make an announcement after next month's elections. Until then, she is raising money for a possible gubernatorial bid. Meanwhile, Hochul is preparing to launch her reelection campaign. Editor's Note: This story has been updated to include a statement from Stefanik's team.</p>
