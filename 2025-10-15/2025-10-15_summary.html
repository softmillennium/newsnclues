Move by US marks sharp escalation in efforts to pressure Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro's regime

Donald Trump confirmed reports on Wednesday that he authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, marking a sharp escalation in US efforts to pressure President Nicolás Maduro's regime.

The New York Times first reported the classified directive, citing US officials familiar with the decision.

The US president said he authorized the action for two main reasons.

First, he claimed Venezuela had been releasing large numbers of prisoners, including individuals from mental health facilities, into the United States, often crossing the border due to what he described as an open border policy. Trump did not specify which border they were crossing.

The second reason, he said, was the large amount of drugs entering the US from Venezuela, much of it trafficked by sea.

“I think Venezuela is feeling heat,” Trump added, but declined to answer when asked if the CIA had the authority to execute Maduro.

If we don't organize and take action in the streets, says Mark Bray, “we're going to end up somewhere really bad.”

We speak with Rutgers University professor Mark Bray, who fled from the U.S. to Spain with his family after receiving death threats over his scholarship. He is the author of the 2017 book Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, which explores the history and tactics of anti-fascist movements in Europe, the United States and beyond. Turning Point USA, the conservative campus group founded by Charlie Kirk, had called for Bray's firing and branded him “Dr. Antifa.” This comes as the Trump administration has dramatically escalated its war on dissent following Kirk's assassination, using his death as pretext to launch an assault on activists, organizations and speech it disagrees with.

“What we're seeing today in the U.S. is increasingly fascist. MAGA, I believe — and I study fascism, I don't say this lightly — is a fascist movement,” says Bray, referring to Trump's political movement.

President Trump signed an executive order designating antifa as a terrorist organization, but Bray stresses there is no such organization; anti-fascism is a loose political movement or ideology akin to feminism, but Trump is using the label to “demonize resistance” to his policies.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: We begin today's show with the war on antifa that the Trump administration has ratcheted up in the aftermath of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk being assassinated last month. Yesterday, President Trump posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Charlie Kirk at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden.

Trump recently signed an executive order purporting to designate antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, even though it's not really an organization. Antifa is actually a shortening of the term “anti-fascist” and is a term that arose in Europe for the movement against the Nazis, both before and after World War II. The decentralized movement in the U.S. today draws on this history.

Several high-level Republicans have accused this Saturday's “No Kings Day” protests of being organized by antifa. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said last week the administration will take the, quote, “same approach” to antifa as it has to drug cartels it's bombed in the Caribbean. This is Bondi on Fox News last night.

ATTORNEY GENERAL PAM BONDI: That's one of the things about antifa. You've heard President Trump say multiple times they are organized, they are a criminal organization. And they're very organized. You're seeing people out there with thousands of signs that all match, pre-bought, pre-put together. They're organized, and someone is funding it.

AMY GOODMAN: This comes as Los Angeles County officials voted Tuesday to declare a state of emergency over ongoing federal immigration raids they say have, quote, “caused widespread fear,” unquote.

Violent attacks by federal agents at protests against immigrant raids have also been documented in Chicago and Portland. On Tuesday, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson [was asked] if he would call for more oversight of federal agents. He responded by complaining about a naked bike ride protest against ICE in Portland, Oregon, which Trump has called a war zone.

SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON: To demand oversight on federal law enforcement? I've not seen them cross the line yet, and that we have committees of jurisdiction who have that responsibility, but it's not risen to that level. What I've seen is the abuse of law enforcement by radical leftist activists. You know, most recently, the most threatening thing I've seen yet was the naked bicyclers in Portland who were protesting ICE down there. I mean, it's getting really ugly.

AMY GOODMAN: Experts are increasingly raising concerns the Trump administration's attacks on antifa are ungrounded in fact and law, and violate free speech rights.

For more, we're joined by someone who knows a lot about all of this. Mark Bray is a Rutgers University history professor, author of the 2017 book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook. Last week, he was forced to leave his home in New Jersey and move to Spain with his family after receiving death threats following Trump's push to categorize the anti-fascist movement as a domestic terrorist organization. Charlie Kirk's group, Turning Point USA, had also circulated a petition labeling him “Dr. Antifa” and calling for him to be fired.

In a remarkable development, Bray was at first blocked from flying out of the United States last week. He wrote on Bluesky, “Someone canceled my family's flight out of the country at the last second. We got our boarding passes. We checked our bags. Went through security. Then at our gate our reservation ‘disappeared.'” They later took another flight, and professor Mark Bray joins us now from Spain.

Thanks so much for being with us. I'm sorry you've gone through all this, Professor Bray. If you can start off by talking about why you left the country and what happened, as we try to follow what was happening to you at the airport?

MARK BRAY: Right. So, I published this book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, in 2017. I'm actually researching different historical topics now. But after Trump's executive order, a series of far-right trolls, online influencers started attacking me. I received a number of death threats. Someone published my home address on X. So I started to fear for the safety of my family staying in our home. More and more death threats came in, and I knew I needed to get away. Getting to another country, getting across the ocean would make us feel much more comfortable.

As you said, our first flight was mysteriously canceled at the last moment. My two small children were sobbing. We had to regroup. The next day, as you said — 

AMY GOODMAN: I want to ask: When you — 

MARK BRAY: — I told — yeah.

AMY GOODMAN: I just want to ask: When say your flight was canceled, you went to — what was it? Newark Airport? Or Kennedy?

MARK BRAY: Yes, Newark.

AMY GOODMAN: And you got — and you got your boarding passes, and you went through security. So you were all set. And you got —

MARK BRAY: Yes.

AMY GOODMAN: — to the gate. And what did they tell you?

MARK BRAY: Right. Well, there was an error. They had us step to the side to talk to the United worker at the desk. There were a series of phone calls and mumbling. And they basically said, at the last moment, someone had canceled our reservation — not the whole flight, just for the four of us, for me, my wife and our two small children. And this is around the same time that Andy Ngo and Jack Posobiec, two of the far-right provocateurs who had been harassing me online, were meeting in the White House with President Trump to discuss antifa. I just can't believe it's a coincidence.

AMY GOODMAN: And yet, you were able to rebook the next day, and you made it through security, and you actually made it onto the flight?

MARK BRAY: Well, this time, I was stopped, searched and interrogated by federal agents for an hour. And at one point, they took me into a side room, and my two kids saw what looked like very bad men taking me in another room, and they started sobbing. So, it was quite an ordeal even the next day. But I made it out. And frankly, I'm very fearful about the potential of returning, but hopefully, by next year, things will improve.

AMY GOODMAN: I mean, this is astounding. You weren't trying to come into the United States. You were trying to leave. And you are an American citizen — not that that should have mattered.

MARK BRAY: And I'm not being charged with any crimes. If anything, I'm the victim of crimes. I wrote a book eight years ago. I consider myself politically an anti-fascist — I detest fascism — but I'm not a member of any antifa group. I'm a professor. I'm a dad. I'm just trying to live my life here. But, of course, because the far right is trying to create a bogeyman term in “antifa” to equate protests with terrorism, I got caught up in the middle of this.

AMY GOODMAN: So, you are the author, Professor Bray, of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook. If you can explain what antifa is and what it means for President Trump to have issued this executive order calling it a terrorist — domestic terrorist organization? Is it even an organization? Talk about antifa now and through history.

MARK BRAY: Right. So, as you said, it's a term that is short for “anti-fascist” or “anti-fascism.” It's originally German from the era of opposition to Hitler. After World War II, anti-fascism continued throughout the world, and the specific European tradition of what they called antifa spread to other countries around the world. For example, in the U.S., you had Anti-Racist Action in the '80s and '90s, which was a network of decentralized groups across the continent organizing against the far right.

The term “antifa” really kind of made its appearance in the U.S. in the late 2000s, but it's not an organization. It's more of a politics or a movement. I liken it to feminism. Sometimes there are feminist groups, but feminism itself is not a group. There are antifa groups, but antifa itself is not a group. It's just sort of like more of a verb. It's a thing you do to organize against the far right in decentralized groups.

Trump, of course, doesn't care about any of that. It's a useful bogeyman term to demonize protest, demonize resistance, equate it with terrorism. And it's really, you know, an obvious page out of the textbooks about fascist and authoritarian leaders. It's so — it's such an obvious imitation of, you know, the kind of the Red Scare talk about communism, but applied to today.

AMY GOODMAN: It's very interesting you've moved to Spain. I mean, for years we've covered the Abraham Lincoln Brigadistas, Brigade, those Americans who went to Spain, where you are now, to fight against the fascist Franco. Many of them died. Many of them came back. And this was just before World War II. They were the most experienced, presumably, in fighting. But when a number of them signed up to fight in World War II, to fight Hitler, they were labeled “premature anti-fascists.” Can you talk about that? And they were not allowed to fight in World War II.

MARK BRAY: Right. So, there were a lot of activists and leftists in the U.S. and around the world who realized the threat of Hitler well before mainstream society. And a number of them journeyed over to Spain to fight in the international brigades. A significant number of them lost their lives. Some of them returned. They were blacklisted in the U.S.

And it is also worth pointing out that a number of Spanish Civil War veterans from other countries who ended up going to France after the Spanish Civil War played important roles in the French underground. And there was a tank battalion of Spanish anarchists that were among the first to liberate Paris in 1945. It's a fascinating history. It's the one that I — I teach a course on the Spanish Civil War.

So, it is strange to sort of have these things twisted around. And I ended up going to Spain because I'm a historian of Spain. But I've received a lot of solidarity and support from the social movements here. And actually, there's a general strike today in Spain for Palestine, as well — just to throw into your news report.

AMY GOODMAN: We had you on last in 2017 to discuss your book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, when it first came out. In the introduction, you wrote you hoped your work would promote organizing against fascism and white supremacy. Can you elaborate?

MARK BRAY: Right. So, anti-fascism has a broad history. In the U.S., certainly, there's the European-inspired antifa tradition. There's also a really good book called The Black Antifascist Tradition that talks about the role of anti-fascism in Black liberation struggles, Black Panthers and so forth, which I suggest people check out. So, it takes many different forms.

What it has in common is actually this impulse towards unity and putting aside the differences that often divide the left, in the interest of promoting the common struggle against fascism, against white supremacy. And what we're seeing today in the U.S. is increasingly fascist. MAGA, I believe — and I study fascism, I don't say this lightly — is a fascist movement. And if we don't organize, if we don't take action in the streets, we're going to end up somewhere really bad.

And for me personally, I felt like my situation was such that I had to get my family out of harm's way. But this story about me is about me, but it's not really about me. It's about attacks on academic freedom, free speech, the right to protest. We're in a really dangerous situation. And so, everyone, in their own way, needs to take action to try and organize against this.

AMY GOODMAN: I mean, it's interesting. You remind me of Timothy Snyder, as well as Jason Stanley, the two Yale professors, who also left the country. They've gone to Canada to teach, both having written books against fascism and tyranny. I wanted to ask you about U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi's comments, saying the administration will take the, quote, “same approach” to antifa as it has to drug cartels it's bombed in the Caribbean. The latest bombing, I think, took place yesterday, killing a number of people. Even Republican politicians, behind closed doors, are saying, “Where is the evidence?” for who these people are, who have been killed by the U.S. bombs. Mark Bray, your response to Pam Bondi?

MARK BRAY: Right. Well, the paradox of fascism is that while it's trying to gain power, it talks about the need for law and order, and to the degree that it gains power, it tramples all over the law. It does not care about the law or legality, due process, civil liberties. And so, this kind of call to murder people in this country, without, of course, even having gone through any due process — not that I'm in favor of capital punishment anyway, but that's another story — it is this kind of example of calling for the strongman, in Trump, to use deadly force, without any evidence, against people accused of made-up crimes that are being equated with — you know, at times, some of the Trump administration people have compared it to — ISIS to antifa, right? So, to me, it's really this kind of fascist attack on civil liberties.

And if they're equating protesters with antifa, and they're saying that they're going to use the methods used for the people in the boats in the Caribbean on antifa, the implication is they are ready to kill American protesters. And, you know, we know the history of Kent State — right? — where students were gunned down in the '60s. It could happen again if we're not careful. So we really need to be very vigilant about this.

AMY GOODMAN: Do you think progressive groups, groups that care about democracy, free speech, across the political spectrum, are pushing back enough around the attack on anti-fascists?

MARK BRAY: Well, you know, I think there's always room for more action. And I think that my main takeaway for viewers today is that whether or not you consider yourself an anti-fascist, anyone who has any critiques of Trump is potentially in the crosshairs here, because there's a concerted project from the top to equate protest with terrorism and to say anyone who's not a Trump supporter is basically the equivalent of ISIS. You can't make this stuff up. It's absolutely ridiculous. They don't care at all about grounding in fact or information. It's something that plays to their base and justifies attempts to step beyond due process to use, apparently, lethal force against dissidents. This is terrifying. And so, everyone really needs to do what they can to sound the alarm.

AMY GOODMAN: Finally, I wanted to ask you about the Rutgers students calling for the university to support you, wanting Rutgers President William Tate to issue a statement, a, quote, “Resolution in Support of Professor Mark Bray's Academic Freedom and Free Expression.” This apparently is slated for consideration and vote Friday by the Rutgers University Senate. Your response, Professor Bray?

MARK BRAY: Well, I've received a tremendous amount of support from the Rutgers faculty, from the student body and from the administration. I support that call. I hope it passes. I would very much appreciate a statement of direct support from President Tate. But, you know, to his credit, he did issue a statement in support of the free speech and academic freedom of all Rutgers faculty, which did not mention me directly, but I think, implicitly, supported my right to do my scholarship in accord with my job. But, you know, again, the Rutgers community has been fantastic, and especially given attacks on higher education across the country, the way that some subjects have been, basically, straight-up banned in states like Florida, I'm happy to be a professor at Rutgers.

AMY GOODMAN: Mark Bray, Rutgers University history professor, author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook. He's just moved his family to Spain after receiving death threats following President Trump's push to categorize the anti-fascist movement as a domestic terrorist organization.

Coming up, we speak with a professor at Stanford University, professor emeritus, about what — the deal that was made in Sharm el-Sheikh, and also about his own niece, who had been held hostage by Hamas in Gaza for 54 days, her husband killed. This is Democracy Now! Back in 30 seconds.

“For Trump, the leader of Argentina is more important than American families struggling with rising costs,” said Warren.

Republican Sen. Tim Scott (South Carolina) blocked a bill seeking to stop President Donald Trump's unprecedented $20 billion bailout of Argentina and its far right government on Tuesday, with Democrats criticizing Republicans' priorities as Americans languish under GOP cuts to social programs.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) tried to pass the No Argentina Bailout Act on Tuesday afternoon via unanimous consent.

In a speech on the Senate floor, she sharply criticized the Trump administration for giving far right Argentinian President Javier Milei a massive handout while gutting health care benefits for millions of Americans, causing prices to soar due to tariffs, and firing thousands of Americans working in key government agencies.

“[Treasury] Secretary [Scott] Bessent seems to be saying that the American economy can tank, and Americans can pay higher prices, but there will be no end to using American taxpayer dollars to bail out Argentina,” said Warren. “For Trump, the leader of Argentina is more important than American families struggling with rising costs for health care.”

The bill was blocked by Scott, who defended the bailout as backing “an important ally in South America” — an ally that, as Democrats pointed out, has been undercutting the U.S. on soybean exports and harming American farmers. 

As Democrats pointed out, however, Trump and Republicans may have ulterior motives for the bailout. Popular Information reported last month that hedge fund manager Rob Citrone, a billionaire ally of Bessent, has significant investments in Argentina — and thus has a large financial stake in the success of the country's economy.

The Trump administration also has political motivations for supporting Milei, a libertarian Trump supporter whose austerity measures caused poverty to skyrocket to above 50 percent in Argentina in his first six months in office.

Warren pointed out that the bailout is seemingly timed with Argentinian midterm elections coming up on October 26 which may lose Milei a majority in the country's legislature. 

“With global investors pulling their money from the country, trying to get off his sinking ship, and destabilizing its financial markets, his party's electoral chances looked really slim. So, Trump is sending 20 billion U.S. taxpayer dollars to bail out Argentina and prop up Milei so he can stay in power,” she said. 

Democrats also lambasted Republicans for supporting the bailout at the outset of the third week of the government shutdown, which is keeping thousands of federal workers in limbo and suspending crucial services supported by American taxpayers.

“Trump refuses to negotiate to keep the government open or prevent a massive spike in health care costs for Americans, but he's eager to shell out $20 billion of taxpayer money to bail out his authoritarian buddy in Argentina,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland), a cosponsor of the bill, when Democrats introduced the legislation last week. 

“All the while, Americans are stuck facing higher prices at the grocery store and higher premiums on their health insurance. We must put a stop to Trump's brazen scheme to put himself and his cronies ahead of the needs of the American people,” Van Hollen said.

“It's day 13 of the shutdown. What's Trump doing? Negotiating a budget deal? No. Preventing premiums from doubling? No. Stopping 15 million Americans from losing health care? No,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), another bill cosponsor. “He's meeting the Pres. of Argentina to reward him with a $20 billion bailout.”

German authorities issue 204 charges against 21-year-old suspect, alleged to be part of wider network of abusers

A man accused of luring children worldwide into a sadistic online abuse network has been charged by German prosecutors with hundreds of crimes, including murder, for the livestreamed death of a 13-year-old American.

Using the pseudonym “White Tiger”, the 21-year-old man from Hamburg is alleged to have victimised more than 30 children with online sexual abuse, manipulation and exploitation as a part of a virtual network of abusers known as “764”.

He allegedly coerced a US boy, 13, into killing himself in 2022, which was broadcast via live stream.

Authorities said the crimes had occurred between January 2021, when the suspect was 16 years old, and September 2023.

Prosecutors in Hamburg announced 204 criminal charges against the German-Iranian man, including allegations of committing one murder and five attempted murders as an “indirect perpetrator”.

“White Tiger” would find vulnerable children and adolescents in online chats or games, develop a bond to groom them for abuse, then exploit them into producing sexual content and harming themselves on video, authorities said.

The man was arrested at his parents' home in June. Authorities said at the time they had identified eight victims of “White Tiger”, aged between 11 and 15 and from Germany, England, Canada and the US.

The case has prompted questions about whether German authorities could have acted sooner and prevented some of the abuse.

The Zeit newspaper reported that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the US had alerted German authorities in 2021 to an apparently Hamburg-based predator using the name “White Tiger”.

According to Zeit, NCMEC provided a roughly 40-page document containing chat transcripts from the online platform Discord in which “White Tiger” demanded photos from two young girls, urging them to harm themselves and suggesting they take their own lives.

Police questioned the suspect at the time, but he was not arrested until this year.

During the arrest, police also seized illegal weapons – knives, brass knuckles and a baton – as well as computers and hard drives, which were still being analysed, prosecutors said.

The Hamburg public prosecutor's office said the criminal proceedings would be held behind closed doors.

Remarking on the ongoing U.S.–China dispute over rare earth exports, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said during an Oct. 15 news conference that if Beijing refuses to act as a reliable trading partner, the United States and its allies may have no choice but to decouple.

While emphasizing that decoupling—severing trade ties entirely or nearly so—is not Washington's desired outcome, Bessent said it could become unavoidable given China's posture in the current standoff over rare earths supplies.

The campaign is part of a larger $3.2 million contract that also includes paying pastors to produce content.

A newly-created firm called Show Faith by Works is embarking on a “geofencing” campaign to target Christian churches and colleges across the American Southwest with pro-Israel advertisements. The pastors and congregations themselves are seemingly unaware of this campaign, and some have concerns with Israel's methods to target Christians.

According to the firm's filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), Show Faith by Works will “geofence the actual boundaries of every Major (sic) church in California, Arizona, Nevada, and Coloardo (sic) and all Christian Colleges during worship times” and then “track attendees and continue to target [them] with ads” on behalf of Israel. The geofencing campaign is part of a larger $3.2 million contract that also includes trying to hire celebrity spokespeople and paying pastors to produce content.

RS reached out to hundreds of churches in California, Arizona, Nevada, and Colorado that were listed as potential targets of the geofencing campaign. None that responded were aware of the campaign. “We were not aware of that, no — you are the first to bring that to our attention,” said the press office for Bethel Church in Redding, California.

The project manager of the operation, Chad Schnitger, explained in an email to RS that the ads may include “invitations for Christians to visit one of our upcoming Mobile Museum exhibits, or to go to our website to learn more about the program, or to visit Israel with your church.” The firm's pitch deck describes the ads as “pro-lsreal (sic) and anti-Palestinian.”

The “Mobile Museum” Schnitger is referring to is a mobile trailer coordinated by his firm that will visit Christian colleges and churches highlighting atrocities from the Hamas attack on October 7, as well as “footage of IDF explaining the difficulty of fighting bad guys in hostile territory with civilians.” Schnitger confirmed the firm currently has one mobile museum exhibit, and that it would be ready to start travelling to churches and colleges in about a month.

Geofencing has long been a way for corporations to capture audiences by using their location services. It allows corporations to market their products using the location of mobile devices, triggering texts, in-app notifications, or mobile ads when users enter a certain physical boundary.

In an interview with RS, Megan Iorio, Senior Counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, described geofencing as a “privacy nightmare.” Iorio explained that data brokers vacuum up data from various applications that use location services, and then will either sell that data to marketing firms or offer marketing tools themselves. Then, users with location services enabled might, for instance, see an H&M advertisement if they walk within a certain radius of an H&M store.

Schnitger said that media reports covering the geofencing campaign have been “sensationalized” and pointed out that it's a common marketing tool; “It is not sending information back to a foreign entity; it's a way to deliver ads … This is a 1-way ad push using marketing tools that have been in place for over 10 years.” Iorio explained that while it is commonplace, the technique is “incredibly invasive.”

“The fact it has become so common and that foreign governments are now using it for targeted, precise influence campaigns shows how much we need regulation to stamp down on the practice. Today, it's the Israeli government looking to curry favor among Christians, but tomorrow it could be a foreign adversary looking to foment discord in a specific US city, and that has broad national security implications.” she added.

Some members of the communities listed as potential targets of Israel's geofencing campaign share these concerns about Israel using this marketing technique.

Micah, a mechanical engineer in Colorado Springs, has been conducting outreach to pastors and local newspapers in order to raise awareness that seven local churches were listed in the document as targets of the geofencing campaign. Micah circulated a document outlining his concerns, which RS obtained a copy of.

“What jumps out immediately is how the entire document talks about Christians as targets to be manipulated. This isn't respectful outreach — it's warfare language,” he wrote.

One of Micah's main concerns is that the firm is paying pastors on behalf of Israel. Show Faith by Works' pitch deck includes a plan to give stipends for “individual guest pastors, bilingual pastors, or pastors who match target demographics to record messages based on content creation targets.” Micah says that this “creates financial conflicts of interest where religious leaders become financially dependent on foreign government messaging, compromising their independence and integrity.”

Asa, Micah's brother, attends Scottsdale Bible Church in Arizona, one of the churches listed by Show Faith by Works. Asa said that Show Faith by Works' campaign is a reaction to Israel losing the support of America's youth. “This entire project is an attempt to regain the attention and hearts/support of Gen Z through the use of religious manipulation,” he said. Micah and Asa requested that RS exclude their full names to discuss the matter freely.

Schnitger is optimistic about swaying Christians' views on Israel. “For those who dislike Israel, maybe some of these exhibits and materials will change your mind.” Part of that effort is to stress anti-Palestinian talking points. The firm's pitch deck includes talking points about how “[P]alestinian and Iranian goals are not land-focused, but genocidal.”

Timothy Feldman, a software engineer in Plano, Texas, explained in an email to RS that he was upset to see his church listed as a potential target for Israel's geofencing campaign. “I am disgusted that a genocidal apartheid state is attempting to whitewash its atrocities by propagandizing the good people of Christ United Methodist Church,” said Feldman.

Despite the inclusion of Texas churches like the one in Plano in the pitch deck, Schnitger clarified in an email that the firm is currently not doing anything in Texas.

A church worker in Prescott, Arizona, saw his church on the list too and explained to RS in a phone interview that it's unclear how the pastors will respond. “The demographics in Prescott tend to be pro-Israel, so it's hard to know how the church leadership will react to this. All we can do is make people aware of it,” he said, requesting anonymity to speak freely about the issue.

The geofencing campaign will be overseen by Eran Shayovich, the Chief of Staff at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel. Shayovich is spearheading an initiative called “project 545,” which he describes as a campaign to “amplify Israel's strategic communication and public diplomacy efforts.” Shayovich is also the point of contact for Brad Parscale, Trump's former campaign manager who is coordinating efforts to train ChatGPT on behalf of Israel and integrate pro-Israel messaging into conservative media.

Some states have taken action against geofencing as a practice. In June, Oregon passed a law that prohibits the sale of precise geolocation information, following a similar provision passed by Maryland last year.

Lina Khan's FTC banned several data brokers from collecting and selling data from sensitive locations such as churches and military installations. While these companies — including Gravy Analytics and Mobilewalla — have attracted significant media attention over the last several years, there is an extensive industry of data brokers that continue to operate in the shadows buying and selling location data at places of worship.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

                                                                                In his famous tragic play Romeo and Juliet, the English playwright William Shakespeare wrote, “What's in a name?” As it turns out, there is quite a lot in a name, particularly a surname, which is commonly known as a person's last name in Western societies. A surname is written after the first name, which is also referred to as a given name or, traditionally, a Christian name. A closer look at the history of surnames reveals some fascinating insights into their origins.
  It may come as a surprise to some that up until about 1,000 years ago, surnames were                                    



                                                                                Rehearsal time is over. The world's best and most ambitious young pianists have descended on Warsaw for the Frederic Chopin International Piano Competition — for some, a gateway to classical music glory. 
Fans from around the globe snapped up tickets as much as a year ago. The lucky ones attended the opening night concert on Oct. 3 and will follow along as the contest builds to a thrilling climax on Oct. 20.
Winning the Chopin International — held every five years in the 19th-century composer's homeland — can raise the curtain to playing at venues across the globe and signing contracts                                    



                                                                                Continued from yesterday（延續自昨日）
https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang
While many early surnames in England were strongly influenced by the work people did, like Carpenter or Plumber, jobs were not the only factor. Physical characteristics, personal nicknames, geographical locations and even parents' first names also played a role.
  It's not hard to imagine how the color of a person's hair could have led to a surname like “Redhead” or “White,” while a darker complexion might have resulted in the last name “Black.” Meanwhile, someone known as a quick runner might have earned the surname “Swift,” while a clever or cunning individual could have been called “Fox”

Cancellations represent escalating government-wide campaign to suppress criticism of rightwing influencer

Civil liberties advocates are warning that the Trump administration's decision to strip visas from at least six foreign nationals over social media posts about Charlie Kirk's killing represents yet another example of dangerous government crackdowns on protected speech.

On Tuesday, the state department announced it was systematically identifying visa holders who “celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk”, declaring in a social media statement that “the United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans”.

The visa cancellations represent an escalating government-wide campaign to suppress criticism of Kirk, who was killed last month. The administration cut visas for nationals from Argentina, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, Germany and Paraguay.

“You can't defend ‘our culture' by eroding the very cornerstone of what America stands for: freedom of speech and thought,” Conor Fitzpatrick, an attorney at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (Fire) said in a statement to the Guardian. “The Trump administration must stop punishing people for their opinions alone.”

Visa revocations under these parameters “are censorship, plain and simple”, Carrie DeCell, Knight First Amendment Institute's senior staff attorney and legislative adviser, said in a press release.

“Mere ‘mockery' can't be grounds for adverse government action – whether revocation of broadcast licenses or revocation of visas,” DeCell said. “While the government can revoke visas for many reasons, the First Amendment forbids it from doing so based on viewpoint.”

The crackdown has ensnared foreign nationals for posts with minimal reach, raising questions about the extent of government surveillance of social media activity. Among those whose visas were revoked was a South African national whose commentary attracted just 2,344 views. The individual “mocked Americans grieving the loss of Kirk, saying ‘they're hurt that the racist rally ended in attempted martyrdom' and alleging ‘he was used to astroturf a movement of white nationalist trailer trash'”, according to the state department.

A German national also had their visa cancelled for a post written in German that translated to: “when fascists die, democrats don't complain.” The state department characterized this as celebrating Kirk's death and attempting to justify his murder.

The Brazilian stripped of his US visa is Tiago Santineli, a far-left standup comedian and online influencer who published a series of inflammatory tweets about Charlie Kirk after his assassination.

In one 16 September post, cited by the state department on Monday, the 33-year-old comedian, who has more than 430,000 X followers, wrote: “Charlie Kirk was the reason for a Nazi demonstration where they marched in tribute to him. Good riddance!”

In a second part of the tweet, not cited by the state department, Santineli refers to the fatal shot to Kirk's neck, writing: “If only someone had given Hitler this kind of tracheostomy before he had reached power. It's too bad that Little Charlie Deep Throat was killed by another by another right-wing conservative, it takes a bit of the fun out of it, but it's still worth it.”

The controversial Brasília-born comedian, who has nearly a million YouTube subscribers, published several other incendiary messages about Kirk's 10 September assassination. In one 18 September post, Santineli wrote beneath a photo of two well-known rightwing Brazilian politicians: “When are these [two] going to get the charlie kirk treatment?”

Santineli did not reply to a request for comment but writing on X on 1 October he said he had received an email from the US embassy revoking his visa. The Brazilian boasted that that made him “the world's first comedian to be banned from entering the US because of a joke”. “I can't go to the US,” Santineli wrote. “But the worst thing is that Charlie Kirk will never be able to leave hahahahahahahahaha.”

Another person singled out by the visa restrictions was Enrique “Kike” Gamarra, a veteran talkshow host who is often critical of Paraguay's conservative government. In a recent programme, Gamarra said that Kirk's killing “doesn't absolve the way he lived his life. Charlie Kirk was a son of a bitch and died according to his own rules.” Gamarra declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian.

Pro-government media in Paraguay celebrated the travel ban imposed on the broadcaster, which comes amid deepening ties between Trump's White House and Paraguay's president, Santiago Peña. 

The state department's actions draw on a vast surveillance apparatus established in 2019, when the department began requiring nearly all visa applicants worldwide to provide social media handles from platforms including Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn and Reddit used within the past five years.

The policy, adopted under Trump's first administration as part of “extreme vetting” measures, continued under Joe Biden, and expanded dramatically in March this year. A state department cable obtained by the Guardian at the time ordered consular offices to conduct comprehensive social media investigations of student visa applicants, with officers instructed to preserve screenshots of “potentially derogatory” content to create permanent records – even if posts were altered or deleted.

The March directive established sweeping new grounds for visa denials, writing that “evidence that an applicant advocates for terrorist activity, or otherwise demonstrates a degree of public approval or public advocacy for terrorist activity or a terrorist organization” could justify rejection.

It also mandated social media reviews of all students applying for visas, with fraud prevention units directed to flag and document content the administration deems threatening to national security.

The directive followed high-profile visa revocations and arrests targeting pro-Palestinian campus activism, signaling an aggressive expansion of how immigration enforcement could be wielded against political speech.

“The supreme court has been clear that noncitizens have a right to freedom of speech” Fitzpatrick said. “In America, no one should fear a midnight knock at the door because of their political views.”

            Syria's interim president, Ahmed Al-Sharaa, travelled to Moscow for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, the first face-to-face contact the pair have had.
    


            The meeting was especially notable considering Putin's long-standing backing of Al-Sharaa's predecessor, Bashar al-Assad, whose dictatorial regime was ousted by rebel forces in December.
    


            After the toppling of the Assad dynasty, the former Syrian leader fled to Russia, where he and his family were granted asylum for “humanitarian reasons,” an official source in Russia told CNN at the time.
    


            However, during his meeting with Al-Sharaa on Wednesday, Putin insisted that the two countries “have been exceptionally friendly” for more than 80 years, and that his country's relationship with Syria has “never been tied to our political circumstances.”
    


            “Throughout these decades, we have always been guided by one thing: the interests of the Syrian people,” he continued.
    


            The Russian leader called the overthrowing of the Assad regime a “great success and a step toward societal consolidation” and said that Syria's most recent parliamentary elections “will strengthen cooperation between all political forces” in the country, despite the “difficult times” it is facing.
    


            Earlier this year, hundreds of people were killed in days of violence in southern Syria, which began with clashes between members of the Druze minority group and Bedouin tribes and subsequently drew a military intervention.
    


            Israel also waded into the conflict, saying it wanted to protected the Druze and striking several government buildings in Damascus before a ceasefire was agreed upon.
    


            Al-Sharaa said Wednesday that his country was “re-establishing relations with all regional and global countries, and there are bilateral relations and common interests that connect us with Russia.”
    


            “We have close relations with Russia, and a large part of the energy sector in Syria depends on Russian expertise,” he said.
    


            Russia's deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, said later Wednesday that his country was ready to support Syria in its reconstruction after years of civil war.
    


            “Today, we discussed specific projects in energy, transport, tourism, healthcare, and cultural and humanitarian areas,” Novak told reporters.
    


            “All of this will be discussed in detail, and we are ready to provide support and participate in the reconstruction of Syria,” he said.

            An American tourist was fatally stabbed and another wounded during an attempted robbery early Wednesday in the coastal town of Cascais, west of Lisbon, according to authorities.
    


            The incident happened near the Church of the Navigators, with emergency services receiving an alert at around 3:16 a.m., CNN Portugal reported.
    


            Investigators say one of the tourists was returning to his hotel when three suspects confronted him and tried to rob him. The victim resisted, was punched, and attempted to flee while calling a friend for help. When the second tourist arrived at the scene, he was also assaulted.
    


            The attackers fatally stabbed one of the men and seriously injured the other before fleeing.
    


            The three suspects have been arrested and are now being questioned by police. One of the men faces a homicide charge, while the others are accused of taking part in the assault.
    


            The victim's death was first reported by Correio da Manhã and later confirmed by CNN Portugal.
    


            Emergency medical teams from the National Institute of Medical Emergency (INEM) attempted to resuscitate the man, but the stab wounds were deep and struck vital areas, authorities said.
    


            The second victim was taken to Santa Maria Hospital in Lisbon. Despite suffering deep cuts to his face and arms, he is no longer in critical condition, according to hospital officials.
    


            The State Department told CNN it is aware of reports of an attack on two US tourists in Cascais, and stands ready to provide consular assistance.

CAPSAT military unit commander Col. Michael Randrianirina says 'we will be sworn in soon,' during a press briefing.Brian Inganga/The Associated Press

Madagascar's new military ruler, Michael Randrianirina, said on Wednesday he would soon be sworn in as the country's president as the African Union suspended the island nation after a coup to oust President Andry Rajoelina. Rajoelina, who was impeached by lawmakers after fleeing abroad during the weekend, has condemned the takeover and refused to step down despite Gen Z demonstrations demanding his resignation and widespread defections in the security forces.

Randrianirina said earlier that the military had taken power and dissolved all institutions except the lower house of parliament, or National Assembly.

“We will be sworn in soon,” the army colonel told a press briefing on Wednesday, a day after the High Constitutional Court invited him to serve as president of the former French colony.

“We took responsibility yesterday.”

Two sources close to him earlier told Reuters he would be sworn in as president in the next day or two.

A spokesperson for the African Union told Reuters on Wednesday that the bloc had suspended Madagascar with immediate effect following the coup, without sharing further details. Suspension by the 55-member bloc carries political weight and could isolate the country's new leadership.

At a bloc meeting earlier on Wednesday, African Union Commission Chairperson Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said: “The rule of law must prevail over the rule of force. Our approach is grounded in law and dialogue.”

Randrianirina said on Tuesday that a committee led by the military would rule for up to two years alongside a transitional government before organizing new elections.

Randrianirina was a commander in the elite CAPSAT army unit that played a key role in the 2009 coup that brought Rajoelina to power but broke ranks with him last week, urging soldiers not to fire on protesters.

Rajoelina fled Madagascar on Sunday aboard a French military plane, security sources told Reuters. He has said his life was at risk and is now believed to be in Dubai, according to three diplomatic and opposition sources.

The 51-year-old former DJ rose to power in a coup in 2009 on the back of youth protests, becoming the world's youngest head of state at 34. But promises to improve living standards and eradicate corruption were never fulfilled.

Madagascar, where the average age is less than 20, has a population of about 30 million, three-quarters of whom live in poverty. Between its independence in 1960 and 2020, GDP per capita plunged 45%, according to the World Bank.

As well as the CAPSAT unit, the paramilitary gendarmerie and the police have also broken ranks with Rajoelina.

MOSCOW, October 15. /TASS/. Russia will use every instrument at its disposal to protect its citizens in Latvia, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said at a news briefing.

Latvia set October 13 as the deadline for a Latvian exam after which Riga will authorize the deportation of those Russians who do not speak fluent Latvian. There have been reports that as many as 841 Russian citizens have been deported for this reason. Moscow has stressed that it has developed measures to accommodate them back in their homeland.

"The Russian embassy in Riga will continue to provide as much assistance as possible to our stranded citizens. Our nationals targeted by such Nazism will be given support, and they are welcome everywhere across our Motherland," Zakharova assured reporters. "We will use absolutely all instruments that we have at our disposal to draw attention to this issue at specialized international venues," the diplomat added as she criticized this policy pursued by who she called Latvian xenophobes as Nazism.

MOSCOW, October 15. /TASS/. Moscow has always been guided by the Syrian people's interests in its relations with Damascus, Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with Syria's interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa.

"Russia has never treated Syria based on political circumstances or special interests. For all these decades, we have been guided solely by the interests of the Syrian people," Putin emphasized.

According to the Russian leader, Moscow has strong, genuine ties with the Syrian people. "Suffice it to say, hundreds and perhaps thousands of people are bound by friendships and marriages," Putin explained.

Hi, this is Kateryna Hodunova reporting from Kyiv on day 1,330 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story:

At least 1,076 Cuban nationals have fought or are fighting for Russia in Ukraine, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15.

Ninety-six are known to have died or gone missing in action.

The figures come after the U.S. earlier this month circulated an unclassified cable sharing details about Cuba's support for Russia's full-scale invasion, in which it claimed an "estimated 1,000 to 5,000 Cubans (are) fighting in Ukraine."

The information from HUR shared with the Kyiv Independent tallies with the lower end of the U.S. estimate, but also provides further insight into the recruitment process and training of Cuban nationals.

HUR claims they receive only two weeks of training at the Avangard training center in Moscow Oblast before being sent to the front line.

The information provided by HUR suggests that some Cuban nationals are tricked into travelling to Russia after being lured by the promise of lucrative construction work advertised on Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok.

Their travel is facilitated by "private intermediaries" who sometimes pay for flights, with Russian diplomatic institutions issuing tourist or work visas.

Denmark has pledged $171 million in military aid to Ukraine, while Sweden is considering the delivery of additional aircraft.

The $171 million aid will be used to support Ukraine's navy, repair tanks, and provide education and training for Ukrainian military personnel, according to a statement from the Danish Defense Ministry published on Oct. 15.

The package also includes initiatives targeting the maritime sector and armored vehicle maintenance. Funds are also allocated for fuel donations and support within rehabilitation zones, both implemented under NATO's auspices.

Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson, speaking ahead of the NATO defense ministers' meeting in Brussels on Oct. 15, said Sweden is prepared to expand its support through the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative and the aviation coalition.

According to Jonson, Stockholm aims to supply radar reconnaissance and early warning aircraft to Ukraine as an initial step, and will later consider the potential delivery of Swedish Gripen fighter jets.

The mayor of Dniproudne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Yevhenii Matvieiev, who was abducted by Russian military personnel, died in a Russian prison from multiple injuries, the Ukrainian media outlet Liga.net reported on Oct. 15, citing the Prosecutor General's Office.

According to the report, Matvieiev died on Sept. 7, 2024, while being held at Detention Center No. 3 in the city of Kizel, located in Russia's Perm Krai.

The cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma to the torso, resulting in multiple rib fractures and damage to the lungs and pleura, the Prosecutor General's Office said.

A pre-trial investigation is ongoing and is being led by Ukraine's Security Service (SBU).

Matvieiev was reportedly abducted at a checkpoint by Russian forces in 2022. His body was returned to Ukraine at the end of 2024 as part of a repatriation process.

Germany will provide Ukraine with an additional military aid package worth more than 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion), German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius announced on Oct. 15 during the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting in Brussels.

The package will include advanced air defense systems, precision-guided weapons, and ammunition.

"You can count on Germany. We will continue and expand our support for Ukraine. With new contracts, Germany will provide additional support amounting to over 2 billion euros," Pistorius said.

Germany will also deliver two additional IRIS-T air defense systems, accompanied by a large number of guided missiles and shoulder-fired air defense weapons. Anti-tank weapons, small arms, and secure communications systems are also expected to be part of the delivery.

Of the total amount, Germany will contribute $500 million to a NATO initiative supplying Ukraine with critically needed U.S.-made weapons, the alliance announced on Aug. 13.

The support will come through NATO's Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) mechanism, which coordinates funding for Kyiv's most urgent battlefield needs.

NATO should not overestimate Russia's capabilities, Secretary General Mark Rutte claimed on Oct. 15, attempting to subdue concerns about Moscow's hybrid activities targeting the alliance.

"Let's trust our military," Rutte said at a news conference after a meeting with NATO defense ministers in Brussels. "Let's not take the Russians too seriously."

Rutte underscored that NATO countries are "25 times bigger than Russia" in economic terms. Talking about the recent aerial incursions, the secretary general noted that it is difficult to establish whether they were intentional or not.

"We are so much stronger than the Russians that we don't need to shoot down their planes when they enter our airspace," he added.

A cyberattack carried out by Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) caused over 66 million rubles (approximately $800,000) in damages to Orion Telecom, one of the largest internet providers in Siberia, a HUR source told the Kyiv Independent.

The provider itself reported the losses in a complaint submitted to Russian police following the attack. The company also admitted that the cyber operation led to a leak of users' personal data.

"One of the largest Siberian Internet providers, Orion Telecom, was immediately impoverished by 66 million rubles as a result of a special operation by the HUR MO cyber corps," the source said.

As a result, Orion Telecom has requested Russian authorities to launch a criminal investigation into the incident. Under Russian law, the provider could face an additional fine of up to 15 million rubles for the data breach.

The delivery of Tomahawk long-range missiles will significantly enhance Ukraine's strike capabilities in its war against Russia, a senior NATO official said during a closed-door briefing with journalists on Oct. 15, according to European Pravda.

Despite Moscow's aggressive rhetoric, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, expressed doubt that Russia would take any concrete action in response to the potential deliveries.

According to the source, Russia is expected to maintain its current narrative, including continued nuclear sabre-rattling.

Russia struck a combined heat and power plant and launched three massive attacks on Ukraine's gas production infrastructure over the last week, Serhii Koretskyi, the CEO of Ukraine's state-owned oil and gas giant Naftogaz, said on Facebook on Oct. 15.

Russian missiles and drones damaged gas infrastructure in Kharkiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv oblasts while drones hit the plant, as Moscow steps up its attacks on Ukraine's energy facilities and temperatures drop.

The new wave of attacks comes days after Russian strikes on Oct. 3 and 5 wiped out around 60% of Ukraine's gas production."Russian terrorists are committing new acts of terrorism, aimed solely at depriving Ukraine of gas, heat, and light this winter," Koretskyi wrote, adding that the company will "restore everything." Ukraine is currently reaching out to partners for further air defense, energy equipment, and funding for gas imports. The embattled country needs at least 13.2 billion cubic meters in its gas storage facilities for the winter, and could seek imports from the U.S. and Norway.

President Volodymyr Zelensky appointed Serhii Lysak, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast governor, as the head of the newly formed Odesa Military Administration on Oct. 15, according to a decree published on the presidential website.

The move came a day after Zelensky stripped the tainted Odesa Mayor Trukhanov of Ukrainian citizenship, effectively pushing him out of office.

Ukraine's Security Service has confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that Zelensky revoked Ukrainian citizenship of Trukhanov, ballet dancer Serhii Polunin, and former Ukrainian politician Oleg Tsaryov.

All three were accused of having Russian citizenship.

Trukhanov denies the allegations and promised to challenge the decision in court.

The decision mandates the forced evacuation of families from 40 settlements across the area. In total, 601 children from 409 families are to be relocated to safer areas.

On Oct. 15, the military monitoring group DeepState reported that Russian forces had captured the village of Myrne in Kupiansk district and were advancing toward the nearby village of Ivanivka.

Kupiansk itself has become a focal point of Russia's renewed offensive in Kharkiv Oblast. Since Sept. 28, it has been closed to civilians due to ongoing combat operations and the threat of Russian sabotage groups.

"Over the past few weeks, the situation has worsened. The enemy has begun clearing operations, and our positions have gradually been lost. Some were simply destroyed by artillery and drones," DeepState wrote on Oct. 14.

Russian gains in the Kupiansk sector follow similar advances reported in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.

 The Kyiv Independent's Chris York sits down with U.S. defense expert Tom Karako to discuss how the potential provision of the Tomahawk — the U.S.'s most advanced cruise missile — to Ukraine could affect the course of Russia's war and Russian President Vladimir Putin's calculations.

Russian authorities had earlier declared a drone threat in the region and implemented emergency measures  at Ufa airport.



During their meeting, Putin lauded the "friendly" relationship between Syria and Russia, while al-Sharaa said Damascus would respect all previously concluded agreements.

Aid trucks rolled into Gaza on Wednesday and Israel resumed preparations to open the main Rafah crossing as Hamas handed over more bodies of dead hostages, following a dispute that had threatened the fragile ceasefire in the Palestinian enclave.

Israel had warned it could keep Rafah shut and reduce aid supplies because it said Hamas was returning bodies too slowly, showing the risks to a truce that has stopped two years of devastating warfare in Gaza and seen all living hostages held by Hamas freed. 

However, the militant group returned several Israeli bodies overnight and two more coffins later on Wednesday. An Israeli security official said preparations were under way to open Rafah to Gazan citizens, while a second official said that 600 aid trucks would go in.

Here's what you need to know about Gaza and the Israel-Hamas war, including the ceasefire deal, the toll of the war so far and what comes next.

Seeking to keep the pressure on Hamas, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would consider allowing Israeli forces to resume fighting in Gaza if Hamas fails to uphold its end of the ceasefire deal that he brokered.

“Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word. If Israel could go in and knock the crap of them, they'd do that,” Trump was quoted as saying to CNN in a brief telephone call when asked what would happen if Hamas refused to disarm.

Palestinians voiced ongoing struggles as they have 'no food, no housing' in Gaza City.

Reuters

Hamas returned four bodies confirmed as dead hostages on Monday and another four bodies late on Tuesday, though Israeli authorities said one of those bodies was not that of a hostage.

The Israeli military said it received two more coffins from the Red Cross at a meeting point in northern Gaza Strip late on Wednesday, and the bodies were being taken for forensic identification.

The dispute over the return of bodies still has the potential to upset the ceasefire deal along with other major issues that are yet to be resolved.

Israel has said that the next phase of the truce calls for Hamas to disarm and cede power, which it has so far refused to do. It has launched a security crackdown, parading its power in Gaza through public executions and clashes with local clans. 

Longer-term elements of the ceasefire plan, including how Gaza will be governed, the makeup of an international “stabilization force” and moves toward the creation of a Palestinian state have yet to emerge.

Israelis return to Oct. 7 sites, but some don't see long-lasting peace

A day after Trump warned Hamas that it must disarm or “we will disarm them,” he told reporters that the U.S. military would not be needed for the task.

The U.S. is looking to establish basic stabilization of the situation in Gaza and planning is under way for an international force to go into the enclave, said a senior U.S. adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Until the latest handover of two coffins, 21 bodies of hostages had remained in Gaza, though some may be hard to find or recover because of destruction during the conflict. An international task force is meant to find them.

“The resistance has abided by what was agreed upon and has handed over all the living captives it had, as well as the bodies it was able to retrieve,” Hamas' armed wing said. “As for the remaining bodies, locating and recovering them requires major efforts and special equipment, and we are exerting great effort to close this file.”

The deal also requires Israel to return the bodies of 360 Palestinians. The first group of 45 was handed over on Tuesday and the bodies were being identified, said Palestinian health authorities.

The war has caused a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, with nearly all inhabitants driven from their homes, a global hunger monitor confirming famine and health authorities overwhelmed.

“Our situation is utterly tragic. We went back to our homes in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood and found there are no homes at all. There is no shelter. Nothing,” said Moemen Hassanein in Gaza City, with tents and shanties behind him.

Reuters video showed trucks moving from the Egyptian side of the border into the Rafah crossing with Gaza at dawn on Wednesday, some carrying fuel and others loaded with pallets of aid.

However, it was not clear if that convoy would complete its crossing into Gaza as part of the 600 trucks that were due to enter the enclave on Wednesday – the daily number required under the ceasefire plan.

The Rafah crossing with Egypt is due to be open for people to cross on Thursday with a European Union mission deployed there, two sources said.

The Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said it was preparing to operate the crossing.

“Humanitarian aid continues to enter the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom Crossing and other crossings after Israeli security inspection,” the Israeli security official said.

The United Nations' top emergency relief co-ordinator, Tom Fletcher, told Reuters the 600 trucks approved to enter the territory was a “good base,” but not enough to meet the scale of need.

Underscoring the political challenges facing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, an opponent of the ceasefire plan, said on X that the aid delivery was a “disgrace” and accused Hamas of lies over the return of hostages' bodies.

Several other Palestinian militant factions in Gaza have backed a days-long Hamas security crackdown as it battles local clans. Hamas has executed several people that it accused of collaborating with Israel.

The U.S. military's Middle East command called on Hamas to “suspend violence and shooting at innocent Palestinian civilians” and to disarm “without delay.”

Trump this week endorsed Hamas' crackdown on gangs, while warning it would face air strikes if it did not later disarm.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the public executions after a video, authenticated by Reuters, showed masked gunmen shooting dead seven men in a Gaza street.

Israeli forces inside Gaza have pulled back to what the truce deal calls a yellow line just outside the main cities.

President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants dead hostages held in Gaza back and warns Hamas 'if they don't disarm, we will disarm them.'

LONDON — Sumo wrestlers participating in the Grand Sumo Tournament in London toured the city center on Tuesday, visiting famous landmarks.

The tournament will be held from Wednesday through Sunday.

The two yokozuna, Onosato and Hoshoryu, along with the other wrestlers, left their hotel by coach and got off in front of the London Eye ferris wheel. As they crossed Westminster Bridge over the River Thames, many of the wrestlers took commemorative photos with Elizabeth Tower, often called Big Ben, in the background.

Wherever they went, the wrestlers were greeted by tourists shouting, “Sumo wrestlers!” and they happily posed for photos. Surrounded by crowds, Onosato smiled and remarked, “This is quite something, isn't it?”

Hoshoryu bought a hot dog from a street stall, took a bite and declared with satisfaction, “It's delicious!”

They later visited Buckingham Palace and other sites, recharging their batteries through their London stroll ahead of the opening performance the following day.

CHISINAU, October 15. /TASS/. The government of Moldova wants to completely abolish the autonomy of Gagauzia, head of the Gagauz autonomy Evghenia Gutsul told TASS in an interview, whose text was handed over by her lawyers.

"Chisinau's ultimate goal is to completely abolish the autonomy. They want to turn us into an ordinary region, governed from the capital, and to deprive the Gagauz people of their special status, for which we fought for generations. But I want to assure you and all residents of Gagauzia: we will not let them to put their plans into practice," she said.

On August 5, 2025, Gutsul was sentenced to seven years in prison on charges of illegal financing of the opposition party Sor. Apart from that, she was banned from being a member of any political party for five years and fined $2.4 million, the amount she allegedly took to finance her campaign. Her defense challenged the court ruling.

The US State Department said on Tuesday that it has revoked the visas of several individuals who publicly celebrated the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Kirk, who co-founded Turning Point USA and rose to prominence by debating politics on college campuses, was killed by a sniper last month while speaking to students in Utah.

In a post on X on Tuesday – Kirk's birthday – the State Department said that the US “has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans.”

The department posted screenshots of messages and quotes it said were made by six people from Germany, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Paraguay, and South Africa.

An Argentinian national allegedly accused Kirk of spreading racist views and claimed he “deserved” to die, while a German national allegedly wrote, “when fascists die, democrats don't complain.” A person from Brazil was said to have written that Kirk “was the reason for a Nazi rally where they marched in homage to him” and had “died too late.”

An Argentine national said that Kirk “devoted his entire life spreading racist, xenophobic, misogynistic rhetoric” and deserves to burn in hell.Visa revoked. pic.twitter.com/4bQoXisHsz

The US State Department said the posts were “just a few examples of aliens who are no longer welcome in the US,” adding that it would continue to identify foreigners who celebrated Kirk's death.

A Mexican national said that Kirk “died being a racist, he died being a misogynist” and stated that “there are people who deserve to die. There are people who would make the world better off dead.”Visa revoked.

On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump posthumously awarded Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. Kirk's widow, Erika, received the medal on his behalf.

Dozens of people in the US have lost their jobs or been suspended for mocking or justifying Kirk's death. Although most Democrats condemned the killing, Trump and other Republicans have blamed the “radical left” for inciting political violence.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

AMOS YADLIN is Founder and President of MIND Israel. He is a retired Major General in the Israeli Air Force and served as the head of Israel's Defense Intelligence from 2006 to 2010.

AVNER GOLOV is Vice President of MIND Israel. From 2018 to 2023, he was a Senior Director on Israel's National Security Council.

 How the Country Can Bring Peace to the Middle East

 Amos Yadlin and Avner Golov

In his recent speeches in Egypt and Israel, U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly invoked the word “peace” when describing his vision for a new Middle East. He is right to do so. After decades of perpetual conflict, the region may be on the precipice of a genuinely stable future. As we argued in Foreign Affairs last December, Israel's battlefield achievements against Hamas and Hezbollah—together with the collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria—had created a rare opening for the Jewish state, the United States, and key Arab countries to forge a coalition capable of stabilizing the region and countering extremism. And developments since then have only made that vision more urgent and attainable.

Earlier this month, after two years of fighting, Hamas and Israel finally agreed to a U.S.-brokered cease-fire that could both end the war in Gaza and dismantle the terror organization. Israel and the United States have decimated Iran's network of proxies and struck the country's own nuclear and missile infrastructure, breaking the Islamic Republic's grip on much of the Middle East. As a result, these two regional spoilers are on the back foot. A better future, in other words, is very much within reach. Even Israeli politicians—foremost among them Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu—are speaking of peace again, after years in which that word had virtually disappeared from their lexicons.

That does not mean the path forward is obstacle-free. Israel is diplomatically isolated and extremely unpopular on Arab streets, in European squares, and on American campuses. Hamas is still the strongest political and military force in Gaza and has maintained support in the West Bank. Iran remains dangerous, even if it is weaker. And a radical Muslim Brotherhood, backed by Qatar and Turkey, is expanding its influence. Unlike in the past, these hurdles are all surmountable. But overcoming them will require a new regional coalition. This coalition will have to offer a moderate alternative to both the Iranian axis and Sunni jihadists. It will need to eventually expand into a broader Mediterranean partnership. And it must receive dedicated American backing.

Trump may have been disappointed not to receive the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. But in the eyes of most Israelis, he has earned it. The U.S. president imposed a cease-fire framework on Netanyahu, who had resisted popular demand for a deal that would have returned all hostages and ended the war. Trump did so while simultaneously getting Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey to exert heavy pressure on Hamas, which had also been reticent to sign such an agreement. It was a display of diplomatic finesse reminiscent of the shuttle diplomacy U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger deployed to end the Yom Kippur War in the 1970s.

The agreement Trump brokered is opaque. Many of its provisions remain undefined, and it appears that Washington offered bilateral assurances—perhaps even contradictory ones—to both parties. But this ambiguity is deliberate, designed to allow each side to declare victory. Israel's claim to victory centers on the return of all hostages, the military's dismantlement of Hamas as an organized force, and the creation of an international plan to eradicate its rule and disarm its militias. Israelis also get to maintain a security zone in Gaza until Hamas's disarmament is complete. Hamas, for its part, gets to declare that it withstood Israel's army for two years, forced its withdrawal from Gaza, secured the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners, put the Palestinian issue back on the global agenda, and extracted assurances that Israel will not resume the conflict.

The war in Gaza could reignite. Trump's 20-point peace plan unfolds in three stages, and only the first is underway and well defined with numerical parameters: the release of all Israeli hostages in exchange for the liberation of convicted Palestinian militants, coupled with the redeployment of Israeli forces outside central Gaza. Hamas will likely exploit areas of ambiguity even in this stage to slow the transition to the next phase, as recent delays in the return of hostages' bodies have demonstrated.

The second phase—disarming Hamas and establishing a new governing authority in Gaza with the participation of Arab and other international forces—will be far more difficult to implement. And should the parties fail to carry it out, Gaza could come to resemble Lebanon: formally ruled by a recognized government but effectively controlled by a militant organization. (Hezbollah has long dominated the Lebanese state.) In that case, Israel may once again find itself compelled to fight in Gaza wherever Hamas continues to operate.



Then there is the third phase. This stage calls for the creation of a pathway to Palestinian statehood and self-determination, conditioned on the full demilitarization of Gaza and sweeping reforms within the Palestinian Authority. It will be Israel's most significant contribution to the Trump plan, taking place after Hamas's dismantlement in the second phase. It will take far longer to see through, if it is even achievable.

Still, there is reason to be hopeful that this war, at least, is finished. Through a combination of pressure and inducements, Trump and his talented team have succeeded in forging an Arab-Palestinian front that supports the demilitarization of Hamas—an unprecedented achievement in a region where no actor has ever voluntarily surrendered its military capabilities.

The region's broader conflicts might also simmer down, thanks to the weakening of the Iranian regime. Israel's military campaign against Tehran severely damaged core components of its strategic apparatus, including its nuclear facilities, its missile systems, its air defenses, and, critically, its network of regional proxies. Israeli fighting in Lebanon, for instance, diminished the power of Hezbollah, which now faces mounting pressure from the United States and from Lebanon's government. The Yemeni Houthis continue to pose a threat to the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, but they are limited in their ability to hit Israel because of the country's excellent air and missile defense. The survival and broad recognition of Ahmed al-Shara's government in Syria further underscores Tehran's diminishing influence, especially given that Shara clearly wants to prevent Iranian meddling in the country. Meanwhile, the Iranian regime is struggling to keep its own country's economy running in the face of widespread sanctions. France, Germany, and the United Kingdom even recently reimposed the UN Security Council's sanctions, using the snapback provisions in the 2015 nuclear deal.

Still, the Iranian regime should never be underestimated, and it remains the Middle East's most patient and determined threat. Its leadership seeks revenge against Israel, and it will almost certainly study the war's lessons alongside its partners in Beijing, Moscow, and Pyongyang. Its nuclear infrastructure is bruised, but it has effectively dismantled the International Atomic Energy Agency's oversight of its nuclear program and still has several nuclear weapons' worth of enriched uranium on hand. It frequently threatens to alter its nuclear strategy and has hinted at leaving the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty or even obtaining a bomb. Iran is driven by a desire for vengeance against Israel and will use whatever weapons and cash it can scrounge up to proliferate and foster terrorism. It remains committed to perpetual conflict—which is why it is virtually the only government that did not welcome the end of the war in Gaza.

As it navigates a new future, Israel has a major advantage: its rock-solid relationship with Washington. For all the hand-wringing about the U.S.-Israeli alliance over the past two years, the two states coordinated more closely than ever after October 7, 2023. The results were excellent. The two countries' attacks on Iran's nuclear program, for instance, improved the United States' leverage in future negotiations without prompting escalation or regional warfare: all the predictions that U.S. attacks would provoke a regional war, close the Strait of Hormuz, prompt oil prices to skyrocket, and yield a wave of terror never materialized. Meanwhile, in Gaza, American diplomatic, financial, and military support allowed Israel to degrade Hamas and thus strike a deal to bring the hostages home. That doesn't mean the two sides were perfectly aligned; in private, U.S. officials pushed their Israeli counterparts to move toward peace, resulting in this month's agreement. Yet Washington showed that genuine influence over Israeli policy derives not from public reprimands or arms embargoes but from unwavering public support and closed-door pressure.

As a result, for the first time in the twenty-first century, the United States has reasserted its leadership role in the Middle East. It has achieved military success without the loss of a single American life and facilitated a peace that has been broadly welcomed across the region. Washington has demonstrated that sustained and strategic involvement in the Middle East can, in fact, reinforce the United States' position as a leading power—in contrast with its rivals. The region is not a quagmire of endless conflicts and financial burdens from which it must disengage.

But for Israel, relations with the United States are now the diplomatic exception. Almost everywhere else in the world, the country is facing a tsunami of condemnation. The harrowing images from Gaza have overshadowed the massacre of October 7. Distorted narratives—including claims that Israel deliberately starved civilians—were fueled by anti-Semitic networks and Hamas's global propaganda machine and compounded by Israel's own diplomatic shortcomings. This prompted recrimination from both the country's longtime critics and even some of its partners, including Germany and Italy. The consequences of all this anger are real. Arab governments, for example, have put a stop to their efforts at normalizing relations with Israel because they are fearful of antagonizing their constituents. Regional officials are also worried that Israel is aiming not just for security but for regional hegemony through military dominance and territorial expansion. But Netanyahu himself has said that Israel has no designs on Gaza, Lebanon, or Syria. The voices in his coalition who have called for annexing the West Bank face resistance from both the Israeli public and the Trump administration. Yet unfair as this reputation may be, Israel is nonetheless seen as a state whose conduct is fundamentally at odds with liberal values and as an unreliable regional interlocutor.

Israel is also staring down new regional competitors. Iran may be weakened, but Muslim Brotherhood–aligned governments in Qatar and Turkey have gained influence. Both states have leveraged their personal rapport with Trump to expand their regional influence, and both now coordinate closely with Washington on Syria, increasing their foothold there. Qatar has also extended its reach into Lebanon. After Israel's failed strike on Hamas leaders in Doha, Trump even compelled Netanyahu to apologize to Qatar. The White House then offered the country defense assurances that were reminiscent of NATO commitments.

Neither of these countries threatens Israel in the same way that Iran does—or to nearly the same extent. In fact, both played central roles in securing a cease-fire in Gaza, and they currently play a central role in keeping Iran weak. But they are not friendly to the Jewish state, either. Qatar, for example, continues to act as a patron of Hamas, and it amplifies anti-Israeli messaging via its Al Jazeera media network. Israel will thus need to carefully manage its relations with the two countries and push for a shift in their hostile policies, ideally in cooperation with Washington. Otherwise, they could fill the vacuum left by Tehran by propping up Sunni radicals from East Africa to the Middle East.

For Israel, diplomatic isolation, Iran, and Sunni extremism will cause continued headaches. Yet overall, the Middle East is becoming more favorable for Israeli interests. There is now a genuine opportunity to end hostilities between Israel and both Lebanon and Syria—and even to slowly normalize relations with both countries. There is also a chance to outright expand the Abraham Accords into the broader Muslim world. Indonesia—the world's largest Muslim-majority nation—represents a particularly significant opportunity. So does Somaliland, in the Horn of Africa, which seeks international recognition and occupies a strategically vital position in the struggle against the Houthis. If Azerbaijan, a long-standing Israeli partner, formally joins this regional force, it would strengthen its own relationship with the United States and reinforce stability across Central Asia. And a political change in Israel could further promote normalization discussions with Saudi Arabia and other Arab states.

Changes in geopolitics will also facilitate such talks. Today, countries across the world, including in the Middle East, are seeking more autonomy in their relationships, diversifying partnerships, and redefining their dependencies. They are more focused on acquiring advanced technology—which has become the currency of power—and maintaining stability. That means the Middle East's future will be shaped by actors who possess the military power to defend themselves and their allies without constant American intervention; the economic capability to rebuild and stabilize destroyed areas, and the technological excellence needed to link the region's economies to Asia and Europe—all while drawing on U.S. leadership when needed. And Israel, with its powerful military, strong tech industry, and ties to Washington, is the best partner most Arab states can find for running this gauntlet.

These countries can deepen their integration even without normalization. They could build a technological ecosystem that links the United States to the Gulf's infrastructure, its energy resources, and Israel's knowledge and innovation, for example, without doing so—and it would be far less politically sensitive. But either way, Arab governments will have to overcome their fears of angering their populations and plow ahead with regional integration.



Israel can simultaneously forge an even stronger relationship with Washington. The two countries should set up a new technological partnership, codified in a bilateral memorandum of understanding, predicated on equitable Israeli-American capital contributions across important tech sectors—including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, energy, and semiconductors. As part of this initiative, the United States should also extend defense assistance to Israel for the ensuing decade.

Most of all, the United States should help facilitate Israel's integration with its Arab neighbors. That means, most obviously, pushing for normalization. But it also means that Washington should ensure Israel's innovative tech ecosystem is connected to the Gulf's and invigorating the India­–Middle East–Europe Economic Corridor (better known as IMEC). To do so, Washington could name a czar specifically tasked with making this bloc of states more cohesive. The envoy would, in turn, help catalyze a technological ecosystem that bridges the Gulf's infrastructure with India's advanced services sector, both of which fit into the Trump administration's plans to turn the Middle East into the world's second most important tech hub, after the United States.

On the military front, the United States should set up a permanent security architecture that combines both Israeli and Gulf resources. It should establish a regional air defense apparatus controlled by the U.S. military's Central Command (popularly known as CENTCOM). But Washington should also establish a broader permanent joint command structure that oversees the region's maritime, cyber, and counterterrorism operations. This structure can feature Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and even Qatar—if it recalibrates its policies.

To further their cooperation, Israel, the United States, and the Arab states should expand their regional coalition into a broader Mediterranean partnership—a kind of pax Mediterranea—that promotes stability, prosperity, and technological progress across all its members. Israel and the United States should do so by convening a leadership summit featuring Arab partners as well as Cyprus, Greece, and Italy (with planned expansions to Azerbaijan, Germany, and India). There, these countries would collectively invest in joint defense procurement and military logistics; technology and energy, with a priority on innovations that can mitigate the effects of climate change and reduce food and water insecurity; and a joint financial institution. They would also figure out ways to support regional reconstruction and plan for how to respond to the many natural disasters that can afflict their shared region. The United States can invite Qatar and Turkey to participate in the coalition if they end their anti-Israeli policies, cease financing Hamas and other terrorist groups, and generally stop spewing propaganda.

A U.S.-backed Arab-Israeli coalition has long been the most viable path toward a stable Middle East. And today, it is more achievable than ever. The challenges—regional mistrust, a resurgent Muslim Brotherhood, and an Iran and a Hamas that are itching to act as spoilers—are real. But if the United States channels its renewed assertiveness and if local actors can align their power with purpose, the Middle East may finally move from perpetual crisis management into a sustainable order.

To achieve this vision, Washington and its regional partners do not need to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But they can certainly try to shift its trajectory in a more hopeful direction. To do so, these actors will need to embrace Trump's framework for a peace committee, which conditions any Israeli concessions on genuine Palestinian reform. The Palestinian Authority (or any other Palestinian government) will need to dismantle terror networks and end Palestinian incitement in schools, religious institutions, and the international arena. Israel will need to receive the remaining hostages' bodies and retain its security primacy in Gaza in order to prevent Hamas's resurgence and ensure that whatever administration follows is effective, made up of both Palestinians and international technocrats.

But regional integration cannot hinge on the Palestinian issue. A veto from Ramallah would almost assuredly doom the rest of this project—and, with it, the region's chance at long-term stability. It is instead time to prioritize peace through strength in its truest sense: not as a slogan, but as a strategy anchored in shared interests, credible deterrence, and the conviction that stability is best secured by those prepared to defend it.

Federal authorities have seized $15 billion in bitcoin from Chen Zhi, a Chinese-Cambodian kingpin accused of running a sprawling scam enterprise that relies on human trafficking and slavery, the U.S. Department of Justice announced on Tuesday.

The asset seizure is part of a broader criminal investigation into Chen and his conglomerate, Prince Group, a Cambodia-based business empire that prosecutors said masked one of Asia's largest transnational fraud and human trafficking networks.

Jon Fetherston, a former Massachusetts migrant shelter director, revealed that he was grabbed and attacked by an immigrant after Fetherston and a state official confronted him about raping and impregnating his own daughter.

A former Massachusetts shelter director-turned-whistleblower is calling the sentencing of yet another illegal alien for raping a child at a taxpayer-funded shelter further evidence of a "total government failure" in the sanctuary state.

Haitian illegal alien Cory Alvarez, 27, was found guilty of aggravated rape of a child at a migrant shelter in Rockland, Massachusetts, and sentenced to 10 to 12 years in prison, according to NBC 10 Boston.

Alvarez was arrested by Rockland police in 2024 on suspicion of sexual assault on a 15-year-old female victim. Both Alvarez and the victim were living at a state-run shelter at a Comfort Inn.

Alvarez was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in August. According to the agency, he entered the country lawfully in 2023 but violated the terms of his admittance, meaning he was present in the country illegally.

In response, Fetherston, who ran a similar migrant shelter in Marlborough, Massachusetts, from 2023 to 2024, said Alvarez's sentencing "exposes a much bigger problem."

"Call it what you will, but this is total government failure," he said. "You have documented cases now of these girls being assaulted in shelters run with taxpayer dollars. No one at the top, including Governor Maura Healey, is taking any of the responsibility."

Fetherston has previously blown the whistle on "rampant" sexual abuse of children taking place in the Massachusetts-run shelter system.

Speaking with Fox News Digital in February, he detailed the case of another Haitian illegal alien, Ronald Joseph, who raped and impregnated his own 14-year-old daughter at the Marlborough shelter. Fetherston said that when he and the authorities confronted Joseph about the rape, he became agitated and threatened him. Despite the gravity of the crime, Fetherston said he was instructed to order Joseph a ride to another state-run shelter.

Joseph was not arrested until months later. He has since been sentenced to 12 to 15 years in prison for aggravated rape of a child.

Fetherston said that these two cases are not isolated but rather part of a larger disturbing pattern of child sexual abuse that has largely gone unpunished.

"The state didn't protect these children, and when you don't protect children, you have no moral authority to run these programs," he said, adding, "If you're not going to protect children, you shouldn't be in office."

Earlier this year, a Healey spokesperson told the Boston Herald that the governor "inherited a disaster of a shelter system" and that Healey "is the one who took action to implement a length of stay limit, mandate criminal background checks, require residents to prove Massachusetts residency and lawful immigration status, and get families out of hotels." 

Fetherston said that despite claims that shelter residents had all been vetted through criminal background checks, "not a single one of these people was vetted" and "nobody knows who they are."

"The governor opened up the doors wide open and didn't vet anybody, and that is on her," he said.

He also noted that "98 percent of the people that I was dealing with were really good people and they were just here to make a better life for themselves. But the 2% that weren't were some of the worst people I have ever seen."

He emphasized that "all of these shelters are paid for with taxpayer dollars."

"The taxpayers need to realize that essentially, and horribly, you're funding these rapes and assaults of little girls," he said, adding, "Nobody wants that."

In August, Healey ordered the closure of the state's shelter system and made some of the residents eligible to receive at least $30,000 in state housing assistance over a two-year period.

Since then, Fetherston said that local police have told him there has been an uptick in auto accidents. He also said that school districts, especially in small-town communities, have been overwhelmed by the influx of foreign students.

"Where do you pull the money from? Do you pull money from police? Do you pull the money from fire? Do you not fix the roads that year? Because you do have to educate these children. So, I mean it has devastating effects on small communities."

Fox News Digital previously reported that Alvarez arrived in June under the parole process for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans (CHNV) instituted by the Biden administration. The policy was first announced for Venezuelans in October 2022, which allowed a limited number to fly directly into the U.S. as long as they had not entered illegally, had a sponsor in the U.S. already and passed certain checks.

Fox News Digital reached out to Healey's office for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani discusses President Donald Trump's peace deal in the Middle East and addresses his prior claims about having the Israeli prime minister arrested on 'The Story.'

New York City Democratic Socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani said the city should honor the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant issued for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he were to visit the city.

"I've said that this is a city that believes international law, and this is a city that wants to uplift and uphold those beliefs," Mamdani told Fox News' Martha MacCallum on "The Story" on Wednesday.

MacCallum then challenged Mamdani, saying, "The United States doesn't stand by the International Criminal Court."

Mamdani acknowledged that the U.S. has not signed the treaty for the International Criminal Court.MAMDANI STANDS BY PROMISE TO ARREST NETANYAHU IF HE COMES TO NEW YORK CITY

"The Criminal Court, however, has issued a warrant for the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu, as it has for Vladimir Putin," he continued. "I've said that I believe that we should uphold arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court and that we would… do so only in abiding with all of the laws in front of us."

Mamdani said he would not make a new law to ensure Netanyahu could be arrested.

MacCallum then asked Mamdani if he thinks NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch would allow him to arrest Netanyahu in the city.

Mamdani refused to answer the question, and when asked again, said: "I can tell you that I'm going to exhaust every legal option in front of me, not to make new laws to do so."

Netanyahu faces an ICC warrant tied to alleged war crimes in Gaza. The United States does not recognize the ICC.The mayoral hopeful also notably refused to give President Donald Trump any credit during the interview concerning the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas secured last week."To any extent, credit or not, I think it's too early to do so, too early to say," said Mamdani. "But if it but if it proves to be something that is lasting, something that is durable, then I think that that's where you give credit."ACTIVISTS SOUND ALARM ON 'DEEPLY TROUBLING' POLL SHOWING SUPPORT FOR MAMDANI'S ANTI-ISRAEL MESSAGING

Additionally, Mamdani did not respond to MacCallum's direct questioning on Hamas "lay[ing] down their arms" in Gaza.

"I don't really have opinions about the future of Hamas and Israel beyond the question of justice and safety and the fact that anything has to abide by international law, and that applies to Hamas, that applies to Israeli military, applies to anyone you could ask me about," Mamdani said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

Mamdani will debate Democrat Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa on Thursday night in the first head-to-head matchup of the campaign.

'Dancing with the Stars' contestants Brooks Nader and Gleb Savchenko tell Fox News Digital that they got ‘secret' matching tattoos together.

Brooks Nader stepped out in another head-turning look this week.

The 28-year-old model was photographed in New York City wearing a sheer black turtleneck top, tucked into a black mini skirt and worn with a black blazer over it, barely covering the adhesive silicone covers on her chest.

She accessorized the look with chunky gold earrings, a gold bracelet and sheer black tights. She opted for a more dramatic makeup look, with glossy red lipstick, a subtle smoky eye and bold lashes.

Nader was photographed alongside her sisters Sarah Jane and Grace Ann as they exited the "Sherri" talk show. Sarah Jane wore a black dress with a plunging neckline and a fuzzy burgundy coat, while Grace Ann paired gray dress pants with a black crop top.

The trio appeared on the talk show to promote their reality show, "Love Thy Nader," which follows their journey as sisters as they leave their home in Louisiana to pursue a career in fashion and media in New York.

Brooks' daring fashion choices have led to several wardrobe malfunctions, the most recent one taking place earlier this month during the Marquee Las Vegas grand reveal weekend at Marquee Nightclub.

While in the process of taking a video of herself dancing inside the event, Nader's low-cut dress slipped lower, briefly exposing her chest. She was at the event with her three sisters, this time including the third sister, Mary Holland.

In a recent interview with Maxim magazine, Nader discussed her upbringing in Baton Rouge, explaining she was raised in an "extremely Christian and extremely conservative" household, but said she always had dreams of moving to a big city.

"For the majority of our childhood, my dad was working for a non-profit, and my mom was at home with the babies," Nader said. "We didn't have a lot of money. We really just had each other and had to be self-entertaining. I wouldn't trade that upbringing for the world."

"I always wanted to express myself and I wanted to look sexy," she added. "I fantasized about living in LA or New York, but it seemed worlds away. I also had to toe the line because of where I'm from."

She said her parents were "totally against" her decision to drop out of school and move to New York City to pursue modeling, telling her, "This is the dumbest thing you could ever do." Despite that, Nader found an agent and launched her career.

After her agents refused to help her land a spot within the pages of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, Nader took things into her own hands and attended an open casting call. Out of 10,000 girls, Nader became one of six women chosen to be included in the magazine, and was later voted Rookie of the Year.

"You can't wait for other people. It's all up to you," she said. "You have to put in the work, go do it and see the vision for yourself."

'Fox & Friends' co-hosts discuss a new report that an anti-Israeli protester on Columbia University's campus was in a group chat with a Hamas spokesperson.

Students for Justice in Palestine, the anti-Israel group with chapters across American college campuses, is calling for "death to all collaborators" in Gaza.

In a Sunday Instagram post, the group cited the death of journalist Saleh Al-Jafarawi, who was killed the same day during fighting between Hamas and the Doghmush clan, a Palestinian opposition group.

"Three days after the ceasefire deal announcement, journalist Saleh Al-Jafarawi was martyred by the Zionist-proxy Doghmush clan," SJP wrote in a tribute online. "Saleh's martyrdom is a testament to the fact that the fight against Zionism in all its manifestations — from the IOF to its collaborators — must continue," it wrote, using the acronym for "Israeli Occupation Forces."

"Death to the occupation. Death to Zionism. Death to all collaborators," the post concluded.

The group has organized protests across college campuses following Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.

With a truce in place between Hamas and Israel following two years of fighting, the terror group has cracked down on its rivals.

Videos circulating on social media appear to show the executions, which an Israeli military official told Fox News Digital are "Hamas's deliberate attempt to show the killing publicly and reestablish its rule by terrorizing civilians."

President Donald Trump and FBI Director Kash Patel share results from Operation Summer Heat, an initiative focused on violent crime. 

President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced federal law enforcement will next set its eyes on San Francisco, commending the FBI's more than 23,000 violent criminal arrests, which he said is more than double the number arrested in the final year of the Biden administration.

During an Oval Office news conference at the White House, Trump said the FBI has "destroyed or severely disrupted" more than 170 organized criminal enterprises and gangs, 1,600 of the most violent gangs, and confiscated more than 6,000 illegal firearms since he was sworn in.

He added he wants to make every city safe, and his focus has turned to San Francisco.

"These are great cities that could be fixed," the president said. "I'm going to be strongly recommending … [we] start looking at San Francisco. I think we can make San Francisco one of our great cities. … It's a mess, and we have great support in San Francisco. … Every American deserves to live in a community where they're not afraid of being mugged, murdered, robbed, raped, assaulted, or shot."

TRUMP'S DC CRIME OPERATION ‘PUTS SAFETY OF FAMILIES FIRST' AS ARRESTS SURGE PAST 1,800: FBI DIRECTOR

During the news conference, FBI Director Kash Patel announced "Operation Summer Heat," which the FBI created to target violent criminals, yielded 8,700 arrests of violent offenders in three months.

More than 2,200 guns and 421 kilograms of fentanyl seized during the operation—enough fentanyl to kill 55 million Americans, according to Patel.

TRUMP'S DC CRIME SUCCESS PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON CHICAGO'S DEADLY 'WAR ZONE'

To date, he said the FBI has seized 1900 kilograms of fentanyl—enough lethal doses to kill 127 million Americans alone to date.

"If you look at the past four years of the Biden administration, [there were] 16,000, 17,000, 15,000, 15,000 … arrests year over year of violent felons in this country," Patel said. "You have 28,600 arrests of violent felons in just seven months alone because of your leadership and the dedication of the men and women at the FBI who want to go out there and do the job they were prevented from doing. … This number is historic by every metric."

Patel also highlighted the FBI's efforts to find missing children, claiming 5,400 were located since January.

"That is a 30% increase year to date over the last administration," he said. "Violent crimes against children arrests alone are up 10% [and] gang arrests are up 210% in the last seven months alone. … Mr. President, you said we have to go after the worst of the worst. … This is just the beginning."

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin discusses deploying the National Guard in U.S. cities on ‘America Reports.'

An alleged Chicago gang leader living in the United States illegally and accused of soliciting the murder of a high-ranking U.S. Border Patrol commander has been indicted by a federal grand jury.

Juan Espinoza Martinez, 37, is charged with a single count of murder for hire over an alleged bounty placed on U.S. Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino, the commander at large.

The indictment states that Martinez, a Mexican citizen, "knowingly used a facility of interstate commerce, namely, an Apple Model 16 cellular telephone... and Snapchat, with intent that a murder be committed."

He was arrested this week and remains in federal custody.

According to a criminal complaint, Martinez is a ranking member of the Latin Kings, a gang notorious for violent crimes and drug trafficking across Chicago and other cities. DHS said Martinez is from Mexico and entered the U.S. illegally at an unknown date and time.

He allegedly sent messages via Snapchat that read, "2k on information when you get him" and "10k if you take him down," the complaint states.

In the exchange, Martinez used the handle "monkeys---" and the name "Juan," federal prosecutors said. The message included a photo of a senior Border Patrol officer involved in immigration enforcement operations in Chicago as part of U.S. Customs and Border Protection's "Operation Midway Blitz."

Martinez's lawyer, Jonathan Bedi, said last week that his client was a longtime Chicago resident and father of three who was innocent of the charge against him.

"Juan has resided in the United States for 30 years, and throughout his time in Chicago, he has had no prior criminal history or gang affiliation," Bedi said. "As a dedicated union member, Juan has consistently worked to provide for his family while contributing positively to the community; he even coaches his kids' sports teams."

"Juan is innocent of these charges. Juan, his family and supporters remain steadfast in their confidence in his innocence and his character as a hardworking, law-abiding member of society," he added.

Trump Organization Executive Vice President Eric Trump joins ‘The Story' to discuss the growing fentanyl threat, rising dangers for ICE agents and how President Donald Trump plans to combat drug cartels.

President Donald Trump is next looking "at land" in Latin America, after the U.S. military has conducted at least five fatal strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean since September. 

"We are certainly looking at land now because we've got the sea very well under control," Trump told reporters Wednesday. "We've had a couple of days where there isn't a boat to be found, and I view that as a good thing, not a bad thing." 

Trump said he wasn't interested in having the Coast Guard simply stop the alleged drugs boats because "we've been doing that for 30 years, and it has been totally ineffective."

"They have faster boats. Some of these boats are seriously, I mean, they're world class speedboats," Trump said. "But they're not faster than missiles. But we've been trying to do that for years." 

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital for more details on the nature of the land operations Trump is considering. 

Additionally, Trump confirmed that he authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, after the New York Times reported Wednesday he had approved the order. According to Trump, he did so because Venezuela has released prisoners into the U.S., and that drugs were coming into the U.S. from Venezuela via maritime channels. 

Trump declined to answer though when asked if the CIA had the authority to "take out" Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The Trump administration has said it does not recognize Maduro as a legitimate head of state, but a leader of a drug cartel.

"I don't want to answer a question like that," Trump said. "That's a ridiculous question for me to be given. Not really a ridiculous question, but wouldn't it be a ridiculous question for me to answer? But I think Venezuela is feeling heat." 

The Trump administration has adopted a hard-line approach to address the flow of drugs into the U.S., and designated drug cartel groups like Tren de Aragua, Sinaloa and others as foreign terrorist organizations in February.

Additionally, the White House sent lawmakers a memo Sept. 30 informing them that the U.S. is now participating in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug smugglers. 

However, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have voiced concerns over the legality of the strikes, and Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., filed a war powers resolution in September to bar U.S. forces from engaging in "hostilities" against certain non-state organizations.

Although the resolution failed in the Senate by a 51–48 margin Oct. 8, Republicans Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted alongside their Democratic counterparts for the resolution.

When asked about lawmakers' concerns about the legality of the strikes, Trump dismissed them and said that lawmakers were informed the vessels carried drugs. 

"But they are given information that they were loaded up with drugs," Trump said. "And that's the thing that matters. When they're loaded up with drugs, they're fair game. And every one of those ships were, and they're not ships, they're boats."

            The Supreme Court's conservative supermajority signaled deep skepticism Wednesday over the creation of a second majority Black district in Louisiana and appeared open to at least weakening the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 in a way that could limit minority representation in Congress.
    


            On one level, the case is about a single congressional district in Louisiana – drawn after the 2020 census to ensure African American voters could elect a candidate of their choice. More fundamentally, the case is about whether governments may actively address discrimination – current or historic – by taking an action that is intended to help racial minorities.
    


            It is also about whether the Supreme Court's conservative justices view the Voting Rights Act, a crowning achievement of the civil rights era, as good law.
    


            The court's decision will almost certainly have sweeping implications beyond the Pelican State. It could potentially reduce minority representation not only in Congress but also in state legislatures and school boards across the country. Depending on the scope of the court's ruling and its timing, it could also upend the 2026 midterms.
    


            Here's what to know from oral arguments:
    


            At issue is a protracted court case that started when Louisiana drew only one congressional district out of six with an opportunity to election a Black member of Congress, despite the fact that African Americans make up about a third of the state's population.
    


            A group of Black plaintiffs sued over that district, and a lower court found the maps likely violated the Voting Rights Act. When the state responded by drawing a second majority Black district, a group of White plaintiffs argued state lawmakers had impermissibly considered race in violation of the 14th and 15th Amendments.
    


            Almost immediately, Justice Brett Kavanaugh – a member of the court's conservative wing – affirmed predictions that he would be the most important person to watch in the case. And over the course of more than two hours, Kavanaugh remained a driving force in the discussion.
    


            Just two years ago, Kavanaugh was the deciding vote to uphold the current approach to the Voting Rights Act in a similar case involving Alabama's congressional districts. At the time, however, he raised concerns about race-based remedies – that is, using race as a factor to address discrimination – that were in place indefinitely. He repeated those concerns on Wednesday.

            “The issue, as you know, is that this court's cases in a variety of contexts have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period time – sometimes for a long period of time, decades in some cases – but that they should not be indefinite and should have an end point,” Kavanaugh told the attorney representing a group of Black voters who successfully challenged Louisiana's first map.
    


Chief Justice John Roberts, another important vote, also quickly tried to draw a distinction between the Louisiana case and the court's surprising decision two years ago to order Alabama to redraw its map.
    


            Roberts, who previously called Louisiana's district a “snake,” seemed to subtly question the idea that the Alabama decision should control the outcome in Louisiana.
    


            That case, Roberts said, took the “existing precedent as a given” and considered “Alabama's particular challenge.”
    


            The exchange prompted Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson to jump in and say that also at issue in the Alabama case was whether to change the way courts look at the Voting Rights Act in redistricting.
    


            “And,” Jackson said, “we chose not to.”
    


            The parties pushing back on Louisiana's second Black congressional district brought slightly different legal arguments into the Supreme Court's ornate chamber on Wednesday. Louisiana, which initially defended the new map and now rejects it, wants a broad ruling that the Constitution bars states from ever considering race when fixing a violation of the Voting Rights Act.
    


            Such a ruling would gut the landmark 1965 law.
    


            But there appeared to be interest, including from Kavanaugh and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in taking a more nuanced approach.
    


            A proposal raised by the Trump administration would require plaintiffs alleging a Voting Rights Act violation to demonstrate that voters in a state cast a ballot differently based specifically on race – decoupled from their political affiliation. Under that approach, if Black voters in a district heavily favor Democrats and White voters heavily favor Republicans, a decision not to create a Black-majority district would be based on partisan rather than motivations.
    


            It is a point that Kavanaugh repeatedly pressed attorneys to address.
    


            “I would have thought that solves a lot of the concerns that you've identified,” Kavanaugh told Benjamin Anguiñaga, Louisiana's solicitor general.
    


            Anguiñaga described that idea as a “half solution.”
    


            But while perhaps less aggressive than gutting the law entirely, DOJ's proposal would likely make it much harder to prove violations of the law, critics say.
    


            “The bottom line,” liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said, is that approach would “just get rid of” the key provision of the Voting Rights Act.
    


            “The standard that you're setting,” she said, “is a much different one.”
    


            Throughout the hearing, the court's three liberals appeared distressed about by the prospect of their colleagues chipping away at the landmark civil rights law.
    


            They focused much of their fire on Congress' intent in enacting the Voting Rights Act: to root out discrimination that targeted African American voters. They questioned the Trump administration's approach, suggesting it would require plaintiffs to meet a much higher standard than is required by the law currently to find discriminatory maps.
    


            The liberals repeatedly tussled with attorneys representing Louisiana and the White voters challenging the state's decision to create a second majority-Black congressional district, with Sotomayor at one point pressing Anguiñaga on why the state's position had changed from what it was when the case was first heard by the justices earlier this year.
    


Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the opinion legalizing same-sex marriage. Here's why he says it won't be overturned



            At the time, Aguiñaga said politics – not race – had played the predominant role in drawing the map. The districts were designed, he said, to protect House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise.
    


            “Are you walking that back?” Sotomayor asked pointedly. “We always talk about what predominates and what predominated here was politics – that's what you said the last time.”
    


            On the other hand, Louisiana had always represented that it redrew its map because of a court order finding that it likely violated the Voting Rights Act.
    


            At another point, Justice Elena Kagan zeroed in on what the “results on the ground” would be if the Supreme Court struck down Section 2 of the law.
    


            The consequences, the lawyer representing Black voters in Louisiana told Kagan, “would be pretty catastrophic.”
    


            Janai Nelson, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, explained that the VRA had paved the way for the election of every Black representative the state has sent to Washington.
    


            “We only have the diversity that we see across the South, for example, because of litigation that forced the creation of opportunity districts under the Voting Rights Act,” she said.
    


            The Voting Rights Act fight involves what has become a familiar – and increasingly fought – debate over race in recent years: whether the Constitution is colorblind, or whether policies may try to make up for past racism.
    


            That complicated question is at the heart of much of Trump's rejection of diversity and inclusion programs, for instance, as well as efforts to reform police departments and the judicial system generally.
    


            It's also squarely at issue in the question over minority representation in Congress.
    


            And in recent years, the 6-3 conservative Supreme Court has come down hard on the side of colorblindness.
    


            Louisiana in its arguments drew a line directly to the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in 2023 gutting affirmative action admissions policies in the nation's colleges.
    


            “There is no safe harbor for racial discrimination the government deems good discrimination,” Louisiana told the Supreme Court in written arguments. “These violations of basic equal protection principles ended race-based admissions programs. They should also end race-based redistricting.”
    


            Voting rights groups counter that courts and Congress have explicitly carved out an exception for race-conscious remedies for “ongoing unlawful” discriminatory policies. And that, those groups said, is precisely what happened with Louisiana's first congressional map.
    


            “The ongoing pattern of racial discrimination in voting in the state makes Louisiana the prototypical case for the ongoing need” for Voting Rights Act enforcement, the NAACP and other groups told the Supreme Court, “not for abandoning it.”

Madagascar's military seized power from the civilian government Tuesday, a high-ranking commander announced after President Andry Rajoelina fled the sprawling Indian Ocean island country for his safety.

ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) — The leader of Madagascar's military coup told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he is “taking the position of president” and that the armed forces would be in charge of the African island nation for up to two years before any elections are held.

Col. Michael Randrianirina, who led the rebellion that ousted President Andry Rajoelina on Tuesday following weeks of youth-led protests, said in his first interview with a global news outlet since taking power that he expects to be sworn in as the country's new leader in the next few days.

“There must be an oath-taking” to make his position official, Randrianirina said at his unit's barracks while flanked by fellow officers. “We are staying here for at least 18 months, at most two years.”

Randrianirina announced Tuesday that the armed forces were taking power in Madagascar, a sprawling country of about 30 million people off of Africa's east coast that is the world's leading vanilla producer and is known for its unique biodiversity. Since gaining independence from France in 1960, it also has a history of coups and political crises.




The latest military takeover capped weeks of protests against Rajoelina and his government led by youth groups calling themselves “Gen Z Madagascar.” The protesters, who also included labor unions and civic groups, have demanded better government and job opportunities, echoing youth-led protests elsewhere in the world. Among other things, the Madagascar protesters have railed against chronic water and electricity outages, limited access to higher education, government corruption and poverty, which affects roughly three out of every four Madagascans, according to the World Bank.

Although some suggest the military seized power on the backs of the civilian protesters, demonstrators cheered Randrianirina and other soldiers from his elite CAPSAT unit as they triumphantly rode through the streets of the capital, Antananarivo, on Tuesday, with one protest leader telling the AP “the military is listening to us.”

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports the Madagascar coup leader tells the AP why he has taken power in the island nation.

The takeover was “an awakening of the people. It was launched by the youth. And the military supported us,” said the protest leader, Safika, who only gave one name as has been typical with the demonstrators. “We must always be wary, but the current state of affairs gives us reason to be confident.”

The protests reached a turning point Saturday when Randrianirina and soldiers from his unit sided with the demonstrators calling for the president to resign. Rajoelina said he fled to an undisclosed country because he feared for his life.

Randrianirina explained that he is taking over as Madagascar's head of state because the country's High Constitutional Court invited him to do so in the absence of Rajoelina. He previously said the military had acted on behalf of the people and cast the coup as a move to “restore” the country. 

“We had to take responsibility yesterday because there is nothing left in the country, no president, no president in the senate, no government,” Randrianirina said. The colonel said the military leadership was “accelerating” the appointment of a new prime minister “so that the crisis in the country does not last forever.” He didn't give an exact time frame for that to happen.

Rajoelina, who first came to power as a transitional leader in a 2009 military coup, was elected president in 2018 and reelected in 2023. He fired his government last month in an attempt to appease the protesters after a crackdown by security forces left 22 people dead and more than 100 injured, according to the United Nations. Rajoelina's government disputed those figures.

The exiled Rajoelina, 51, has rejected the military takeover's legitimacy.

But Randrianirina pushed back on that, telling the AP: “What is he saying is illegal? We have an order from the High Constitutional Court. We did not force the HCC or point a gun at it to issue this.”

Randrianirina's claim that his authority to take over as president came from the country's highest court seemed to contradict his announcement Tuesday that the military council that was taking power had suspended that court's powers. 

In a statement, Rajoelina's office claimed that some of the high court's judges had been threatened so they would sign off on the colonel's ascendency.

The African Union announced Wednesday that it had suspended Madagascar from its bodies with immediate effect “until constitutional order is restored in the country.” The group previously suspended several other member states after military coups, including Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea.

U.N. Secretary General António Guterres, meanwhile, is “deeply concerned by the unconstitutional change of power in Madagascar” and hopes all stakeholders there can “work together to reach a peaceful settlement to the ongoing crisis and its root causes,” his spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said in a statement, noting that the U.N. will continue to work to “restore peace and stability in the country.”

Some analysts have described Madagascar's youth movement as an expression of understandable grievances over government failures, and condemned the military takeover.

“Gen-Zers in Madagascar have been on the streets of the country protesting the lack of essential services, especially water and electricity, and the negative impact on their lives for almost a month,” said Olufemi Taiwo, professor of Africana studies at Cornell University. “This is a civil society uprising and its resolution should not involve the military.”

Turkey has been accused of deporting hundreds of peaceful Christians under the guise of "national security," including dozens last year, in a move legal advocates warn is an "attack" on the freedom of religion.

In a Monday address to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), legal expert for the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) International, Lidia Rieder, warned that Turkey is systematically targeting Christians purely "for practicing their faith."

"Turkey's labeling of peaceful Christian residents as ‘security threats' is a clear misuse of law and an attack on freedom of religion or belief," Rieder said during the OSCE Warsaw Human Dimension Conference. "When governments manipulate administrative or immigration systems to exclude people based solely on their faith, it undermines both the rule of law and the very principles of tolerance and peaceful coexistence that the OSCE was founded to protect."

TURKEY CONVERTS ANCIENT CHURCH INTO MOSQUE, SPARKING DEBATE ON HERITAGE PRESERVATION

Since 2020, more than 350 foreign Christian workers and their family members have been expelled from Turkey, including at least 35 cases between December 2024 and January 2025, reported the ADF. 

According to the international watchdog, Turkey's Ministry of Interior has assigned the individuals targeted by Ankara "security codes," like as N-82 and G-87, which effectively bars them from ever re-entering the country as it classifies them as a national security threat.  

Rieder also reminded the OSCE conference of the "landmark case" Wiest v. Turkey, which is currently before the European Court of Human Rights, and is "expected to set a crucial precedent for the protection of religious freedom in Europe and beyond."

Kenneth Wiest, a U.S. citizen and a Protestant, was born, raised and then resided legally in Turkey with his wife and three children for over 30 years before he was banned from the country in 2019 upon returning from a trip "without evidence of wrongdoing."

His case is just the latest in what is increasingly viewed as discriminatory policies that persecute religious minorities since President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan took office more than a decade ago.

TRUMP: ERDOGAN COULD BE ‘INFLUENTIAL' IN ENDING PUTIN'S WAR BY ENDING OIL SALES ‘IF HE WANTS'

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Rieder said that the Turkish delegation present at the OSCE conference "itself acknowledged that discrimination against Christians is on the rise across the OSCE region and beyond," which she said was "notable."

"While Turkey emphasized its commitment to promoting tolerance through international cooperation, the same principles must be upheld within its own borders," she said. "The reality on the ground remains deeply concerning for many individuals, families, and communities who continue to face restrictions on worship, deportations, and barriers to religious education. 

"Turkey's call to hear the voices of victims and to respect fundamental freedoms for all must now be translated into concrete action," Rieder added.

The Turkish embassy in D.C. did not directly respond to Fox News Digital's questions but pointed to a statement released on Wednesday by Ankara's office of Communications Center for Countering Disinformation, which denied the claims levied by ADF International and called them "completely unfounded and part of a deliberate disinformation campaign."

The office pointed to the history of Christian, Jewish and Muslim communities that have co-existed together and said Turkey is working to "protect" and "restore" places of worship.

"Respect for faiths and pluralism are indispensable elements of our country's democratic order," the statement read. "Turkey, like any other sovereign state, may make administrative decisions on foreign nationals for a variety of reasons, including visa violations, disturbance of public order, or a lack of legal permits."

The communications department said no visa-based decisions have been made based on "identity or affiliation."

The statement did not directly address the case involving Wiest.

"Freedom of religion cannot exist if believers live under threat of expulsion for practicing their faith," Rieder said. "The OSCE and its participating States have pledged to promote tolerance and non-discrimination. These commitments must be upheld not only in word, but in action." 

OSCE did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's questions about what steps it will take to address the growing concerns of religious persecution in Turkey.

California high schoolers stepped away from their volleyball team to file a lawsuit over the state's transgender athlete policies after spending the previous three years sharing a locker room with a biological male.

Jurupa Valley High School's girls' volleyball team in California has now seen at least 10 games on its 2025 schedule forfeited amid a national controversy involving one of its players, who is transgender. 

Los Osos High School forfeited a tournament game against Jurupa Valley on Saturday, while Patriot High School forfeited its Monday varsity match, marking its second forfeit to JVHS this season. Patriot High School previously forfeited a Sept. 26 match to Jurupa Valley. 

Maribel Munoz, the mother of Jurupa Valley player Alyssa McPherson, provided Fox News Digital a copy of a message sent by JVHS head coach Liana Manu, announcing that the varsity match against Patriot was forfeited. The JV and freshman games were still played.

A California school board president close to the situation also confirmed to Fox News Digital that the Patriot High School varsity team did not play its Monday game against Jurupa Valley while the JV and freshman teams did play.

Los Osos forfeited to Jurupa Valley after the two teams were matched up in the consolation round of a neutral tournament over the weekend. That game is currently logged as a forfeit on the high school sports tracking website MaxPreps. No official reason for the forfeits has been provided by the schools. 

Fox News Digital reached out to Jurupa Unified School District, which houses Jurupa Valley and Patriot High School, and the Chaffey Joint Union High School District, which houses Los Osos, for a response. 

"Patriot will be forfeiting varsity but lower levels will be playing. We already expected it," Manu's text message read. 

Patriot High School shares a league and school district with JVHS, and by forfeiting for the second time this season, it keeps Jurupa Valley a perfect 9-0 in league play and in first place going into the final game of the regular season. Jurupa Valley will face Norte Vista High School on Wednesday with a chance to clinch first place going into the playoffs. JVHS has already beaten Norte Vista 3-2 in their first meeting on Oct. 1. 

Meanwhile, Patriot High School and Los Osos join fellow southern California high school girls' volleyball teams at Riverside Poly, Orange Vista, Rim of The World, AB Miller, Yucaipa, Aquinas and San Dimas in refusing to face Jurupa Valley this season. No official reason for the forfeits has been provided by any of those schools. 

Two of Jurupa Valley's senior players, McPherson and Hadeel Hazameh, stepped away from the team this season in protest of trans teammate AB Hernandez. 

McPherson and Hazameh have also filed a lawsuit against the Jurupa Unified School District citing their experience playing and sharing a locker room with Hernandez the previous three seasons. McPherson's older sister and former JVHS girls' volleyball player Madison McPherson is the third plaintiff in that lawsuit.

Jurupa Valley is poised to play in the postseason, where forfeits may continue. Last season, a Christian high school girls' volleyball team in northern California, Stone Ridge Christian, forfeited a playoff game to San Francisco Waldorf, which had a trans athlete on its team.

Jurupa Valley won their league with Hernandez on its team in 2024, albeit with far less attention and controversy than this year. 

Hernandez then garnered national attention in the spring during a highly-publicized run to the state girls' track and field championships. The trans athlete took first place in the girls' high jump and triple jump after President Donald Trump sent a Truth Social post warning California not to allow a trans athlete to compete in the girls' events just days before the state meet on the last day of May.

Amid Trump's warning and national and local backlash, the state's high school sports league, the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) changed its rules to award any female athlete who competed in the same events to Hernandez a spot in the competition or one spot higher on the medal podium if they finished behind a biological male athlete. 

The rule change resulted in Hernandez sharing podium spots with female athletes who finished behind the trans athlete in the state finals. Hernandez also finished in second place in the long jump.

The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the CIF and California Department of Education a month later in July for refusing to change its transgender policies to comply with Trump's "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" executive order. 

California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office previously provided a statement to Fox News Digital, deferring responsibility for the situation to the CIF, CDE and state legislature. 

"CIF is an independent nonprofit that governs high school sports. The California Department of Education is a separate constitutional office. Neither is under the Governor's authority. CIF and the CDE have stated they follow existing state law — a law that was passed in 2013 and signed by Governor Jerry Brown (not Newsom) and in line with 21 other states. For the law to change, the legislature would need to send the Governor a bill. They have not," the statement read.

On April 1, the California state legislature blocked two bills that would reverse the current law which allows males in girls' sports. Every Democrat voted against it, with Assembly member Rick Chavez Zbur arguing that one of the bills "is really reminiscent to me of what happened in Nazi Germany in the 1930s. We are moving towards autocracy in this country. In Nazi Germany, transgender people were persecuted, barred from public life." 

Zbur said this while in the presence of a descendant of a Holocaust survivor, who had to excuse herself from the chamber, according to GOP Assembly member Kate Sanchez. 

"She stood up and left because she was just so disgusted with the comparison," Sanchez told Fox News Digital. 

In July, Newsom spoke about the issue in an interview on the "Shawn Ryan Show," saying he has been "amazingly frustrated by it" and that he regularly encounters parents who are angry about the state's policies at his children's soccer games. 

"Every parent coming up says, ‘It's so unfair.' Like ‘Whoa,' like everywhere I went, progressively-minded people, not bigots, that are champions of trans policy like I am, but didn't like the sports. They were like ‘Come on man, you got to figure this out,'" Newsom said.

Newsom added that his allies in the LGBTQ caucus were "furious" with him after he made his initial comments in March while speaking to Kirk, and even recalled an alleged conversation with Trump about it. 

"And now he's suing and threatening us, and they're just, and you know, I'm the poster child," Newsom added. "But I do think we have to address that issue."

            President Donald Trump is involved in planning for a major new monument in Washington, DC: a triumphal arch to commemorate the country's 250th anniversary, marking his latest effort to impose his style and tastes on the nation's capital.
    


            The Trump administration, said sources familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to describe ongoing deliberations, is considering building a permanent arch as part of broader America250 celebrations honoring the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence next July.
    


            A senior White House official told CNN the arch was Trump's idea.
    


            “He came up with the design and has been part of the process every step of the way,” the official said.
    


From flag poles to a $200 million ballroom: Inside Trump's ‘legacy project' at the White House



            Trump remains deeply attuned to his background as a real estate developer and has taken major steps since returning to office to apply his aesthetic vision to Washington, DC: paving over the White House Rose Garden and decorating it to mirror his Mar-a-Lago patio; adorning the Oval Office, Cabinet Room, and West Colonnade with gilded features; and launching a major ballroom expansion.
    


            Last week, AFP photographer Jim Watson captured images of a pair of three-dimensional models of the proposed arch atop Trump's desk in the Oval Office as the president met with his Finnish counterpart, President Alexander Stubb. Canadian Minister of Energy Tim Hodgson also posted a photo of Trump showcasing one of the models to a group of Canadian officials. The models were on the president's desk again on Wednesday as he hosted an event on crime statistics.
    


            The models match a design and watercolor rendering from the firm Harrison Design. Trump recently posted the watercolor on social media, offering an implicit endorsement of the plans.
    


            The White House, Harrison Design and America250 did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            The watercolor of the proposed stone arch features columns, eagles, wreaths, and a gilded, winged figure. It is similar to France's Arc de Triomphe. Trump memorably visited Paris in 2017, where he delightedly observed a Bastille Day parade from a viewing stand near the iconic arch – and soon called on his aides to deliver his own military parade, which came to fruition eight years later.
    


            The design is in progress and timing for construction of the arch is to be determined, the senior White House official said.
    


            The proposed monument would be situated near the Virginia side of the Arlington Memorial Bridge – atop a grassy traffic circle directly between Arlington National Cemetery and the Lincoln Memorial, according to architect Nicolas Leo Charbonneau, a partner at Harrison Design.
    


            “A proposal for a triumphal arch in DC for #America250, in the traffic circle in front of Arlington National Cemetery. America needs a triumphal arch!” Charbonneau posted on social media alongside a watercolor rendering of the arch by artist Christopher Draper.
    


            It was not immediately clear how the arch would be paid for.
    


            “Washington, DC, is the only major Western capital that lacks an arch. It's a time-honored tradition for celebrating events and people and ideas – and also for acting as gateways to cities,” a source familiar with the matter said.
    


            Catesby Leigh, a co-founder of the National Civil Art Society, has made multiple appeals for a triumphal arch to commemorate the country's anniversary. He suggested in a December 2024 piece for urban policy magazine City Journal that any initial structure should be temporary – but could be eventually made permanent.
    


            “There isn't enough time to build a permanent arch for the 250th. But temporary arches have a long history in this country. And there's also a noteworthy precedent for a temporary arch being rebuilt in permanent form after winning public acclaim: the Washington Arch in Manhattan, which celebrated the centennial of George Washington's first inauguration,” Leigh wrote.
    


            The plans come months after the president signed an executive order mandating that all federal buildings embrace classical architecture, noting that any designs that depart from the “preferred style,” including Brutalist-style buildings, must be run directly by the president.
    


            While the new arch won't be subject to those restrictions, the source familiar with the matter said that the design “follows the spirit of the executive order.”
    


            On Wednesday, as reporters departed an Oval Office event, Trump was asked about the model on his desk.
    


            “It's an Arc, take a look,” he said, according to pool reports.
    


            Asked who the arch was for, the president pointed at himself: “Me.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — With every passing day of the government shutdown, hundreds of thousands of federal employees furloughed or working without pay face mounting financial strain. And now they are confronting new uncertainty with the Trump administration's promised layoffs.

Little progress has been made to end the shutdown as it enters its third week, with Republicans and Democrats digging in and convinced their messaging is resonating with voters. The fate of the federal workers is among several pressure points that could eventually push the sides to agree to resolve the stalemate.

“Luckily I was able to pay rent this month,” said Peter Farruggia, a furloughed federal worker. “But for sure I am going to have bills that are going to go unpaid this month, and I really don't have many options.”

The shutdown has a familiar feel for many federal employees who endured past stalemates — including during President Donald Trump's first term — but this time, the stakes are higher. The Republican White House is leveraging federal workers' jobs to pressure Democrats to soften their demands. A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked the administration from firing workers during the shutdown, saying the human cost “cannot be tolerated.”

The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Trump and other Republican leaders have said the government must reopen before they will negotiate with Democrats on the health subsidies.




Government shutdownThe AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them?

Farruggia is the executive committee chair of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883, representing employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency that faced a wave of layoffs over the weekend. Like 8,000 other CDC employees who have been furloughed from the agency, he was already living paycheck to paycheck, and the partial pay that arrived Friday was his last until the government comes back online.

With the agency's leadership in turmoil and still rattled from a shooting, the shutdown and new firings mean “people are scared, nervous, anxious, but also really just exasperated,” Farruggia said. 

After Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said last week on social media that the “RIFs have begun,” referring to reduction-in-force plans aimed at reducing the size of the federal government, Vice President JD Vance doubled down on the threat Sunday, saying “the longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be.”

The layoffs have begun across federal agencies. Labor unions have already filed a lawsuit to stop the move by Trump's budget office.

In a court filing on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget said well over 4,000 federal employees from eight departments and agencies would be fired in conjunction with the shutdown.

Jessica Sweet, an Albany, New York, Social Security claims specialist who is a union steward of AFGE Local 3343 in New York, said, “I, myself, have a backup plan” in case she is fired during the shutdown, “but I know most people don't.” 

She says the Social Security Administration is already so short-staffed from layoffs earlier this year brought on by the Department of Government Efficiency, she doesn't fear a massive layoff during the shutdown. 

“The one thing this administration has taught me is that nothing is ever for certain, even if it's codified into law,” she said.

Having received a partial payment in her last paycheck, Sweet has begun reaching out to her local power companies to request that she not get charged late fees, since “my bills won't wait for me to eventually get paid.”

For some federal workers, this isn't their first shutdown — the last one, during Trump's first term in 2019, stretched a record 34 days. But this time, federal employees are being used more directly as leverage in the political fight over government funding.

The Republican administration last week warned that there would be no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a shutdown — a reversal of long-standing policy affecting roughly 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a White House memo. The move, which Trump later backtracked on, was widely seen as a strong-arm tactic.

Adam Pelletier, a National Labor Relations Board field examiner whose agency furloughed nearly all of its workforce on Oct. 1, going from roughly 1,100 workers to fewer than a dozen people, said he wouldn't mind if the shutdown continued if it meant meaningful progress toward gaining health care protections for Americans across the country — a key demand by Democrats for ending the stalemate. 

Pelletier, a union leader for NLRB local 3, said “right now, nothing is being investigated at the NLRB. There's no elections for unions or elections for decertifications. Basically nothing is happening.”

As for the financial strain on workers, he said workers can't even find alternate employment to weather the shutdown because “the ethics office that would approve of those requests is not staffed now.”

National Treasury Employees Union President Doreen Greenwald, which represents workers across dozens of federal agencies, said several of the union's members had been laid off as of Friday. The Treasury Department would lose 1,446 workers, according to the filing.

Greenwald said it was unfortunate that the Trump administration was using “federal employees as political pawns by furloughing and proposing to fire them all to try to cause pressure in a political game of chicken.”

“This isn't about one party or the other. It's about real people,” said Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees.

“The correction officer worrying about his next paycheck. The TSA officer who still shows up to work because he or she loves their country, even though they're not getting paid. No American should ever have to choose between serving their country and feeding their family,” Kelley said.

Kelley and other major federal worker union leaders gathered blocks from the Capitol last week, urging congressional leaders to find a solution and put “people over politics.” The event grew emotional at times, with union heads outlining the difficulties facing their members and the stakes growing daily.

Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, which represents 110,000 workers nationwide, called on both sides of Congress to find a resolution. He said Trump appeared to aim to “degrade, frighten, antagonize hardworking federal employees.”

Chris Bartley, political program coordinator for the International Association of Fire Fighters, said thousands of firefighters were showing up for work without pay out of a sense of devotion but stressed that could have broader consequences.

“Families go without income,” Bartley said. “Morale and retention suffer. Public safety is compromised.”

Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich joins 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss the ongoing government shutdown and his take on Operation Arctic Frost that reportedly targeted Republican lawmakers' phone records.

A federal judge in San Francisco on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration from continuing government furloughs, granting a temporary restraining order sought by labor unions that argued layoffs were unlawful during the ongoing government shutdown.

U.S. District Court Judge Susan Illston, a Clinton appointee, ordered the administration not to issue any reduction in force notices to federal employees in "any program, project or activity," including any bargaining unit or member represented by the unions during, or because of, the shutdown.

"The evidence suggests OMB and OPM have taken advantage of the lapse in government spending–function to assume all bets are off and that the laws don't apply to them," Illston said.

            US District Judge Karin Immergut has ruled to extend her temporary restraining orders barring the deployment of the National Guard troops to Portland, keeping President Donald Trump's federalization efforts in limbo as legal challenges unfold.
    


            The ruling by the Trump-appointed judge blocks the federal troops from deploying to Portland for another 14 days. The orders were originally set to expire this weekend.
    


            By extending the temporary orders, Immergut allowed the court and appeals judges time to fully consider the case as the Trump administration remains blocked from deploying federalized troops. The case is expected to go to trial on October 29.
    


            The extension comes as the federal government challenges the judge's earlier ruling on deployment in a higher court as it works to crack down on Democratic-led cities it claims are stricken by crime and disorder.
    


            “Regardless of what happens next, Oregon (Department of Justice) will continue to fight to uphold Oregon's laws and the Constitution,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a social media post Wednesday.
    


            The president has cited  protests outside Portland's Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility to justify the callups of troops in the deep blue city.
    


            Leaders in Oregon have emphatically disputed the president's characterizations of their cities as “war-ravaged” and uncontrollably violent, arguing in court that the situation on the ground in Portland is nowhere as extreme as federal officials portray it to be.
    


            Protests in Oregon's biggest city over White House immigration policies started in June, with a declared riot and arson arrests in mid-summer. The scene was largely calm until Trump had declared late September he was sending 200 Oregon National Guard troops to the city.
    


            Oregon and Portland officials jointly sued following the announcement, and Immergut granted a temporary order barring the federalization of those Oregon troops.
    


            The federal judge then expanded that ruling a day later to include barring the deployment of any US troops when the Trump administration reassigned federalized guard troops in Los Angeles to Portland in an apparent effort to get around the initial order.
    


            A three-judge panel with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is still weighing whether the Trump administration should be blocked from deploying the Oregon National Guard to respond to ICE protests in Portland. They have yet to release a decision. The panel last week granted an administrative stay that allowed for the federalization of the Oregon National Guard.
    


            If the Ninth Circuit rules against the temporary order on deployment, Immergut said during the hearing Wednesday that she will file an order to end her extension.
    


Trump has had his sights on Portland, Oregon, for years. This is how we got here



            As Trump continues efforts to federalize National Guard members across the US for deployment to Democratic-led cities, the administration faces mounting legal pushback from states saying they don't need — or want — any federal help.
    


            After the state of Illinois and its largest city sued the administration last week, calling plans to move troops from the Illinois and Texas National Guards into Chicago “illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional,” a federal appeals court ruled that the troops in Illinois can remain under federal control but can't be deployed as the appeals process continues in the ongoing showdown between the Trump administration and the state.

Here's a simple way to switch up your walking routine, according to experts: try going backward.

Taking a brisk walk is an exercise rich in simplicity, and it can have impressive mental and physical benefits: stronger bones and muscles, cardiovascular fitness and stress relief, to name a few. But like any workout, hoofing it for your health may feel repetitive and even boring after a while.

Backward walking, also known as retro walking or reverse walking, could add variety and value to an exercise routine, when done safely. Turning around not only provides a change of view, but also puts different demands on your body.

Janet Dufek, a biomechanist and faculty member at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, has researched the mechanics of both walking and landing from jumps to identify ways of preventing injuries and improving physical performance. And as a former college basketball player and a regular exerciser, she's also done her fair share of backward walking. 

In humans, reverse locomotion can increase hamstring flexibility, strengthen underused muscles and challenges the mind as the body adjusts to a new movement and posture. 

“I see a lot of people in my neighborhood and they walk, and that's good,” she said. “But they are still stressing the same elements of their structure over and over again. Walking backward introduces an element of cross-training, a subtly different activity.”




Kevin Patterson, a personal trainer in Nashville, Tennessee, recommends the treadmill as the safest place to retro walk. You can adjust it to a slow speed. However, Patterson likes to turn off the treadmill — termed the “dead mill” — and have clients propel the belt on their own. 

“It can take a while to get the treadmill going, but from there we have them be the horsepower for the treadmill,” he said. 

Patterson said he uses backward walking with all his clients as an “accessory exercise” — a weight-training term for add-on movements designed to work a specific muscle group — or during warm-ups. The activity typically makes up a small part of the workouts, he said. 

“The treadmill is great for older clients because you have the handles on the side and you reduce that risk of falling,” he said.

Dufek suggests working a one-minute segment of backward walking into a 10-minute walk and adding time and distance as you get comfortable.

You can also do it with a partner; face each other, perhaps clasp hands. One person walks backward, and the other strolls forward and watches for problems. Then switch positions. 

“At first, you start really, really slowly because there's a balance accommodation and there is brain retraining. You are learning a new skill,” Dufek said. “You're using muscles in different ways.”

If you work your way up to running and get really good at it, you can try running a marathon backward — 26.2 miles or 42.2 kilometers. Yes, people have done that.

Dufek classifies backward walking as a form of cross-training, or incorporating a mix of moves into a fitness program. Doing a range of exercises can help prevent overuse injuries, which can occur after repeatedly using the same muscle groups.

For many people, cross-training involves different activities and types of exercise: for example, running one day, swimming the next, and strength training on a third day. But the modifications required to walk backward work in the same way, but on a micro level. 

Do small tweaks make much of a difference? Once an avid runner, Dufek said she had several pairs of running shoes and did not wear the same pair two days in a row. 

“The shoes had a different level of wear, a different design,” she said. “Just by changing that one element, in this case footwear, it would provide a slightly different stress to the system.”

Physical therapists instruct some of their clients to reverse walk, which can be useful after knee injuries or for people in rehabilitation or recovering from surgery. 

“Backward walking is very different than forward walking from a force perspective, from a movement pattern perspective,” Dufek explained. Instead of landing heel first, “you strike the forefoot first, often quite gently, and often the heel does not contact the ground.” 

“This reduces of the range of motion in the knee joint, which allows for activity without stressing the (knee) joint,” Dufek said. 

Backward walking also stretches the hamstring muscles, the group of muscles at the back of the thigh. Dufek is interested in finding out if it improves balance and reduces fall risks in older adults by activating more senses of the body. 

There is nothing unnatural about backward walking. In fact, backward running is a key skill for top athletes.

Basketball players do it. So do soccer players. American football players — particularly the defensive backs — do it continually.

“I played basketball and I probably spent 40% of my time playing defense and running backwards,” Dufek said.

            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed US military leaders to verify that every member of the department watched the speech he delivered at an unusual gathering of senior officers in Quantico, Virginia, last month and reviews the policy changes he announced in the wake of that event, according to a memo reviewed by CNN.
    


            “Leaders at every level will ensure all personnel will either watch the full recording or read the official transcript of the speech, and review the policy changes no later than 31 October 2025,” the October 6 memo from Hegseth states.
    


            Hegseth's memo comes after he ordered senior officers to travel to Quantico for what amounted to a largely political speech that asserted his vision for how the military will physically look and act.
    


            He also offered a stark ultimatum during his speech: If you don't agree, resign.
    


            While Hegseth delivered his speech, in person, to hundreds of senior officers, the subsequent memo makes clear he wants to make sure the message reaches defense personnel at every level.
    


            Leaders “must inculcate our cultural shift and ensure every member of the Department of War understands my guidance,” Hegseth wrote in the memo, using the Trump administration's preferred name for the Defense Department.
    


            Asked about the new memo, a Pentagon spokesperson said that “The Secretary's speech was for the whole force and this memo just reinforces that guidance.”
    


            The directives that accompanied the speech largely roll back efforts made over the last decade focused on eradicating toxic culture in the military, both to decrease harmful behaviors like harassment, but also to meet practical needs of getting people in uniform and keeping them there longer.
    


            There was also a significant emphasis in Hegseth's speech on the fitness and appearance of service members. Hegseth told the room of senior officers he did not want to see any “fat” generals walking the halls of the Pentagon.
    


            Following Hegseth's speech in Quantico, the Texas Military Department removed seven National Guard troops that had been deployed to Chicago because they “did not meet mission requirements,” a Texas National Guard spokesperson told CNN.
    


            “These service members were returned to home station. The Texas National Guard echoes Secretary Hegseth's message to the force: ‘Our standards will be high, uncompromising, and clear,'” the spokesperson said.
    


            The troops, sent to Chicago as part of President Donald Trump's domestic-facing mission focused on crime, were replaced amid criticism on social media over pictures that showed some of the Guard members appearing to be overweight.

The “sanctuary” state of Illinois allocated more money in its 2025 budget to cover free healthcare for illegal immigrants than it did for the state's road repair fund, home-delivered meals for the elderly, expanding foster homes, and the arts, combined.

A Washington Examiner analysis of the state's budget, put forth in state Senate Bill 251 last year, revealed that the state put $629 million toward taxpayer-funded healthcare for illegal immigrant adults from July 1, 2024, through June 30, 2025.

That single expenditure was more than the $400 million the Illinois Department of Transportation was given for its Road Fund that pays for transportation-related projects in towns, cities, and counties; $55.3 million to cook and deliver meals to the elderly; $22.1 million to increase foster homes and specialized care of children; and $24.6 million to fund the Illinois Arts Council — combined.

Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, said programs like Illinois' incentivize illegal immigration and take away from other deserving programs.

“It is directly impacting taxpayer money that is available for other people in Illinois, for needy people in Illinois,” Vaughan said in a phone call Wednesday. “States have to balance their budgets, unlike the federal government, so when these costs of services to illegal aliens explode, as has happened with the population of people in the country illegally, generally, then that directly takes away from programs that serve Americans.”

In 2020, Illinois politicians moved to make healthcare coverage available for people who had no legal basis to be in the United States. In December 2020, the state rolled out the Health Benefits for Immigrant Seniors program to give adults over 65 years of age a government-subsidized way to obtain healthcare at low to no cost. People who are unlawfully present in the U.S. are not eligible for coverage under Medicaid.

In May 2022, the program was expanded to include adults between the ages of 55 and 64. Then in July 2022, adults 42 to 54 years old became eligible. Both groups under 65 years old were wrapped into a new program, Health Benefits for Adults. 

Between 2021 and 2024, Illinois spent $1.6 billion covering healthcare costs for illegal immigrants over the age of 42, according to a February 2025 report by the auditor general.

The massive spending was due, in part, to the state's allowing approximately twice as many people to get covered as it had planned for. Around 30,000 illegal immigrants in Illinois were covered by the state plan. 

For the fiscal 2026 budget, which began in July this year, Pritzker said the state would no longer be paying for healthcare for illegal immigrant adults — only elderly illegal immigrants who were 65 years old or above. 

The state's Department of Human Services dropped the budget by $330 million by cutting the Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults program. As of July 1, only senior citizens in the country illegally would be eligible for healthcare coverage.

Despite canceling one of the two healthcare programs for illegal immigrants, Illinois had already hit a $200 million deficit by the end of September, just a quarter of the way into fiscal 2026, according to the Governor's Office of Management and Budget.

Thirteen other states and Washington, D.C., also provide healthcare to illegal immigrants: California, New York, Washington, New Jersey, Oregon, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Rhode Island, Maine, and Vermont.

Vaughan said healthcare programs for illegal immigrants “can serve as a reason that these people don't go home,” knowing that their healthcare in blue states is better than in the country they are from.

Immigrant advocates have argued that the healthcare program was beneficial.

For example, the Embodying Race(ism) Project at the University of Chicago determined that the programs coincided with a roughly 15% drop in “bad debt” by Illinois hospitals, meaning that because more people were covered by the state programs, hospitals were not forced to take on the cost of services themselves.

“Notably, we did not observe similar reductions in Wisconsin and Indiana, our control states, suggesting that these changes may have been linked to the implementation of HBIA/HBIS,” the Embodying Race(ism) Project's website states.

            The first known hand fossils from an extinct human relative have been unearthed in Kenya, revealing a species with unexpected dexterity and a gorilla-like grip. The hand bones, which were discovered alongside skull and teeth fossils, are leading researchers to believe these early humans may have been able to use stone tools.
    


            Paranthropus boisei was previously identified only by its distinctive skull and large teeth, with molars up to four times bigger than those of living humans, so researchers didn't know what the rest of the body looked like or how the hominin interacted with its environment. They did, however, theorize about the huge chewing muscles its jaw would have contained and its eating habits, which earned it the moniker Nutcracker Man.
    


            The remarkably well-preserved hand bones comprise a long thumb, straight fingers and a mobile pinkie finger that would have allowed the species to form a powerful grip, similar to how modern humans might grasp a hammer. Other features, such as the broad shape of the finger bones, closely resemble those of a gorilla, however.
    


            The partial skeleton, unearthed at Koobi Fora, a site on the eastern edge of Lake Turkana, is estimated to be slightly more than 1.52 million years old. The teeth and skull fossils matched previously studied P. boisei specimens, while the hand and foot bones proved to be unique among previously studied hominins, a term referring to all species that emerged after the genetic split from the ancestors of the great apes 6 million to 7 million years ago.
    


            “This is the first time we can confidently link Paranthropus boisei to specific hand and foot bones,” said Carrie Mongle, a paleoanthropologist and an assistant professor at Stony Brook University in New York. Mongle is the lead author of a study on the fossils that published in the journal Nature on Wednesday.
    


A skull unearthed in China challenges the timeline of human evolution, scientists say



            The hand was “quite unexpected,” according to Tracy Kivell, director of the department of human origins at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.
    


            “It is clearly the hand of (a) human ancestor, but also has features that are remarkably similar to gorillas, which is surprising,” Kivell said via email.
    


            “No other hominin that we know of has hand morphology that is so gorilla-like, which greatly broadens our perspective on what is ‘possible' within (the) human evolutionary story of hand use,” she added. Kivell coauthored a commentary published alongside the study but was not involved in the research.
    


            P. boisei lived in eastern Africa from 1.3 million to 2.6 million years ago, coexisting with at least three other hominin species: Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus.
    


            Some researchers hypothesized that only species within the genus Homo had the ability to make stone tools, although recent discoveries have undermined that assumption. Stone artifacts unearthed in Kenya dating 2.9 million years ago suggest that tool use was more widespread in the hominin family tree than once thought.
    


            Hominins include species within the genus Homo, such as our own Homo sapiens; more recently extinct species such as Neanderthals, which disappeared 40,000 years ago; early Homo species like Homo erectus; and more distantly related species such as Australopithecus afarensis, represented by the famous Lucy skeleton in Ethiopia, which is 3.2 million years old.
    


Fossils unearthed in Grand Canyon reveal new details of evolutionary explosion of life



            Mongle said the proportions of P. boisei's hands would have allowed it to manipulate stone tools just as well as the other Homo species living in Africa at the time. “This paper is careful in not claiming that Paranthropus made and used tools, but instead they say that there is essentially nothing in the hand anatomy that would prevent that,” Ryan McRae, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC, told CNN in an email.
    


            “Without a smoking gun of stone tools found in a fossilized hand, or stone tools found at a site with only (one) hominin species represented, we may never know for sure who was and was not making these tools, but this paper is a huge step in the ‘Paranthropus the tool maker' hypothesis.”
    


            Later humans such as Neanderthals and Homo sapiens had different wrist anatomy, and P. boisei, along with its contemporaries, likely would not have been able to precisely pinch its fingers together, the study noted.
    


            The hand fossils also suggest that P. boisei shared grasping capabilities with gorillas that would have allowed it to grab and strip tough-to-eat plants, removing the indigestible parts with its hands, the study found.
    


            While its powerful hands indicate it would have been an adept climber, the hominin's feet had arches, which allowed for efficient movement.This means it was unquestioningly adapted to walking upright on two legs, Mongle said.
    


            “Because of the combined morphology of the hand and foot, the authors suggest that this species was likely not arboreal (climbing in trees), but that any convergence with gorillas in the hand is likely due to how they used their hands for processing of tough foods. This makes sense,” McRae, who was not involved in the study, added.
    


            The fossils were found during excavations between 2019 and 2021 by a team led by coauthor Louise Leakey. In the 1950s, her grandparents, the renowned paleoanthropologists Louis Leakey and Mary Leakey, found the first P. boisei skull in what is now Tanzania and gave it the nickname Nutcracker Man. However, wear marks on the species' teeth indicate that rather than cracking hard food like nuts, it chewed and ground tough foods like tubers and roots to survive.
    


            The latest fossils emerged from a layer of sandy silt just above an extraordinary trackway of hominin footprints made public last year.
    


Newly discovered fossils shed light on the origins of curious ‘hobbit' humans



            Pressed into soft mud, the footprints were attributed to P. boisei and Homo erectus, leading researchers to believe the two species crossed paths and were able to live as ﻿neighbors, not competitors, in the same habitat.
    


            Mongle said the two species would have occupied different ecological niches, but based on what's known of the hominin's face, teeth, jaws and now hands, P. boisei likely ate a specialized diet of plant foods such as grasses.

Why A House of Dynamite is so damn scary.

There's no shortage of things that could end the world. But between climate change, risks from AI, and biological threats like pandemics, we seem to be forgetting about one human-made existential risk that has been with us for 80 years: the ever-present possibility of nuclear warfare.

But nuclear war hasn't forgotten about us.

“Because of extraordinary luck over 80 years, despite many close calls and near-misses, there hasn't been a detonation of nuclear weapons,” Elise Rowan, the deputy vice president of communications at the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), told me over email. “Every concern that is top of mind for Americans right now…could be eclipsed by a snap decision under pressure or even an accident.”

Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

That makes the new film A House of Dynamite the perfect movie for the moment.

Directed by Kathryn Bigelow for Netflix — out in select theaters now, and streaming on the service beginning October 24 — the film is divided into three acts that follow government workers, military officials, and finally the president himself (played by Idris Elba) in the roughly 18 minutes that pass between the detection of a nuclear missile launch over the Pacific and its arrival in Chicago.

The day starts like any other. Coworkers flirt and bicker. They make small talk about sports, kids, and snacking habits. A senior officer (Rebecca Ferguson) in the White House Situation Room, which provides 24/7 intelligence updates and decision support to US national security officials, chides a colleague for waiting until that night to propose marriage to his longtime girlfriend. Everything is normal until it isn't.

Even then, it takes minutes for the tension to mount, for the unthinkable to become thinkable. Soldiers in a remote Alaska base initially think it's a North Korean missile test that will land harmlessly in the Pacific.

After all, a real nuclear attack would probably involve hundreds of missiles, including decoys. That's how the Soviet air force officer Stanislov Petrov realized that the five American nuclear missiles heading toward the Soviet Union in 1983 were actually a false alarm caused by malfunctioning early-warning satellites. Petrov's good judgment — he decided not to report the finding up the military chain, which would have led to retaliation per Soviet doctrine — is how we avoided all-out nuclear war by way of Soviet retaliation.

Someone in the film naturally mentions the Petrov case. The US launches its anti-missile defense system from that base in Alaska. It's like hitting a bullet with a bullet, one character explains. “This is going to be the second-most exciting thing that happens today,” the senior officer in the Situation Room reassures the colleague planning to propose to his girlfriend.

But the interceptor fails to destroy the missile, which remains inbound for Chicago and its metro population of 10 million people. It's only after the fact that top officials learn that the defense systems charged with keeping the homeland safe from just such a strike have just a 61 percent chance of success. In real life, it's around a 55 percent success rate — and that's under controlled conditions.

“So it's a fucking coin toss?” the defense secretary (Jared Harris) exclaims. “That's what $50 billion buys us?”

That's plan A. And when it fails, there's no plan B.

What this shows, Rowan told me, is that the nuclear defense system “demands perfection from people and machines 100 percent of the time. And that's just not realistic.”

(Disclosure: I worked at NTI for two years on the Global Biological Policy and Programs team. I learned a lot about nuclear risks through osmosis, but my focus was on pandemic prevention, bioweapons deterrence, and biotechnology governance. I did not work on “nuclear pandemics,” as my uncle once asked me.)

Back to the movie. With the minutes ticking down, the military chief of the US Strategic Command advocates for a preemptive counterstrike, even though the US doesn't know who fired the missile or why, and even though doing so would mean the 10 million Americans who will die in the Chicago strike will only be the first to perish.

But it almost certainly wouldn't end there. Further retaliations could lead to the death of billions, perhaps spark nuclear winter, and potentially spell humanity's end.

What comes across in A House of Dynamite is that no one, in this most important moment in history, seems to be in control.

While it's impossible not to watch the film without nauseously picturing Donald Trump, who has the sole power to order a nuclear attack as the president, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in charge, it may not make a difference.

The experts, the president, the “other side” as far as we can tell from a brief conversation with the Russian foreign minister — everyone seems basically at a loss. It's not a matter of skill or nerve; nearly everyone does their job as best they can.

In the end, we never even learn who fired the missile. North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran are floated as possibilities. The movie doesn't tell us if the launch was a purposeful attack or an accident, an isolated incident or part of a coordinated campaign. I don't see my childhood home in the Chicago suburbs get vaporized. It's even possible that the missile doesn't detonate at all — that can happen. But even if it doesn't destroy the Chicagoland area, causing millions of deaths, the US might still respond preemptively, leading to an all-out nuclear war all the same.

The ambiguity, while narratively frustrating, is the point. It's not possible for us to know all of this in just the 18 minutes the intercontinental ballistic missile allows, just as it's not possible for the president to make a meaningfully informed decision on how to respond in that time. When presented with a menu of escalating retaliation options — “rare, medium, and well-done,” someone quips darkly — the president says he's ready to give the order. We don't see the results.

The film highlights how our approach to nuclear risks has changed since the Cold War. Things were simpler in those “us versus them” Cold War days, if not any less dangerous. But the world has since gotten multipolar. There are (at least) nine nuclear powers to keep track of, and emerging technologies like AI enhance the risks.

“I hope this film gets a new generation interested and engaged in nuclear issues,” Heather Williams, the director of the Project on Nuclear Issues at the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), told me by email. “There are still thousands of nuclear weapons in the world and some countries are still engaging in nuclear saber-rattling — the threat hasn't gone away.”

It's not all doom and gloom, though: In 1986, there were 70,000 nuclear weapons. There are 12,000 today — an 80 percent reduction of the world's total nukes. But for the first time in 40 years, that number is expected to increase. More countries want to add nukes to their arsenals, and the last verifiable limits on nuclear weapons in Russia and the US are going to expire in February.

So things are heading in the wrong direction. “We need the same level of public outcry that led to reductions and [nuclear weapon] verification measures that have made the world safer,” Rowan said. “People have power on this issue — they just have to reclaim it.”

The argument for having nukes is that they may deter conventional warfare as devastating as World War II. But you can't have deterrence in a world wiped out by nuclear apocalypse.

Democrats are using a $20 billion lifeline to Argentina to claim Republicans care more about bailing out foreign governments than helping Americans at home.

The messaging, a riff on President Donald Trump's “America First” policy agenda, intensified ahead of a White House visit by Argentinian President Javier Milei on Tuesday, where Trump said the United States would “be there” for Argentina, so long as Milei succeeds in midterm elections set to take place later this month.

Democrats have variously framed the bailout as an affront to American farmers, as Argentina sells its soybean crops at “manipulative prices” to China, as well as average voters who fear rising healthcare costs.

The latter argument marks a new wrinkle in a shutdown fight with Republicans as Democrats demand an extension of premium Obamacare subsidies to reopen the government, which shuttered over the demands on Oct. 1.

“If this administration has $20 billion to spare for a MAGA-friendly foreign government, how can they say we don't have the money to lower healthcare costs?” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said on the Senate floor.

TRUMP MAKES ARGENTINE CURRENCY SWAP CONTINGENT ON MILEI WIN

The Democratic talking point, made in the halls of Congress and a Democratic National Committee press call on Tuesday, reflects an attempt to turn Trump's signature policy doctrine against him.

Trump has used the “America First” mantra to encapsulate his agenda, from a crackdown on illegal immigration to his demands that NATO contribute more to its own self-defense. But the financial assistance for Argentina, structured in the form of a currency swap, has torn at the president's MAGA support and frustrated business groups that noted Argentina, an agricultural rival, sold shipments of soybeans to China as talk of a bailout became public.

Trump defended the economic package at the White House on Tuesday, arguing that the U.S. benefits from the Milei government staying in power. He represents a libertarian break from the socialist policies of other regional governments and has forged a closer relationship with the White House.

“It's just helping a great philosophy take over a great country,” Trump told reporters. “We don't have to do it. It's not going to make a big difference for our country, but it will in terms of South America.”

Democrats nonetheless see the issue as a liability for Trump, whose strikes on Iran and loose commitment to Ukraine have also rankled supporters.

On Tuesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) attempted to pass a bill, the “No Argentina Bailout Act,” to keep the Treasury Department from performing the currency swap, before her attempt was blocked by Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC).

“It is shameful that President Trump is propping up a foreign government, while he shuts down our own,” Warren said in a floor speech.

The message represents the latest attempt to move Republicans off their shutdown position – a clean funding extension with no policy changes attached. The House passed a bill last month that would keep the government operating through Nov. 21, but it has failed in the Senate eight times as Democrats use the funding cliff as leverage.

TRUMP BLUNTS GOP'S SHUTDOWN LEVERAGE WITH WELFARE AND MILITARY CARVEOUTS

Beyond the shutdown, Democrats have been using Trump's foreign policy to weaken his standing ahead of the midterm elections next year. His tariffs, in particular, have been wrapped into a broader critique that Republicans will send prices higher for consumers.

Trump and congressional Republicans made the same case successfully in November, when Democrats were swept out of power in the face of decades-high inflation.

President Donald Trump turned his attention on Tuesday to criminal behavior in Boston after multiple deployments of National Guard troops to cities throughout the country to help reduce crime. 

Trump suggested he might order the removal of the 2026 World Cup games from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, home of the NFL's New England Patriots. 

In a Tuesday meeting with Argentine President Javier Milei at the White House, Trump cited “unsafe conditions” in Boston. He mentioned recent violent car meets in Boston earlier this month, one of which left a police department cruiser destroyed by fire. 

The car meetups have been deemed “staged attacks” and organized through social media and group messaging platforms, local prosecutors said. 

“These street takeovers are not spontaneous events but are preplanned and coordinated through social media platforms and group messaging applications,” said Lisa Deacutis, assistant district attorney at the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office. “Participants share meeting points, times, and driving routes in advance to allow large numbers to join intersections before police arrive.”

The president claimed that “they're taking over parts of Boston” before stating, “But we could get them back in about two seconds.”

Trump was also critical of Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, calling her “radical left” and saying he was not pleased with her response to the violence.

​​”I think she is hurting Boston,” Trump said. “The answer is yes. If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, let's move it to another location, if I thought Boston was going to cause safety conditions for the World Cup. I could say the same thing for the Olympics.”

Wu's office issued a statement in response to Trump's comments. It did not mention the president's remarks but emphasized its excitement about Boston holding the event.

“Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions,” the statement read.

When the corroded pipeline burst in 2015, inky crude spread along the Southern California coast, becoming the state's worst oil spill in decades.

More than 140,000 gallons (3,300 barrels) of oil gushed out, blackening beaches for 150 miles (240 kilometers) from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles, polluting a biologically rich habitat for endangered whales and sea turtles, killing scores of pelicans, seals and dolphins, and decimating the fishing industry.

Plains All American Pipeline in 2022 agreed to a $230 million settlement with fishers and coastal property owners without admitting liability. Federal inspectors found that the Houston-based company failed to quickly detect the rupture and responded too slowly. It faced an uphill battle to build a new pipeline.

Three decades-old drilling platforms were subsequently shuttered, but another Texas-based fossil fuel company supported by the Trump administration purchased the operation and is intent on pumping oil through the pipeline again. 

Sable Offshore Corp., headquartered in Houston, is facing a slew of legal challenges but is determined to restart production, even if that means confining it to federal waters, where state regulators have virtually no say. California controls the 3 miles (5 kilometers) nearest to shore. The platforms are 5 to 9 miles (8 to 14 kilometers) offshore.

The Trump administration has hailed Sable's plans as the kind of project the president wants to increase U.S. energy production as the federal government removes regulatory barriers. President Donald Trump has directed Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to undo his predecessor's ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts. 

“This project risks another environmental disaster in California at a time when demand for oil is going down and the climate crisis is escalating,” said Alex Katz, executive director of Environmental Defense Center, the Santa Barbara group formed in response to a massive spill in 1969.

The environmental organization is among several suing Sable. 

“Our concern is that there is no way to make this pipeline safe and that this company has proven that it cannot be trusted to operate safely, responsibly or even legally,” he said.

Actor and activist Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who lives in the area, has implored officials to stop Sable, saying at a March protest: “I can smell a rat. And this project is a rat.”

The California Coastal Commission fined Sable a record $18 million for ignoring cease-and-desist orders over repair work it says was done without permits. Sable said it has permits from the previous owner, Exxon Mobil, and sued the commission while work continued on the pipeline. In June, a state judge ordered it to stop while the case proceeds through the court. The commission and Sable are due back in court Wednesday. 

“This fly-by-night oil company has repeatedly abused the public's trust, racking up millions of dollars in fines and causing environmental damage along the treasured Gaviota Coast,” a state park south of Santa Barbara, said Joshua Smith, the commission's spokesman.

So far, Sable is undeterred. 

The California Attorney General's office sued Sable this month, saying it illegally discharged waste into waterways, and disregarded state law requiring permits before work along the pipeline route that crosses sensitive wildlife habitat.

“Sable placed profits over environmental protection in its rush to get oil on the market,” the agency said in its lawsuit. 

Last month, the Santa Barbara District Attorney filed felony criminal charges against Sable, also accusing it of polluting waterways and harming wildlife.

Sable said it has fully cooperated with local and state agencies, including the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and called the district attorney's allegation “inflammatory and extremely misleading.” It said a biologist and state fire marshal officials oversaw the work, and no wildlife was harmed. 

The company is seeking $347 million for the delays, and says if the state blocks it from restarting the onshore pipeline system, it will use a floating facility that would keep its entire operation in federal waters and use tankers to transport the oil to markets outside California. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, the company updated its plan to include the option. 

The U.S. Interior Department's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said in July it was working with Sable to bring a second rig online. 

“President Trump made it clear that American energy should come from American resources,” the agency's deputy director Kenny Stevens said in a statement then, heralding the “comeback story for Pacific production.”

The agency said there are an estimated 190 million barrels (6 billion gallons) of recoverable oil reserves in the area, nearly 80% of residual Pacific reserves. It noted advancements in preventing and preparing for oil spills and said the failed pipeline has been rigorously tested. 

“Continuous monitoring and improved technology significantly reduce the risk of a similar incident occurring in the future,” the agency said. 

On May 19 — the 10th anniversary of the disaster — CEO Jim Flores announced that Sable “is proud to have safely and responsibly achieved first production at the Santa Ynez Unit” — which includes three rigs in federal waters, offshore and onshore pipelines, and the Las Flores Canyon Processing Facility.

State officials countered that the company had only conducted testing and not commercial production. Sable's stock price dropped and some investors sued, alleging they were misled.

Sable purchased the Santa Ynez Unit from Exxon Mobil in 2024 for nearly $650 million primarily with a loan from Exxon. Exxon sold the shuttered operation after losing a court battle in 2023 to truck the crude through central California while the pipeline system was rebuilt or repaired. 

Flores said well tests at the Platform Harmony rig indicate there is much oil to be extracted and that it will relieve California's gas prices — among the nation's highest — by stabilizing supplies.

“Sable is very concerned about the crumbling energy complex in California,” Flores said in a statement to The Associated Press. “With the exit of two refineries last year and more shuttering soon, California's economy cannot survive without the strong energy infrastructure it enjoyed for the last 150 years.”

California has been reducing the state's production of fossil fuels in favor of clean energy for years. The movement has been spearheaded partly by Santa Barbara County, where elected officials voted in May to begin taking steps to phase out onshore oil and gas operations.

WASHINGTON (AP) — After months of aggressive immigration enforcement measures from the Trump administration, Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander adults are more likely to hold a negative view of President Donald Trump's handling of immigration, a new AAPI Data/AP-NORC poll finds.

About 7 in 10 AAPI adults nationwide disapprove of Trump's approach on immigration, according to the survey from AAPI Data and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, an increase from 58% in March. The new poll also finds that a solid majority of AAPI adults say the Republican president has overstepped on deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, and most oppose several specific tactics used by the administration, such as using the military and National Guard to carry out arrests or deportations.

The findings come as federal immigration agents expand a crackdown in the Chicago area, where more than 1,000 immigrants have been arrested since last month. The escalation in Chicago is just part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to boost deportations, which has been a high priority for the president since he took office at the beginning of the year. 

This approach does not seem to be landing well among AAPI adults, a diverse and rapidly growing group where many were born outside the U.S. Even among foreign-born AAPI adults, who tend to be more conservative, most disapprove of the president's handling of immigration. 

Joie Meyer, 25, was born in China and adopted as an infant. The Miami resident, who identifies as a Democrat, supports secure borders but Trump's recent actions have made her wonder what would happen if she suddenly lost her citizenship. 

“If I was at risk of like being stripped away from my home, family, friends, everything I knew because of like a technicality, which is what some people are facing, that's just heartbreaking,” Meyer said, adding that she finds Trump's methods “punitive.”

AAPI adults are particularly likely to think Trump has crossed a line on immigration enforcement. About two-thirds say Trump has “gone too far” when it comes to deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, compared to about 6 in 10 Black and Hispanic adults in a separate AP-NORC poll conducted in September. In that survey, less than half of white adults thought Trump had overstepped on immigration. 




The finding, combined with AAPI adults' increased disapproval of Trump on immigration, signals that the president's handling of the issue over the past few months may have turned some people off. Some may be finding “a big difference in terms of what policy support looks like in theory and how it plays out,” said Karthick Ramakrishnan, AAPI Data executive director and researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.

Immigration is frequently in the local news for 38-year-old Peter Lee of Tacoma, Washington, where there is an active Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center. He sees Trump as hastily meeting deportation quotas without compassion.

“One, there doesn't seem to be a clear game plan for what he's doing in terms of immigration enforcement other than just pure numbers. Second it seems like his directives come from just gut, not fact-based,” said Lee, a Democrat, who is Korean American. “The fact that he's deporting people to third-party countries not of their origin, I think that it's ridiculous.”

American-born and foreign-born AAPI adults are equally likely to think Trump has overstepped on immigration overall. But they're more divided on issues related to illegal immigration.

Just over half of foreign-born AAPI adults, who tend to be older and more conservative than other AAPI adults, support deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who have been charged with misdemeanors, compared to 41% of American-born AAPI adults. AAPI adults who were born outside the U.S. are also more likely than American-born AAPI adults to support deporting all immigrants who are in the country illegally.

More than half of AAPI adults are foreign-born, Ramakrishnan said, adding that American-born AAPI adults may be less “attuned in terms of what it takes to maintain one's status.”

Tyrone Tai, 65, who has homes in Tampa and Lauderhill, Florida, was born in Jamaica. The half-Chinese and half-Jamaican immigrated with his parents to New York City when he was 12. He recalls how they struggled but eventually gained U.S. citizenship. He indicated Trump has “not gone far enough” when it comes to arresting those who “jump the line.” 

AAPI adults who were born outside the U.S. are more likely than American-born AAPI adults to approve of Trump's handling of immigration, although they still don't rate him especially highly on the issue. They're also more likely to approve of his handling of crime, suggesting that the president's efforts to link illegal immigration with crime may be resonating with some among this group.

Some of the Trump administration's tactics are particularly unpopular among AAPI adults, the poll found. For example, about 6 in 10 AAPI adults oppose conducting large-scale immigration enforcement operations in neighborhoods with high populations of immigrants, deploying the military or National Guard to carry out arrests and deportations, detaining immigrants at their workplaces, or allowing agents to cover their faces during arrests. 

Videos of ICE officers wearing masks and snatching people while they are at work or on a public street has rattled Michael Ida, a 56-year-old resident of Honolulu. An independent and Christian, Ida believes that some immigrants in the country illegally may deserve to stay.

“When it comes down to justice or mercy, we should err on the side of mercy. It's very disturbing to me,” Ida said. “As an Asian American especially, I feel like there's a little bit of anxiety to travel outside of Hawaii.”

Tai, however, says that ICE agents should be allowed to wear masks.

“Those poor ICE agents, they're doing their job there and people are basically threatening their families. That shouldn't be,” Tai said. 

Ida, who is half Korean and half Japanese, sees parallels with World War II, when in 1942 the U.S. government began forcing Japanese Americans from their homes and into incarceration camps. 

“History doesn't repeat but it rhymes. There's kind of echoes of what happened in the past.”

The poll of 1,027 U.S. adults who are Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders was conducted from Sept 2-9, 2025, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based Amplify AAPI Panel, designed to be representative of the Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 5.0 percentage points.

Young Republicans leaders across the nation have exchanged racist texts that have been leaked in a new report, landing the New York GOP in the crossfire.

The Telegram messages, first reported by Politico, highlighted messages written by Young Republicans in New York, Kansas, Arizona, and Vermont. Among the messages, people labeled black people monkeys and “the watermelon people” and also called for rape against their political opponents, among other examples.

The New York State Young Republicans group was the most vocal in the group chat. In one instance, one of the group's leaders said, “I love Hitler,” and mused about placing their enemies in gas chambers. Another leader in the New York GOP group wondered about the possibility of the chat getting leaked.

In the hours since the report was published, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) denounced the messages and Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) over her previous praise of the state's Young Republicans. Stefanik and other New York Republicans have condemned the messages.

When asked by a reporter whether the messages reflect “some bad apples,” Hochul excoriated Republicans and suggested they are condoning the behavior.

“Some bad apples? These are the future of the Republican Party,” the Democratic governor answered. “This is so vile it is hard to find the words to put into context that these are people who are part of a political party — one of two major parties — and they believe in gas chambers and rape and discrimination based on the color of people's skin. These are racist, sexist, disgusting remarks.”

Hochul then criticized Stefanik for labeling New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani a “jihadist” and “terrorist,” called on Republicans to do a “reexamination” of their rhetoric, and floated possible punishments for the Young Republican leaders who wrote the hateful messages.

“Kick them out of the party. Take away their official roles. Stop using them as campaign advisers,” she said. “There needs to be consequences. This bulls*** has to stop.”

Stefanik previously described the New York State Young Republicans as “the backbone of our party.” The congresswoman is also tied to the group through an award she was gifted in August.

“As the proud representative of NY's 21st District, and the House Republican Leadership Chair, I am honored to receive the distinguished designation of Congresswoman of the Year!” Stefanik said in a statement at the time. “I want to thank Bobby Walker, Peter Giunta, and all of the hardworking Young Republicans who are the backbone of our party, for all the work they do to ensure Republican victories up and down the ballot in New York.”

Bobby Walker and Peter Giunta were two of the leaders who exchanged some of the texts that are now under scrutiny.

Hochul's campaign called on Stefanik to return the award following the report.

“Elise Stefanik can't hide behind staff to denounce the antisemitic, racist, hateful individuals she endorsed, funded, and praised as the ‘backbone' of the Republican Party,” a spokesperson for Hochul's campaign said, per Politico. “These are her people who said ‘I love Hitler' and named her their congresswoman of the year — an award she still hasn't returned. Stefanik's silence tells New Yorkers where she stands and who she stands with.”

In response to her connections to the group, Stefanik's campaign committee noted she has never employed any member of the group chat.

NEW YORK CITY GOP BACKS MICHAEL HENRY'S CAMPAIGN FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL AGAINST LETITIA JAMES

Alex deGrasse, a senior adviser to Stefanik, told the Washington Examiner, “Kathy Hochul's endorsed candidate Zohran Mamdani is an Antisemite Defund the Police Communist who embraces and campaigns with terrorists who say 9/11 was justified, say Israel doesn't have the right to exist as a Jewish state, and say he will arrest Netanyahu. And Kathy Hochul not only supports him, she endorsed him.”

On the subject of the Young Republicans group chat, deGrasse continued, “Congresswoman Stefanik was absolutely appalled to learn about the alleged comments made by leaders of the New York State Young Republicans and other state YRs in a large national group chat. According to the description provided by Politico, the comments were heinous, antisemitic, racist and unacceptable. While none have ever been employed  by Congresswoman Stefanik, if the description by Politico is accurate, Congresswoman Stefanik calls for any NY Young Republicans responsible for these horrific comments in this chat to step down immediately. Unlike Kathy Hochul who bends the knee and refuses to condemn the vile antisemitism spewed by leading NY Democrat candidates like Mamdani every single day, Congresswoman Stefanik will call out vile hate and demand accountability.”

Stefanik hasn't yet entered next year's race for governor of New York, although she is expected to make an announcement after next month's elections. Until then, she is raising money for a possible gubernatorial bid. Meanwhile, Hochul is preparing to launch her reelection campaign.

Manufacturing is seeing renewed attention from corporate America, with Walmart among the major companies publicly reaffirming its commitment to domestic production. 

At CNBC's inaugural Invest in America Forum, Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said the company is increasing its investments in U.S.-made products and suppliers, describing it as part of a long-standing, strategic priority. 

"Investing in U.S. manufacturing and U.S. operations, sure, it's great for business, but it's also great for employment. It's great for jobs. It's great for the country, and it helps us with our supply chain being flexible and dynamic," Furner said. 

Nearly two-thirds of the products Walmart sells are made, grown or assembled in the United States, according to Furner. Walmart is expanding on that front, including a new beef processing facility in Olathe, Kansas, which he said is expected to create over 600 jobs. 

"It's a big investment, and having quality products that are sourced in a more sustainable way that can deliver to customers is really important," Furner said. 

Furner also pointed to specific categories where domestic production is being revived, citing a recent partnership with USAntibiotics aimed at "bringing back products like amoxicillin so that they're made here in the United States."

Still, global sourcing remains essential for Walmart's operations. 

"We source from all around the world," Furner said. "There are things that are grown around the world that tend to do better in other climates, you know, coffee might be an example … I think there are a lot of possibilities."

The heightened public focus on U.S. manufacturing comes amid trade policy uncertainty, with tariffs and interest rates remaining central to retailers' equation of how much inventory to stock and what to set prices at. For his part, Furner was uncertain about the future for the levies. 

"As policies change, they'll change. Environments will change. That happens. Commodities change," he said. "We've landed in a place where we have more rollbacks going into the fall than we had at the beginning of the year, and that's something we're proud of."

Despite uncertain economic headwinds, Furner said Walmart is pushing to lower prices for consumers. 

"We want to try to keep prices as low as we can, as long as we can," he said. "We see a resilient customer that makes really smart choices for what's right for them and their families at the time of shopping."

Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla sounded the alarm Wednesday over the potential for the the U.S. to lose its competitive edge to China, but said artificial intelligence could help America maintain its lead.

Speaking at CNBC's inaugural Invest in America Forum in Washington, D.C., the two executives said that while the U.S. still leads in many sectors, inconsistent policy and underinvestment is ceding ground to China. AI, they said, poses both risks and benefits for the U.S. economy.

Scharf said AI will likely reduce the size of workforces — but will boost productivity.

"We will likely have less people, absolutely," Scharf said. "When we look at the tools that we've implemented just for people that are coding, you see 20%, 30%, 40% improvement in coders. We haven't reduced our head count by 20%, 30% or 40%. We're actually doing more than we otherwise would have been able to do."

Wells Fargo big bank peers like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are already hiring fewer people because of AI advancements.

Scharf also said the financial sector is poised for major regulatory changes despite an ongoing political stalemate in Washington.

"We ultimately do expect significant changes in capital requirements, liquidity requirements," he said. "We do expect to see changes which will allow people in the industry, not just big banks and medium-sized banks, but smaller banks as well, to do more in these [local] communities."

Bourla, meanwhile, expressed concern about China's growing strength in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, pointing to a surge in research and development spending, regulatory reforms and a national strategy focused on life sciences.

"They [China] filed more patents this year than the U.S.," Bourla said. "That's never happened in history. Five years ago, the split was 90%-10%. ... The gap is closing, but they probably will become [better than us] unless we get our act together."

Bourla urged the U.S. to shift focus from trying to slow China's progress toward improving its own productivity and innovation.

"We spend more time trying to think about how to slow down China rather than think how we can become better than them," Bourla said. "We need to have regulatory changes here. We need to have stability. Tariffs and pricing was not helping."

Pfizer recently agreed to a drug pricing deal with the Trump administration as part of a broader effort to remove long-standing uncertainties around pricing, Medicaid reimbursements and distribution. As part of the agreement, Pfizer secured a three-year exemption from pharmaceutical-specific tariffs, contingent on additional investments in U.S. manufacturing. 

"Tariffs and the uncertainty of drastic correction of U.S. pricing — with this deal, we are removing both uncertainties," Bourla said Wednesday.

He also called artificial intelligence the next frontier for medicine, predicting that AI will revolutionize drug discovery by dramatically accelerating timelines for finding treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer.

"We tried for years to find cures ... AI will make it happen," Bourla said.

A federal judge on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration, for now, from firing federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown.

The order came five days after the administration issued reduction-in-force notifications to more than 4,000 federal workers.

"The activities that are being undertaken here are contrary to the laws," San Francisco U.S. District Court Judge Susan Yvonne Illston told lawyers for the administration on Wednesday at a hearing where she issued the temporary restraining order.

"You can't do this in a nation of laws," Illston said, according to NBC News. "And we have laws here, and the things that are being articulated here are not within the law."

The judge cited comments by President Donald Trump and White House Budget Director Russell Vought that have indicated the workers were being laid off explicitly to target programs favored by Democrats.

Two unions representing tens of thousands of federal workers had asked Illston to block the RIFs.

The Trump administration had warned that it would lay off workers during the shutdown, and President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that the cuts were aimed at "Democrat agencies" or initiatives.

Shortly before Illston issued her order blocking layoffs, White House Budget Director Russell Vought, during an interview on "The Charlie Kirk Show," said that he expected that "north of 10,000" federal jobs would be cut because of their shutdown.

Illston said that the Trump administration took "advantage of the lapse in government spending and government functioning to assume that all bets are off, the laws don't apply to them anymore, and they can impose the structures that they like on the government situation that they don't like," according to NBC.

The judge also said that she believed the unions would be able to prove that the Trump administration's actions were illegal and "arbitrary and capricious."

Illston's order came on the 15th day of the government shutdown, and shortly before a stopgap funding bill that would end the shutdown failed in the Senate for the ninth time.

Democracy Forward, an advocacy group representing the unions in court, praised the judge's order.

"The president seems to think his government shutdown is distracting people from the harmful and lawlessness actions of his administration, but the American people are holding him accountable, including in the courts," said Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward.

"The statements today by the court make clear that the President's targeting of federal workers — a move straight out of Project 2025's playbook — is unlawful," Perryman said.

"Our civil servants do the work of the people, and playing games with their livelihoods is cruel and unlawful and a threat to everyone in our nation."

Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell on Wednesday asked the U.S. Office of Special Counsel to investigate Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for "likely" violating the Hatch Act by making a video to be shown in airports blaming Democrats for the government shutdown.

The Hatch Act bars federal employees, including Cabinet secretaries, from engaging in political activity while acting in their official role.

Multiple major airports have refused to show Noem's video near passenger screening lines, including Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in Cantwell's home state of Washington, as well as airports in Chicago and New York.

A number of airports specifically mentioned the video's potential violation of the Hatch Act in their decision. The Office of Special Counsel is responsible for investigating potential Hatch Act violations.

In a letter to acting Special Counsel Jamieson Greer, Cantwell called out Noem for "airing a partisan video message — on televisions in public airports across the country — in which she erroneously blames 'Democrats in Congress' for the current government shutdown's impact on airport 'operations' and for Transportation Security Administration ... employees 'working without pay.'"

"This message is not just false; it appears to violate the prohibitions contained in the Hatch Act," wrote Cantwell, who is a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.

Cantwell said recent reports indicate that DHS is using taxpayer dollars and federal assets to produce and air the video, in which Noem appears in her official capacity.

The letter notes that Noem, in the video, stands in front of an American flag alongside the official insignia of Homeland Security.

"When viewed in its totality, Secretary Noem's video can only be reasonably interpreted as a partisan message intended to misleadingly malign the Trump Administration's political opponents, convince Americans to blame 'Democrats in Congress' for the ongoing government shutdown, and influence their future votes — all while omitting the fact that Republicans currently control the White House, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives," Cantwell wrote.

"As the independent agency responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, I urge you to investigate this matter immediately," she wrote Greer.

DHS didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Cantwell's letter.

A spokesperson for Port of Seattle, which operates the Seattle-Tacoma airport, said Noem's video was not being played "due to the political nature of the content."

A spokesperson for Portland International Airport in Oregon told CNBC that the airport "did not consent to playing the video in its current form, as we believe the Hatch Act clearly prohibits use of public assets for political purposes and messaging."

The Trump administration could slash more than 10,000 federal jobs during the government shutdown, White House budget director Russell Vought said Wednesday.

"We want to be very aggressive where we can be in shuttering the bureaucracy, not just the funding," said Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget.

"We now have an opportunity to do that, and that's where we're going to be looking for our opportunities," he said during an appearance on "The Charlie Kirk Show," which was broadcasting from the White House.

The comments came shortly before a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from firing federal workers during the shutdown.

Vought listed a number of government entities that could be targeted for cuts, including so-called Green New Deal programs at the Department of Energy and environmental justice efforts at the Environmental Protection Agency. He also pointed to the Commerce Department's Minority Business Development Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA.

Vought also said he aims to close the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which he currently leads as acting director, within "the next two, three months."

He said that the agency has "the DNA of [Democratic Sen.] Elizabeth Warren," and that it has tried to "weaponize" the law against small financial institutions.

The Trump administration has warned that the shutdown, which has now stretched into its third week with no end in sight, will lead to mass firings of federal workers.

The White House said it sent layoff announcements, known as reduction-in-force notices or RIFs, to around 4,200 federal employees on Friday. That number was revised slightly downward on Tuesday.

But Vought, in Wednesday's talk show appearance, said he expects the number of RIFs to grow. 

"It could grow higher," he said. "I think we'll probably end up being north of 10,000."

The White House has shared its rolling RIF estimates in court documents as part of a federal lawsuit filed by unions representing government workers who are challenging the Trump administration's cuts.

In a hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Susan Illston issued a temporary restraining order blocking the firings for now.

"The activities that are being undertaken here are contrary to the laws," Illston told lawyers for the administration as she issued the order, according to NBC News.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Vought said the RIF numbers provided in the lawsuit are "just a snapshot."

"I think it'll get much higher, and we're going to keep those RIFs rolling throughout this shutdown, because we think it's important," he said.

Government employees who are furloughed during the shutdown, as well as those deemed "excepted" who are still required to work, are going without pay while the lapse in federal funds drags on.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday afternoon issued a presidential memorandum directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to use any remaining congressional funds to continue to pay active-duty military personnel.

General Motors' announcement on Tuesday that its upcoming quarterly results will include a $1.6 billion charge from its electric vehicle investments is the latest in a string of troubling EV-related disclosures from big automakers.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said late last month that he expects demand for fully electric vehicles to be slashed in half following the end of a federal tax credit program. His prediction came after Stellantis, the parent company of auto brands including Chrysler and Jeep, said it was scrapping its target of producing nothing but electric vehicles in Europe by 2030, and backed off ambitious targets for the U.S., notably for Chrysler.

The industry, which was already facing hurdles imposed by the Trump administration, faces a hefty dose of uncertainty now that consumers can no longer take advantage of $7,500 tax credits for purchasing EVs. The incentives expired at the end of September as part of President Trump's signature spending bill.

As automakers reset investor expectations, one name has been notably absent from the conversation: Tesla.

Elon Musk's company is by far the largest seller of EVs in the U.S., though its market share has been sliding as competition has increased and its brand value has declined. Tesla's share of the all-electric market in the U.S. was estimated at 43.1% at the end of September, down from 49% at the end of last year, according to data provided to CNBC from Motor Intelligence

Tesla is slated to report third-quarter results next week, and Wall Street will be eager to hear what kind of demand the company expects with the credits no longer available. Tesla recently unveiled stripped-down, lower-cost variants of its popular Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedans, offsetting some of the effective price increases that come with the loss of incentives.

Steve Greenfield, general partner at investment firm Automotive Ventures, said the retreat of legacy automakers from the segment could be good news for Tesla as its market share may start to rebound. He said in an email that the company has "very strong brand loyalty."

"Chances are, most Tesla buyers will continue to stay in the brand, as they buy their next new car," Greenfield said.

However, significant challenges loom. Interest in battery electric vehicles "is very likely to shrink dramatically" in the fourth quarter, he said, due to the "pull-ahead of demand," as consumers rushed to buy EVs before the credit expired. As the year ends, Tesla will likely face a "double whammy," Greenfield said, from reduced BEV sales and lower margins on the cars they do sell.

Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.

Investors have become more bullish. Following a 36% slump in the first quarter, the stock has rallied and is now up more than 7% for the year, aided by Musk's purchase of about $1 billion worth of Tesla stock in September.

The brutal start to the year was linked to a consumer backlash in the U.S. and Europe in response to Musk's incendiary political rhetoric, his work for President Trump slashing the federal workforce, and his endorsements of far-right groups including Germany's AfD party.

In the company's third-quarter earnings scheduled for next Wednesday, analysts are expecting to see revenue growth of 3.5% from a year earlier to $26.1 billion, according to LSEG. Analysts are projecting a revenue drop in the fourth quarter and a 3.5% slide for all of 2025, which would mark the first full-year decline on record.

Earlier this month, Tesla reported a 7% year-over-year increase in quarterly vehicle deliveries for the third quarter. That marked a turnaround after two consecutive quarterly declines to start the year.

"It's not just a retreat of everybody else, and Tesla gets to run away with the market," said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at Alix Partners, in an interview.

Consumer demand for fully electric vehicles had "already kind of flatlined a bit" even before the Republican spending bill, Wakefield added. Car buyers have been looking for a "breakthrough moment" where EVs would become cost competitive with hybrid or gas-powered models.

Wakefield added that "this market needs a sense of newness," and that the new, lower-priced Model Y and Model 3 options are not exactly "earth shattering."

The Trump administration isn't making life easy.

Robbie Orvis, a senior director at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate policy think tank, told CNBC the automakers' writedowns were expected and stem entirely from policy changes beyond just the tax credits.

The Trump White House has also "revoked California's waiver to set its own vehicle standards, revoked billions in funding for EV chargers and for auto plants to retool to build EVs, and is in the process of undoing vehicle tailpipe standards that would encourage the adoption of EVs," Orvis said.

Those policies, along with tariffs, have already caused billions of dollars in losses for U.S. automakers, which means they aren't in a position to invest in new market segments, Orvis said.

Tesla is experiencing its share of that pain, and it's showing up most acutely in international markets.

"Chinese automakers are rapidly displacing U.S. automakers in foreign markets as they are able to offer cheaper, higher-quality new cars, particularly EVs, in markets where there is large and growing demand for these cars," Orvis said.

Musk, meanwhile, continues to try and focus investor attention elsewhere.

He insists the future of the company hinges on robotaxis and humanoid robotics, two markets that Tesla has yet to meaningfully crack. Tesla is testing its Robotaxi-branded service in limited capacity in some cities, but is way behind Alphabet's Waymo, which is rapidly expanding commercial operations.

Musk said in March that Tesla aimed to make 5,000 of its Optimus robots this year, but key departures from the group have thrown that plan into question.

In September, Musk wrote on X that "~80% of Tesla's value will be Optimus." Last year, he predicted that Optimus robots would someday turn Tesla into a $25 trillion company, which was equal to more than half of the entire value of the S&P 500 at the time of his comment.

It's a story that's compelling enough for some longtime Tesla bulls and Musk fanboys. But at the moment, the company still relies on sales of EVs to drive its business. And in the U.S., while Tesla's market share may be poised to rise, the overall pie — at least in the near term — appears to be shrinking.

Bunge Global jumped more than 11% on Wednesday on the back of the Trump administration's threat to cut off U.S. purchases of Chinese cooking oil.

Bunge is one of the largest soybean processors and cooking oil producers in the world. The stock's year to date gains are roughly 18%.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the U.S. is considering "terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil" as a retaliatory action against Beijing's refusal to buy U.S. soybeans. China was the top buyer of American soybeans for years but has not bought a single soybean from the U.S. since May amid its trade war with the Trump administration. The country has instead been buying the crop from Argentina and Brazil due to Trump's high tariff rates on China.

Trump's threat to China comes after China's used cooking oil exports surged to record highs last year, with the U.S. accounting for 43% of the total export number.

Trade tensions between China and the U.S. have escalated in recent days. Late last week, President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports. That came after China placed new export controls on rare earth minerals. China this week then moved to tighten its grip in the global shipping space by sanctioning five U.S. subsidiaries from South Korea's Hanwha Group. 

Bunge earlier Wednesday also gave a full-year forecast that reflects its merger with grain and oilseeds processor Viterra. The company said it expects to earn $7.30 to $7.60 per share, excluding items, while analysts polled by FactSet expected $7.39 per share. Still, that appeared to be better than many investors feared. 

Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland, another large American oilseed processor, also rose 1.5% after Trump's threat.

Nuclear stocks traded mixed Wednesday after the U.S. Army launched a program to deploy small reactors.

Shares of NuScale, a small reactor developer, surged more than 16%. Oklo and Nano Nuclear fell more than 1% and about 3%, respectively. The uranium company Centrus jumped 10%.

Those stocks all rallied sharply earlier in the session.

The U.S. Army on Tuesday unveiled a program to build micro nuclear reactors in partnership with the Defense Innovation Unit. The microreactors will be commercially owned and operated with the goal of helping developers scale up their businesses, according to the Army.

The Army launched the "Janus Program" in response to President Donald Trump's May executive orders that aim to speed the deployment of advanced reactors. Trump ordered the Defense Department to have a reactor operating at a domestic military installation no later than Sept. 30, 2028.

Investors have speculated heavily on the fortunes of NuScale, Oklo and Nano Nuclear despite the fact that none of the companies have deployed a reactor yet. Oklo and Nano Nuclear have not generated any revenue. NuScale posted $8 million in revenue in the second quarter.

Artificial intelligence power demand and Trump's executive orders have fueled a wave of market enthusiasm about nuclear power. Goldman Sachs recently told investors to exercise caution on Oklo.

Elon Musk's lawyers will urge the Delaware Supreme Court on Wednesday to restore his $56 billion pay package from Tesla, as one of the biggest corporate legal battles enters its final stage nearly two years after a lower court judge rescinded the Tesla CEO's record compensation.

The outcome could have substantial consequences for the state of Delaware, its widely used corporate law, and its Court of Chancery, a once-favored venue for business disputes that has recently been accused of hostility towards powerful entrepreneurs.

The January 2024 Court of Chancery ruling striking down Musk's pay has become a rallying cry for Delaware critics. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled that the Tesla board lacked independence from Musk when it approved the pay package in 2018 and that shareholders lacked key information when they voted overwhelmingly in favor of it. As a result, she applied a demanding legal standard and found the pay unfair to investors.

The defendants, current and former Tesla directors, denied wrongdoing and said McCormick misinterpreted the facts and the law. Musk is not expected to attend.

After the Musk pay ruling, large companies, including Tesla, Dropbox, and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, switched their legal homes to Texas or Nevada, where courts are friendlier toward directors. Delaware lawmakers responded to the corporate departures, a trend known as "Dexit," by overhauling its corporate law.

If Musk loses the appeal, he will still reap tens of billions of dollars in stock from the electric vehicle company, which agreed in August to a replacement deal if his 2018 plan is not restored.

The company said the replacement award was meant to retain and focus Musk, who said earlier this year he was forming a new U.S. political party, on transitioning Tesla to robotics and automated driving. Tesla is now incorporated in Texas, where it is far more difficult for a shareholder to challenge board decisions.

Tesla's board last month proposed a $1 trillion compensation plan, highlighting confidence in Musk's ability to steer the company in a new direction, even as Tesla loses ground to Chinese rivals in key markets amid softening EV demand.

The five justices on Delaware's high court will consider the appeal of the pay ruling as well as the $345 million legal fee that McCormick ordered Tesla to pay to the attorneys for Richard Tornetta, who held just nine Tesla shares when he sued to block the pay deal. The court typically takes months to rule.

Tesla estimated in 2018 the stock options plan would be worth $56 billion if the company met operational and financial goals, which it did. Because the stock continued to appreciate, the options are currently worth closer to $120 billion, by far the largest executive compensation ever. Musk is the world's richest person with a fortune of around $480 billion, according to Forbes.

The defendants have argued that McCormick erred in finding social and business ties to Musk compromised their independence and said Tesla shareholders were informed of the economic terms of the pay deal before they approved the plan. The directors said she should have reviewed the pay package under the "business judgment" standard, which protects directors from second-guessing by courts.

The directors have long argued the pay package performed as hoped - it focused the attention of Musk, a serial entrepreneur, and he transformed Tesla from a startup into one of the world's most valuable companies.

Several months after McCormick's ruling, Tesla received shareholder approval a second time for the plan, which McCormick rejected as legally invalid. Tesla is also appealing that decision.

Walmart is deploying millions of ambient Internet of Things battery-free sensors throughout its massive supply chain in the U.S.

The retail giant is using technology from Wiliot in what the IoT vendor is calling the first large-scale deployment of ambient IoT in the retail sector and one of the largest such implementations to date.

Ambient IoT is a class of IoT devices mainly powered by harvesting ambient energy from radio waves, light, motion, heat, or other viable ambient energy sources. It's an evolution of legacy IoT and radio frequency identification technologies that promise lower costs and high scalability.

Walmart will be using the IoT sensors to track pallets nationwide by the end of 2026. "Expansion to other global markets is under consideration, but the immediate focus is the U.S. rollout," Cathey said.

The company will now have real-time insights into inventory management, knowing exactly where merchandise is located and whether it's owned by the retailer, at any moment, and covering an estimated 90 million pallets of inventory when at full scale.

The ambient IoT sensors Walmart uses capture signals about temperature, location, humidity, and dwell time. These signals are linked with the company's advanced artificial intelligence systems, enabling the company to dramatically improve supply chain efficiency, inventory accuracy, and cold chain compliance.

"We expect to be active in about 500 Walmart locations by the end of the year, with plans for national expansion in 2026," said Greg Cathey, senior vice president of transformation and innovation at Walmart. The rollout will cover 4,600 Walmart Supercenters, Neighborhood Markets, and more than 40 distribution centers, generating high-resolution supply chain data that feeds into Walmart's AI systems, he said.

"This data provides proof of delivery, improves replenishment decisions, and lets us know where our items are in real time," Cathey said. "By combining continuous sensing with AI, we're moving from probabilistic predictions to precision decision-making."

What makes the addition of ambient IoT sensors significant is it provides a new stream of data into AI systems, enabling them to be even more effective in giving Walmart greater visibility into supply chain operations.

The technology initiative is already making a significant impact by eliminating some manual tasks and providing automated alerts, Cathey said. "Associates no longer need to perform time-consuming checks to locate items," he said. "Automated alerts now flag this information in real time, allowing associates to act faster and dedicate more time to serving customers."

The enhanced visibility into the supply chain is also helping to resolve inventory discrepancies, allowing improved customer experiences.

While Cathey did not disclose specific figures such as cost savings, Walmart is anticipating gains from higher supply chain efficiency, improved inventory accuracy, reduced manual tasks for associates, and the ability to get items on shelves more quickly. "Customers [will] benefit from better product availability and consistency," he said.

"AI system performance is predicated on its training data. The better the data, the better the AI performance," said Julien Bellanger, president of Wiliot. "Supply chain AI has long been fueled by inherently out-of-date data — or forecasted data that represents projections rather than reality."

Ambient IoT is changing this model, Bellanger said, by fueling AI with data that reflects what's actually happening throughout the supply chain.

"We have been here before; Walmart was an early adopter of RFID back in 2004 when it was supposed to provide much the same functionality," said Bill Ray, distinguished vice president, analyst and chief of research at research firm Gartner. "However, this time the cost of the tags is much lower, and that will be a tipping point."

Ray says it's important to note that the value of such IoT systems is already known. "The business models have been well studied and evaluated, when RFID was first touted as the solution to supply chain problems," he said. "RFID has had an enormous impact, but the cost of the tags prevented the transformation it had promised. The industry has been able to integrate the new, lower-cost tags into the same value models, and come up with positive answers."

Gartner has been tracking Wiliot for a long time. "The question was never if the technology could deliver on its promise. The question was if Wiliot could reliably scale production without compromising tag performance or price, and if it could integrate with existing supply chain systems. This announcement tells us that Walmart is convinced it can, now Wiliot will have to prove it," Ray said.

"Ambient IoT just works," Cathey said. "It doesn't require wanding or scanning. It lets our associates do what they do, and they can focus on doing their jobs safely and efficiently while providing continuous, real-time visibility into our supply chain."

Ambient IoT got a boost earlier this year when a new business alliance was created to develop and promote an open, multi-standard ecosystem for ambient IoT manufacturers, suppliers, integrators, operators, users, and customers, based on next-generation, battery-free ambient IoT standards.

By focusing on advanced communication technologies, the alliance is seeking to overcome the limitations of traditional battery-powered IoT devices, promoting more sustainable and efficient products.

Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock and Elon Musk's xAI are part of a consortium of investors that has agreed to purchase Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion, the companies announced Wednesday.

Aligned designs and operates data centers and data campuses across North and South America, and is owned by Macquarie Asset Management.

MGX of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners and members of Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership, or AIP, will acquire 100% of the company's equity, in what will be the largest global data center deal to date, according to a release.

AIP was created by BlackRock, MGX, Microsoft and Nvidia in September 2024 to accelerate investment in AI infrastructure. The Kuwait Investment Authority, xAI and Temasek have joined as additional participants.

The Aligned deal marks AIP's first investment and is a step toward the group's goal of deploying $30 billion of equity capital.

"With this investment in Aligned Data Centers, we further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI, while offering our clients attractive opportunities to participate in its growth," Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock and Chairman of AIP, said in a statement.

AI companies have been racing to build out the infrastructure they believe they will need to meet growing demand for the technology.

Companies including OpenAI, Nvidia, CoreWeave and Oracle are striking ambitious data center and computing deals that will require unprecedented amounts of funding and power.

Data centers are the large facilities that house the hardware and equipment needed to run big AI workloads and train models. Aligned currently operates 50 campuses and has more than 5 gigawatts of operational and planned capacity.

The Aligned transaction is expected to close late next year, and it is still subject to regulatory approvals and other standard closing conditions.

The Trump administration will set price floors across a range of industries to combat market manipulation by China, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC in an exclusive interview Wednesday.

China has driven foreign competitors in the rare earth industry out of business over the past two decades by using its global dominance in refining and processing to slash prices, Bessent said.

"When you are facing a nonmarket economy like China, then you have to exercise industrial policy," Bessent told Sara Eisen at CNBC's Invest in America Forum in Washington, D.C.

"So we're going to set price floors and the forward buying to make sure that this doesn't happen again and we're going to do it across a range of industries," the Treasury secretary said, without naming specific industries the administration was looking at beyond rare earths.

The U.S. also needs to set up a strategic mineral reserve, Bessent said. JPMorgan Chase is interested in working with the Trump administration to create such a reserve, he said.

Rare earths are used to produce magnets that are crucial inputs in U.S. weapons systems like the F-35 warplane and Tomahawk cruise missiles. Rare earth magnets are also essential for civilian commercial applications like electric vehicles.

The Trump administration has been working to stand up a domestic rare earth supply chain. The Department of Defense struck an unprecedented deal in July with MP Materials, the largest U.S. rare earth miner, that included an equity stake, a price floor and offtake agreement.

China last week announced sweeping new restrictions on rare earth exports ahead of an expected meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump in South Korea later this month. Trump has threatened to slap China with additional 100% tariffs in response.

The U.S. could take equity stakes in other companies in the wake of Beijing's rare earth restrictions, Bessent told CNBC.

"I wouldn't be surprised," the Treasury secretary said when asked about additional equity stakes. "When we get an announcement like this week with China on the rare earths, you realize we have to be self-sufficient, or we have to be sufficient with our allies."

The Trump administration will not take stakes in nonstrategic industries, Bessent said. "We do have to be very careful not to overreach," he said.

Shares of rare earth and critical mineral miners have rallied over the past several sessions as investors speculate on which companies might be future targets for Trump administration industrial policy.

Apple announced new MacBook Pro, iPad Pro and Vision Pro models on Wednesday with an updated M5 chip that allows them to run faster than their predecessors.

The new MacBook Pro models start at $1,599. The 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $999. The latest Apple Vision Pro, which includes a Dual Knit Band, starts at $3,499.

The new devices are available to preorder now in most markets and go on sale Oct. 22. They are Apple's latest additions to its fall catalog of products.

The company released the iPhone 17 and Apple Watch Series 11 models in September.

Apple's December quarter is its largest by sales, driven by holiday and Christmas shopping. That is why the company usually updates its bestselling products in the fall. This year, it's the first full quarter of iPhone 17 sales as well.

The new device lineup is powered by Apple's M5 chip, which the company said has four times the peak compute performance compared with the previous M4.

Johny Srouji, Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Technologies, said in a release that the "M5 delivers a huge boost to AI workloads."

Wednesday's announcement comes as Wall Street analysts are closely watching Apple's new releases to see if the company is raising prices or eating costs related to President Donald Trump's announced and threatened tariffs, especially on semiconductors and China.

Starting prices for the latest M5 models are the same as the previous versions.

While iPads and MacBooks aren't as critical for Apple as iPhone sales, they are still massive businesses.

Apple reported $6.58 billion in iPad sales in the June quarter, an 8% decrease on an annual basis that the company attributed to difficult comparisons to the year-ago quarter when new iPad Pros were released.

Mac sales in the June quarter came in at $8.05 billion, a 15% increase on a year-over-year basis. Apple released a new version of what it calls its bestselling laptop, the MacBook Air, earlier this year.

Apple has never broken out figures for the Vision Pro headset but they are included alongside Apple Watch and AirPods sales in the company's wearables, or other products, line item. Analysts believe the company's Vision Pro revenue is negligible.

MacBook, iPads and Vision Pro put together are significantly less than Apple's iPhone revenue, which accounted for more than 47% of revenue in the company's June quarter at just under $45 billion.

Wall Street analysts tend to focus on iPhone sales and growth over the company's secondary product lines.

BEIJING — Chinese smartphone company Honor on Wednesday announced it is developing a smartphone with a camera that folds out of the device using a robotic arm.

The company said it plans to share more details at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona early next year.

The new device would be the latest Chinese consumer electronics product to shake up a decades-old hardware design in an attempt to integrate AI. Earlier this year, Beijing-based Roborock started selling a robot vacuum cleaner with an arm that folds out from the top, and combines AI with sensors to detect obstructions for the arm to remove.

Honor is calling the product a "robot phone" and said it will incorporate artificial intelligence, but did not provide specific details.

The company said it is rolling out AI tools that help its smartphone users scan Chinese e-commerce sites for personalized shopping deals, quickly hail a taxi or get tips on how to better position the camera for a photo. The move is part of Honor's plan to spend $10 billion over the next five years for a transformation into an AI device company.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent insisted Wednesday that the U.S. won't change its trade negotiating stance on China due to stock market volatility.

"We won't negotiate because the stock market is going down" or shy away from taking strong measures against Beijing for that reason, Bessent said in an exclusive interview at CNBC's Invest in America Forum.

"We will negotiate because we are doing what is best economically for the U.S.," he said.

Bessent pushed back on a report in The Wall Street Journal overnight that China "expects that the prospect of another market meltdown ultimately will force [President Donald Trump] to negotiate."

Chinese President Xi Jinping is "betting that the U.S. economy can't absorb a prolonged trade conflict" with China, the Journal reported, citing people close to Beijing's decision-making. 

The Cabinet secretary called that report "terrible," accusing the newspaper of taking "CCP dictation."

A spokesperson for the Journal, asked for comment on Bessent's remarks, said the newspaper stands by its reporting.

"We hold ourselves to the highest journalistic standards and any insinuation otherwise is baseless and false," the spokesperson said in a statement.

Bessent's comments came as markets have whipsawed in recent days, as the status of ongoing trade talks between the world's largest economies appeared to teeter.

Stocks tanked on Friday after Trump threatened to hike tariffs on Chinese imports in retaliation for new export controls that China imposed on rare earth minerals.

Trump appeared to soften his tone over the weekend, spurring a market rebound on Monday. Major stock indexes bounced around in volatile trading Tuesday; the S&P 500 took a dive before the session close after Trump issued yet another trade threat against China, this one accusing Beijing of economic hostility for not buying U.S. soybeans.

Bessent added Wednesday that while Trump "likes a high stock market," he "believes that the high stock market is a result of good policies."

"It's the policies that we're talking about here today, in terms of this capex boom," Bessent said, highlighting increased investment in artificial intelligence.

Many predict that the artificial intelligence boom will dramatically change how people live and work, and the scale and pace of recent AI deals seems to reflect this. At the center are a handful of companies that are increasingly turning to each other to finance and build out the necessary infrastructure.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI alone has racked up around $1 trillion in deals this year, according to a report from the Financial Times. In September, OpenAI confirmed that it would pay Oracle $300 billion for computer infrastructure over the course of five years. This deal is part of a $500 billion data center buildout project called Stargate, to which Japan's SoftBank Group is also contributing. OpenAI has also inked a $22 billion deal with CoreWeave for use of its data centers, which are packed with Nvidia graphics processing units. Most recently, OpenAI announced a partnership with Broadcom to develop and deploy racks of chips designed by the AI startup. That deal amount is undisclosed. OpenAI has been able to go on this shopping spree because of a $100 billion investment from Nvidia, though a large portion of that money likely be used for leasing Nvidia's GPUs. Microsoft has also invested about $14 billion in OpenAI since 2019.

Nvidia has also spun a similar web of intertwining AI deals. Nvidia in September agreed to pay up to $6.3 billion for any of CoreWeave's unsold cloud-computing capacity through 2032. CoreWeave gets most of its GPUs that it then rents out to customers from Nvidia, which is also an investor in the AI cloud infrastructure company. Meanwhile, Oracle has purchased about $40 billion worth of Nvidia chips to build a data center for OpenAI, which is part of the Stargate project. Softbank has a $3 billion stake in Nvidia.

Some experts are worried that these inflated AI company valuations "are at a bubble." A recent report by Bain & Company found that AI companies will need $2 trillion of annual revenue to fund the infrastructure needed to meet projected demand for AI by 2030. That's an $800 billion shortfall.

But AI leaders are pushing back against concerns, saying that this is simply what it takes to make AI a reality.

"The largest tech companies in the world are purchasing this infrastructure because they have demand," CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator said on Mad Money on Oct. 8. "There's nothing circular about that. It's a fundamental infrastructure buildout that's taking place, and when you have such a massive-scale investment in infrastructure, it is not unusual to see partnerships as people try to serve infrastructure to the consumer. It happens in other markets, it's happening in this one."Watch the video for a visual representation of this entangled web of AI deals.

Marc Benioff doesn't think enough companies have figured out how to adopt AI.

"Customers are getting their head around how to deploy AI," Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, told CNBC host Jim Cramer on Tuesday.

Earlier on Tuesday, Benoiff kicked off the Dreamforce conference at San Francisco's Moscone Center with a keynote, where he touted how clients such as Williams-Sonoma and Dutch jewelry maker Pandora have adopted Salesforce's AI products.

"The speed of innovation is far exceeding the speed of customer adoption," said Benioff to Cramer. "These customers have to go back and modify massive architectures they have and systems they're running."

The comments on AI adoption come as Salesforce shares are down more than 28% compared to the same time last year and around 34% compared to their peak in December 2024. The company said in August that it cut its support staff from 9,000 to 5,000 employees, thanks to the adoption of AI agents.

When asked about the stock decline, Benioff said that the Agentforce platform has rapidly grown since the company first introduced it a little over a year ago, but there is little understanding of how the company is using autonomous bots to drive efficiency.

"People don't understand that Agentforce is part and parcel of Salesforce," said Benioff. "It is the core of every product we make now, it is the platform."

The Dreamforce conference is set to bring tens of thousands of guests to San Francisco this week as Benoiff attempts to sell software like Tableau and Slack, powered by AI. Tickets typically run from $999 to $2,299. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Dario Amodei, CEO of AI lab Anthropic, are both scheduled to have chat sessions with Benoiff throughout the week, topped off with music performances from Metallica and Benson Boone.

To build brand loyalty, get 'em while they're young.

Harvey, a startup building artificial intelligence tools for lawyers, is taking that creed to college campuses.

The company, last valued at $5 billion, says it now works with half of the country's 100 largest law firms and is extending its reach to the classroom.

In August, Harvey said it would give six law schools access to the platform as part of a new "alliance." The next month, it onboarded 11 more law schools. Now, Harvey has added Duke Law and Northwestern Pritzker Law to the roster, the company tells Business Insider. Participation in the program is available to the law schools free of charge.

"What we're trying to do is make it so they can start integrating that into their training as early as possible," Winston Weinberg, Harvey's cofounder and chief executive, said from a conference room in the company's Manhattan office.

He imagines a not-so-distant future where a private-equity class conducts a mock leveraged buyout inside Harvey; students draft and refine arguments with its tools before a moot court. The simulations he describes aren't live yet.

Harvey's program borrows from the "Wexis" playbook. For decades, LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters, which both supply case law to legal professionals, blanketed law schools with free or nearly free access. Students spend years getting fluent in one system and then carry that muscle memory into practice.

Harvey is betting that prompting and directing virtual agents will be the next habits that stick.

Inside firms, Weinberg says Harvey is stripping the drudgery from legal work, and clients are starting to notice. Faster is becoming the expectation. He compares it to the advent of email. "The biggest change it made," he said, is that "you've got to respond way faster."

That's the incentive problem at the heart of legal tech: many lawyers are paid by the hour, and saving time can result in a loss of revenue. Weinberg thinks that Harvey's efficiency gains will prompt firms to move more work off the billable hour and onto flat-fee menus to protect their profits. The price of services depends on the specific legal matter, and doesn't decrease even as labor costs fall.

Weinberg said law firms could also pass along the cost of using Harvey and other tools to their clients, a familiar move in the legal world. Many firms already include a line item on their invoices for research databases, such as LexisNexis or Westlaw, showing how many queries a matter requires. Asked if Harvey might one day appear the same way, Weinberg said the company is "exploring that right now."

The caveat is that uptake today skews towards the big corporates and law firms, and even there, Harvey is still seen as an efficiency booster, not a requirement for practice.

Law schools aren't entirely analog. They've long run on enterprise tools like Lexis and Westlaw. Where they diverge is on policies around generative artificial intelligence. Some prohibit it. Others allow it with disclosure. A few are weaving it into clinics and practice labs.

Notably, the list of Harvey's launch partners was missing a few giants, Yale and Harvard among them. Company lore says the name "Harvey" is partly a nod to Harvard.

Asked what he would change about legal education if he were rewriting the first-year curriculum today, Weinberg, a trained lawyer who graduated from the USC Gould School of Law, said his answer would have been the same, even before the arrival of ChatGPT. He argues law schools can do far more to prepare students for the realities of practice.

He has no quarrel with the traditional first-year curriculum. "I think where things actually break down," he said, "is that there is almost no hands-on stuff in the second and third year." Summer jobs help. But, in his view, a three-year legal education should more closely resemble the workplace.

Harvey aims to help fix that, though its law school partnership remains light on details. To land on campus, it has to navigate a live debate inside faculties, where purists who want to prohibit the tech to protect core skills are squaring off against pragmatists who want supervised use.

If Harvey can get a foothold in law schools now, the payoff could arrive when today's second-year lawyers become tomorrow's associates and in-house counsel.

Six AI startups are part of Jensen Huang's vision for human-digital workforces.

"Future workforces in enterprise will be a combination of humans and digital humans. Some of them will be OpenAI-based, and some of it would be Harvey-based or Open Evidence or Cursor or Replit or Lovable," the Nvidia CEO said in an interview with Citadel Securities published on Tuesday.

Huang's wide-ranging list included OpenAI, which makes large language models, legal tech darling Harvey, and AI healthcare tool OpenEvidence. Replit, Cursor, and Lovable offer AI-powered coding or "vibe coding" tools.

Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI to build data centers running the chipmaker's systems, the companies said last month.

In his Citadel talk, Huang specifically highlighted Anysphere-owned Cursor. He said that 100% of Nvidia's software engineers and chip designers use Cursor.

"We now have AIs for all of our engineers," he said. "Productivity gains, the work that we do is so much better."

Nvidia declined to comment further.

In June, Business Insider reported that Amazon was in talks with Cursor to adopt the AI coding tool internally after employees demanded it.

Huang has long said that AI and "biological" employees will work together in the future. AI agents break down a task into multiple smaller steps, each tackling a specific part to achieve a broader objective.

In Huang's January keynote at CES, one of the world's largest tech trade shows, he proclaimed, "The age of agentic AI is here."

In a podcast last October, Huang explained how the human and AI employees would work together. He described a future where the technology giant would mass-deploy AI assistants, also called agents, across every division to improve output.

"I'm hoping that Nvidia someday will be a 50,000-employee company with a 100 million, you know, AI assistants, in every single group," Huang said.

Human-AI integration is gaining venture capital attention, too.

Late last month, General Catalyst's CEO Hemant Taneja said that true AI integration has four non-negotiables, and one of them is planning for how humans and AI will work together.

"Some humans are going to manage AI agents. Some AI agents are going to manage humans," he said on a podcast appearance. "Imagine how the org charts have to change."

Cathie Wood says Wall Street is overlooking AI's biggest payoff.

The CEO of Ark Invest said at the All-In Summit 2025 in September that the real AI revolution is happening in hospitals and labs — and investors are barely paying attention.

"The most profound application of AI is in healthcare," Wood said in a discussion posted Tuesday.

She added that combining AI with advances in gene sequencing and CRISPR technology — a technology scientists use to selectively modify the DNA of living organisms — could spark a medical transformation.

"This is the sleeper. It's the most inefficiently priced part of the market," Wood said.

Wood said that five major technologies — AI, robotics, energy storage, blockchain, and genomics — are each entering their steep growth phase. When one advances, it accelerates the others.

That convergence is why healthcare could deliver massive gains for investors willing to bet early, Wood said. Smarter algorithms make gene sequencing faster; cheaper sequencing gives AI more data to learn from; and breakthroughs in gene editing can open the door to new treatments.

It's not the first time Wood has gone against the grain — her funds became famous for early bets on Tesla and Roku.

Wood also said some of the so-called "MAG 6" tech giants — Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet — could see slower growth in the next five years. These giants tripled in valuation in market cap from 2019 to 2024 "because investors were playing it safe, and they were investing only in the largest, most cash-rich stocks."

"That was a very difficult time for innovation for venture capital generally," Wood said, referring to the years when investors stuck with Big Tech. "Now we think it is truly disruptive innovation's time to shine in the market," she added.

Wood did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Her firm managed over $13 billion in May, according to its most recent filing.

AI is quickly reshaping the healthcare industry, and tech's biggest players are racing to stake their claims.

Microsoft has been integrating AI into its cloud solutions to automate hospital operations. Earlier this year, Microsoft said its medical AI system diagnosed cases more accurately than human doctors by a wide margin in a study.

Nvidia is also pushing deeper into the sector. Its VP of healthcare, Kimberly Powell, told Business Insider in April that medical imaging was one of Nvidia's entry points into healthcare. The company has notched a number of medical imaging partnerships powered by its AI platforms, most recently with GE Healthcare in March.

Healthcare startups are rushing in, too. Founders told Business Insider in July that AI could be the breakthrough that helps clinicians multiply their caseloads and earn extra cash without sacrificing care quality.

Kim Dhatt, a 34-year-old recruitment specialist, was in a relationship with her ex-partner for four years. When they first got together, he earned slightly more than she did, and the difference didn't bother either of them. After a series of promotions over 18 months, her salary tripled — and then he couldn't deal, Dhatt says.

Her partner's self-worth was tied directly to his income, and it eroded as her salary grew, Dhatt tells me. He insisted on splitting costs 50-50, leaving her with a disposable income that she wanted to spend on nice things but felt like she couldn't. When she proposed booking a luxury vacation for the two of them, for example, he insisted they go on a cheaper trip and divide the cost. She felt like she was compromising. They argued often, and resentment curdled.

Dhatt's financial success soon exposed a tension that many couples face today: What happens when she earns more than him?

"I'd worked hard to achieve my income level, and I was not reaping the benefits of it," Dhatt says. "When our relationship finally ended, he told me as he left that I have nothing to worry about because of my salary," she adds, which to her revealed how money was "a bigger factor" in their relationship than he'd previously admitted.

Divorce rates in heterosexual couples rise significantly when a woman is more professionally successful than the man, be that in terms of fame or, more commonly, money. Perhaps even more strikingly, studies also show that the marriages most likely to endure are those that most closely fit the traditional pattern of male breadwinner and female homemaker. A 2023 report from the Institute for Family Studies found that couples in which husbands earn more than their wives have the lowest chance of divorce, and that when a man earns upwards of $38,000-a-year more than his wife, the chances of divorce are lowest. The wider the traditional wage gap, it would seem, the stronger the marriage.

Despite recent leaps in progress toward gender equality both in the home and in the workplace, marital inequality might be the last vexing barrier to our ongoing quest for true gender parity.

No doubt one of today's highest profile wage-gap relationships with a female breadwinner is Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. The pop megastar's estimated net worth, about $1.6 billion, is about 30 times the NFL tight end's estimated $52 million.

When the pair announced their engagement in August, Lyz Lenz, a New York Times bestselling author of a memoir about her own divorce, cut through the internet's euphoria by offering some sobering stats and reflections on her own experience.

"The image they are projecting to us is that a successful woman has found a supportive partner, one who eagerly fawns over her new album cover while interviewing her for his own podcast," she wrote on her Substack. "This reality is far from reality for most American women."

Lenz noted that women who succeed as Swift has "are often punished for it" and that she herself has been forced to pay the price of being professionally and economically ambitious. "Every time I succeed, there's a downside. The hate mail gets worse. The man I am dating backs away. A tabloid publishes a scathing story about me," she writes. "I'm so, so tired."

The data corroborates the vibe. A 2013 University of Chicago study of 4,000 married couples in the US found that as soon as a woman out-earns her husband, both are 6% less likely to report a "very happy" marriage. They're also 8% more likely to report marital troubles and 6 percent more likely to discuss separating. A Swedish study from 2016 found that a married woman is twice as likely as a man to be divorced three years after being promoted to CEO. A similar pattern follows in the public sector: Women who are elected to positions like mayor or parliamentarian double the chances of their marriages falling apart.

There are darker findings too. A 2023 study from Australia, for example, found that women who earn more than their male partners are also significantly more likely to be physically and emotionally abused by that partner. "When women's income exceeds that of their partners," the authors write, "the violation of a gender norm creates a strong negative effect."

Scant research is available on the correlation between divorce rates and income inequality in same-sex marriages, but one paper from 2014 found that in those couples bigger earnings gaps also translate to a higher likelihood of a break-up.

More than a dozen women I spoke to for this story told me that money significantly shaped their relationship or marriage. Many men told me the same. And of the women who earned more than their male spouses, the majority said that this had a detrimental impact on their relationship. Several said that it was "the elephant in the room" — something that complicated their relationship but that their male partners didn't want to talk about explicitly.

Sukhy Desangh, a 41-year old management consultant, tells me she was earning more than five times what her ex-fiancé earned. "I realized I was just bank-rolling him," she says. He was humiliated by her being the primary earner in their household, she says. "When we were out for dinner with friends and family, he would message me to say, 'Give me your credit card and I'll pay with it.'"

Several other women said that their partners felt "emasculated" by being out-earned. Two women who asked not to be named said that they felt like their ex-husbands became depressed as a result of not being the primary financial provider. The depression, the women said, turned to bitterness and anger, and ultimately led to the breakdown of the marriages.

"Money wasn't the only reason me and my ex broke up," says Ali, a 34-year old who works in financial services, "but it was a topic of conversation and there were many times he said he wouldn't be able to be with someone long-term who earns more than him. And I was making significantly more than him."

Why have marriages not caught up to the reality of the labor market? Women now hold more managerial positions than ever, and they bring home the bulk of household income in more families than ever. The US gender pay gap, while still stuck at about 82 cents on the dollar, is close to the narrowest it's ever been. What is holding marriages back?

Dené Logan, a marriage and family therapist based in Los Angeles, says that for one, gender norms are set in childhood. "Men are handed a very specific template early in life: protect, provide, procreate — and their worth is tied to it," she says. With that mindset deeply ingrained, Logan adds, when a woman in a heterosexual marriage is financially and professionally successful, it can "trigger resentment" within the man — whether he knows it or not.

Because of these long-standing constructs, men's sense of mission and meaning is still frequently tied up in work and money. "And without a sense of mission or meaning, many men can feel diminished and even threatened," Logan says.

Muriel Wilkins, an executive coach and CEO of a leadership advisory firm, agrees. "What's really happening here is a clash between progress and old expectations," she says. "Beliefs don't change as fast as paychecks do."

"Cultural norms are very sticky," says Ramit Sethi, a bestselling author and podcast host. "We see stickiness," he says, in the "amount of time spent on household chores, emotional labor, and money in relationships." For example, he notes, even though women in urban cities out-earn men in their 20s, dating norms about who picks up the check have been glacially slow to change.

Many of the women I spoke to also said that fault lines in marriages and relationships that were initially caused by money were exacerbated by the fact that men who weren't getting paid as much were also not shouldering as much of the unpaid labor in the home. A Pew study from 2023 found that women in the US still consistently pick up more household chores and caregiving responsibilities. That's true in marriages in which the man outearns the woman, but also in those in which both spouses earn roughly the same amount, and even when the wife is the primary earner. The only marriages in which husbands devoted more time to caregiving than their wives were those in which the wife was the sole household earner. In those situations, wives and husbands spent roughly the same amount of time per week on household chores.

"It felt like a double whammy," one woman says of her husband, who was laid off shortly after they got married. "He wasn't working, which made him angry and resentful, but then he refused to do almost anything around the house while I was earning for the both of us. And that made me angry and resentful," she says. "If that's not a recipe for disaster, then I don't know what is."

There are, of course, exceptions to the female breadwinner trend.

Brian Tan and his wife, who live in New York, have been married for two years and in a relationship for eight. They started their careers earning the same salary at the same financial services firm. After that, he switched employers and took a job which paid about double her salary. But since then, he's started working for a children's hospital and she's moved into tech. She now earns between 70 and 80% more than him, Tan says, and it's not an issue in their marriage.

He says there are several reasons her outearning him doesn't bother him. "The first is that I view it as one big pool of money. The second is that this is a pendulum that swings both ways — there was a period where I made more, then we made the same amount, then she makes more now," says Tan. "A third reason is that I'm truly proud of her, and to be genuinely proud of someone, all feelings of jealousy disappear from one's mindset; I want her to feel fulfilled and intellectually stimulated, and the fact that she gets paid a lot while doing her job is a win-win for me."

One woman based in the UK who asked not to be named tells me that she has four sisters. "We all earn more than our husbands — all six figures," she says. "Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but we are all married." The key to success, she said, is being open and communicating, especially when conflicts arise.

Natasha, a 37-year old marketing executive, says that her family is very traditional in terms of gender norms. By earning double what her husband earns, she sometimes feels like she's simultaneously living both outside of traditional gender norms and inside of them — "a sort of double existence that can feel stressful," she says. But crucially, she's been happily married to her husband for seven years — they just had a baby. The pay differential doesn't bother him, she says. "I think that's evidence of his maturity and confidence."

Another woman told me that when she first met the man who became her husband, she was earning "a thousand times" more than him. They've now been together for a decade, and she's still earning about 40 percent more than him. "It's never ever been a problem," she said. And he agrees: "Unless it's a problem for my wife, I'm secure enough in myself and in our relationship for it to not even be a consideration."

William Conrad and his girlfriend Levi Coralynn, who are both in their 20s, have garnered an enormous social media following — he has about 1.3 million TikTok followers, she about 2.3 million— for publicly and performatively living out an atypical heterosexual relationship. Coralynn, a content creator, is the primary earner, while Conrad seemingly takes care of the bulk of the domestic work.

Muriel Wilkins said that she does think things will eventually change, especially as Gen Zers like Conrad and Coralynn are questioning and pushing back against outdated norms. But it will take time, she said, and progress will only materialize if individual couples are prepared to confront these outdated norms head-on.

"Couples have to talk openly about expectations — who does what, what success means, what partnership really looks like — rather than just falling back on the old scripts," she says. "They need to redefine what success looks like in their marriage. Together, they can stop asking, 'Who's the breadwinner?' and start asking, 'How do we win together?'"

Dené Logan put it more bluntly: "Your husband is not the patriarchy." In other words, frustration over inequality in marriage often has roots beyond the individual relationship. And recognizing that distinction is key to avoiding misplaced resentment.

Progress won't come from paychecks alone. It will come, says Wilkins, "when we stop treating money as the measure of power in a marriage, and start seeing partnership as a balance of respect, care, and shared responsibility." Equality doesn't necessarily mean sameness, says Logan, it means rewriting the story of marriage for a new era.

In a world glued to screens, Aziz Ansari is choosing the analog life.

During an appearance on Tuesday's episode of the "Good Hang with Amy Poehler" podcast, the comedian spoke about his Luddite ways and why he isn't a fan of ChatGPT.

"I don't have email. I haven't had email for, like, 10 years. But I have an assistant," Ansari told podcast host Amy Poehler.

And it's not just his inbox that he's abandoned.

"I have a flip phone. If I get really lost, I've got to either ask people or just call my wife and be like 'Hey.' I've had to do that before, like, call my wife, and to the point where she's kind of used to it," Ansari said.

Instead of using an app to call for an Uber, Ansari says he hails a taxi. If there isn't one, he'll call, he added.

Living a low-tech lifestyle has its benefits, Ansari said.

"It just gives me more space to think. I mean, I heard something about, like, Tarantino doesn't even have a phone. Chris Nolan doesn't have a phone. I was like, 'Whoa, those guys are able to get a lot of stuff done. Maybe there's something to it,'" he said.

The comedian says he is also wary of ChatGPT.

"It's outsourcing critical thinking. It's making everyone's opinions kind of the same," Ansari said.

Not only is AI prone to making mistakes, it reinforces what people already think, he added.

The comedian said he once saw a commercial in which someone asked ChatGPT how to make dinner for a date.

"I would rather call someone and ask someone, or maybe have some sort of conversation, a human thing. It just seems like it's like outsourcing thinking, and it's like killing some bit of humanity," Ansari said.

Speaking to People in September, Ansari said he knows that his ability to live offline comes with a certain level of privilege and isn't realistic for everyone.

"But for me, it helps me keep a clear head to help me write and do what's more important for my job," he said.

A representative for Ansari did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.

Ansari isn't the only celebrity who has spoken about preferring an analog lifestyle.

In July 2023, Christopher Nolan said he doesn't carry a smartphone or use email. The filmmaker said he writes scripts on a computer without the internet.

"If I'm generating my material and writing my own scripts, being on a smartphone all day wouldn't be very useful for me," Nolan told The Hollywood Reporter.

Dolly Parton said during an October 2023 appearance on "The View" that she still prefers communicating via fax because otherwise, she'd be overwhelmed by all the messages she gets.

"So I never did get into getting involved in all that because it'll take up too much of my time if I talked to everybody who is trying to get in touch with me," Parton said.

In January, Christopher Walken told The Wall Street Journal that his relationship with technology is nearly nonexistent.

"I only have a satellite dish on my house. So I've seen 'Severance' on DVDs that they're good enough to send me. I don't have a cellphone. I've never emailed or, what do you call it, Twittered," Walken said.

It's not just Hollywood: In a May story, regular people told Business Insider that they swapped smartphones for dumb phones to wean themselves off their screens and social media.

Some Gen Zs are even chaining their smartphones to a wall — creating a makeshift landline —and freeing themselves from the urge to scroll.

Former Ford CEO Mark Fields said on Tuesday that US automakers overestimated consumer demand when they started ramping up production of electric vehicles.

"Over the last couple of years, the automakers really went full bore in putting in capacity for EVs," Fields, 64, told CNBC's "Power Lunch."

"They really didn't have a good discussion on the consumer, in terms of what it was going to take to get the consumer to buy these EV products," Fields said.

Representatives for Fields did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Fields started his career at Ford in 1989 after graduating with an MBA from Harvard Business School. He held a variety of senior leadership positions at Ford, and was the company's chief operating officer from 2012 to 2014 and its CEO from 2014 to 2017.

Some of the big bets automakers made on EVs have come undone "over the last 18 months or so," Fields told CNBC.

General Motors said in an exchange filing on Tuesday that it was taking a $1.6 billion charge "based on a planned strategic realignment of our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint to consumer demand."

The company said it expected the "adoption rate of EVs to slow" after the Trump administration eliminated federal EV incentives.

Under the Biden administration, EV buyers were entitled to a $7,500 consumer tax credit if they bought a new EV and a $4,000 consumer tax credit for a used EV. Both schemes expired on September 30.

"This is clearly an issue where the market didn't develop the way automakers thought. A lot of them, particularly in GM's case, boasted that they had the full lineup of EVs," Fields said on Tuesday.

"And what was an advantage, at least they thought at the time, has now probably turned into a bit of an albatross as the market take-up of EVs is going to be lower, at least in the near to medium term, than they plan for," he continued.

Auto chiefs have expressed mixed views on whether the rollback of federal EV incentives would hurt the US EV market.

Ford's current CEO, Jim Farley, said last month that the expiry of federal EV incentives could halve US EV sales.

"I think it's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought," Farley said on September 30.

Former Tesla president Jon McNeill, however, thought otherwise. McNeill said in an interview with CNBC on October 2 that the market can continue to "grow without subsidies."

"In Europe, France and Germany in particular rolled subsidies off a couple of years ago, and what happened after that, surprisingly, was the market continued to grow," McNeill said.

"That's largely because the models continue to roll out from other OEMs, much like they have here," McNeill added, using the acronym for original equipment manufacturers.

A federal jury is set to hear opening statements in Manhattan on Tuesday in the fraud and conspiracy trial of two MIT-educated brothers accused in a lightning-fast, $25 million cryptocurrency heist.

The defendants — Anton Peraire-Bueno, 25, of Boston, and James Peraire-Bueno, 29, of New York City — will face a jury of their peers in the complicated case, at least in terms of education.

The daylong jury selection on Monday resulted in a four-woman, eight-man panel consisting entirely of individuals with college degrees.

Half of the jurors hold master's degrees, including in finance, the sciences, medicine, and education.

The jurors, almost all of whom are middle- or retirement-aged, will return to court on Tuesday morning, when they'll be sworn in, listen to opening statements, and hear the first government witnesses by the end of the day.

The openings promise to describe a complex, multi-step transaction on the Ethereum blockchain that left the brothers $25 million richer, while a trio of traders were left holding a pile of worthless, illiquid junk crypto.

Prosecutors say the "first-of-its-kind" fraud scheme took months of meticulous planning and was executed in just 12 seconds on a day in April 2023.

Before and after the alleged exploit, prosecutors say, the brothers typed in internet searches that included: "how to wash crypto," "top crypto lawyers," "fraudulent Ethereum addresses database," and "money laundering statue [sic] of limitations."

Prosecutors allege that the brothers studied the trading behaviors of the victim traders before the heist, then took steps afterward to hide their identities and the location of the pilfered cryptocurrency. They've promised to reveal a web of shell companies, private cryptocurrency addresses, and foreign cryptocurrency exchanges.

"Using the specialized skills developed during their education, as well as their expertise in cryptocurrency trading," the brothers "exploited the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain," prosecutors said in a 19-page indictment last year.

The brothers, who remain free on $250,000 bail each, have strongly contested the prosecution's accusations.

Their defense attorneys have argued that there was no fraud at all and that they merely outsmarted some "predatory" automated trading bots.

The alleged victims lost their cryptocurrency "through pre-programmed trades without ever interacting with the Peraire-Buenos, directly or indirectly," the defense lawyers argued earlier this year, in a failed motion to dismiss the indictment.

In a blow to the defense last week, US District Judge Jessica G. L. Clarke barred the Peraire-Bueno's lawyers from arguing, as she put it, "that the victims deserved this."

The judge also barred defense experts from testifying about the lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency market.

The trial is expected to last into early November.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nian Yang-yi, 34, a barista turned quality control specialist at a coffee trading firm in Taiwan. The following has been translated and edited for length and clarity.

I chose to study computer science and information engineering in college because I didn't like interacting with people.

Programming seemed perfect: I could spend all day on a computer, coding and debugging. At the time, I was happy with this choice and imagined my future would follow that path.

But life is unexpected. In my third year of college, I had a sports accident that caused a retinal detachment. I went through surgery, and afterward, the doctor told me to rest and not overuse my eyes.

If I became an engineer right away, the pressure on my eyes would be even greater. So my plan was simple: work somewhere else for two or three years, let my eyes recover, and then return to writing code.

That's how I ended up at a café. At first, I didn't drink coffee at all, and I didn't like it. But my boss and coworkers encouraged me to try it. They brewed me a cup every day.

At first, I refused, but eventually I tried a cup — and something clicked. It felt like coding: Could I make this more precise, more efficient? Could I describe what I tasted so others could understand?

So, I started studying sensory skills and how to communicate flavors. That was how I became absorbed in coffee.

I worked as a barista at that café for 10 years.

Outside of work, I was still involved in coffee — going to tastings, events, and classes.

At first, I thought coffee was straightforward — as long as I could brew drinks that customers enjoyed and my coworkers liked, it felt like I had already learned everything there was to learn.

But once I started going out and experiencing more, I realized coffee is something you can never fully master. People often say the more you study a subject, the more you realize how little you understand — and that was exactly how I felt about coffee.

It was partly why I left the café to join a coffee trading firm. I had met the boss in a coffee course, and he asked years later if I wanted to try working there.

I felt I had to do it because coffee is not just about making drinks. It is a whole supply chain — farmers, importers, roasters — and I wanted to learn more.

I'm now in my third year as a quality control specialist.

In the café, my skills were in brewing and serving customers. But upstream, the needs are different: evaluating beans, checking consistency, and thinking about market demand.

When I moved, my salary dropped from nearly 50,000 Taiwan dollars a month, about $1,600, to about 35,000 Taiwan dollars. Now, I earn about 42,000 Taiwan dollars.

This job has broadened my perspective on the coffee supply chain. In my fourth month, I earned the internationally recognized Arabica Q Grader certification.

Coffee changed me as a person. I used to avoid human interaction, but being a barista meant I had to understand customers, chat, and connect with them.

At first, it was a big challenge. Conversations often dropped awkwardly. But over time, I developed ways to interact more comfortably, learned to listen, and sense how people were feeling.

In 2022, I started volunteering at a community café for Believe in Next Generation, a nonprofit, where I regularly serve as a barista when the café offers coffee for a donation.

The nonprofit is located in a military village, and some elderly residents would come early, wait for me, and smile when I arrived. They didn't directly say they needed companionship, but I could feel it.

Sometimes, they stayed in the café and told me their life stories and memories, many from Taiwan's martial law years or the Japanese colonial era.

This is one of coffee's meanings: It gives people a chance to gather and share their stories.

Some of my engineering friends have told me they envy me for turning my interest into a job — until the topic of salary comes up, because their salaries can be two to three times mine.

I have wondered whether I should continue doing what I want to do or return to a more practical job.

At this stage of life — from your twenties into your early thirties — many people are buying cars and houses. But coffee is the industry that makes me feel the happiest and most at ease.

Now, I live with my parents in New Taipei City and share a mortgage with my sister for our family home. I pay about 15,000 Taiwan dollars a month toward it.

To manage, I spend less on recreation, like traveling once every three or four years. Since coffee is also my hobby, most of my discretionary spending goes to coffee courses or activities.

I can usually save 10,000 to 15,000 Taiwan dollars a month.

I also look for ways to increase my income through side hustles, such as judging coffee competitions and teaching courses. These can add about 5% to 10% to my monthly income.

Some people choose high-paying jobs and use their salaries to fund hobbies. Others, like me, turned their passion into work, even with less money.

The first step is to imagine the kind of life you want, and then decide if your passion is strong enough to carry you there.

If I could start over, my choice probably wouldn't change — it would still be coffee.

In an embarrassing error, PayPal blockchain partner Paxos accidentally minted 300 trillion of the PYUSD token today. PayPal's stablecoin, which it debuted in 2023, is supposed to be redeemable at a 1:1 rate for US dollars. $300 trillion is more than double the entire world's current GDP of $117 trillion. In short, that's a really bad mistake from Paxos.

At least the action did appear to be a mistake. Paxos acknowledged the issue in a post on X, assuring clients that their funds are secure and stating that it burned the excess reserves of stablecoins. The company claimed that "this was an internal technical error.” Maybe so, but internal technical errors can still wreak havoc pretty quickly when it comes to finance, especially in the fantasy worlds of blockchain and crypto.

The trial of two MIT-educated brothers accused of stealing $25 million worth of Ethereum kicked off in Manhattan federal court this week, with a prosecutor claiming that the alleged scheme questions “the very integrity of the blockchain” itself.

Anton Peraire-Bueno, 25, and his brother James Peraire-Bueno, 29, “manipulated and tampered with the process and protocols by which transactions are validated and added to the Ethereum blockchain” in order to gain access to victims' digital assets.

The Peraire-Bueno brothers, however, argue that the exploit wasn't fraud at all and was not illegal in the first place—raising a fundamental question about where the legality of the blockchain ends and criminal manipulation begins.

In a May 2024 statement, former U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York said the case brings “the very integrity of the blockchain into question.”

“The brothers, who studied computer science and math at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, allegedly used their specialized skills and education to tamper with and manipulate the protocols relied upon by millions of Ethereum users across the globe,” Williams said. “And once they put their plan into action, their heist only took 12 seconds to complete.”

The Peraire-Bueno brothers were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering last year.

Both brothers face a maximum sentence of 20 years for each count. Their trial began on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court and could last through the first week of November.

Earlier this year, the brothers' legal team filed a motion to prevent the prosecution from using their Google search history as part of the case, calling it “unfairly prejudicial.”

However, prosecutors claim the alleged crypto scheme was “meticulously planned” and took “numerous steps to conceal their identities and lay the groundwork to conceal the stolen proceeds.”

As the trial intensifies, it is unclear if the brothers will testify in their own defense.

October 15, 2025 – The cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem stands at the precipice of a profound transformation, driven by a wave of innovative technologies poised to redefine scalability, privacy, user experience, and real-world integration. From modular blockchain architectures to the cryptographic marvels of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and the tangible impact of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs), these advancements, gaining significant traction from late 2023 through 2025, are addressing the core limitations that have historically hindered mainstream Web3 adoption.

This burgeoning landscape is fostering a palpable sense of optimism within the crypto community, with many hailing these innovations as the catalysts for the next major bull run. The immediate perceived impact is a concerted effort to make blockchain technology more intuitive, secure, and integrated with daily life, moving beyond speculative trading to deliver substantial utility. This matters immensely for the crypto ecosystem as it signals a maturation of the industry, shifting focus towards foundational infrastructure and user-centric design that can onboard billions of new users and unlock trillions in real-world value.

The market leading up to October 15, 2025, has been a dynamic canvas reflecting both the promise of these emerging technologies and the broader macroeconomic currents. While some innovations are still in nascent stages of direct tokenization, others have already demonstrated measurable impacts on associated tokens.

Modular Blockchains, exemplified by projects like Celestia (TIA), are viewed as a foundational shift towards greater scalability and flexibility. The TIA token, focusing on data availability, experienced significant volatility. After a surge to $1 on October 14, it had previously plummeted to a new all-time low of $0.27 on October 10, following a broader crypto market deleveraging event. Token unlocks, including 9.62 million TIA tokens worth approximately $9.6 million on October 5, and the exit of Polychain Capital, which sold its remaining 43 million TIA back to the Celestia Foundation, contributed to supply pressure and market uncertainty. Despite the "disillusionment" period, the underlying technology's long-term potential continues to attract developer interest, indicating a discerning market seeking real utility.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are garnering distinctly bullish sentiment, anticipated to drive the next major crypto bull run. The market sees ZKPs as the "missing link" for widespread blockchain adoption, crucial for scaling networks, ensuring transactional privacy, and enabling regulatory compliance. ZKP-based systems are projected to grow 35% annually, reaching $5.6 billion by 2027. This heightened interest is projected to drive increased trading volume and enhanced liquidity for ZKP-related tokens such as Polygon (MATIC), Mina Protocol (MINA), and Loopring (LRC), as upcoming ZKP whitelists and presales generate intense anticipation.

Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) have seen their ecosystem surge past $16 billion in market capitalization as of late 2025, projected to reach $669 million by 2032. Solana has rapidly emerged as a hub for DePIN projects, hosting over 50 projects with a collective market capitalization of $3.5 billion. While the sector experienced substantial growth in 2024, it struggled against other crypto metas in 2025, with tokens like Helium (HNT) battling support levels around $3.10-$3.20 in September 2025, having experienced a "long, painful grind down." However, Render (RENDER) found support at $6.80 and was poised for a potential 60% surge. Experts believe 2025 will be a "breakthrough year" for DePIN, transitioning from speculative excitement to infrastructure reality.

Account Abstraction and Intent-Centric Architecture are protocol-level innovations that, while not having directly associated investment tokens in the same way as L1s or specific dApps, indirectly impact the market by enhancing user experience and increasing utility. Increased adoption of these features could indirectly lead to higher trading volumes and liquidity on networks that support them, such as Ethereum (ETH), by simplifying transactions and onboarding more users. Ethereum itself experienced significant volatility, surging above $4,700 in early October 2025 due to institutional inflows, before dipping below $3,800 due to macro tensions and then rebounding.

Restaking, popularized by protocols like EigenLayer, has introduced a new "yield meta," reshaping capital efficiency. EigenLayer's EIGEN token saw a dramatic 33% price increase in mid-September 2025, climbing from $1.50 to $2.09, driven by partnerships and broader risk sentiment improvements. However, EIGEN also experienced downward pressure, projected to prolong a negative trend in October 2025, with token unlocks (e.g., 36.82 million EIGEN tokens unlocked on October 1, 2025) contributing to supply. Trading in EIGEN surged over 260% in a 24-hour period during its rally but showed weak volume in mid-October, suggesting limited buying interest.

The broader market context, including a "historic deleveraging event" between October 10-14, 2025, saw an estimated $19-20 billion in leveraged positions liquidated. This was triggered by macro policy shifts, excessive market leverage, and a sharp drop in liquidity, with Bitcoin (BTC) plunging from over $126,000 to below $105,000. This event, while painful, is viewed by analysts as a crucial market reset, purging speculative excess and laying a healthier foundation for utility-driven growth.

The crypto community and ecosystem are demonstrating strong engagement and a largely positive sentiment towards these emerging technologies, viewing them as critical for addressing existing blockchain limitations, enhancing user experience, and driving mainstream Web3 adoption.

Modular Blockchains are met with strong positive sentiment, seen as a significant evolution from monolithic architectures. Discussions highlight their ability to enhance scalability, reduce transaction costs, and improve overall performance by separating core blockchain functions. Influencers recognize modular blockchains as setting a new standard for how crypto platforms scale and interact, emphasizing the full-stack flexibility they offer. Projects like Arbitrum, Manta Network, Celestia, Optimism, and Berachain are frequently highlighted. PancakeSwap is integrating Layer 2 modular solutions for faster DeFi trading, Solana is collaborating with modular ecosystems to offload data availability tasks, and Binance's (BNB) NFT platform is adopting modular models to handle traffic surges.

Sentiment around Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) is overwhelmingly enthusiastic. The crypto community views ZKPs as a revolutionary cryptographic technique poised to drive the next major bull run, with discussions frequently labeling upcoming ZKP whitelists and presales as "rare entry points" and "Ethereum moments." There's a palpable "buzz" on platforms like Crypto Twitter and Reddit, recognizing ZKPs as the "math behind the next bull run" and a "missing link" for widespread blockchain adoption. Influencers are actively championing ZKP projects, predicting they will redefine how digital societies adjudicate truth. ZKPs are crucial for scaling decentralized networks, ensuring transactional privacy, and enabling regulatory compliance, with projects like zkSync, StarkWare, and Polygon zkEVM experiencing renewed attention.

DePINs represent one of the hottest sectors of 2024, characterized by considerable excitement and optimism. The community sees DePINs as a foundational element for a resilient, user-empowered internet, promising enhanced security and improved uptime. There's a strong belief that DePINs will be instrumental in onboarding the next billion users into Web3. Major crypto influencers are "betting heavily" on DePINs as the "next significant hype." Leading projects include Helium (decentralized wireless), Akash Network (decentralized compute), and Filecoin (decentralized storage). IoTeX aims to onboard 100 million devices and unlock trillions of dollars in real-world value on-chain by 2025.

The community around Account Abstraction (AA) has expanded significantly, particularly with the widespread adoption of ERC-4337. Discussions center on AA's potential to revolutionize the user experience of on-chain interactions and accelerate mass adoption by making blockchain more intuitive and accessible. Ethereum developers, including Vitalik Buterin, are actively debating achieving "long-term goal alignment" for an account system revamp that incorporates quantum resistance and transaction batching. The anticipated inclusion of EIP-7702 in the Pectra upgrade in 2025 is considered a major development. AA is expected to lead to programmable wallets, enabling innovative use cases like subscription payments and social recovery.

The concept of Intent-Centric Architecture has gained significant traction, with major institutions like Paradigm identifying it as a top area of interest. The sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, focusing on its potential to drastically improve the Web3 user experience by simplifying complex blockchain interactions. Thought leaders consider intent-centric design one of the most critical UX and architectural shifts in Web3, highlighting its capacity to simplify onboarding, reduce errors, lower costs, and broaden adoption. This architecture is anticipated to streamline DeFi operations, enhance security, and improve user experience, with projects like Enso Finance's Intent Engine and Cow Swap already utilizing this approach.

Discussions surrounding Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) are marked by a sense of urgency and preparedness. The community acknowledges the impending threat of quantum computers potentially compromising current cryptographic systems. There is a strong focus on how to future-proof decentralized platforms. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has advocated for an account system revamp that includes quantum computer resistance. PQC is crucial for protecting wallet security, DeFi protocols, NFTs, digital identity, and interoperability bridges.

While Restaking has gained significant traction in DeFi for capital efficiency, and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a crucial privacy technology, specific widespread social media sentiment and community discussions for these particular aspects were not prominently detailed in the research leading up to October 15, 2025. However, their underlying technical importance is widely acknowledged.

The period from October 2025 onwards promises to be a pivotal era for the crypto market, characterized by the convergence and maturation of these emerging technologies, driving unprecedented growth and mainstream adoption.

In the short-term (October 2025 – 2027), the market will experience increased efficiency, improved user experiences, and a surge in institutional interest. Modular Blockchains will see increased deployment of appchains and wider adoption of ZK-Rollup platforms, significantly reducing gas fees and transaction times. Zero-Knowledge Proofs will drive the next bull run, with ZKP-based solutions projected to process over 60% of Ethereum's Layer-2 transactions by year-end 2025, unlocking new utility for Web3. DePINs will transition from speculative excitement to large-scale application, with their global market expected to surpass $32 billion by the end of 2025, becoming a cornerstone of digital infrastructure, especially driven by AI industry demand. Account Abstraction will accelerate crypto adoption by making Web3 as intuitive as mobile banking, removing barriers for millions of new users. Restaking will have a dramatic impact on the DeFi industry, boosting liquidity and yield, and attracting more individual and institutional investors. Intent-Centric Architecture will bring millions of new users into the Web3 ecosystem by making blockchain services feel as intuitive as regular apps, enabling new classes of AI-native protocols.

In the long-term (2028 Onwards), these technologies will fundamentally reshape the internet, financial systems, and digital interactions, moving towards a more private, secure, and user-centric Web3. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), though still maturing, will become crucial for enabling privacy-preserving computation on blockchains, facilitating the handling of sensitive institutional and personal data without decryption. This capability is vital for integrating blockchain into sectors requiring strict data confidentiality and regulatory compliance. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) will become an existential imperative. As quantum computers pose a tangible threat, all critical blockchain infrastructure and digital assets will undergo a mandatory transition to PQC, ensuring the long-term integrity and security of the digital economy.

Cross-cutting catalysts include continued institutional adoption and regulatory clarity, with approvals of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs driving significant inflows. The fusion of AI and blockchain is a major trend, with AI enhancing scalability, risk management, and powering AI agents interacting with DePINs and intent-centric systems. The tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWAs) is expected to accelerate, bridging traditional and digital finance. Enhanced UX/UI through Account Abstraction and Intent-Centric Architecture will be critical for mass adoption.

Strategic considerations for projects include embracing modularity, prioritizing user experience, leveraging ZKPs for privacy and scalability, exploring DePINs, and preparing for PQC migration. For investors, diversification into foundational infrastructure, identifying user-centric innovations, evaluating security and privacy roadmaps, monitoring the regulatory landscape, and looking for real-world utility are paramount. A long-term investment horizon is crucial, recognizing that the full impact of these emerging technologies will unfold over several years.

The crypto market in October 2025 is at a pivotal juncture, transitioning from speculative interest to a more mature, secure, scalable, and user-friendly ecosystem. The advancements in modularity, privacy (ZKPs, FHE), user experience (Account Abstraction, Intent-Centric Architecture), and long-term security (PQC) are directly addressing the historical barriers to mainstream adoption.

Key takeaways for crypto investors and enthusiasts:

The long-term significance of these technologies for crypto adoption cannot be overstated. They are the building blocks for a future where blockchain technology seamlessly integrates into global financial and digital infrastructure.

Oops, something went wrong

Publicly traded digital asset treasury and advertising firm Thumzup Media is considering integrating Dogecoin (DOGE) reward payments for users of its Thumzup app. 

The app provides users with cash rewards when they share content about advertiser's products. Thumzup believes integrating DOGE as another payment option could lower fees and improve settlement of cross-border micro-payments. 

“Exploring Dogecoin integration is an important next step in our journey to create a scalable, low-friction rewards engine," Thumzup CEO Robert Steele said in a statement. "If successful, this change could improve our unit economics and increase appeal to a broader, crypto-friendly creator base."

As part of early assessments, the firm said it believes adding DOGE could improve user satisfaction and experience while improving reward pools as other costs are cut.

Thumzup was first connected to Dogecoin in July when it began considering expansions of its Bitcoin treasury into alternative assets like DOGE, Solana (SOL), and XRP. 

Later, the Trump family-backed firm raised $50 million to add to its digital asset treasury, and agreed to acquire Dogecoin mining firm Dogehash in an all-stock deal that aimed to create a leading Dogecoin mining platform. 

Ahead of the completed acquisition, Thumzup provided Dogehash with a $2.5 million loan in September to accelerate the bettering of its Dogecoin mining suite.

Oops, something went wrong

Shares in publicly traded Ethereum treasury firm ETHZilla (ETHZ) fell nearly 5% Wednesday following an announcement that the firm is enacting a 1-for-10 reverse stock split.

The Palm Beach, Florida-based firm expects the split to become effective in trading at market open on October 20, at which point every 10 shares of outstanding ETHZ will be converted into one share.

“As part of ETHZilla's effort to expand engagement with institutional investors, the reverse split is designed to provide these investors with access to collateral and margin availability associated with stock prices greater than $10.00,” the firm posted on X.

“This decision reflects a strategic alignment with institutional standards, enabling broader participation from sophisticated capital into ETHZilla and positioning it for long-term growth.”

The firm's outstanding share count will drop from around 160 million to approximately 16 million as part of the split. It cited mutual fund minimum share price limitations as part of its rationale.

ETHZilla, formerly known as 180 Life Sciences, adopted an Ethereum treasury strategy and rebranded in late July, aiming to make a splash as one of the largest Ethereum holders in the world.

It initially secured $425 million via a PIPE offering to kickstart its Ethereum treasury.

Shortly after its strategy announcement, shares in the firm skyrocketed as it was unveiled that Peter Thiel and related entities acquired around a 7.5% equity stake in ETHZilla. But just a couple of weeks later, shares had fallen sharply, leading to a $250 million share buyback.

Despite trading above $10.00 per share at one point, ETHZ finished the trading day at $1.83, down almost 5% on the day. Shares are up more than 105% in the last six months, though.

The firm owns 102,246 ETH at present time, valuing its treasury at around $407 million at current ETH prices. The haul is good enough to make ETHZilla the sixth-largest publicly traded Ethereum treasury.

"The stock split has no impact on our ETH accumulation plans. It is important to note that ETH accumulation is only one part of ETHZilla's business model—we are not a traditional DAT," ETHZilla SVP, Corporate Communications and IR John Kristoff told Decrypt.

"ETHZilla is currently working to offer tokenization solutions, DeFi protocol integration, blockchain analytics, traditional-to-digital asset conversion gateways and other DeFi services," he added. "We will be updating the market on our progress on these and other initiatives in the coming weeks and months."

Palmer Luckey's ambitious crypto-friendly digital banking startup Erebor has received conditional approval from regulators to start operations, federal officials announced Wednesday.

As The Post was first to report, Luckey, the 32-year-old tech mogul known for leading the fast-growing defense firm Anduril, is among the chief backers for Erebor – which aims to aims to provide a stable option for Silicon Valley firms and tech entrepreneurs to park their money and cryptocurrency outside traditional banks.

Tech investor Joe Lonsdale of venture firm 8VC is another key backer for Erebor, as is Peter Thiel's Founders Fund.

Conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an independent branch of the US Treasury, marked a crucial step forward for the startup, which is based in Columbus, Ohio. It still needs to clear a few more regulatory hurdles before it can open for business – a process likely to take several months.

“Today's decision is also proof that the OCC under my leadership does not impose blanket barriers to banks that want to engage in digital asset activities,” Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gould said in a statement.

“Permissible digital asset activities, like any other legally permissible banking activity, have a place in the federal banking system if conducted in a safe and sound manner,” he added.

An Erebor representative declined to comment.

Luckey is listed as Erebor's principal shareholder and a member of its board of directors. Owen Rapaport, the cofounder of crypto-monitoring company Aer Compliance, is listed as Erebor's CEO.

The startup's unusual name is a reference to the mountain where the dragon Smaug stores his hoard of gold in J.R.R. Tolkien's “The Lord of The Rings” prequel “The Hobbit.”

Sources previously told The Post that Erebor will handle cash plus deposits in stablecoin, a class of digital currency with value directly pegged to a “stable” asset like the US dollar or gold.

Talks about Erebor began soon after the sudden collapse in 2023 of Silicon Valley Bank and accelerated as some tech investors grumbled about crypto and crypto-adjacent startups getting “debanked” by traditional institutions during the Biden administration.

Luckey is not expected to play a role in Erebor's day-to-day operations.

President Trump — who got backing from Luckey and Lonsdale as well as many other tech and crypto executives during his 2024 campaign — has taken a much friendlier regulatory approach to the industry.

Luckey and his allies also are seeking an alternative to traditional fractional reserve banking – where banks deploy most of their client deposits while keeping a relatively small amount in reserve at any given time.

Insiders say Erebor will focus on helping tech entrepreneurs build their businesses as opposed to maximizing returns on deposits.

Eric Trump, son of U.S. President Donald Trump and a co-founder of decentralized finance protocol WLFI$0.1381, said he is actively working on a real estate tokenization project tied to a building currently under development.

Teasing the plan in an interview with CoinDesk TV coming next week, he said the effort may offer fractional ownership to the public, potentially using the crypto rails built by World Liberty Financial.

"We are working on it as it pertains to one specific building that I'm doing right now," Trump said in the interview. "I think it's going to be absolutely incredible."

His comments followed Zach Witkoff, another WLFI co-founder, who floated plans to bring the Trump real estate portfolio onchain during a panel discussion at the Token2049 event in Singapore in early October.

Tokenization refers to the process of turning traditional assets such as bonds, credit, equity – or, as in this case – real estate into digital tokens that can be bought, sold and transferred on blockchain rails. It's a model increasingly explored by global banks and asset managers as a way to unlock liquidity and broaden investor access to traditionally exclusive asset classes.

Trump suggested in the interview on Wednesday that applying the tokenization model could open investment opportunities to his family's global base of supporters. He said he envisions offering micro-shares in "high-profile properties" directly to retail investors, instead of getting financing through traditional lenders.

"If I decided to build a hotel in Washington, D.C. or in Dubai or in New York, why do I have to go out using Deutsche Bank?" he said. "Why can't I go out to the masses?"

He described a model where investors might contribute as little as $1,000 to gain partial ownership of a building, with added benefits like hotel perks or exclusive access.

While details remain scarce, he indicated the initiative would be integrated with World Liberty Financial and its U.S. dollar stablecoin USD1. World Liberty Financial launched last year with a focus on merging crypto infrastructure with traditional financial services.

The protocol announced plans last month to roll out a debit card and retail application soon, a move that would make the USD1 stablecoin available for everyday payments, CoinDesk reported.

The full interview will air on October 21 on CoinDesk's YouTube channel.

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) is battling to hold the $4,000 level while Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA) clings to $0.65, with both charts nearing breakout zones that could decide the next altcoin rally.

ADA Key Technical Levels (Source: TradingView)

Cardano's price structure that began in November 2024 is reaching its apex. 

The token trades around $0.67 as of Oct. 15, after sliding toward the lower boundary of a long-term symmetrical triangle.

The daily chart shows consolidation between descending resistance from the $1.50 peak and ascending support near $0.42. 

ADA recently retested this base after rejection at $0.95 earlier in October. 

Major EMAs now act as layered resistance between $0.77 and $0.84. 

The Parabolic SAR aligns near $0.84, reinforcing this ceiling.

A drop below $0.65 could expose stronger demand near $0.55 to $0.58. 

A rebound above $0.77 may open targets at $0.80 and $1.00 if momentum improves.

ADA Netflows (Source: Coinglass)

On-chain data shows consistent outflows in October, indicating that investors are moving ADA to private wallets. 

Netflows on Oct. 15 totaled negative $8.08 million. While this reduces selling pressure, it also narrows trading liquidity.

ADA Derivqtive Analysis (Source: Coinglass)

Derivatives activity has declined sharply. ADA futures volume is down 34.9% on the day, and open interest has slipped 3.7% to $682 million. 

Options volume is nearly inactive, down 92.9%. Long-short ratios still favor bulls, with Binance accounts showing 2.6 longs for every short.

In the last 24 hours, $2.04 million in ADA positions were liquidated, mostly from longs. The data shows leveraged traders remain exposed even as overall positioning turns cautious.

ETH Price Analysis (Source: TradingView)

Ethereum slipped to $3,996 on Oct. 15, down about 3% in the session, testing key support within its year-long ascending triangle. 

The move follows heavy exchange outflows and increased liquidations across derivatives markets.

The daily chart shows ETH compressed between an ascending trendline from April and descending resistance from the $4,800 peak. 

Price now trades near $3,950 to $4,000, where the 50-day EMA ($3,979) offers immediate support. 

A hold above this range could spark a rebound toward $4,230 and $4,639. A close below may expose the 200-day EMA at $3,546 and deeper support near $3,400.

The Parabolic SAR remains overhead at $4,639, signaling that buyers have yet to regain control.

ETH Netflows (Source: Coinglass)

Exchange data shows $65.28 million in ETH outflows on Oct. 15, consistent with the broader trend of coins moving off exchanges. 

This often signals accumulation but also reduces liquidity, which can amplify volatility during sharp moves.

ETH futures volume fell 25.8% to $107.6 billion, and open interest dropped 2% to $46.7 billion. 

Options trading also slowed. Despite lower volume, positioning remains bullish. Binance accounts show a 2.4-to-1 long-short ratio, with top traders holding similar exposure.

Liquidation data reveals ongoing stress. Over the past 24 hours, $125 million in ETH positions were liquidated, including $77 million in longs. 

The figures show that optimism persists, but leveraged positions remain vulnerable to another dip.

SEC filings show Bitmain gave firm partially owned by Eric Trump unusually generous terms on equipment

A private Chinese company is giving preferential access to its technology and providing unusually beneficial payment terms on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of specialized equipment to a firm partially owned by Eric Trump, according to industry sources and Securities and Exchange Commission records.

The company, Bitmain, has faced concerns over the potential national security risks of its technology, with one Republican congressman asking the treasury department to review some of its business dealings in the United States.

American Bitcoin Corporation was founded in March, just two months after Donald Trump's inauguration. Eric Trump currently has a 7.5% stake in the company, SEC filings show. Created through a daisy chain of mergers, and majority owned by a company called Hut 8, American Bitcoin went public with overwhelming publicity on 3 September on the Nasdaq exchange. Though the phenomenal stock profits of the Trump venture have been previously reported, the fact that Bitmain appears to be providing preferential access and payment terms to the operation has not been previously reported.

Filings by American Bitcoin with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that the company is purchasing more than 16,000 advanced mining machines – servers that process complex math problems to earn Bitcoin – from Bitmain.

The SEC filings indicate that American Bitcoin is paying Bitmain in “pledged” bitcoin – rather than cash – which could be redeemed up to two years from now, at a current price. An industry expert said he was briefed on the American Bitcoin deals and that Bitmain was offering the company unique and favorable terms, with little money down, and such a long period of time for redeeming their collateral.

In May, at a Las Vegas bitcoin conference sponsored by Bitmain, the president of American Bitcoin, Matt Prusak, underscored the political nature of the bitcoin industry. “If you think you're in the energy business or compute business or bitcoin business you're half right,” he told the audience. “Underneath it all you're in the business of politics, in the politics business.”

Favorable treatment by Bitmain is a main ingredient of the American Bitcoin venture. “Preferential access” to the technology it buys from Bitmain is “central to American Bitcoin's ability to maintain a structural cost advantage”, according to an American Bitcoin press release last month.

In a statement to the Guardian, Bitmain said “technical cooperation” with American Bitcoin's majority owner Hut 8 was specific to one type of mining machine, and was with Hut 8 rather than American Bitcoin. Hut 8 and American both list the same address in Miami on filings with the US government, and Hut 8 handles all of American Bitcoin's operations and infrastructure.

Bitmain, in its statement to the Guardian, said it offers “pledged bitcoin” to other customers. But in a May announcement the company said it would offer a six-month redemption period for these pledges, not a 24-month term, as it offers American Bitcoin.

Experts say American Bitcoin's special access to Bitmain's technology and financing terms raise concerns that the Chinese entity views business with the Trump sons as an opportunity to try to influence the Trump administration on a variety of issues: crypto regulation, energy, or China policy.

“The disclosed terms are pretty unusual,” said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. “It's one thing to extend credit. But the weird part is: ‘you have the option to buy back when you're mining at a discount,'” he said. “If the president's family was involved it brings up the obvious question of whether Bitmain is trying to get special treatment.”

Even the appearance of impropriety can be problematic, said Eric Chaffee, a professor of law at Case Western, who cautioned that at the same time all the facts are not known. “This does look a bit like a sweetheart deal where the reason they are doing this is to curry some influence with the Trump administration,” he said. “This looks bad but at the same time there could be underlying facts that make it a fair deal.”

A spokesperson for Hut 8, Gautier Lemyze-Young, did not dispute the financing terms involved bitcoin with a 24-month window but said the terms were agreed to “in September 2024 long before the launch of American Bitcoin”.

The transaction at issue, though, was done by American Bitcoin, and was revealed in August 2025.

On the day American Bitcoin went public a company executive posted a photo of the team, including Eric and Don Jr, on X, with the phrase “And we are off to the races.”

Lemyze-Young said in the statement that the close work with the Chinese company stemmed from a longstanding relationship and was due to “results, not politics or external affiliations”.

Eric Trump did not respond to detailed requests for comment emailed to American Bitcoin and the Trump Organization, where he is executive vice-president.

A former company executive who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Guardian that the Trump family involvement, announced publicly in March, was known months earlier to insiders as the mergers were organized to form American Bitcoin. “We knew well in advance that they were involved. That's why we wanted to do it,” he said, referring to a merger. “They have some access at the White House. Better than not having it. That's certainly a bonus.”

It is not the first crypto venture of the Trump family to raise questions about foreign influence. An entirely separate Trump cryptocurrency business, World Liberty Financial, which has no ties to American Bitcoin except the Eric Trump ownership, announced in May that the United Arab Emirates would use its stablecoin in a transaction in which it made a $2bn investment involving a separate cryptocurrency exchange.

But American Bitcoin stands out in part because so many threads intersect with US policy: Trump has announced a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve”, which may help drive up bitcoin's price; has loosened regulations on energy, which is key to cheap bitcoin mining; and has launched policies on China that often seem to pivot back and forth between aggressive economic confrontation and conciliation.

Eric Trump has been promoting American Bitcoin and the stock, appearing with company executives at investor forums and business news broadcasts, repeating that the Trump family had turned to cryptocurrency because it was “debanked” following the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol.

“We developed a company named American Bitcoin. We are one of the biggest bitcoin mining companies on Earth,” he told a conference last month, claiming the price of bitcoin would shoot to a million dollars, an eightfold increase from the present.

Bitmain is not regulated by US agencies but there have been concerns about the company's technology. Last month the Republican congressman Zachary Nunn, of Iowa, pressed the treasury department to review Bitmain and another Chinese bitcoin company. In a statement to the Guardian, Nunn wrote: “American families deserve to know that our power grid, digital infrastructure, and national security aren't being compromised by foreign entities with opaque ownership and ties to hostile regimes.”

In Bitmain's statement to the Guardian, the company said it responded to his office, and said it “strictly complies with US and applicable laws and regulations and has never engaged in activities that pose risks to US national security”.

A former U.S. citizen who earned the moniker “Bitcoin Jesus” for his evangelism of cryptocurrency has agreed to pay the IRS nearly $50 million in back taxes in exchange for dropping its criminal case against him.

Roger Ver once owned two computer companies in Santa Clara. But he said goodbye to the United States in 2014 and moved to the eastern Caribbean Sea, specifically the island country St. Kitts and Nevis. 

When he renounced his U.S. citizenship, Ver owned roughly 131,000 Bitcoins either personally or through companies that he owned, according to federal prosecutors. At the time, Bitcoins traded for around $871 each and Ver was required to pay an “exit tax” on his capital gains. 

He hired a law firm to help him with his expatriation process and prepare his tax returns, along with an appraiser to value his companies. But prosecutors say he provided false or misleading information to the law firm and appraiser by hiding the actual number of Bitcoins he owned.

The following year, an appraiser Ver hired to value his companies asked him in an email to provide the number of Bitcoins he owned when he expatriated. That appraiser copied Ver's attorney in the email, but Ver did not provide a clear answer, according to court documents.

Federal public defenders in Los Angeles have accused the Trump administration of circumventing rules with the way acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli was appointed.

Ver asked, “[c]ompletely hypothetically speaking, what would the ramifications be if I were to have had 200,000 [bitcoins] at the time of my renunciation?”

The lawyer advised Ver to get an appraisal of his personally held Bitcoins from a “third party who [had] no personal interest in the tax implications of the appraisal,” according to court documents.

Ver continued to provide unclear responses to the appraiser. In some emails, the appraiser asked point blank for a number, but instead Ver wrote back about the state of the cryptocurrency market. 

“I actually have all the information you need to make it super easy for you. I would just need to explain it all, and then you would affix your name to it,” Ver wrote in an October 2015 email.

He then filed false returns in May 2016, which omitted the true number of Bitcoins he owned. 

By November 2017, Ver had sold tens of thousands of Bitcoins on cryptocurrency exchanges for approximately $240 million in cash, according to federal prosecutors. Even though he was no longer a U.S. citizen, Ver was required to report his earnings to the IRS and pay taxes, because his companies were U.S. corporations. 

A federal grand jury indicted Ver in April 2024 for mail fraud, two counts of tax evasion and three counts of subscription to a false tax return. At the time, he was living in Tokyo but was arrested in Spain. 

Ver agreed to pay his back taxes under an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office and the charges against him are set to be dismissed. 

“Mr. Ver is accepting responsibility for his actions and has agreed to pay a substantial penalty,” acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli said in a statement. “Every person, whether you're a millionaire or not, is required by law to pay taxes and we will not hesitate to hold anyone accountable.”

Through his attorney, Ver said in a statement, “I am very grateful this case has been dismissed and appreciate the Trump Administration's leadership and professionalism in working towards this final resolution. I am also grateful to everyone who supported me and sought justice in my case.”

Coinbase surprised crypto markets on Wednesday by unveiling a new issuer-facing listings program and, minutes later, adding BNB to its listing roadmap — an unexpected nod to the flagship token of its biggest rival.

At 4:12 p.m. UTC, the Coinbase Markets account on X introduced “The Blue Carpet,” a revamped asset-listing experience aimed at making the process more transparent for onchain builders. 

According to Coinbase's blog post, the bundle offers a direct line to the listings team for tailored guidance, the ability to request updates to an asset's page across Coinbase's centralized exchange and its retail DEX, referral discounts for services such as MiCA whitepaper support and market-maker matching, and limited Coinbase One subscriptions for select core team members. Coinbase reiterated that applications and listings are free and that issuers are not required to purchase ancillary services.

At 4:45 p.m. UTC, Coinbase Markets posted that BNB had been added to the roadmap. As with other roadmap items, the signal reflects intent rather than immediate availability. Roadmap inclusion does not ensure a listing; Coinbase can delay or decline assets if liquidity, technical, compliance, or other requirements are not satisfied. Coinbase said trading will be announced separately once sufficient market-making support and infrastructure are in place.

The timing is notable. 

Just nine days earlier, Arca CIO Jeff Dorman published a critique arguing Coinbase lists “some of the absolute worst assets” while ignoring “the best ones,” and he highlighted tokens issued by rival platforms — including BNB — as examples of high performers the exchange had historically not offered. He said an exchange should either list widely and be neutral, or curate the “best assets” like a broker, and faulted Coinbase for falling between those models. 

Dorman further contrasted BNB, LEO, TRX and HYPE — citing revenue-backed buybacks and strong tokenomics — with what he called inflationary tokens and opaque listing practices, framing Coinbase's approach as selectively exclusionary. Against that backdrop, adding BNB to the roadmap looks like a meaningful shift in posture, even if a listing is not guaranteed. 

Beyond its 2017 origins as a trading-fee token, BNB now serves as the primary gas asset for BNB Chain transactions and is used across that network for payments, staking, token launches and governance proposals — functioning as the chain's transaction fuel and utility token.

Pairing the Blue Carpet rollout with a high-profile roadmap addition signals Coinbase aims to court major nonnative assets when liquidity, compliance and technical standards are met — rival affiliations notwithstanding. 

At the time of writing, bnb was $1,164.33, down 4.7% in the past 24 hours.

MegaETH, an Ethereum-compatible ‘real-time' blockchain, appears to be planning an initial coin offering (ICO). 

This potential public token sale would take place on Sonar, a self-hosted token launch platform created by crypto investor Jordan “Cobie” Fish, who is also a co-founder of Lido. “The First Real-Time Blockchain. Built for you. Owned by you. Register now,” MegaETH's team shared on X earlier today. 

ICOs – which are a way for crypto projects to raise funds – are making a comeback in 2025, with MegaETH's move showing a shift toward community-focused, transparent sales to drive user engagement and ecosystem growth.

According to the project's website, the registration window is open from today to Oct. 27. While MegaETH says details of a “potential crypto-asset offering” will be announced soon, it emphasized that registration does not guarantee allocation or constitute a sale. No terms of the potential deal have been disclosed.

Registration is open to anyone who completes identity verification on the Sonar platform, excluding MegaETH employees and users from prohibited areas. Individuals from the U.S. must also meet accredited investor requirements and will be subject to a 12-month lockup, MegaETH's website notes. 

Earlier this year, MegaETH announced plans to distribute its tokens through a new ICO model built around a soulbound NFT mint for its pioneer collection, The Fluffle. MegaETH said the NFT model was chosen to reward genuine community participation rather than speculative farming, The Defiant previously reported. 

“A simple points program tied to an airdrop often creates perverse incentives—especially when deployed by a blockchain—driving inauthentic behavior and ‘farming,' which raises questions about real value creation and leaves everyone dissatisfied,” the announcement noted.

This latest announcement also follows MegaETH Labs' recent launch of MegaUSD (USDm), a native stablecoin developed in collaboration with Ethena Labs using its Stablecoin-as-a-Service stack.

“$USDM aligns incentives across stakeholders, letting users and apps enjoy the lowest fees possible while routing scalable value back to MegaETH,” MegaETH said in a post on X on Sept. 8.

MegaETH initially raised $10 million through Echo in December 2024.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

The Ethereum Foundation is expanding its DeFi-focused treasury management strategy with a fresh deployment of 2,400 ETH, worth some $9.6 million, and about $6 million worth of stablecoins, in a yield-bearing Morpho vault, according to an announcement on Wednesday.

"Morpho is a pioneer in permissionless DeFi protocols and consistently demonstrates a commitment to Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) principles," the foundation wrote on X, explaining that both Morpho Vault v2 and Morpho Blue v1 were released under an open GPL2.0 license.

Facing criticism earlier this year over its routine sales of ETH to fund its operations, the non-profit Ethereum Foundation announced a plan to move a portion of its treasury into DeFi protocols, beginning with 50,000 ETH.

The foundation has since moved millions worth of funds onto platforms like Compound, an OG lending protocol, and Spark, part of the Sky (formerly MakerDAO) ecosystem. That said, it also continues to sell crypto assets for fiat on centralized exchanges to fund blockchain research and development.

According to Arkham Intelligence, the Ethereum Foundation holds over $820 million worth of crypto assets, including $735 million worth of ETH, at current prices, according to The Block's ETH price page.

Founded in 2022, Morpho is a decentralized lending protocol on Ethereum that has become a popular institutional option. For instance, Coinbase recently surpassed $1 billion worth of bitcoin-backed onchain loan originations using Morpho, just eight months after the service launched.

Some $4.6 billion has been locked on Morpho Blue v1, a small fraction of the total Ethereum lending market, but in line with rivals like Compound, Spark, and older versions of Aave, according to The Block's data.

Southwark Crown Court in London

UK prosecutors are looking to confiscate Bitcoin worth about $6.8 billion tied to a massive fraud in China uncovered at criminal trials, as they plan a victim compensation plan to repay duped investors. 

The UK police unearthed 61,000 Bitcoin in 2018 during a money laundering investigation against two Chinese women linked to the fraud that impacted around 128,000 investors. Prosecutors are planning a victim compensation program, a lawyer said during a court hearing on Wednesday while several investors have applied to the court to claw back their money.

If Ethereum ever reaches $100,000, the ecosystem could grow into a $12 trillion digital economy.

It sounds almost impossible, yet some investors are starting to wonder what would happen if Ethereum (ETH-USD) really did reach $100,000. At this level, Ethereum  would no longer be just another cryptocurrency. It would become one of the largest financial ecosystems in history.





At a $100,000 price, Ethereum's current circulating supply of around 121 million ETH would be worth nearly $12.1 trillion. This is more than three times Apple's (AAPL) market capitalization and close to half the total value of gold. These are world-shifting numbers that could redefine what digital assets mean for global finance.

If Ethereum reached six figures, about 36 million ETH or roughly 30% of supply would likely remain staked, which would represent around $3.6 trillion locked up in network security. At this scale, Ethereum would function as a global digital economy with its own financial infrastructure.

Every part of the network would expand in value. Transaction fees, validator rewards, and the amount of ETH permanently removed from circulation through burning would all rise in U.S. dollar terms. The entire system would start to resemble a digital nation with its own monetary policy and incentives.

Getting to $100,000 would require more than retail enthusiasm. It would take a steady flow of institutional money. Spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have already shown that traditional investors are willing to buy and hold ETH.

If pensions, wealth managers, and retirement funds begin to treat ETH as a long-term asset class, their constant inflows could keep buying pressure high. This type of structural demand would provide stability instead of relying on hype or short-term speculation.

Another major force could come from tokenized dollars. Stablecoins and digital U.S. Treasury funds now move billions across Ethereum each day. As these assets grow, Ethereum becomes the main payment and settlement layer of the digital economy, which continually drives demand for ETH.

ETH's design already supports long-term scarcity. The network burns a portion of transaction fees in every block, reducing supply over time. Meanwhile, staking continues to remove large amounts of ETH from circulation.

Overall, roughly a third of all ETH locked up, therefore the available supply in markets becomes increasingly limited. When this shrinking supply meets consistent institutional demand, the conditions for higher prices become stronger.

At $100,000 per ETH, the scale of Ethereum's “security budget” would be staggering. The network pays validators in new ETH and fees to keep it secure. Even small changes in issuance would mean huge shifts in dollar terms.

If 100,000 ETH were issued in a year, validators would earn $10 billion. At 300,000 ETH, this number jumps to $30 billion. If the issuance reached 1 million ETH, the total security payout would reach $100 billion a year. These figures show how Ethereum's economic size directly fuels its protection.

At such a high price, ordinary users would not tolerate expensive transactions. This is why Ethereum's Layer 2 networks are so important. These secondary systems handle most transactions for just a few cents while still using ETH to settle on the main chain.

The Dencun upgrade helped by introducing “blob” data storage, which reduced costs for these networks. This setup allows Ethereum to scale for millions of users while keeping fees manageable and still ensuring ETH remains central to the entire system.

If ETH did climb to $100,000, it would likely be driven by several forces working together. ETFs would create consistent buying pressure from long-term investors. DeFi (decentralized finance) would expand as higher prices increase the value of collateral and boost lending activity.

Stablecoins would keep the system running smoothly by providing liquidity for payments and trading. Together, these elements could sustain a healthy balance between buying, staking, and burning ETH, keeping the ecosystem active and valuable.

Rapid growth brings new dangers. A multitrillion-dollar Ethereum would attract much closer scrutiny from global regulators. Oversight of staking providers, liquid staking tokens, and ETFs would increase sharply.

Technical risks would also rise. Larger stakes mean higher rewards for attackers, making network decentralization and validator diversity even more important. Any sign of centralization or technical weakness could trigger sharp market reactions.

Reaching $100,000 per ETH would take years of consistent growth, stable regulation, and strong technical execution. It would not happen overnight or from a single upgrade. It would depend on a deep integration of Ethereum into global finance, where everything from digital dollars to investment funds depends on its infrastructure.

If that vision becomes real, Ethereum would evolve from a blockchain network into a core part of the world's economic system. It would represent a new era in how technology, money, and trust connect — and show just how far one decentralized idea can go.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is sitting at $4,018.90.

Nigel Farage, the leader of political party Reform UK – currently riding high in opinion polls – has told an event audience that he wants to “bring crypto in from the cold” and put an immediate halt to work on a potential UK central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Farage – a former Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1999 until the UK's withdrawal from the European Union (EU) in 2020, a move he campaigned for – is one of the best-known figures in British politics. Reform UK has just five members of Parliament but has recently consistently polled above the ruling Labour Party and opposition Conservatives, leading to growing talk of Farage as a potential prime minister.

Farage took part in a fireside chat on the opening day of the ‘Digital Asset Summit 2025', an event organised in London on 13-15 October by US-based financial media, research and events firm Blockworks. During a 30-minute conversation he highlighted some the promises made in a ‘Cryptoassets and Digital Finance Bill' (or, in its own words, ‘statement of intent') published by Reform in May that set out a ‘post-Brexit roadmap to make the United Kingdom the world's premier hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation.'

“I was in the European Parliament for over 20 years but I don't regard myself as a politician,” he told the audience, ahead of positively answering the opening question as to whether he believed he was the UK's next prime minister. Farage began his career as a commodities trader in the City. “I still regard myself much more as a businessman who's in politics because things need fixing,” he said.

Duirng the discussion he went on to slam “over-regulation” in the City and tell digital asset industry representatives in the audience that “I am your champion.”

Reform's seven-page ‘bill' included a plan for HM Treasury to create and manage a ‘Bitcoin Reserve Fund' as part of the UK's official reserves. This is following the example of the US, where president Donald Trump signed an executive order in March to create a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve' and ‘Digital Asset Stockpile'.

The document also specified ‘Rapid Policy-Making Timelines', stating that ‘any government taskforce or commission on crypto is limited to 90 days (extendable by 30 days only with parliamentary approval) to prevent bureaucratic drift and keep the UK well ahead of slow EU processes.'

“We're [the UK] losing reinsurance businesses off to Bermuda, etc, and this whole area of digital assets and crypto just isn't being talked about at all,” Farage said at the Blockworks event.  

“I was the first prominent person in British politics to adopt crypto, to talk about crypto, to try and legitimise crypto, which was in 2020,” he said. “One of the reasons I'm here today [at the conference] is my deep frustration that despite one speech by [former Conservative PM] Rishi Sunak in this space, the Conservatives [and] the Labour Party have done nothing in this area.”

Referring to Reform's stated plans, he said: “If we win the next general election, will put [it] into law very, very quickly, and we will effectively bring crypto in from the cold.”

The Labour government was elected in July 2024 in a landslide win that ended 14 years of Conservative rule. In March this year PM Sir Keir Starmer in spoke of planned ‘fundamental reform of the British state', saying that politicians had for years “hid[den] behind a vast array of quangos, arms-length bodies and regulators… a sort of cottage industry of checkers and blockers.”

Farage wants “appropriate” regulation.

“When I started [working in the City], you could put a brass plaque outside your front door and say ‘commodity broker' and there were a few cowboys around,” he said. “I think a degree of regulation that gives consumers confidence is what you need. By the time I left the City in 2004, I saw compliance departments getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger, and, effectively, their job was to stop you doing business, to stop you innovating. So over-regulation is a curse.”

“I saw it [regulation] go massively over the top,” he continued. “A lot of that was because we were in the globalist European Union, which is the most heavily regulated marketplace on Earth – which is why it's going down the tubes, frankly. “

“So, yes, I'm all for appropriate regulation,” he said. “But the next British government needs to deregulate: deregulate financial services, deregulate small business, deregulate entrepreneurship. And we have to get the tax burden right because, at the moment, the flight of capital, the flight of brains from this country is frankly disastrous.”

Farage was talking on stage to Blockworks co-founder Michael Ippolito in a session titled ‘The Future of Digital Assets in the UK'.

He criticised his fellow parliamentarians for a perceived lack of knowledge and interest in digital finance-related topics.

“If you had this conversation with 95 per cent of current regulators in the House of Commons or the House of Lords, you may as well be speaking Swahili to them. They don't know anything about the space – they don't want to know anything about the space,” he said.

He also aimed his fire at the Bank of England (BoE), criticising the central bank for a cautious stance over cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins.

“I remember when I came out publicly saying that, actually, people should hold crypto as part of their portfolio – and that was in 2020, when I said ‘look, this [crypto] is here to stay, it's a fascinating space',” he said. “I liked it because whilst I'd campaigned for national sovereignty [from the EU] for all those years, here is personal sovereignty… you've got your own money, you're in charge.”

The BoE is currently researching the possibilities for a potential British CBDC through a digital pound ‘design phase.'

Like Trump, who slammed a potential digital US dollar as a “dangerous threat to freedom”, Farage describing CBDCs as “the ultimate authoritarian nightmare.”

“If and when we win the next election, we will automatically shut down the CBDC project, make all those working on it say ‘very sorry, chaps – you're of work'. We will stop it overnight,” he said.

Last month the UK government announced plans to launch a digital ID scheme and make having digital ID mandatory for anyone for working in the UK.

Farage was similarly critical of this public sector initiative. “I'd rather go to prison that have digital ID and total state control over my life and over my money…. I'm going to fight this and we are going to win,” he said.

Cryptocurrencies are widely seen as having made it easier for criminals to launder money due to their high degree of anonymity.

The government is attempting to ramp up anti-money laundering (AML) through updated legislation such as the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023.

“We have excessive anti-money laundering rules,” Farage said. “The AML regs are a ‘sledgehammer to miss the nut'. For every 100 quid we're spending on regulation to seek money laundering, we're only getting a pound back the other way.”

Reform's cryptoassets and digital finance bill included an intention to allow taxes to be paid in cryptocurrencies. HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) ‘must build systems to accept Bitcoin (and other approved crypto) for tax liabilities, using HMRC-published GBP exchange rates at the time of payment,' the document stated, adding that ‘crypto collected can be converted into sterling or added to the Bitcoin Reserve Fund.'

The document also stated that the party had become the first UK political party ‘to be able to accept donations in Bitcoin, Ethereum, as well as other cryptocurrencies.'

Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ:BITF) is now causing ripples both in the blockchain and AI sectors. 

Following a 500% surge in five weeks, the firm refinanced a debt facility with Macquarie Group into $300 million project financing for its Panther Creek data center in Pennsylvania, marking a strategic shift from crypto mining to high-performance computing (HPC) and AI infrastructure. 

The initiative is an attention grabber among ETF investors as thematic funds following blockchain and AI experience a rare overlap in one firm.

For ETF investors, Bitfarms — previously best known as a Bitcoin miner cashing in on the cryptocurrency bubble — is now a compelling case study. Historically, the company fits into blockchain-themed ETFs which aim at crypto miners and digital ledger innovators. However, BITF's recent actions place these funds at crossroads, as the company is no longer simply mining Bitcoin.

On the contrary, AI-related ETFs such as the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ) and Roundhill Generative AI ETF (NYSE:CHAT) can now indirectly invest in Bitfarms' changing business. Investors in these ETFs can ride the upside of a company utilizing existing data center infrastructure to get into the red-hot AI business.

CEO Ben Gagnon said this $300 million worth of project finance provides the company with quicker access to capital as it transitioned to HPC and AI workloads.

Joshua Stevens, Macquarie's managing director, emphasized the state of Pennsylvania's strong energy and fiber base, describing it as an emerging AI hub, while a change of leadership in the finance department indicates the company's intent on this new direction.

Bitfarms' makeover spotlights an ETF manager's peculiar dilemma. Blockchain ETFs may need to reconsider their definition of inclusion, striking a balance between exposure to legacy crypto mining and hybrid approaches that combine mining and AI infrastructure. By contrast, AI ETFs could benefit from this indirect exposure, establishing a foothold in a company that combines compute-intensive workloads with blockchain expertise.

For investors, this would mean exposure to the growth of AI unintentionally through holding a blockchain ETF, while holders of AI ETFs would receive the reward of digital infrastructure initially developed for mining, a cross-over that is very unusual among thematic funds.

Bitfarms' turn is a trial run for thematic ETF agility. As companies balance multiple edges of innovation, ETFs with the capacity to modify screening and sector definitions could ride the next wave of cross-industry expansion.

ByJeff Kauflin,

Forbes Staff.

Ascrypto receives a warm embrace in Washington and token prices rise to new levels, some once-hot digital asset sectors like NFTs continue to languish. Few firms have suffered the brunt of NFTs' collapse more than NFT specialist OpenSea.

Starting in mid-2022, the market for digital art represented by these unique, nonfungible tokens–from CryptoPunks to Bored Apes—experienced a spectacular fall, declining by more than 80%. By October 2023, OpenSea, the once-dominant venue for buying and selling NFTs, was bringing in just $3 million in monthly revenue, down from a peak of $125 million in January 2022, the same month the startup was valued at $13.3 billion, briefly giving its cofounders ownership stakes worth more than $1 billion.

It wasn't just that people had lost interest in NFTs. OpenSea had also been abruptly overtaken by an upstart competitor, Blur, which charged zero trading fees and didn't require buyers to pay royalties to NFT creators. When OpenSea responded by loosening its own royalty policy, it drew the ire of its customers on Twitter, who said everything from “you people are foul” to characterizing it as “evil” and “a joke of a company.”

As OpenSea was hemorrhaging cash and struggling for market share, cofounder and CEO Devin Finzer held a company meeting for 175 staffers on payroll. He told employees that the company needed a reset and that he would be firing more than half of them. His goal: to emerge again as a smaller, nimbler startup where every remaining employee was enthusiastic about reinventing the company. Finzer offered severance packages to anyone who hadn't been laid off but also wanted out.

“What was really tough was that a lot more people than I expected–some really good people–took that package,” he says today, looking downward. CEO Finzer now operates often from a WeWork-like co-working space in downtown Manhattan. About six other New York area employees are office regulars, but nearly all of OpenSea's 60 employees and 10 contractors today work remotely.

After trudging through a three-year bear market for digital art NFTs that may never bounce back, OpenSea is pivoting hard. Taking advantage of its customer base, which had swelled to millions of monthly website visitors, the battle-worn startup has expanded from NFTs to become a one-stop shop for trading all cryptocurrencies across 22 different blockchains. This shift means OpenSea can cash in on the memecoin craze, too.

Finzer, 34, credits his wife Yu-Chi Lyra Kuo with having the idea to turn OpenSea into a trade-any-crypto application. Kuo is an early cryptocurrency investor who pursued a PhD in philosophy and politics at Princeton, earned a Harvard Law degree and in 2016 began running a crypto trading fund. In 2021, Kuo left the trading fund and met Finzer later that year. “I really consider her a silent cofounder of OpenSea 2.0,” says Finzer. He adds that she spent hundreds of hours working with him on everything from OpenSea's high-level strategy to technically mapping out how it would pull in trades from different blockchains.

OpenSea's new focus is already showing real traction. In the first two weeks of October 2025, it facilitated $1.6 billion in cryptocurrency trades and $230 million in NFT transactions, up from $142 million in total volume in all of May. The surge will make October 2025 its biggest month in over three years. Under OpenSea's new gameplan, it aggregates buy and sell orders from decentralized crypto exchanges like Uniswap and Meteora. In terms of fees, OpenSea takes about 0.9% for every transaction, accounting for $16 million in revenue over the last two weeks.

Finzer's new focus for OpenSea employs an age-old trader axiom, “Don't fight the tape.” As the soaring price of bitcoin makes headlines, crypto goes mainstream and prediction markets gain in popularity, “risk on” is the new mantra for investors. One only needs to look at Robinhood's 400% one-year stock return and exploding volume at prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket as evidence. Even though slumping market values for NFTs like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, whose average floor price has fallen from around $400,000 at its peak to $32,000 today, have burned many investors, a new crop of speculators remains undeterred. For the past two years, memecoins have been the industry's biggest obsession. “You can't fight the macro trend,” Finzer says, so you might as well embrace it.

Finzer thinks letting people trade any and all cryptocurrencies is the “right one for crypto right now” due to high demand. In this respect, he has taken a lesson from his biggest rival Blur, a company that burst onto the NFT scene three years ago with a trader-centric approach that helped it gobble up most of the NFT trading market.

His run-in with Blur also taught him something about leadership. After Blur made trading fee-free and royalty-free, Finzer responded with a series of flip-flopping fee changes that wavered between minimizing and maximizing royalties for digital creators. He was trying to please too many people, and his reactive, consensus-driven approach wasn't working. Finzer learned to stop giving in to pressure from others and trust his own instincts. “For some of these things, the only way you get better is by having the thing happen and failing your way through it,” Finzer says.

Looking back on the past two years, Finzer and former OpenSea chief technology officer Nadav Hollander say the deep layoffs were essential. They flattened the startup's structure and removed all technical managers so that every engineer wrote code. Finzer has also come to reject the conventional Silicon Valley wisdom of hiring rapidly to keep pace with soaring customer demand. He now tries to keep the company as small as possible, an approach that has become in vogue in the AI era.

Meanwhile, Blur seems to be missing in action. Its trading volume has dwindled to $92 million over the past month, down from more than $1 billion in early 2023, according to DappRadar. Its corporate X account and that of cofounder and CEO Tieshun Roquerre have been mysteriously quiet since last spring. Roquerre didn't respond to Forbes' emails or Telegram messages requesting an interview. “In crypto, some people are there to get in and get out,” says Finzer.

Crypto trading applications are everywhere–thousands already exist. Yet even though today's most popular blockchains have been around for over a decade, no company has cracked the code on making it easy to trade the millions of tokens that reside on different blockchains and store the assets yourself (or in crypto parlance, self-custody).

While Coinbase makes 300 tokens available to trade through its centralized exchange primary service, that selection represents a tiny fraction of all the tokens in existence. And like a traditional bank, Coinbase stores customers' assets for them. Everyday Americans typically don't think twice about that since they're accustomed to using banks, but it's deeply troubling to cryptocurrency die-hards who believe in completely owning and controlling their crypto at all times. Just ask anyone who had money on crypto exchange FTX when it collapsed. (More recently, Coinbase has started making many more tokens available to trade through its Base service, which lets people self-custody their assets and trade on decentralized exchanges.)

Finzer says OpenSea's bridging feature of letting people trade across 22 blockchains is its most attractive, since there are still few places where that's easy to do. The challenges of achieving this are manifold–to do it well, a company needs to: index an ever-expanding list of tokens across an ever-expanding set of blockchain operating systems; get customers the best possible price for any given trade; make the application easy to use; create a user interface where people can discover new assets; prevent customers from getting scammed.

OpenSea built a booming business years ago by making NFTs simple for anyone to purchase, and it's trying to do the same with all token trading. Finzer's goal is to make the user's experience as intuitive as it is on an app like Coinbase or Robinhood, while under the hood, aggregating people's buy and sell orders from the places where more sophisticated, tech-savvy crypto traders congregate like Uniswap.

One way he tries to do this is by opting not to do know-your-customer (KYC) checks to verify a user's identity. These checks are an important step required for banks and financial institutions to prevent money laundering and transfers from people in sanctioned countries. Finzer says OpenSea, which has moved its corporate headquarters to Miami, isn't legally required to do KYC checks, since it's not considered a U.S. money transmitter and never takes custody of customers' assets. He adds that OpenSea uses blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs to check digital wallets against lists of sanctioned addresses and flag any suspicious transactions for money laundering.

But this compliance-light approach could easily present future risks, not only of money launderers and sanctioned-country senders slipping through the cracks, but also of future U.S. administrations bringing regulatory enforcement actions against OpenSea. Under President Biden, the Securities and Exchange Commission opened investigations into whether OpenSea and decentralized exchange Uniswap were running unlicensed securities exchanges. Both companies denied that they were violating the law, and the Trump Administration dropped those investigations this past February.

Finzer denies that OpenSea takes a compliance-light approach and says his company does more on compliance than “the vast majority of apps that are built on top of blockchains.” Regarding KYC checks, he says, “KYC isn't an ‘option' we're choosing to avoid; it's fundamentally incompatible with non-custodial architecture.”

OpenSea's new trade-everything strategy also means Finzer is trying to straddle the distant worlds of art and pure financial speculation, a balance that seems impossible. He says he doesn't want to build a “soulless financial app,” but when you visit the “Tokens” section of the site, it feels like a gambling-centric financial app.

The CEO thinks the art-focused NFT market, memecoins and all other crypto tokens can “harmoniously live together” in one place on OpenSea. He says the company is only “a fraction of the way” to its vision of a venue for trading all tokens and notes that it hasn't even launched a new mobile app yet. An independent foundation set up by OpenSea is expected to release an OpenSea token soon, though Finzer declined to give details.

Outside of potential regulatory issues, OpenSea may face significant competitive challenges since the barriers to entry in crypto trading are low. In fact, globally there are hundreds of crypto exchanges. “We've found there's a lot of moat in just consistently delivering on a quality product experience–building out a brand that's trusted and works as users want it to work,” says Finzer. The history of crypto, and the eight-year history of his own startup, tells a different story.

BDC and Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC join forces to expand access to financing and advice, unlocking growth where it's often overlooked

PRINCE GEORGE, British Columbia and QUEBEC CITY and MONTREAL, Oct. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC and the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) today announced a $100M initiative to reach more business owners living in rural and remote areas. Leaders in their communities, rural entrepreneurs are an exceptionally active demographic, with an entrepreneurship rate standing at 17% in 2024, compared to 12% in urban areas. The financing envelope created by this new initiative is expected to generate up to $250 million in GDP over five years.

With their respective business centres and offices throughout the country, Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC and BDC have a complimentary footprint. A federal program administered by regional development agencies and Canada Economic Development, Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC operates 267 non-profit offices across Canada delivering small business loans, tools, training and events. BDC supports entrepreneurs with financing, advisory services and capital from 109 business centres across Canada and online at bdc.ca.

"This initiative aims to increase the support provided to the 520,000 entrepreneurs living in rural and remote areas who grow our economy”, said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions. "It leverages the complementary strengths of both organizations-BDC's financing and advisory expertise and Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC's deep local presence across the country.”

"At BDC, we believe that every entrepreneur, no matter where they live, deserves a fair chance to grow their business. Rural and remote communities are full of bold, resilient business owners who often face more barriers and fewer resources”, said Isabelle Hudon, President and Chief Executive Officer of BDC. "This initiative with Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC allows us to do what a development bank should: go where others don't, and build bridges where gaps exist. We're unlocking potential that's been overlooked for too long. We believe that's what our economy needs right now.”

"Joining forces with BDC to supercharge the opportunities and resources available to rural and remote entrepreneurs from coast-to-coast-to-coast is a powerful combination that will result in significant impact throughout the country for decades to come," said Troy Dungate, President of Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC. "BDC is committing to investing $100M to bolster businesses that often face strong headwinds simply due to geography and the vast nature of our country. This commitment, combined with our boots-on-the-ground, grassroots knowledge is an intelligent way to ensure that this capital infusion is dispersed through loans to new and existing entrepreneurs that are ready to bring their business to the next level. Additionally, we know that many entrepreneurs in rural Canada are attracted to the work because of the desirable lifestyle it creates for their families. Working together, we expect this to make positive, meaningful change in the lives of individual Canadians and our country as a whole.”

This initiative with Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC builds on BDC's broader commitment to develop entrepreneurial potential in all its forms and to help grow the Canadian economy. Since launching our Community Banking initiative in November 2024, BDC teamed up with financial institutions and community lending partners that support underserved groups. By joining this network of trusted partners, Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC should help us reach even more business owners in rural and remote areas. It's about meeting entrepreneurs where they are and helping them grow.

This announcement comes just before Small Business Week, a national celebration of Canadian entrepreneurship that BDC has organized for more than 45 years. This year's theme is The economic revolution is here - get your business ready.

BDC and Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC are stepping up to help entrepreneurs in rural and remote communities-who are vital contributors to Canada's economy-have the resources they need to thrive.

 Crypto analysts say the weekend's market volatility is temporary and are predicting an upward trend to emerge in the coming weeks. 

Bitcoin could reclaim its all-time high of $125,100 in the coming week, but not without one more major correction, according to veteran trader Peter Brandt.

“Either a huge shakeout, which would be confirmed by an ATH quickly within the next week or so,” he said, though he acknowledged there could also be a much more bearish outcome. 

The crypto market crashed on Friday after US President Donald Trump's announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, resulting in over $19 billion in liquidations across the market.

After dropping from around $121,000 to as low as $102,000 on Friday, Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded to approximately $112,400 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap.

“If anything, this weekend was a reminder you have to be so careful with leverage, and even multiples above 1.5x are dangerous,” Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards told Cointelegraph.

“They do, and you need to always consider multi-year, long-term risk,” he said. He said the weekend's volatility is temporary, and described his outlook for the coming weeks as simply “up.” 

Other analysts remain optimistic, citing broader macroeconomic signals as indications that fresh capital could flow into the cryptocurrency market in the coming weeks.

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said in an X post on Tuesday that a buying opportunity may be presenting itself in the crypto market after US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that quantitative tightening “is over.” 

“Back up the … truck and buy everything,” Hayes said. 

Quantitative easing is bullish for crypto as it encourages banks to lend more and makes borrowing cheaper for consumers and businesses through lower interest rates.

Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph on Tuesday that “the fundamental economic data is the big story for Bitcoin right now.”

“Inflation is facing a double whammy at the moment from lower oil prices and demand, and at the same time, the US labor market is showing signs of distress,” Hundal said, as US inflation reached 2.90% in August, the highest level since January.

“The Fed has a mandate to target full employment, and it all just feels inevitable that we'll see further rate cuts this month. This is a goldilocks zone for Bitcoin,” he said.

Meanwhile, macroeconomist Lyn Alden recently said on a podcast that she is leaning “toward this next quarter being probably pretty favorable” for Bitcoin.

Large-scale metagenomic and data-mining efforts have revealed an expansive diversity of bacteriophages (phages) within the human gut1,2,3. However, functional understanding of phage–host interactions within this complex environment is limited, largely due to a lack of cultured isolates available for experimental validation. Here we characterize 134 inducible prophages originating from 252 human gut bacterial isolates using 10 different induction conditions to expand the experimentally validated temperate phage–host pairs originating from the human gut. Importantly, only 18% of computationally predicted prophages could be induced in pure cultures. Moreover, we construct a 78-member synthetic microbiome that, when co-cultured in the presence of human colonic cells (Caco2), led to the induction of 35% phage species. Using cultured isolates, we demonstrate that human host-associated cellular products may act as induction agents, providing a possible link between gastrointestinal cell lysis and temperate phage populations4,5. We provide key insights into prophage diversity and genetics, including a genetic pathway for domestication, finding that polylysogeny was common and resulted in coordinated prophage induction, and that differential induction can be influenced by divergent prophage integration sites. More broadly, our study highlights the importance of culture-based techniques, alongside experimental validation, genomics and computational prediction, to understand the biology and function of temperate phages in the human gut microbiome. These culture-based approaches will enable applications across synthetic biology, biotechnology and microbiome fields.

The human gut microbiota consists of a plethora of microorganisms along with the viruses that infect them, including phages. These viruses are thought to shape the gut microbial community through predation, horizontal gene transfer and lysogenic conversion6,7. Recent advances in computational mining of gut metagenomes have revealed an expansive collection of viral metagenome-assembled genomes and efforts cataloguing this diversity have led to the discovery of several important viral families1,2,3,8,9,10. Moreover, lysogeny is common within the gut, with up to 90% of bacteria predicted to harbour prophages11,12. However, the extent to which these prophages re-enter lytic replication remains unclear. For example, the inactivation of resident prophages represents a common strategy whereby the bacterial population can escape lysis while maintaining beneficial phage genes13,14. Furthermore, initiation of lytic replication by resident prophages is complex, involving both host- and phage-specific cues15,16. Within the gut, little is known about temperate phages and how they interact with our commensals.

Advances in cultivation of the microbiota have enabled the isolation and archiving of previously ‘unculturable' gut bacterial species17,18, along with their phages. Here we use a collection of 252 human gut bacterial isolates (50 Actinomycetota, 1 Fusobacteriota, 51 Bacillota, 57 Pseudomonadota and 93 Bacteroidota) to computationally identify and experimentally validate inducible prophages (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). We began by exposing our bacterial isolate cultures to eight different induction agents and conditions, which included a standard medium control, well-known inducing agents such as mitomycin C (0.3 and 3 µg ml−1) and hydrogen peroxide (0.5 mM), along with lesser-known induction conditions with potential relevance to the gut, including the sugar substitute Stevia (3.7 and 37 mg ml−1) and two starvation conditions (50% carbon depletion and 100% short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) depletion)19,20,21,22,23. After induction, the samples were processed for DNA extraction and 433 viral induction samples that passed our inclusion criteria were sequenced (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 2). This resulted in the detection of 125 inducible gut prophages, representing 63 (23%) phage species (95% average nucleotide identity (ANI), over 85% alignment fraction (AF))24 from 73 (29%) bacterial isolates (5 Actinomycetota, 1 Fusobacteriota, 10 Bacillota, 17 Pseudomonadota and 40 Bacteroidota) (Fig. 1b).

a, Schematic of the methods used. (1) Induction of pure-culture bacterial isolates with standard induction agents. (2) Bacterial synthetic community co-cultured with and without Caco2 cell monolayer. (3) Induction of bacterial isolate pure cultures with cell culture medium, Caco2 cells or cell products. b, Phylogenetic tree of isolates.

Fusobacteriota was excluded from h and i due to a single isolate.

To further expand on the prophage induction triggers tested above, we constructed a synthetic bacterial community based on a subset of our isolates (n = 78, 4 Actinomycetota, 1 Fusobacteriota, 4 Bacillota, 28 Pseudomonadota and 41 Bacteroidota; Supplementary Table 1). Using this community, we investigated the effects of bacterial co-culture, in which the competition for resources, production of microbial byproducts and quorum sensing may affect prophage induction, as well as community co-culture with a monolayer of human colonic epithelial cells (Caco2), to investigate human host-associated factors5,16 (Extended Data Fig. 1c). In total, 29 phage species out of 162 (17%) were identified as induced in community co-culture using read mapping, yet, notably, 57 phage species (35%) were induced within the Caco2 co-culture, with a total of 22 phage species being newly identified as inducible across both experiments (Fig. 1c). However, there was a shift in the bacterial community composition within the Caco2 co-culture, dominated by Pseudomonadota and Bacteroidota, potentially leading to detection of prophages induced from isolates extinct in the community only co-culture25 (Fig. 1d,e). In a complementary approach, we detected the induction of distinct prophage–host pairs by identifying unique k-mers within each prophage genome. Out of the 338 predicted prophages within the community, 150 contained unique k-mers, allowing for the detection of 43 (29%) induced prophages, 21 of which were detected only in the Caco2 co-culture (Fig. 1f).

Considering the increased prophage induction within the Caco2 co-cultured community, we wanted to investigate whether human cells or cell lysis products (independent of community effects) act as prophage induction triggers. To this end, we selected 32 bacterial isolates from the community (3 Actinomycetota, 1 Fusobacteriota, 2 Bacillota, 14 Pseudomonadota and 12 Bacteroidota; Supplementary Table 1) for pure culture induction assays using Caco2 cell monolayers, Caco2 cellular lysates and DMEM cell culture medium alone (Extended Data Fig. 1a). These conditions induced 29 prophages, with 25 observed within the Caco2 cell lysate condition and 14 in the Caco2 monolayer and DMEM cell medium (Fig. 1g). Importantly, nine of the induced prophages had not been previously detected in our bacterial isolate cultures using standard induction agents, indicating that human host-associated cellular products act as induction triggers. Taken together, 35 out of 146 (24%) prophages were found to be inducible across all conditions within these 32 bacterial isolates.

Consistent with previous reports of substantial lysogeny within the human gut11, 237 out of 252 of bacterial isolates (94%) were computationally predicted to contain high-quality prophage regions. However, across all 10 of our tested induction conditions, only 32% (80 out of 252) of isolates were induced and 18% (134 out of 736) of the high-quality prophage predictions, or 24% (68 out of 274) of high-quality prophage species, corresponded to experimentally inducible prophages in pure culture conditions (Fig. 1h,i and Supplementary Table 3). The highest concordance between inducible and predicted prophage regions was observed within Bacteroidota isolates, in which 80 predictions (27%) from 41 isolates (44%) were inducible. Comparatively, in Pseudomonadota, which had the highest number of predicted prophages (4.5 per isolate), just 12% of prophages were found to be inducible. Moreover, combining the synthetic communities, a total of 36% of prophage species was detected as induced, coinciding with recent reports from human gut metagenomes (8–36%)26,27. Although our experimental approach does not provide comprehensive identification of all gut prophages due to factors including detection limits and potential unidentified induction conditions, it is likely that a substantial portion of predicted prophages within our dataset rarely undergo induction.

We next looked to assign phage taxonomy to our induced temperate phage collection using a database comprising 9,920 phage reference genomes. Given the inherent challenges in assigning taxonomy to phages28, we applied both a gene voting-based search and a gene sharing network method using vContact2 (refs. 2,29) (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 4) with taxonomy assigned to the highest taxonomic resolution shared between methods. The resulting classification assigned 133 phages to the Caudoviricetes order and one phage within the Faserviricetes order (Supplementary Table 3). In total, 26% (35 out of 134) of phages could be assigned to ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) accepted taxa at the family level or lower. These belonged to previously reported phage taxa infecting Pseudomonadota (Bcepmuvirus, Punavirus, Uetakevirus and Peduoviridae), one Spbetavirus infecting Bacillota and 16 prophages belonging to the Winoviridae family infecting Bacteroidota. Although lacking ICTV classification, 30 genomes could be grouped into viral clusters (genus-subfamily level) together with previously described phages. Notably, 19 of these clustered with Hankyphage, a recently described virus thought to lysogenize several Bacteroides species30. Further taxonomic classification grouped ten prophages at the species level with Hankyphage, whereas the remaining nine clustered into seven potential novel species, forming a putative novel genus that we name Hankyvirus after the original phage characterized (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Comparing the Hankyvirus species to bacterial genomes in NCBI RefSeq database (95% ANI over 85% AF), we identified 52 host species originating from 9 genera and 5 families, indicating a broad host range of this genus (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Correspondingly, we find two Hankyvirus species induced within both Bacteroides and Phocaeicola isolates within our collection, providing experimental validation of these phages as actively replicating across these two host genera.

Actinomycetota is shown in yellow (7), Fusobacteriota in black (1), Bacillota in blue (15), Pseudomonadota in red (17) and Bacteroidota in teal (28).

The portion of the network connecting to induced prophages is shown; the full network is shown in Extended Data Fig. 3. b, The mean fractional abundance and detection frequency (prevalence) of Caudoviricetes phages within 1,241 viromes originating from the human gut. A minimum of 70% coverage over the phage was required to be counted as present within a virome. The bacterial host phyla of inducible prophage species coloured as in a, and database reference genomes (n = 875) are shown in grey.

We next sought to place our temperate phage genomes within the larger context of the human gut by comparing their prevalence to the reference genomes, including the Crassvirales order31. Approximately half of our inducible prophage species (28 out of 68) could be detected in gut viromes9 (n = 1,241; Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 5). LoVEphage, a recently discovered Bacteroidota phage9,10, was the most common, being detected in around 8% (97 out of 1,241) of the viromes and representing up to 64% of reads within one virome (Supplementary Table 3). Comparatively, the most abundant Crassvirales genome, belonging to the alpha/gamma family, was found in approximately 19% of the viromes investigated (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Three phages in our collection were species-level members of LoVEphage, induced from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Phocaeicola dorei and Phocaeicola vulgatus hosts (Extended Data Fig. 2b). An additional eight phage species were detected in 2–5% of gut viromes (Supplementary Table 3). These included the four species within the Hankyvirus genus, one Uetakevirus infecting Escherichia coli and three previously uncharacterized Bacteroidota phages (Wilby, Saffi and Shia; Extended Data Fig. 3c).

Discernible integrase or site-specific recombination genes, both of which are used as hallmark genes for a temperate lifestyle32,33, were absent in 28% (19 out of 68) of our inducible phage species, including Hankyviruses. We found transposases in ten of these viruses, while the remaining nine lacked any discernible integration genes, illustrating the difficulty in assigning phage lifestyle based on genomic data alone. Diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) are prevalent within the gut virome, and tail-targeting DGRs are known to enable rapid host switching in a Bordetella phage34,35. We found DGRs in 19% (13 out of 68) of our inducible prophage species, the majority of which were seen in Bacteroidota phages, in which 43% (12 out of 28) of species encoded DGRs targeting known and genomically predicted tail proteins (Supplementary Table 3). Concordantly, we found eight Bacteroidota prophage species actively replicating across different bacterial species, three of which replicating across different bacterial genera (Fig. 1b (connecting lines)), highlighting the involvement of DGRs in phage host range expansion through diversification of tail proteins34. More recently, bacterial DGRs were implicated in anti-phage defence mechanisms, and targeted engineering using DGRs accelerated evolution within both host receptor and the reciprocal phage binding domain36,37. Notably, we found four prophage species containing DGRs that encoded a second variable region (VR) targeting genes distal from the reverse transcriptase cassette9 (Extended Data Fig. 3c). The second VR was found in proximity to counter defence genes, such as DNA methyltransferase, indicating further involvement of DGRs in the phage–host arms race34.

The retention of cryptic prophages is known to provide the host with adaptive fitness advantages and has been shown to result in a bimodal size distribution of prophage genomes13,14. Concordantly, we find bimodal length distributions of prophages across all host phyla within our collection (Extended Data Fig. 4a), with the early peak corresponding to sequences with low completeness scores (<50% complete, n = 1,236) and later peaks corresponding to high-quality predictions (>50% complete, n = 736) and experimentally inducible prophages (n = 134; Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 6). To investigate differences in gene content between these groups, we performed gene enrichment analysis of annotated PHROG gene categories and found that small prophage genomes lacked essential phage genes (such as structural, head and packaging, and lysis genes) but were enriched in accessory genes and genes of unknown function38 (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Similarly, when limiting the comparison to high-quality predictions, we found an enrichment of structural genes (head and packaging, connector, lysis and tail) within induced prophages, whereas non-induced predictions were enriched for accessory genes and genes of unknown function, indicating that a subset of high-quality predictions might be cryptic prophage-like elements or poor predictions (Fig. 3b).

Significant P values (shown above the brackets) were calculated using two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and adjusted using the Hochberg method.

For the ΦPomma genome map, genes are coloured by PHROG categories; unknown genes are shown in grey. The deleted ‘DNA transposition protein' gene is highlighted by a black dashed box.

We next sought to investigate potential genetic mechanisms leading to trapping of prophages within the host genome by comparing experimentally induced prophages to highly similar, non-induced prophages (95% ANI, 85% AF; Supplementary Table 7). To classify these non-induced prophages as putatively cryptic, we restricted the analysis to prophages that had been sequenced (but not induced) in the same condition(s) as their inducible counterparts, with the rationale that highly similar prophages should respond to the same induction triggers. This resulted in a total of 231 prophage pairs between 65 induced and 58 non-induced prophages. No significant changes were found in gene frequency (P > 0.05, Fisher's exact test), indicating that, although gene loss may be characteristic of cryptic prophages, it is unlikely to be the initial cause of inactivation. Moreover, although we detected 201 homologous gene transfer (HGT) and 65 insertion–deletion events, there was no significant difference in the number of total events when compared to a set of high sequence similarity induced prophage pairs (222 pairs, P = 0.46, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Comparing host ANI between the induced and non-induced prophage pairs (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d), we found no association with induction (P = 0.6, Pearson's correlation), suggesting that prophage inactivation was not driven by diversification of the host or integration into divergent non-permissive hosts.

To investigate whether non-induced prophages have an elevated number of mutations, we measured the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) within the set of induced to non-induced prophage pairs, and their associated hosts. We found an overall elevated mutation rate in prophages (mean = 0.89, median = 0.18) compared with the host genome (mean = 0.16, median = 0.095, P < 2 × 10−16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), but no significant difference between induced to induced or induced to non-induced prophage pairs or their host genomes (P = 0.99 and P = 0.62 respectively, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 8). Comparing gene substitution rates, we found 143 genes with elevated dN/dS rates (>1), indicating diversifying selection (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 9). Notably, the majority (110 out of 143) of these genes lacked a known function and 40% (57 out of 143) were associated with DGRs, highlighting an active and not yet deciphered role of DGRs within gut prophages. Importantly, within the non-induced prophages we found a significant increase in the dN/dS substitution rates in genes involved in integration and excision (P = 0.002, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), suggesting that non-functional mutations in these genes provides a pathway for the inactivation of prophages.

To test whether the inactivation of integration and excision genes could trap a prophage inside its host genome, we constructed a gene deletion mutant of the inducible prophage Pomma by knocking out its DNA transposition protein (ΦPomma ∆tran) within the Bacteroides faecis host strain CC01414 (Extended Data Fig. 4e and Supplementary Table 10). From our previous inductions, we found that prophage Pomma was selectively induced by hydrogen peroxide and Stevia (37 mg ml−1). Using these two inducers, we compared the induction of wild-type ΦPomma versus the ∆tran mutant using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and sequencing of chloroform and DNase-treated supernatants. qPCR analysis showed a 3.5 and 2.6 log increase in ΦPomma concentration within the wild type versus ∆tran deletion mutant in samples treated with Stevia and hydrogen peroxide, respectively (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Table 11). Through sequencing, we observed clear induction in the wild-type strain, with 35- and 17-fold increased coverage over the bacterial background in the Stevia-treated and hydrogen-peroxide-treated samples, respectively, whereas no increase over the bacterial background was detected in the ∆tran mutant strain (Fig. 3f).

To determine whether prophage induction was linked to phylogeny, we examined the induction response across our ten conditions and standard growth control (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 3). Combined, the two concentrations of mitomycin C induced the largest number of prophages (n = 70) and the most Pseudomonadota prophages (n = 17). Hydrogen peroxide induced 43 prophages, including the largest number of Bacteroidota prophages (n = 35). However, these well-known induction agents exhibited only marginally increased induction compared to spontaneous induction during standard growth condition (n = 36). The Caco2 human cell induction conditions induced 29 prophages from 32 tested hosts, with Bacteroidota (n = 16) followed by Pseudomonadota (n = 9) showing the largest numbers of induced prophages. Considerable overlap was observed between prophage induction in standard media and induction agents (mitomycin C, n = 25; hydrogen peroxide, n = 15; Stevia, n = 19; carbon depletion, n = 9; SCFA depletion, n = 11; Caco2 induction conditions, n = 5). Comparing induction conditions across each phylum, the only significant difference observed was within the Pseudomonadota phyla in response to 3 µg ml−1 mitomycin C (P = 0.024, Fisher's exact test).

The box plots show the median (centre line), first and third quartiles (box limits), and the whiskers extend to ±1.5× the interquartile range; the means of three technical replicates are shown as dots. Normality was tested using the Shapiro–Wilk test, and significant P values (shown above brackets) of normal data were calculated using two-sided paired t-tests. e, The genome location of prophage ΦWilby (red) and ΦPomma (grey). Shaded lines connect genes with 100% amino acid identity (AAI).

We next investigated polylysogeny across our collection and its influence on induction (Fig. 4b). Polylysogeny was most prevalent within the Bacteroidota isolates, in which 28 out of 41 (68%) of lysogens had more than one inducible prophage compared with 11 out of 38 isolates (29%) across the other phyla (P = 0.002, Fisher's exact test). We then compared whether polylysogeny influenced induction, observing a positive correlation between the number of co-inhabiting inducible prophages and conditions leading to induction of each prophage (τ = 0.22, P = 0.002, Kendall's rank correlation; Fig. 4c). Prophages residing in polylysogens (n = 90) were induced on average in 2.7 conditions compared with 2.1 conditions in single lysogens (n = 35, P = 0.03, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), suggesting that polylysogeny may promote simultaneous prophage induction and reduce stability within lysogens.

Finally, we investigated differential induction within polylysogens by measuring the abundance of phage DNA in the supernatants of five highly similar (99% ANI) Bacteroidota caccae isolates harbouring the same two prophages (ΦWilby and ΦPomma; Supplementary Table 11). We identified an overall preferential induction of ΦWilby within standard medium (P = 0.006), but not in hydrogen-peroxide-treated samples (P = 0.9, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), with isolate CC01407 demonstrating the most marked difference between the two phages (P = 0.026, paired t-test; Fig. 4d). Calculating the ratio of ΦWilby over ΦPomma within each isolate, we found a significant variance of means between the isolates in both standard medium (P = 0.012) and hydrogen peroxide (P = 0.0008, analysis of variance (ANOVA)). These results implied that the host genetic background, even within highly similar isolates, may affect prophage induction. We previously identified phage ΦPomma as a transposable prophage that does not use site-specific integration, but randomly inserts into the host genome39. To investigate the prophage integration sites within our isolates, we used long-read sequencing on the five B. caccae strains. Genomic analysis identified ΦWilby integrated into the same tRNA gene location, which is characteristic of site-specific integration; however, the transposable prophage ΦPomma was found in four different genomic locations within the five isolates (Fig. 4e), implicating the integration site as a possible driver for the observed differential induction within these isolates.

The high microbial load within the human gut represents an optimal environment for temperate phages, as frequent interactions with their hosts provide ample opportunity for lysogeny12. Concordantly, the majority of bacteria within the gut are predicted to be lysogens, with up to 90% of bacteria harbouring at least one prophage11,12. However, the degree to which these prophages engage in lytic replication is poorly understood. Using our defined culture collection of 252 gut bacterial isolates, we predict that the majority harbour prophage-like elements (94%), but find that only a fraction of predicted prophages could be experimentally induced in pure culture (18%). Caveats to our approach include experimental cut-offs for detection and minimum amounts of DNA required for sequencing, which could exclude detection of low-level-inducing prophages. Moreover, there are probably biases towards induction and detection of Caudoviricetes prophages and, indeed, all but one prophage (from the Inoviridae family) belonged to this class. Moreover, considering little is known about prophage induction triggers within the gut, it is plausible that some of our isolates carry prophages that were not induced due to a lack of appropriate induction triggers. To address this, we constructed a synthetic microbiome community and co-cultured it with or without human cells to simulate the biologically relevant conditions within the human gut. Within the community co-culture, we estimate that around 29% of prophages were induced, with around half of these induced only in co-culture with human epithelial Caco2 cells. However, whether this induction was triggered by human cell factors or was the result of spontaneous induction mirroring the shift in host taxa was unclear36,40. We therefore investigated human host factors in the absence of community effects, using 32 pure culture isolates exposed to Caco2 cell monolayers, Caco2 cellular lysates and DMEM cell culture medium alone. We observed a modest increase in induction with lysed Caco2 cellular products compared with cell culture medium or intact cells, suggesting that human cellular lysis products act as prophage induction triggers. This is in accordance with previous observations of temperate virion expansion found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease that are associated with increased inflammation and cell death4.

Recent advances have highlighted the complexities governing prophage induction within natural environments, ranging from SOS-independent induction triggers, interprophage competition and interference by defence mechanisms41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48. Across our pure culture and community inductions, only a minority of predicted prophages was detected to undergo lytic replication. We therefore propose that, although the genetic pool of integrated prophages within the gut is large, only a fraction of these will readily undergo lytic replication. This is consistent with previous studies estimating low induction rates within the human gut and reduced lytic infection rates of temperate gut phages25,49. Furthermore, we detect distinct gene enrichment patterns where non-induced prophage predictions encoded fewer structural and lysis-associated genes, indicating that a portion of high-quality predictions might consist of prophage remnants or poor prophage predictions. Moreover, non-induced predictions with high sequence similarity to experimentally induced prophages exhibited increased non-synonymous substitution rates in integrase and excision-related genes. Deletion of one of these genes in an active prophage led to complete abolishment of induction, providing evidence for a genetic pathway towards prophage domestication.

A considerable portion of our isolates (52%) with inducible prophages were polylysogens, harbouring more than one replicating prophage48. We found a positive correlation between polylysogeny and successful prophage induction conditions, which is consistent with previous reports of phage anti-repressor proteins targeting non-cognate prophages leading to synchronized prophage induction50. Finally, we show that induction of polylysogenic prophages varied between near identical isolates, which correlated with divergent prophage integration sites within the host genome. Thus, prophage induction is complex and influenced by growth condition, polylysogeny and prophage integration site. In summary, we demonstrate the feasibility of culture-based approaches to provide insights into temperate phage biology and their interactions within human-associated commensals, and provide a validated collection of phage–host pairs for future use in synthetic biology, microbiome and biotechnological advances.

A culture collection of 252 bacterial isolates previously isolated and sequenced from human gut samples was used for prophage induction51. All bacterial culture work was performed in yeast-extract casitone fatty acid (YCFA) medium at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions (Whitely A95 anaerobic workstation) containing 10% carbon dioxide, 10% hydrogen and 80% nitrogen52. Each isolate was streaked onto YCFA agar plates and incubated for 24 h before a single colony was inoculated in 1 ml YCFA medium in a 96-well plate and incubated for 24 h. Frozen stocks of the 96-well master plates were maintained in glycerol suspension (25%, v/v) at −80 °C. Before each induction, 96-well plates containing 1 ml YCFA were inoculated from the frozen master plate and grown overnight.

A set of 40 single-copy marker genes were extracted from the 252 bacterial isolates using progenome-classifier53 and translated into amino acid sequences using SeqKit54 (v.2). The protein sequences were concatenated and aligned using MAFFT55 (v.7.310) before gaps were trimmed with trimAI56 (v.1.4.1). Maximum-likelihood trees were constructed using RAxML57 (v.8.2.12) PROTGAMMALGF model with 100 bootstraps replicates and visualized in iTOL58. Bacterial clusters sharing 99% ANI were identified using dRep59 (v.3.0.0) with the ‘-pa 0.9 --sa 0.99' flags. Prophage regions were predicted using Virsorter60, Vibrant61 (default settings) and VirFinder62 (minimum length 5 kb; 0.7 score; and P value 0.05). Completeness was predicted using CheckV63 and contaminating bacterial regions were removed. Trimmed predictions were located within their cognate bacterial genome and overlapping predictions were merged using R IRanges64 (v.2.28.0).

Prophages were induced by one of two methods. (1) Overnight starter cultures were diluted 1:50 in 1.5 ml standard YCFA medium and grown for 5 h before the addition of mitomycin C19 (0.3 or 3 μg ml−1, M4287, Sigma-Aldrich) or hydrogen peroxide20 (0.5 mM, H1009, Sigma-Aldrich). (2) Starter cultures were diluted 1:50 directly into standard YCFA medium, YCFA medium supplemented with Stevia23 (3.7 or 37 mg ml−1, SweetLeaf, organic Stevia leaf extract), carbon-depleted medium22 (YCFA medium with 50% reduced carbon source) or SCFA-depleted21 medium (YCFA medium without SCFAs). All cultures were then grown for 20–25 h followed by centrifugation at 4,000g for 30 min and 1 ml supernatants were collected. The supernatants were treated with 10 μg ml−1 DNase I (DN25, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.01 volume RNase A (R6148, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 37 °C. Viral particles were precipitated in 7% PEG 8000 0.3 M NaCl overnight at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 14,000g for 30 min, after which the pellets were dissolved in 50 μl TE buffer at 4 °C. Next, 20 μl of each sample was mixed with 5 μl loading dye containing 0.8% SDS and 60 mM EDTA and heated at 65 °C for 10 min. The samples were loaded onto 0.4% agarose gels and run in TAE for 1.5 h, followed by visualization of phage sized (about 50 kb) DNA bands using Image Studio Lite (LI-COR Biosciences) with a sample to control well signal ratio cut off of 0.03 (refs. 65). Samples with suspected viral DNA were treated with 0.5% SDS and 100 μg ml−1 proteinase K at 55 °C for 1 h followed by a 10 min inactivation at 65 °C. Phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction was performed followed by sodium acetate (0.3 M final) and 70% ethanol precipitation with 0.4 mg ml−1 glycogen overnight at 4 °C. The DNA quantity was validated using Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), with a minimum of 2 ng µl−1 required for sequencing. From these, a subset of samples was selected for sequencing as follows. First, all of the samples grown in standard YCFA medium or induced with mitomycin C were selected. Second, samples from at least one isolate within a bacterial cluster (99% ANI) grown in the remaining five induction conditions were selected, except for the Fusobacteria isolate, which was sequenced only in standard medium and mitomycin C. For 17 out of 84 clusters, more than one isolate was sequenced in all conditions. Nextera-XT libraries were constructed and sequenced on either the Illumina NextSeq 2000 or Illumina NextSeq 550 system.

Human colonic epithelial immortalized cells (Caco2 TC766; genotype verified by the AGRF Human Cell Line Identification Service) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, low glucose, GlutaMAX supplement, pyruvate) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), containing 10% FCS (Bovogen) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in T75 cm2 flasks (Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were routinely tested for the presence of mycoplasma contamination (MycoStrip, Invivogen) and were confirmed to be mycoplasma negative. For sonicated cell inductions, 4 × 107 cells in 5 ml DMEM (without FCS) were sonicated on ice (5 cycles, 30 s on and off at 40% frequency). Sonicated Caco2 cells were confirmed by observing efficient lysis of cells by bright-field microscopy and stored at −20 °C. Before the addition of bacterial cells, sonicated cells were thawed on ice and pre-reduced DMEM was resuspended with the cells for a final cell density of 5 × 105 cells per ml in the Whitley A95 Anaerobic Workstation (Don Whitley Scientific) at 37 °C. Sonicated cells in DMEM (2 ml) were added to 6-well tissue culture plates to achieve a total of 1 × 106 cells per well.

Two days before induction, 1 × 106 Caco2 cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates (Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a final volume of 2 ml per well with DMEM containing 10% FCS and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Caco2 confluent cell layers were serum starved under anaerobic conditions for 2 h by replacing the cell medium with 2 ml pre-reduced DMEM (no FCS) per well in the Whitley A95 anaerobic workstation at 37 °C.

Individual working stocks of bacterial isolates were prepared from overnight bacterial cultures that were centrifuged at 4,000g for 10 min, resuspended to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 5.5, combined 1:1 with 150 μl 50% glycerol and stored as frozen glycerol stocks (25% final glycerol). Glycerol stocks of individual bacterial isolates were thawed and 8.5 µl of each isolate was added to 6-well tissue culture plates containing 2 ml pre-reduced DMEM medium only, 2 ml sonicated Caco2 cells (total cell number, 1 × 106 cells per well) or confluent Caco2 cell layer. All cultures were grown for 24 h followed by centrifugation at 4,000g for 30 min after which 1.8 ml supernatants were collected, and viral DNA was extracted and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 2000 system as previously described.

Reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic67 (v.0.38) (SLIDINGWINDOW:4:25 MINLEN:100) and used to identify induced prophages using two approaches. First, high-quality prophage predictions (>50% completeness) were validated for induction as follows. Read coverage for each library were obtained on their corresponding genome using Bowtie2 (ref. 68) (v.2.3.5) (default settings). Genome coverage in 100 bp increments was obtained using Samtools69 (v.1.9) and Deeptools70 (v.3.1.3) and the average modified z score, coverage fold increase and Cohen's D of prophage regions was calculated as follows:

where z-scoreave is the average z score of the predicted region, xp is 100 bp coverage increments of the phage region, xh is 100 bp coverage increments of the host and \(\tilde{x}\) is median coverage of the host and

where Cohen's D is the effect size of prophage versus host coverage, Sh and Sp is the s.d. of the host and phage coverage, respectively71. Regions with a minimum average modified z score of 3.5 or an average twofold coverage and Cohen's D larger than 0.7 were retained. A custom Python script was then used to refine the start stop positions of the prophage regions within each genome, removing flanking 100 bp increments with coverage less than 25% of the mean prophage coverage (code is available at https://doi.org/10.26180/29946902.v1). In a second approach, regions of increased coverage were identified without previous prophage predictions using hafeZ72 (v.1.0.2) (default settings with the -N -S flags). Some of the identified regions of interest were found to be split across several host contigs. To resolve these into full-length phage contigs, de novo assembly using MetaViral SPade73 (default setting) was performed and contigs overlapping with hafeZ prediction were retained. The resulting contigs were dereplicated at 99% ANI over 85% of the AF using scripts from the CheckV repository and the longest representative of each prophage were retained for further analysis.

Proteins from the resulting contigs were predicted and annotated using PROKKA74 (v.1.14.6) (default settings, --hmms) with the PHROGS38 database. Furthermore, all proteins were scanned against the hmm databases provided by Cenote-Taker2 (ref. 75) using Hmmer76 (v.3.3.1) hmmscan (-E 1e-9). To remove potential fragmented protein hits against hallmark genes, a custom phage database was constructed of genomes from refs. 9,31 and the INphared database (December 2021 version) dereplicated at 95% ANI over 85% AF using CheckV scripts77. The same HMM searches were performed on proteins from the database and half the average length of the middle 80% percentile was calculated as a cut-off for each Caudoviricetes hallmark gene (265 amino acids for terminase large subunit, 245 amino acids for portal protein and 186 amino acids for major head protein). To identify any non-Caudoviricetes genomes, HMM searches for Microviridae, Tectiviridae and Inoviridae were performed as follows. Microviridae hallmark VP1 proteins from ref. 78 was made into HMM profiles using MAFFT v.7.310 with the standard settings followed by TABAJARA (-t 0.5 -p 50 -w 15 -b 15 -mb 15 -m c -gs 20 -md 3 -cs yes -mb 20)79. Multiple-sequence alignments of the double jelly-roll hallmark protein of Tectiviridae were obtained from a previous study80 and turned into HMM profiles using HMMER v.3.3.1 hmmbuild. These and the Inoviridae morphogenesis protein family HMMs provided by ref. 81 were searched against all proteins using hmmscan (-E 1e-9 and score ≥ 30). Contigs containing at least one viral hallmark gene were retained.

Working stocks of the synthetic microbiome community were prepared by combining 1.5 ml of overnight bacterial culture diluted to OD600 0.7, after which the community was centrifuged at 8,000g for 10 min, resuspended in 10 ml fresh YCFA and stored as frozen glycerol stocks (25% final glycerol). Human Caco2 confluent cell layers grown for 48 h in 175 cm2 tissue culture flasks (NUNC) in DMEM containing 10% FCS with 5% CO2 at 37 °C were transferred to anaerobic conditions (Whitley A95 anaerobic workstation) and the medium in each flask was replaced with 70 ml pre-warmed and pre-reduced (overnight) DMEM (without FCS). Next, 200 μl of the frozen community stock was added to each 70 ml tissue culture flasks containing Caco2 cell layers as well as to culture bottles containing 200 ml pre-reduced YCFA medium, both in five replicates. All cultures were grown anaerobically with samples (14 ml) taken at 24, 48 and 72 h. Total metagenome DNA extraction was performed using the FastDNA SPIN Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals) on 1 ml of each sample. The remainder of the sample was centrifuged at 3,000g for 30 min and the supernatant was collected and filtered through 0.45 μM syringe filters (Acrodisc, Pall) followed by incubation for 15 min with 0.1 volumes of chloroform at room temperature. The samples were then centrifuged at 4,000g for 15 min and 9 ml of the aqueous phase was collected and treated with 10 μg ml−1 DNase I (DN25, Sigma-Aldrich) and 120 μl RNase A (R6148, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature. Viral particles were precipitated using 7% PEG 8000 incubated overnight at 4 °C, centrifuged at 12,000g for 1 h and resuspended in 100 μl TE buffer. Viral DNA was extracted and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 2000 system as previously described.

Reads from the synthetic microbiome community were trimmed using Trimmomatic67 (v.0.38) (SLIDINGWINDOW:4:25 MINLEN:100), decontaminated of human reads (GCA_000001405.29) using Bowtie2 (v.2.3.5) and Samtools (v.1.19) and de-interleaved using bbmap (v.39.06). A database of community prophage genomes (high-quality predictions n = 338) and bacterial host genomes (n = 78, masked for prophage regions using bedtools (v.2.26.0)) was constructed70. Decontaminated community reads from samples were aligned against the database using Bowtie2 (default flags) and coverage was obtained using Samtools ‘coverage'. Host abundance was calculated from the Samtools outputs of total DNA extracted sequence libraries.

In viral-enriched samples, prophage species were regarded to be induced if at least one representative genome was covered with reads ≥85% of the length with a twofold increase in coverage (depth) over the mean host genome coverage (sum coverage of host contigs normalized by length) in a minimum three out of five replicates. For detection of individual prophage genomes, a custom metagenomic read classification database was built using KrakenUniq (v.1.0.4)82 containing prophage and prophage-masked host genomes. For database construction purposes, phage sequences were assigned the NCBI taxonomy IDs of their host bacteria. NCBI taxonomic data were downloaded using the ‘krakenuniq-download --db taxonomy' command on 7 July 2024. The KrakenUniq database was constructed with the krakenuniq-build command using Jellyfish (v.1.1.12) for k-mer extraction, a k-mer size of 21 and the --taxids-for-genomes option. Paired-end reads were merged using the read_merger.pl script within KrakenUniq and subsequently classified using the krakenuniq command with default parameters. On the basis of data from pure isolate inductions, a cut-off of 0.25 k-mer coverage, 10 reads and 100 unique k-mers was selected for calling detection of phage and a cut-off of 10 reads and 18,000 unique k-mers for calling detection of bacterial host genome was used. Prophage genomes were regarded as induced if they had a twofold increase in kmerDuplicity over mean host genome kmerDuplicity (sum duplicity of host contigs normalized to length) in a minimum of three out of five replicates. Prophages from undetected isolates were regarded as induced if detected in a minimum of three replicates. To estimate the number of detectable prophages within the community (prophages with at least 100 unique k-mers), pairwise distances between all prophage and prophage-masked host genomes were calculated using Mash (v.2.2.2) with a k-mer size 21 and sketch size 5000 (ref. 83). Neighbour-joining was applied to the resulting distance matrix as implemented in RapidNJ (v.2.3.2) with default parameters84. Using the resulting tree, a metagenomic classification database was constructed using Expam (v.1.2.2.5) with a k-mer size 21 and number of unique k-mers per genome was obtained using the CountUniqueKmers.py script (https://github.com/seansolari/expam/scripts/database/CountUniqueKmers.py)85.

Viral taxonomy was assigned based on a combination of the protein alignment method previously described2 against the INphared database and genus level clustering using vContact229 against phage genomes in the custom made database used for hallmark gene searches. In cases in which the taxonomic assignments from the protein voting and genus-level clustering method differed, the lowest common classification was assigned. Species level dereplication was performed at 95% ANI over 85% AF using scripts from the CheckV repository. DGRs were identified using DGRscan86 with the default settings, and remote VRs were identified querying the template repeat using BLASTn (v.2.7.1+) (-dust no -perc_identity 75 -qcov_hsp_perc 50 -ungapped -word_size 4). DGR-positive genomes were defined as genomes encoding both a reverse transcriptase gene and containing repeat regions.

The fractional abundance and prevalence of induced prophages within gut viromes were performed as described previously9 using the 1,241 human gut viromes described therein. Reads from each virome were competitively aligned to the temperate phage species genomes together with the custom database previously described. The number of reads and read coverage was obtained using Samtools ‘coverage' (v.1.9). The fractional abundance of a genomes was calculated as follows:

and the sum fractional abundance was normalized to 1 as previously described87. A genome was counted as present within a virome if at least 70% of the genome length was covered by reads.

Proteins of predicted prophages were predicted using PROKKA v.1.14.6 (default setting, --hmms) and annotated using the PHROG database. The total gene counts per PHROG category and the presence–absence of PHROG categories within each genome were obtained for induced, high-quality predictions (>50% completeness) and low-quality predictions (<50% completeness). The percentage gene frequency change of PHROG categories between induced, high-quality and low-quality predictions was calculated for total genes and presence–absence counts as follows:

where fcry and fin are the gene frequencies in the high completeness prediction and induced prophage set, respectively.

High-quality predictions were aligned to induced prophages using BLASTn (v.2.15.0+) and pairs with a minimum of 95% ANI over 85% AF (Checkv anicalc.py63 script) were further filtered to only include hosts that had been sequenced in the same condition(s) as the induced prophage. The same search was performed to identify induced–induced prophage pairs. The number of HGT and insertion–deletion events between the pairs was calculated using R IRanges (v.2.28.0) and splicejam (v. 0.0.77) packages, where an HGT event was defined as a gap of a at least 50 bp within the alignment present in both pairs and insertion–deletion events was defined as gap (minimum 50 bp) present in one of the pairs but not the other88. Gaps involving the ends of either prophage were excluded. Host ANI of prophage pairs was calculated using fastANI89 (v.1.33). dN/dS ratios between prophage pairs was calculated using dRep (compare --SkipMash --S_algorithm goANI) and the dnds_from_drep.py90 script.

Gene deletion of the DNA transposition protein gene within ΦPomma in B. faecis isolate CC01414 was achieved using the CRISPR–Cas-based system described previously91. First, we redesigned pB025, which contains the FnCas12a system, with a sgRNA targeting the DNA transposition protein gene (gene location, base pairs 5610–6524) along with a repair template containing 1,000 bp of homologous DNA up and downstream of this gene (Supplemental Table 10). This plasmid (pB025_09) was transformed into competent E. coli S17 and grown aerobically in LB medium supplemented with 100 µg ml−1 ampicillin. B. faecis was grown in brain–heart infusion (BHI) liquid medium supplemented with haemin, resazurin and vitamin K3 (menadione) under anaerobic conditions. Conjugation was performed under anaerobic conditions and B. faecis transconjugants were selected for with 200 µg ml−1 gentamicin and 25 µg ml−1 erythromycin. A deletion mutant was identified before anhydrotetracycline (aTc) induction, presumably due to leaky expression. This deletion mutant was verified by PCR and sanger sequencing confirming the clean deletion of the DNA transposition protein gene (CC01414 ∆tran).

Induction of ΦPomma in CC01414 wild type and deletion mutant (∆tran) was performed as described previously using hydrogen peroxide (0.5 mM) and stevia (37 mg ml−1) using three separate induction reactions for each condition and isolate. Lysates were treated with 2% chloroform, centrifuged for 20 min at 4,000g at 4 °C, DNase treated and phage precipitation with PEG, DNA extraction and sequencing was performed as described previously. qPCR of DNA extracted phage lysates was performed in technical triplicates using SYBR Green I Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics) with the Roche Lightcycler 480 system containing 1 μM of each primer, 2 μl of DNA template and 1× SYBR Green I Master Kit, in a final reaction volume of 20 μl. Cycle parameters were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min; followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, 62 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Primers were designed using Primer blast and no cross reactivity to bacterial background was detected (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast). The standard curve was produced with gBlock sequence from IDT containing the sequence targeted by ΦPomma primers.

Isolates were streaked onto YCFA plates and grown for 24 h. Three sperate colonies from each isolate were inoculated into 1 ml YCFA broth and grown overnight. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:50 into 1.5 ml standard YCFA medium and hydrogen peroxide was added after 5 h of growth. All cultures were grown for an additional 20 h and lysates were treated with 2% chloroform and centrifuged for 20 min at 4,000g at 4 °C and frozen at −80 °C until analysis was performed. qPCR was performed as previously described using 5 μl of DNA template and annealing temperature of 60 °C for 30 s and elongation of 30 s. qPCR primer pairs were custom designed using Primer 3 (https://primer3.org/). In silico PCR amplification (http://insilico.ehu.eus/user_seqs/PCR/) did not show cross reactivity of primers to the rest of the bacterial genome. Standard curves for primer efficiency analysis were generated by tenfold dilution in PCR-grade H2O. Samples were diluted tenfold and qPCRs was performed in triplicates. The efficiency of each primer calculated as in equation (5) and corrected ΔCt values calculated as in equation (6):

Isolates were streaked onto YCFA plates and grown for 24 h. Single colonies were grown overnight in 40 ml of YCFA medium, pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000g for 10 min and washed four times in 1 ml of PBS. DNA was extracted using the Monarch HMW DNA extraction kit (New England Biolabs) according to the Gram-positive bacteria protocol, with modifications. Cells were lysed in 300 μl of STET buffer (8% sucrose 5% Triton X-100 50 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris pH 8) containing 10 mg ml−1 lysozyme, 300 μl of HMW gDNA tissue lysis buffer and 20 μl of proteinase K and incubated at 56 °C for 10 min. The lysates were treated with 10 μl of RNase A at 56 °C for 5 min followed by 300 μl of protein separation solution. The samples were mixed by inversion for 2 min then centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 16,000g. The supernatants were collected and 550 μl of isopropanol was added to 800 μl of supernatant. The samples were inverted for 5 min, or until DNA was precipitated, and DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 12,000g. The resulting pellet was washed twice with 500 μl of gDNA wash buffer and resuspended in nuclease free water. Library preparation and Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing was performed using either the Oxford Nanopore ligation sequencing kit (SQK-LSK109) with native barcoding expansion kit (EXP-NBD114) (CC01407, CC01390, CC01401 and CC01405) or the rapid barcoding kit 96 (SQK-RBK110.96, CC01404). Resulting long reads were hybrid assembled with Illumina short reads into closed genomes using dragonfly (v.1.0.14) (CC01407, CC01390, CC01401 and CC01405) or into near complete genome using unicycler92 (v.0.4.7) (CC01404) with subsequent scaffolding using RagTag93 with CC01407 genome as reference.

Significance of PHROG gene category was calculated with Fisher's exact test (two sided) and P values were adjusted with the Hochberg method using R base stats (R v.4.1.3) and rstatix (v.0.7.0) packages. Pearson's correlation test between host ANI and phage pair inducibility as well as Kendall's rank correlation between the number prophages within lysogens and prophage inducibility was calculated and plotted using the R ggpubr (v.0.4.0) package. Significance of horizontal gene transfers and dN/dS data was calculated with Wilcoxon rank-sum test (two sided) and adjusted by Hochberg method using R ggpubr (v.0.4.0) and rstatix (v.0.7.0) packages. Normality of qPCR fold change between induced prophage in polylysogens calculated with Shapiro–Wilk test and significance tested with paired t-test (two sided) using rstatix (v.0.7.0), preferential induction calculated with Wilcoxon rank-sum test (two sided) and variance of means between isolates was calculated with ANOVA using the R base stats (R v.4.1.3) package. Genome maps were visualized using the R gggenomes (v.0.9.9.9000) package, and genome read coverage was visualized using R ggplot2 (v.3.5.1).

a, Schematic of bacterial single isolate inductions. Isolates were grown 20–25 h in standard media, Mitomycin C (0.3 and 3 μg/mL), hydrogen peroxide (0.5 mM), Stevia (3.7 and 37 μg/mL), carbon depleted or SCFA depleted media (n = 2,016). Samples were centrifugated, DNAse treated, PEG concentrated, and phage sized DNA bands were detected on agarose gels. DNA was extracted from samples with phage sized bands (n = 859) and DNA concentrations >2 ng/µL were chosen for sequencing based on condition and bacterial cluster (n = 452), 19 of which failed library preparation. Second, a subset of isolates (n = 32) were induced in DMEM media with or without sonicated or intact human colonic epithelial cells (Caco2) and DNA was extracted (n = 96), 3 of which failed library preparation. Prophages were predicted using Virsorter, Vibrant and VirFinder (n = 1972) and predictions >50% complete were trimmed for bacterial flanking regions (n = 736). Prophage reads (n = 526) were aligned to host genome and predictions with >2-fold coverage and Cohen's D > 0.7 or mean zscore >3.5 were retained. Further, reads were investigated for induction using HafeZ. De novo assembly using MetaViralSpades was used to resolve predictions spanning host contigs. Predictions were dereplicated at 99% ANI and 85% AF retaining the longest representative with at least one viral hallmark gene. b, Phylogenetic tree of bacterial isolates with heatmap depicting sequenced phage-enriched samples (shown in blue); Actinomycetota yellow (20/409), Fusobacteriota black (6/8), Bacillota blue (37/414), Pseudomonadota red (216/498) and Bacteroidota teal (247/786). c, Schematic of the synthetic community inductions. Isolates (n = 78) were co-cultured with or without Caco2 cell monolayer for 24, 48 and 72 h. Host abundance was calculated on total metagenome DNA using read mapping. Prophage induction was detected in phage enriched DNA at species level using read mapping as well as on individual prophage using KrakenUnique.

a, Annotated genome maps of the eight Hankyvirus genus phages species. Genomes are scaled by length with the ruler displayed at the bottom of the figure. Genes coloured by PHROG categories and unknown genes coloured in grey. DGR template and variable repeats denoted with black lines. b, Host range of Hankyvirus and LoVEphage species induced in this study. Light green denotes hosts found in NCBI RefSeq bacterial genome database; dark green denotes hosts in which the phage was actively induced in this study.

a, Gene sharing network between induced prophage species (solid circles, n = 68) and database representatives (9920). Representatives in translucence and coloured by host phyla when applicable otherwise in grey, except Crassvirales genomes from Yutin et al. 2021 which are highlighted with solid black boarded grey circles31. b, Mean fractional abundance and prevalence of Caudoviricetes phages within gut viromes (1241) shown as in Fig. 2b, but highlighting Crassvirales genomes in large solid grey circles. c, Annotated genome maps of four phage species encoding a second variable repeat (VR) distal from the RT cassette. Genes coloured by PHROG categories and unknown genes in grey. DGR template and variable repeats denoted with black lines.

a, Length distribution of all predicted prophages in this study separated by host phyla. Fusobacteriota excluded as only single isolate. A bimodal length distribution was observed for all phyla, with an initial peak at around 8 kb followed by a second peak at around 37 kb. b, Frequency of PHROG gene categories across induced (green, n = 134), high quality (> 50% completeness, orange, n = 736) and low quality (< 50% completeness, blue, n = 1236) predictions. Significant p values calculated using Fisher's exact test (two sided) and adjusted by Hochberg method shown above bars. c, Host ANI comparisons of induced to induced (n = 222) and induced to non-induced (n = 231) isolates with high similarity prophage pairs. Comparisons coloured by genus and shape based on NCBI taxon. Host pairs with less than 80% similarity grouped separately as too divergent for reliable ANI score. d, Density of ANI comparisons of all isolates within the dataset separated by phyla, coloured as in panel a. e, PCR amplification with phage specific primers surrounding the targeted gene (DNA transposition protein), visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis (single experiment) alongside GeneRuler 1 kb DNA ladder, showing deletion of a ~ 900 bp fragment in øPomma ∆tran mutant (gene product size, 915 bp).

Over the past decade, consumer wearable sensors have become increasingly ubiquitous in health monitoring, enabling the widespread tracking of key biophysical parameters. The transition towards next-generation body-interfaced biomolecular sensing technologies, fuelled by the integration of reagentless sensing strategies with advanced nanomaterials, marks the next substantial leap forward. These innovations enable unobtrusive, multimodal monitoring of both physiological parameters and biochemical disease markers in real time. This Review examines the current generation of body-interfaced biomolecular sensing technologies, with a particular emphasis on materials innovation and nanotechnological advancements, and discusses their pivotal role in chronic disease monitoring. The discussion extends to the challenges and prospects in this rapidly evolving field, highlighting the potential for materials-focused approaches to transform the landscape of chronic disease monitoring and management with body-interfaced bioelectronics. By harnessing the power of materials and nanotechnological innovations, these biomolecular sensing technologies promise to enhance diagnostic capabilities and foster a more proactive, personalized approach to combating these diseases.

Predicting complex disease risks on the basis of individual genomic profiles is an advancing field in human genetics1,2. However, most genetic studies have focused on populations of European ancestry, creating a global imbalance in precision medicine and underscoring the need for genomic research in non-European groups3,4. The Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative recruited more than half a million Taiwanese residents, providing a large dataset of genetic profiles and electronic medical record data for people with Han Chinese ancestry. Using extensive phenotypic data, we conducted comprehensive genomic analyses across the medical phenome with individuals genetically similar to Han Chinese reference populations. These analyses identified population-specific genetic risk variants and new findings for various complex traits. We developed polygenic risk scores, demonstrating strong predictive performance for conditions such as cardiometabolic diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancers and infectious diseases. We observed consistent findings in an independent dataset, Taiwan Biobank, and among people of East Asian ancestry in the UK Biobank and the All of Us Project. The identified genetic risks accounted for up to 10.3% of the overall health variation in the Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative cohort. Our approach of characterizing the phenome-wide genomic landscape, developing population-specific risk-prediction models, assessing their performance and identifying the genetic effect on health serves as a model for similar studies in other diverse study populations.

A principal promise of modern genetics is the ability to predict complex disease risk on the basis of a person's genetic profile. If successful, health management strategies can be developed to mitigate risk (disease prevention) and to optimize care (early diagnosis and effective treatment). Large-scale studies by the UK Biobank (UKB) and the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network show that risk prediction on the basis of genetics holds promise, and several countries are exploring ways to implement risk-based management in clinical practice1,2. Using polygenic risk scores (PRS) to predict disease risk and identify individuals at high risk is an emerging ‘precision medicine' approach to leverage genetic findings in clinical practice. However, a substantial limitation is that current PRS models are predominantly based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with participants of European ancestry (EUR)4,5, often leading to reduced predictive performance in groups of other ancestry6,7. To fully realize the potential of precision medicine for diverse global populations, population-specific phenome-wide genomic discovery must be performed at scale and clinically applicable polygenic risk models must be optimized in and across populations. To fill this research gap in a population of East Asian ancestry (EAS), we characterized the complex genetic architecture of the population of Han Chinese ancestry phenome wide, developed population-specific PRS and assessed the external validity of the models across populations with varying degrees of genetic similarity.

Populations of EAS represent nearly a quarter of the global population, but they account for only 3.95% of the participants in previous GWAS3. Although several biobanks have been built to recruit subjects from East Asia, they have moderate sample size (72,000–212,000), and many focus on specific conditions8,9,10,11,12. By contrast, biobanks with predominantly EUR participants13,14,15,16 have significantly larger sample sizes (224,000–635,000) and access to more comprehensive clinical data. The moderate sample size and limited phenotypes in existing EAS biobanks hamper discovery of unique genetic effects and preclude the development of robust and clinically useful PRS models for EAS.

We assembled a large non-EUR cohort, the Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative (TPMI), and genotyped more than half a million participants across 16 medical centres in Taiwan from 2019 to 2023. All the participants, who are overwhelmingly of Han Chinese ancestry, contributed DNA samples for genetic profiling with a custom-designed genotyping array and consented to provide their longitudinal electronic medical records (EMRs) from 5 years before enrolment and into the future. The EMR dataset includes rich and accurate health-related phenotypes, including medical diagnoses and biochemical examinations17. Here we present the results of comprehensive genomic analyses with extensive genetic and medical data derived from the TPMI cohort, including phenome-wide GWAS and PRS model development. We identified numerous population-specific risk variants/genes, observed evidence of genetic pleiotropy and pinpointed clusters of traits that shared similar genetic aetiology. Then, we developed and validated PRS prediction models for numerous conditions against external datasets including those from the Taiwan Biobank (TWB), the UKB and the All of Us Project. Our results show the benefits of leveraging a large cohort from an understudied population to identify unique genetic underpinnings of the human phenome, interpret causal effects by means of fine mapping and colocalization and improve the performance of population-specific PRS models, which together better illuminate the clinical implications of genetic risk.

We performed comprehensive genomic analyses, including GWAS, heritability estimation and PRS model building and evaluation, across a wide range of diseases and quantitative traits using 463,447 individuals genetically similar to Han Chinese reference populations from TPMI. We examined 695 dichotomized phenotypes (phecodes; case n > 2,000) and 24 quantitative traits (sample size > 100,000), spanning numerous disease categories (defined by phecode groupings18,19), such as neoplasms, metabolic disorders, circulatory conditions, autoimmune diseases and more (Fig. 1). The phecodes, derived from International Classification of Diseases codes18,19, alongside quantitative traits such as blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), liver enzymes and lipid levels, provide a robust dataset for exploring genetic contributions to human health (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The log-transformed case proportion identified from EMRs showed a moderate but significant correlation with the log-transformed 5-year disease prevalence from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan20 (r = 0.656, P = 2.69 × 10−84) (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1), indicating that the TPMI's hospital-based design may not fully capture mild and common illnesses, which are primarily observed in local and primary care clinics. Figure 1b displays the sample sizes for 24 quantitative traits in the TPMI and highlights sample size variation across traits, a key measure affecting the power and precision of association analyses in the cohort.

The correlation coefficient and significance were calculated using the two-sided Pearson correlation test. b, Bar chart showing the sample sizes for quantitative traits in the TPMI cohort. Each bar represents a trait, with the x axis indicating the different category of quantitative traits and the y axis representing the corresponding sample sizes. Definitions for abbreviations in panel b can be found in Supplementary Table 2.

Our GWAS identified at least one significant locus (P < 5 × 10−8) for 265 phecodes of the 695 tested and all 24 quantitative traits. Highlighting the robustness of the TPMI data, we observed a high replication rate of reported disease loci from EAS GWAS on the GWAS catalogue (actual/expected ratio (AER) = 78.17%, considering the statistical power with the published tool, PGRM21), particularly for endocrine and metabolic/hematopoietic diseases (AER = 88.68% and 84.62%, respectively; Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 3). Lower replication rates for respiratory disease (AER = 23.53%) may reflect limited case numbers; untyped genetic variants, such as rare variants, copy number variation and structural variants; or recruitment bias such as age distribution.

We applied the sum-of-single-effects model for fine mapping to identify the independent variant–trait associations and reported the genetic variant with highest posterior inclusion probability of identified credible sets as well as the single lead variant for the failed fine-mapping regions and major histocompatibility complex region (MHC region; chromosome 6: 25,391,792–33,424,245). Our analyses showed a total of 2,656 fine-mapping-identified independent association signals, including 1,309 from phecodes GWAS and 1,347 from quantitative traits. Notably, 95 new associations, defined as having no previously reported results within 1 Mb in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalogue21 of relevant GWAS, were identified across 50 phecodes and seven quantitative traits. In addition, we identified 217 new hits from previously reported regions, defined as having low linkage disequilibrium (r2 < 0.1) with any variant observed in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalogue within 1 Mb for the same phenotype (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). After applying the multiple testing correction, 1,502 fine-mapped associations passed a Bonferroni-adjusted threshold (5 × 10−8/(695 + 24) = 6.95 × 10−11), as well as 21 previously unreported variants and 115 new hits.

Of the 95 new genetic associations, 30 variants are rare (minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.05) in populations with other ancestry (African or African American (AFR), Admixed American (AMR), South Asian (SAS) and non-Finnish European) in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)) and 33 variants less than 0.01 in EUR, the most extensively studied population, which explains why they were not reported in previous GWAS. For example, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs17089782, a missense variant in PIBF1 (p.R405Q) on chromosome 13 is significantly associated with thyroid cancer (P = 2.8 × 10−9) in the TPMI cohort. This SNP has a MAF of 5.65% in TPMI but 0.01% in EUR, which may explain why this association was only detectable in TPMI. However, PIBF1 is essential for immune regulation, especially during pregnancy, and is relevant to autoimmune diseases and cancer22. Another variant identified in our analysis of BMI (rs761018157; P = 4.8 × 10−9, MAF in TPMI = 4.34%, MAF in EUR < 0.01%) maps to PHOX2B. This gene, highly expressed in the nervous system, had previously been linked to obesity hypoventilation syndrome in a small study (n = 30)23 and associated with bone mineral density24. In addition, when we compare the effect size in TPMI and UKB for the rest of the new findings, 25 exhibit a significant different effect size (P < 0.05). For instance, a TPMI-identified platelet-count-associated variant, rs12955741, located in the intergenic region between TGIF1 and DLGAP1, exhibits a different effect size (β) compared to that in UKB (βTPMI = 0.044, βUKB = −0.005, P = 1.7 × 10−9). Moreover, the high hepatitis B virus carrier rate in Taiwan25 contrasts sharply with its rarity in European cohorts, enabling TPMI to identify new loci associated with viral hepatitis B (case number in TPMI = 23,618 versus UKB = 132). Among the 26 independent loci identified in our analysis of hepatitis B, 19 fine-mapped loci are new (Extended Data Fig. 3). Notably, 18 of these 19 loci were found to be associated with liver function or diseases (Supplementary Table 5). These new associations highlight the uniqueness of certain disease loci in the TPMI cohort, presenting opportunities for developing population-specific therapeutic interventions and advancing precision medicine.

All identified independent associations are summarized in Fig. 2. The identification of the MHC region as a significant hotspot on chromosome 6 emphasizes its extensive involvement in immune-related diseases across several categories. Similarly, the short arm of chromosome 11 (INS-KCNQ1 region) also affect various traits, including metabolic, endocrine and genitourinary diseases. These hotspots of trait-relevant variants implied the shared genetic mechanism among diseases and potential of pleiotropic effects.

Vertical bars show the accumulated number of independent variant–trait associations for dichotomized phecodes (top) and quantitative traits (bottom). Each category of diseases and traits is represented by a corresponding colour. The x axis is chromosome number and the y axis represents the accumulated number of associations, highlighting the uneven distribution of trait-associated variants across phenotypes.

Linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis (LDSC)26 showed strong liability-scaled SNP heritability (h2) for conditions such as alcoholism (h2 = 0.213), retention of urine (h2 = 0.163) and open-angle glaucoma (h2 = 0.160). Among quantitative traits, body height (h2 = 0.323), BMI (h2 = 0.218) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (h2 = 0.191) exhibited the highest heritability estimates (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Information), highlighting the significant role of genetics in these traits. These results have far-reaching implications for precision medicine, as higher heritability signals indicate the potential for more accurate genetic risk-prediction models that could improve personalized disease risk assessments.

We then partitioned heritability at the gene level and identified 329 unique genes contributing significantly to phenotypic variation (h2 > 0.1% and Z-score > 1.64). Of these, 45 affected more than one phecode and/or quantitative category, including key genes such as APOE, APOC1, TOMM40, ABCG2 and KCNQ1 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 7). We also conducted a colocalization analysis to elucidate the potential molecular function of identified GWAS signals with three expression quantitative traits locus (eQTL) datasets, including the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx)27, Multi-ancestry Analysis of Gene Expression (MAGE)28 and the Japan COVID-19 Task Force (JCTF)29 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 8). Our results identified 391 unique genes that potentially mediate the outcome through their expression level (posterior probability > 0.9), including GBAP1, which colocalized with five different traits (uric acid, serum creatinine, hematocrit, hypertension and gout). Among the colocalized genes, 75 of them can be identified only in the multi-ancestry lymphoblastoid cell lines eQTL (MAGE; 20 genes) and/or Japanese whole blood eQTL (JCTF; 59 genes). Our findings demonstrate the effect of these genes (such as APOE, ABCG2 and KCNQ1) on several traits and disorders. By elucidating shared genetic effects, these results offer opportunities to develop precision medicine approaches that address comorbidities, such as treating hyperlipidaemia and reducing dementia risk through a single intervention targeting APOE, which influences both lipid metabolism and Alzheimer's disease risk. This gene-level understanding emphasizes the potential to optimize therapeutic strategies by leveraging genetic pleiotropy in disease management.

Dots represent gene-level h2 > 10−3; squares indicate colocalization posterior probability (PP) for the hypothesis that both traits are associated and share a single causal variant (H4) > 0.9; and triangles show both. Inner circle indicates the number of associated traits for each identified gene. Outer circle indicates chromosome number. The bar chart shows the number of identified genes by category and grouped by type of pleiotropy. We estimated h2 with h2gene57 and performed the colocalization analysis with coloc58.

Pairwise genetic correlation and clustering analyses showed three main phenotype clusters: cardiometabolic traits, autoimmune and infectious diseases, and kidney-related traits (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 4). The cardiometabolic cluster, which includes type 2 diabetes, hypertension and BMI, reinforces the interconnected phenotypic and genetic architectures of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The cluster of autoimmune and infectious diseases, which includes viral hepatitis B, psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus, illuminates shared immune system pathways and potential gene–pathogen interaction. The kidney-related cluster involved gout, chronic kidney disease, calculus of kidney and ureter, ankylosing spondylitis and measures of urea nitrogen, creatinine and uric acid. The shared genetic architecture provides opportunities to leverage the genetic risk of correlated traits while developing the PRS model.

Cross-population comparisons30 with EUR GWAS from UKB showed varying degrees of transethnic genetic-effect correlation (ρge), with strong, statistically significant correlations for traits like cholelithiasis (ρge > 0.999), type 2 diabetes (ρge = 0.829) and ischaemic heart disease (ρge = 0.756), but moderate correlations for gout (ρge = 0.616) and psoriasis (ρge = 0.418) (Supplementary Table 6). The moderate correlations indicate the differentiated genetic mechanism and disease distribution across populations (gout case n = 24,411 in TPMI and 3,179 in UKB; psoriasis case n = 4,166 in TPMI and 2,197 in UKB). Therefore, these findings demonstrate the importance of population-specific genetic studies, as differences in genetic architectures between populations can significantly affect the accuracy of PRS models.

Building on these insights, we developed and validated PRS models that demonstrated strong predictive performance for a wide range of diseases. Although we used five PRS tools, including LDpred231, Lassosum232, PRS-CS33, SBayesR34 and MegaPRS35 (Supplementary Tables 9–13), we found that LDpred2 outperformed the others for most traits (Extended Data Fig. 5). Therefore, we took the results of LDpred2 for further comparisons. Of the 265 PRS models for phecodes, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values exceeded 0.55 for 105 dichotomized phecodes with a significant P value (P < 0.05). Additionally, the explained variance of models for 24 quantitative traits ranged from 0.028 (aspartate aminotransferase) to 0.227 (height). (Supplementary Table 9 and Extended Data Fig. 6). The most predictive PRS models included highly heritable traits such as ankylosing spondylitis (AUC = 0.812 ± 0.016), psoriasis (0.709 ± 0.016), atrial fibrillation (0.702 ± 0.014), prostate cancer (0.696 ± 0.018), systemic lupus erythematosus (0.696 ± 0.015), rheumatoid arthritis (0.646 ± 0.011), type 2 diabetes (0.640 ± 0.005), female breast cancer (0.611 ± 0.010) and hypertension (0.610 ± 0.004). Interestingly, the PRS for hepatitis B also demonstrated high genetic predictability (0.654 ± 0.008). Because h² represents the upper bound of variance that can be explained by PRS, we examined the proportion of heritability captured by our models (r2/h2). A total of 36 traits, including prostate cancer (r2/h2 = 0.054/0.070), type 2 diabetes (0.066/0.126) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.136/0.191), reached more than 50% of their SNP heritability, indicating that PRS can achieve near-optimal predictive accuracy for highly heritable traits. However, for complex diseases influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, PRS performance is inherently constrained by the fraction of heritability attributable to common variants. These findings reinforce the importance of SNP heritability as a reference point for evaluating PRS utility and highlight the need for larger, ancestrally diverse datasets to further enhance genetic prediction models (Extended Data Fig. 6).

Leveraging the identified clusters, we performed a multitrait PRS training, PRSmix+36, for the traits in each cluster (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 14). Notably, multitrait PRS models improved prediction accuracy for the cardiometabolic disease cluster with a 0.040 increase in AUC (from 0.608 to 0.648) and a 1.770-fold improvement in phenotypic variance explained (r2). The performances of autoimmune and kidney-related disease clusters were also enhanced, with average AUC improvements of 0.018 and 0.009, respectively (from 0.641 to 0.659 and 0.601 to 0.610, respectively) and 1.351-fold and 1.349-fold improvements in r². The significant enhancement of multitrait PRS prediction (comparing r2 of LDpred2 and PRSmix+ with a paired t-test, P = 1.07 × 10−13) highlights the potential of leveraging shared genetic architecture to enhance disease risk prediction. Figure 5 demonstrates the performance of single-trait and multitrait PRS across three disease clusters, as well as the differing effectiveness of PRS in predicting genetic risk across various disease categories.

Grey bars indicate SNP heritability (estimated from TPMI GWAS unrelated set (n = 248,754) with LDSC) and the coloured bars represent the r2 values, indicating the proportion of variance explained by the PRS among TPMI validation set (n = 20,000) from single-trait PRS (LDpred2, red bar) or multitrait PRS (PRSmix+, blue bar). The dot-and-whisker plots showcase predictive accuracy using AUC with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomized traits. Asterisks indicate h2 estimates that consider the MHC region.

To evaluate the robustness and generalizability of our PRS models, we performed an external validation of the models (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, viral hepatitis B, gout, calculus of kidney from PRSmix+ and others from LDpred2) in TWB, unrelated individuals genetically similar to Han Chinese reference populations, n = 88,628), UKB (self-reported EAS, n = 9,893) and All of Us (genetically inferred EAS, n = 6,895). We found that the prediction accuracy, AUC, of our models ranged from 0.548 (glaucoma) to 0.712 (prostate cancer) in TWB, 0.557 (female breast cancer) to 0.634 (hypertension) in UKB and 0.520 (migraine) to 0.709 (gout) in All of Us (Extended Data Fig. 7). Although the TWB questionnaire did not contain specific details on hepatitis B status, we used antihepatitis B core total antibodies (Anti-HBc) as an indicator of infection or past infection and hepatitis B surface-antigen (HBsAg) as a marker of acute/chronic infection. Intriguingly, the AUCs for the TPMI-derived model of hepatitis B were 0.674 ± 0.003 for HBsAg and 0.530 ± 0.002 for Anti-HBc in TWB. These results demonstrate the high predictive value of the PRS for hepatitis B for predicting symptoms and severity of the disease.

TPMI-derived PRS models perform better than the UKB EUR-derived models when applied to EAS for viral hepatitis B, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, gout and migraine. (Extended Data Fig. 7) For the other traits, TPMI-derived models consistently outperform the UKB ones, although the confidence intervals overlap. However, the overlapping confidence intervals in UKB and All of Us may be due to their limited sample size of EAS. These results indicate that population-specific PRS models allow for more accurate risk stratification and enable personalized healthcare interventions for EAS. Additionally, we assessed the performance of TPMI-derived PRS and TPMI-included cross-population PRS across various ancestry groups, including populations of EUR, AFR, AMR and SAS ancestry from the UKB and All of Us cohorts (Extended Data Fig. 8). Performance varied by diseases, but consistent results were observed for female breast cancer and glaucoma across populations, and TPMI-included cross-population PRS slightly but not significantly improved in the populations other than EAS and EUR.

Although overall health is hard to define with a few metrics, herein, we used the count of clinical visits and duration of hospitalization to roughly describe individuals' overall health. We found that 131 of the top-performing PRS models (LDpred2 models with AUC > 0.55 and all PRSmix+ models for phecodes and all models for quantitative traits) are significantly associated with overall health indices, explaining 8.47% of the variation in clinical visit frequency (P = 2.69 × 10−14) and 10.29% of the variation in hospitalization duration (P = 5.62 × 10−27; Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Table 15) in the comparison between top and bottom 5% groups after adjusting for sex, age and recruiting hospital. Among the identified clusters, the cardiometabolic disease cluster contributed the most to the indices, accounting for 1.32% of clinical visits (P = 0.02) and 3.55% of hospitalizations (P = 7.10 × 10−9). This may reflect the high prevalence of cardiometabolic diseases in the hospital-based TPMI cohort. In short, quantification of the effect of PRS for various diseases and traits on human health opens up opportunities for developing precision health management strategies.

This study represents a large-scale GWAS in the population of Han Chinese ancestry, using data of around 500,000 individuals recruited from 16 medical centres across Taiwan. We investigated the genetic architecture of 695 dichotomized phecodes and 24 quantitative traits, identifying 2,656 independent variant–trait associations and showed that population-specific genetic risk-prediction PRS models for a wide range of diseases performed well in the population. Indeed, for the traits with sufficient sample size in the cohort, PRS performance rivals those developed for EUR using UKB data. These findings show that population-specific PRS models can be developed successfully for populations of non-EUR, and our project serves as a model for large-scale genetic studies in other populations.

Recent large-scale projects that emphasize ancestral diversity in human genetic studies have discovered new findings with the inclusion of subjects of non-EUR. MVP conducted multi-ancestry GWAS on 635,000 participants, identifying more than 2,000 signals unique to populations with non-EUR16. With the TPMI dataset, we performed larger GWAS in subjects genetically similar to Han Chinese reference populations for several traits than published studies. For instance, the previous largest meta-analysis for type 2 diabetes included 20,573 cases who were of Han Chinese ancestry37. By contrast, our GWAS included 59,289 cases of type 2 diabetes, almost tripling the number of cases ever tested and identified five unreported type 2 diabetes associated loci from known regions, demonstrating the power of TPMI sample size. Identification of new and population-specific risk variants may lead to further understanding of their molecular mechanism and underline the need for population-specific weightings in PRS models. Moreover, population-specific findings also better explain the performance of population-specific PRS models in the population in question. In short, our population-specific genomic profiles for comprehensive phenotypes provide a solid foundation for PRS development.

Our understanding of how the genetic factors influencing hepatitis B, an endemic infectious disease in Taiwan with an estimated hepatitis B virus carrier rate of 9.78% among the unvaccinated cohort (born before 1984)25, also benefited from the large dataset. With 23,618 cases, a significant increase from previous studies of only a few thousand cases38,39,40, we identified 26 fine-mapped signals, including 19 new loci, and showed a significant negative correlation between hepatitis B and other autoimmune diseases, such as Sicca syndrome, psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Our well-performed and validated PRS model for hepatitis B demonstrated that the host genome may determine the severity and symptoms of this infectious disease. This is similar to that previously reported in COVID-19 and pneumonia, where genetic factors have been shown to influence disease outcomes41,42,43,44. Our unexpected success of GWAS and PRS for hepatitis B not only demonstrates the power of the large sample size of TPMI but also shows the necessity of population-specific genetic study for population-enriched diseases. The benefits extend beyond differences in ancestry to include environmental factors such as pathogen exposure, food intake and lifestyle influences. Exploring how the human genome interacts with these diverse external and environmental factors can greatly enhance our understanding of how genetic variants contribute to disease susceptibility or severity.

In addition, the comprehensive phenotypic data allow us to investigate the genetic correlation among several traits that have substantial implications for clinical applications and leverage them to improve the performance of PRS models. By identifying shared genetic risks across diseases, at-risk individuals can be alerted to pursue early detection of comorbidities and targeted prevention strategies. For example, the clustering of cardiometabolic traits, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension and BMI, highlights their interconnected genetic basis and indicates that individuals with a high genetic risk for one condition may benefit from early screening and intervention for related conditions45. Additionally, the shared genetic architecture allows the development of multitrait PRS models that integrate genetic risks across correlated traits, improving prediction accuracy and enabling precision medicine approaches that address several health outcomes simultaneously46. Including the correlated traits in PRS model development improved performance, resulting in an average 1.55-fold increase in the explained percentage of phenotypic variation (P = 1.07 × 10−13). Although previous studies have proven the utility of multitraits on target diseases36,47,48, we have extended the use this approach on a phenome-wide level and demonstrated the improvement across different types of traits. As a result, we produced well-performed PRS for various categories of diseases, including cardiometabolic diseases, autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases.

We evaluated our PRS models across several large cohorts, including the TWB, UKB and All of Us. The TPMI-derived PRS models consistently outperformed those developed from EUR when applied to diseases in people with Han Chinese or EAS ancestry from the three large cohorts. When comparing with EUR-derived PRS models, we also observed better performance across several traits in EAS, particularly for cardiometabolic and autoimmune diseases. Similarly, the TPMI-included cross-population model slightly improves performance in populations of other ancestries. These results highlight the need for population-specific models and emphasize the importance of genetic data from diverse populations to advance cross-population models. By integrating these well-developed PRS models, we estimate that genetics account for 10.3% of variation of hospitalization duration in TPMI. Although the estimates of genetic contributions to health measure may be influenced by disease prevalences and ascertainment biases, our result indicate integrating genetic risk-based health management strategies with traditional risk factors, such as age, sex, smoking and BMI, may enhance prediction models and refine personalized risk stratification.

As with other large-scale epidemiological studies, ascertainment bias is also observed in our study. TPMI's case proportion shows a significant but moderate correlation with the prevalence from NHIRD, implying potential ascertainment bias of TPMI's hospital-based design. Compared to the general population in Taiwan (NHIRD), TPMI participants are overrepresented in the middle-aged group (year of birth 1940–1970, 54.3% versus 38.3%), include slightly more females (55.1% versus 50.6%) and have a higher proportion of participants from northern Taiwan (59.5% versus 47.3%). These demographic differences, along with the volunteer-based recruitment process, probably contribute to the lower case proportions observed in TPMI (Fig. 1a). Importantly, a significant portion of disease records in the NHIRD originate from local clinics and primary care settings, which are not covered in TPMI. Notably, the EMRs of the participants are incomplete, as some participants receive care from several health providers, but the TPMI only has access to EMRs from their enrolment hospitals. We acknowledge that ascertainment biases may influence disease prevalence and heritability estimates. Thus, we accounted for case-control ascertainment by applying liability-scale transformations using population prevalence data from NHIRD and used independent validation for PRS (TWB, UKB and All of Us) to mitigate the effect of ascertainment biases, while acknowledging that residual biases may persist. Methods like inverse probability weighting could mitigate such biases49, but these require detailed external reference data that are unavailable at present. Additionally, we observed a relatively low estimated heritability for body height and BMI in TPMI, compared to values reported in the literature50,51. These estimates may be affected by factors such as inconsistencies in assessment across EMRs, variations in statistical approaches and reduced bias of assortative mating in TPMI population52,53,54. These limitations also emphasize the need for future adjustments to enhance generalizability.

In addition to ascertainment bias, our study has other commonly found limitations. First, the TPMI cohort size is not sufficiently large to study some of the severe subtypes of many diseases, such as diabetes insipidus and neurofibromatosis. Second, we attempted to use eQTLs to elucidate the molecular mechanism of diseases, but the underrepresentation of EAS in current eQTL datasets, such as GTEx, poses challenges27. Gene expression regulation varies across ancestries55,56, and differences in LD structures further complicate colocalization analyses. Comparing to GTEx whole blood eQTL, the multi-ancestry lymphoblastoid eQTL and Japanese whole blood eQTL showed 309 more gene–trait pairs. Therefore, ancestral diversity is an urgent need not only in genomic data but also in transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and epigenomic datasets. Third, the current project retrieved EMRs from an average of 5 years before enrolment, so some important data such as age of disease onset for the older participants are not available. Incomplete EMRs lead to less precise case definition of some participants. Fourth, some of the younger participants have high-risk genetic profiles but are disease free for those diseases. The duration of the project is too short to determine whether they will eventually develop those diseases.

An effort is underway to gain access to the complete EMRs of the TPMI participants and to recruit more participants with severe subtypes of common diseases. The high-risk participants who are symptom-free are being followed to monitor disease development. Future studies are being planned to study the high-risk individuals who escape disease development to identify genetic and non-genetic factors that mitigate their disease risk. Furthermore, the meta-analysis integrating TPMI with other large-scale EAS biobanks, such as TWB11,12, Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study9, China Kadoorie Biobank10 and Biobank Japan8, may further enhance our understanding of the genetic aetiology in EAS and improve prediction models.

This study demonstrates that population-specific risk-prediction models, such as those developed for EAS in this work, can achieve strong predictive performance for traits with high relevance in that population. The PRS we developed for EAS performed well for several traits, including diseases with significant public health implications, such as type 2 diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus. However, for certain traits, such as female breast cancer and glaucoma, PRS derived from both UKB and TPMI performed comparably, indicating that the genetic architecture of some traits allows for generalizable models. These findings emphasize the importance of developing and validating PRS models in diverse global populations to maximize their utility and equity in genetic risk prediction. Although our results emphasize the utility of developing population-specific PRS, further research is needed to directly compare their performance with multipopulation models and assess their generalizability and to assess their effect on disease prevention and management. In particular, longitudinal studies and real-world implementations will be critical to determine the extent to which PRS-guided interventions can delay disease onset or improve health outcomes. Furthermore, it is hoped that if all can obtain their genetic profiles and determine their risk for major diseases, many diseases can be prevented or their onset can be delayed significantly, thereby fulfilling the promise of modern genetics.

In conclusion, we used a large-scale dataset of individuals genetically similar to Han Chinese reference populations produced by the TPMI to conduct phenome-wide genetic analyses and leverage these genetic findings to train risk-prediction models for several diseases and traits. The developed models are validated in EAS of different biobanks and demonstrate a consistent performance that bodes well for their use in populations of Han Chinese and EAS ancestry. Our approach can serve as a template for developing PRS models in populations that are currently without such resources, anticipating the time when all populations around the world can benefit from risk-based health management as part of the precision health movement.

We used the TPMI dataset, which links extensive EMRs with genotypic data for 486,956 individuals. Dichotomized disease status was defined by phecodes, which were based on information extracted from the EMR using International Classification of Diseases codes18,19. To ensure robustness, cases were defined by having the diagnosis of the relevant condition on two or more clinical visits. We also extracted quantitative traits from the EMR, including anthropometric, vital sign and laboratory measurements; we excluded the extreme outliers and removed or adjusted the treated and/or medicated measures on the basis of previous research; and the median value was kept if the participant had several qualified measures59 (Supplementary Information). In this study, we focused on 695 phecodes that had at least 2,000 cases and 24 quantitative traits that were measured in at least 100,000 individuals. These phecodes spanned 16 disease categories, including but not limited to infectious diseases, neoplasms, endocrine/metabolic disorders and circulatory system diseases. The 24 quantitative traits were categorized into anthropometric, circulatory, hematological, kidney-related, liver-related and metabolic measurements.

We performed genotyping using two customized high-density Axiom SNP arrays produced by Thermo Fisher, TPMv1 and TPMv2. The genotyping experiments were conducted in six genotyping centres in Taiwan17. The raw genotypic data underwent quality control measures, and the genetic variants were excluded when they had a call rate less than 0.98, MAF < 0.01, or Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test P < 1 × 10−6. We also excluded individuals with overall call rate less than 0.95, failed heterozygosity check, or inconsistent documented versus genetically determined sex. For this study, we only included the genetic variants found on both genotyping arrays and excluded variants with a significant batch effect in GWAS. The proportion of genetic ancestry was determined by ADMIXTURE60, and the projected principal component scores with 1000 Genomes as a reference panel were applied to determine individuals' ancestry61. As a result, 401,710 genetic variants and 463,447 Han Chinese participants passed all quality control measures and were used in the subsequent studies. Details are found in Supplementary Information and on GitHub (https://github.com/TPMI-Taiwan/tpmi-qc).

Phasing was conducted on quality-control-passed genotype data with SHAPEIT562. Genome imputation was carried out with IMPUTE5 using a reference panel of 1,498 whole-genome-sequenced TWB subjects12,63. We also conducted postimputation quality control with exclusion criteria INFO score ≤ 0.7 and MAF ≤ 0.01. In addition, we also performed a chip-GWAS for minimizing the bias from different chips, resulting in a dataset of 8,046,864 well-imputed common genetic variants.

We performed a principal component analysis (PCA) on the basis of genotyped variants to capture the effect of population structure. To diminish the effect of close relatives, the main PCA was conducted in a genetically unrelated subset, and other subjects were projected with the calculated PC weightings. Then these PCA scores were leveraged to accurately quantify the proportion of identity by descent and degree of relatedness. The maximum unrelated set was determined on the basis of these estimated degrees of relatedness. PC-AiR and PC-Relate were used for PCA and relatedness estimation, and PRIMUS was used for identifying the maximum unrelated set with the third degree as threshold64,65,66.

The entire dataset was divided into three subgroups: the GWAS set (n = 363,447), the training set (n = 80,000) and the testing set (n = 20,000). To maximize the statistical power, we used a mixed-effect regression model to examine the association between genotype and outcome of interest, logistic regression for dichotomized phecode and linear regression for quantitative traits. The quantile-normalization was applied to quantitative traits to ensure the normal distribution. The mixed-effect model accounted for relatedness among individuals by including a random effect for pairwise kinship. The model was also adjusted for key covariates, including age, sex, age2, interactions between age/age2 and sex, genotyping chip, enrolment hospital and ten genetic principal components to control for population stratification. SAIGE was applied for the mixed-effect model GWAS67. In the GWAS set, we selected an unrelated subset (n = 248,754) to perform GWAS using a generalized linear model with PLINK2, and we conducted 1:10 age, sex-matching for the traits with imbalanced case/control ratio (less than 1/20). These PLINK2 GWAS statistics were then used for heritability and genetic correlation estimation68.

To systematically evaluate the performance of our GWAS, we leveraged a presummarized phenotype–genotype reference map69, which collected 5,879 genetic associations for 149 unique phecodes from 523 published GWAS, including 1,215 associations from EAS. We calculate the overall and power-adjusted replication rates and actual over expected ratio for each available phecode and categories, respectively. The R package PGRM was used to measure the quality of biobank data through replication69.

We performed fine mapping to identify the independent GWAS signals in all genomic regions containing any variant with a P value less than 5 × 10−8 and plus or minus 1.5 Mb of the regional lead variant14, except the MHC region (chromosome 6: 25,391,792–33,424,245) because of its complex linkage disequilibrium structure. We used the reported 95% credible set to determine the independent signals, and up to ten signals were allowed for each region. The genome-wide significant threshold was applied for defining a credible set as an independent hit, and a further requirement of log Bayes factor > 2 was applied for the second hit. For the failed fine-mapping regions and MHC region, we used the lead SNP as the hit of each significant region. SuSiE was conducted for this summary statistics-based fine mapping with linkage disequilibrium derived from our imputation reference panel70, which reflects our study population's genetic architecture. Although using linkage disequilibrium from the GWAS sample might improve accuracy, we used the imputation panel because of the computation efficiency.

We comprehensively compared our GWAS results with reported significant signals on the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalogue21, downloaded on 11 March 2024. The mapping of phecodes and quantitative traits to GWAS catalogue phenotypes is summarized in Supplementary Table 16. We classified a variant as new if the fine-mapped independent signal was not located within 1 Mb of any reported genome-wide significant association (P < 5 × 10−8) for the corresponding phenotype. Additionally, a variant was considered a new hit if the highest linkage disequilibrium r² was less than 0.1, with any reported significant association within 1 Mb. Associations derived from uncertain and umbrella phecodes were excluded, and for duplicated genetic variants or regions, we only reported the association with the smaller P value or from the phecode with the more specific definition. Finally, we used ANNOVAR to annotate the new variants with data from the RefSeqGene database (updated 17 August 2020)71,72. For the new variants, we explored their allele frequencies in non-Finnish European, AFR, SAS and AMR from gnomAD73. We also compared the effect size between TPMI and UKB with a t-test for investigating the ancestry-specific effect.

To quantify the genomic contribution of the specific traits, we applied linkage disequilibrium score regression to estimate the SNP-based heritability with LDSC26. The GWAS summary statistics and the precalculated linkage disequilibrium score from the EAS superpopulation of 1000 Genomes were used61. For the dichotomized traits, we performed a liability-scaled transformation on the observed heritability using the 5-year population prevalence from the NHIRD of the Health and Welfare Data Science Center20,74. For traits with a higher prevalence in our dataset (TPMI) than the population (NHIRD), we applied the equation from ref. 75. For other traits, we used the adapted equation from ref. 74. Additionally, we conducted LDSC to obtain pairwise genetic correlations to assess the similarity of genetic mechanisms between traits76. On the basis of the genetic correlation matrix, we used a hierarchical cluster analysis to identify groups of traits that share genetic mechanisms. We used the weighted pair group method with arithmetic mean for clustering, and the resulting cluster tree was used for group identification. Moreover, we estimate the genetic correlation across populations, TPMI and UKB, to demonstrate varied genetic architecture in different ancestry populations. For the UKB GWAS, we applied a generalized linear model from PLINK2 with the predefined phecode (https://github.com/umich-cphds/createUKBphenome) and corresponding baseline quantitative measures among the identified unrelated set (n = 378,544). We used Popcorn for the cross-population genetic correlation, and two correlation coefficients were calculated: the transethnic genetic-effect correlation (ρge) and transethnic genetic-impact correlation (ρgi)30.

We used both gene-level heritability estimation and colocalization analysis to map our GWAS findings to functional units, specifically genes. We conducted h2gene analysis to partition SNP-based heritability to the gene level57. We estimated heritability for genes that overlapped with fine-mapped regions, where gene regions were defined as the gene body plus or minus 10 kb for gene-level heritability. Additionally, to illustrate the molecular functions of genes of interest, we used colocalization analysis to examine whether there are shared common genetic causal variants between tissue-specific gene expression and traits of interest. We used eQTL resources from 49 tissues in GTEx v.827, lymphoblastoid in MAGE28 and whole blood in JCTF29, testing any gene with genome-wide significant signals in the cis-regulation region (transcription start site plus or minus 1 Mb). The posterior probabilities were used to evaluate colocalization between gene expression and the trait of interest. The R package coloc was used with SuSiE, relaxing the single causal variant assumption58,77,78.

The preserved dataset of 100,000 unrelated TPMI subjects was split into two subsets, training (n = 80,000) and validation (n = 20,000), for PRS model building. Five popular PRS tools were used—LDpred231, Lassosum232, PRS-CS33, SBayesR34 and MegaPRS35—and the training subset was applied for parameter selection and model optimization if needed. LDpred2, PRS-CS and SBayesR assumed the effect of genetic variants following a mixture distribution with different predefined parameters and applied a Bayesian framework for distribution estimation. Lassosum2 used a penalized regression (LASSO) for weight estimating, and MegaPRS leveraged MAF and linkage disequilibrium for model building. We then used the validation subset to evaluate the performance of PRS models. Individual scores were calculated with PLINK268. The explained variance (r2) was used to evaluate the performance of PRS for quantitative traits75,79, and two indices, AUC and liability-scaled r2, were used for PRS of phecodes. We followed the approach of ref. 79 and report both raw r² and r² adjusted for covariates (sex, age and PCs). Additionally, we include partial r² estimates, calculated using the R package rsq. To account for population stratification in cross-cohort predictions, we also report r² with PCs as covariates in Supplementary Tables 9–14. For AUC comparisons, we include a baseline model incorporating standard covariates (sex, age and PCs) to better assess the added predictive power of PRS. We used the likelihood ratio test to obtain the significance for r2 with the R package lmtest, and we calculated the standard error for AUC with the R package auctestr. To further leverage the gene's pleiotropy and shared genetic mechanism among traits, we conducted multitrait PRS model building for the traits in the same genetic cluster based on pairwise genetic correlation identified in the previous step. We pooled all PRS models from the five tools for those identified traits and applied an elastic net regression to combine their weighting and find the most optimized model for the target trait. We performed PRSmix+ for multiple-traits PRS model building36. The cross-population PRS models were based on both TPMI and UKB European GWAS (https://pheweb.org/UKB-TOPMed/), and PRS-CSx was applied80.

We conducted an external validation of our developed PRS using data from the TWB, EAS from UKB and All of Us. TWB is a community-based biobank, and it has recruited over 200,000 participants in Taiwan. Herein, we used 88,628 unrelated subjects (greater than third degree; we removed 5,242 overlapped individuals), who were genotyped with the Axiom customized chip TWB2 (equivalent to TPMv1); their genotyping quality control, phasing and imputation followed the same protocol as described above. The self-reported disease condition was queried from their baseline questionnaire, except for cancer. Because the study design of TWB excluded cancer patients at recruitment, we used both baseline and follow-up self-reporting data to define cancer cases and controls. UKB has enroled approximately 500,000 participants since 2006 and linked their genetic data with enriched phenotypic data. For UKB validation, we used their inpatient record for case definition. Their ancestral population was determined by self-reported ethnic background, such as self-reported Chinese as EAS (n = 1,572); white, British, Irish and any other white background as EUR (n = 472,869); Black or Black British, Caribbean, African and any other Black background as AFR (n = 8,074); and Asian or Asian British, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and any other Asian background as SAS (n = 9,893). All of Us intends to enrol more than 1 million participants in the United States and has released whole-genome genotyping data for approximately 312,000 participants as of the first quarter of 2024. We applied ADMIXTURE with 1000 Genomes as a reference panel to assign the genetically inferred ancestral populations, including EAS (n = 6,895), EUR (n = 152,754), AFR (n = 60,964), AMR (n = 32,394) and SAS (n = 2,334). The genetically confirmed EAS as well as other superpopulations and their linked EMR were used for validating our PRS models. Moreover, we compared the TPMI-derived PRS model with UKB-derived models to investigate the performance of population-specific PRS. The UKB-derived models were based on published UKB European GWAS (https://pheweb.org/UKB-TOPMed/), and LDpred2-auto was applied for model building.

We evaluated the genetic effect on overall health measures. We used the number of clinical visits and the aggregate duration of hospitalization as overall health indices. Owing to collinearity among PRS for different traits, we used a partial least square-generalized linear model to extract components from the PRS of qualified traits with the R package plsRglm81. The number of extracted components was determined by the Akaike Information Criterion. We then estimated the covariate-adjusted proportion of genetic contribution (r2) by comparing the full model with the null model, which included only covariates such as sex, age and hospital. We used a likelihood ratio test to obtain the significances of regression models. For each index, we used three models to compare the top and bottom 5%, 10% and 20%. We selected covariate-matched controls from subjects without hospitalization records as the bottom group for hospitalization models.

The significantly positive correlations are observed across disease categories between the case proportion in TPMI (x-axis) and the 5-year prevalence in NHIRD (y-axis), except congenital anomalies.

The replication rates of TPMI GWAS-identified loci when compared to previously reported loci from the GWAS catalog are presented in this bar chart. Red bars indicate the comparison of TPMI findings to that of all ancestries and blue bars represent the comparison to East Asian ancestries. The categories of diseases are shown under the bars.

The names of nearest mapped gene were labeled for the independent GWAS significant loci.

Heatmap showing genetic correlations among heritable traits. Genetic correlations were estimated using LDSC, with colors representing the correlation coefficients between traits. The weighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (WPGMA) was used for clustering with the correlation coefficient as distance between traits.

The color represents the phecode category, and the shape indicates the PRS development tool: Lassosum2 (circle), LDpred2 (triangle), MegaPRS (square), PRS-CS (cross), and SbayesR (square cross). Each phecode is positioned at a unique x-coordinate, with the tool that has the highest AUC highlighted.

Bar and dot plot showing PRS explained variance (r²) and SNP-heritability for dichotomous traits. Gray bars indicate SNP-heritability (estimated from TPMI GWAS unrelated set [n = 248,754] with LDSC), and the colored bar chart presents the r² values, indicating the proportion of variance explained by the PRS among TPMI validation set (n = 20,000), and dots and error bars show Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) with 95% confidence interval. An asterisk (*) indicates estimates considering the MHC region.

PRS performance is presented as Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) with 95% confidence inverval in TPMI (orange, TPMI validation set, n = 20,000), Taiwan Biobank (green, n = 88,628), East Asians in UK Biobank (blue, n = 1,572), and East Asians in All of Us (purple, n = 6,895). Circles represent TPMI-derived PRS, and triangles indicate UKB (European)-derived PRS models. Only the estimates with case size > 30 were showed on the figure.

The plots show the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) with 95% confidence inverval for PRS validation in East Asian (red, n = 88,628 in TWB; 1,572 in UKB; 6,895 in All of Us), European (olive green, n = 472,869 in UKB and 152,754 in All of Us), African (green, n = 8,074 in UKB and 60,964 in All of Us), South Asian (blue, n = 9,893 in UKB and 2,334 in All of Us), and Admixed American (purple, n = 32,394 in All of Us) populations from TPMI (circle), UKB (triangle), and All of Us (square) cohorts.

Detailed methods of genotyping and phenotyping quality control and discussion of SNP-based heritability for quantitative traits, including Supplementary Figs. 1–20 and Tables 17–20.

Tropical forests act as important global carbon sinks1, and Earth System Models predict increasing near-term carbon sink capacity for these forests, with elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration thought to stimulate tree growth2,3. However, current forest inventory data analyses suggest that the carbon sink capacity of intact tropical forests may be in decline, portending a possible future switch from carbon sinks to carbon sources3,4,5,6,7. Here we use long-term forest inventory data (1971–2019) from Australian moist tropical forests and a causal inference framework8,9,10 to assess the carbon balance of woody aboveground standing biomass over time, the demographic processes accounting for it, and its climatic drivers, including cyclones. We find that a transition from sink (0.62 ± 0.04 Mg C ha−1 yr−1: 1971–2000) to source (−0.93 ± 0.11 Mg C ha−1 yr−1: 2010–2019) has occurred for the aboveground woody biomass of these forests, with sink capacity declining at a rate of 0.041 ± 0.032 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. The transition was driven by increasingly extreme temperature and other climate anomalies, which have increased tree mortality and associated biomass losses4, with no evidence of the carbon fertilization (stimulation) of woody tree growth. Forest dynamics underlying carbon sink capacity were also punctuated by cyclones, with impacts of a similar magnitude to long-term climate-induced changes. Our findings suggest the potential for a similar response to climate change by woody aboveground biomass in moist tropical forests globally, which could culminate in a long-term switch from carbon sinks to carbon sources.

CRT is calculated by dividing a, total standing aboveground biomass (AGB) by b, biomass loss rate. c, CRTs were calculated per decade for each plot (grey lines), then averaged to give regional means. Panels (a-b) show regional means for standing biomass and biomass loss, plotted using a loess smooth on all plot-by-census data. Grey shading is the 95th percentile confidence interval for error on the loess-smoothed annual means.

a, Wood density, b, stem density, c, basal area, and d, mean AGB of dead stems (biomass loss divided by number of dead stems) for n = 279 timepoints (n = 20 plots).

This arises because the statistical infrequency of cyclones results in smaller sample size for this group. Net AGB rate is the annualized change in per hectare AGB gains minus AGB losses. Boxplots show the interquartile range of the distribution, with census records for individual plots (open circles) and statistical outliers based on the inter-quartile range of the Net AGB distribution (closed circles).

Bars represent each census interval and are shaded by interval length (lighter bars for longer intervals) to aid visual interpretation. Red triangles represent the cyclone dates for each plot affected.

Recalled memories become transiently labile and require stabilization1,2,3. The mechanism for stabilizing memories of survival-critical experiences, which are often emotionally salient and repeated, remains unclear4. Here we identify an astrocytic ensemble that is transcriptionally primed by emotional experience and functionally triggered by repeated experience to stabilize labile memory. Using a novel brain-wide Fos tagging and imaging method, we found that astrocytic Fos ensembles were preferentially recruited in regions with neuronal engrams5 and were more widespread during fear recall than during conditioning. We established the induction mechanism of the astrocytic ensemble, which involves two steps: (1) an initial fear experience that induces day-long, slow astrocytic state changes with noradrenaline receptor upregulation; and (2) enhanced noradrenaline responses during recall, a repeated experience, enabling astrocytes to integrate coincident signals from local engrams and long-range noradrenergic projections, which induce secondary astrocytic state changes, including the upregulation of Fos and the neuromodulatory molecule IGFBP2. Pharmacological and genetic perturbation of the astrocytic ensemble signalling modulate engrams, and memory stability and precision. The astrocytic ensemble thus acts as a multiday trace in a subset of astrocytes after experience-dependent neural activity, which are eligible to capture future repeated experiences for stabilizing memories.

Recall transiently destabilizes memories, which require re-stabilization to become long-lasting1,2,3. Despite its importance in human cognition and neuropsychiatric disorders6,7, the mechanisms that specifically stabilize memories of critical experiences—those that are essential for survival and frequently marked by emotional salience and repetition—remain incompletely understood. Memory traces are linked to specialized neuronal ensembles (neuronal engrams), which include neuronal populations that become Fos+ during both initial and repeated experiences8. However, neuronal Fos alone, a plasticity marker that indicates circuit remodelling9, is insufficient for memory stabilization, implying the need for additional cellular substrates.

By tiling the entire mammalian central nervous system (CNS), astrocytes structurally and functionally interact with neurons and other glia. Their functions contribute to information processing and animal behaviour, and their dysfunctions are widely implicated in CNS disorders10,11. Astrocytes are known to be developmentally diverse12,13,14 and can adaptively change their molecular programmes in response to physiology11,15,16,17,18 and pathology19,20,21—hereafter referred to as state—in specific ways that suggest flexibly altered functions in a context-dependent manner. This adaptability is akin to experience-dependent neuronal responses (such as Fos upregulation)22 and the subsequent formation of inter-regional neuronal engram network8. However, the manifold nature of astrocyte responses through an extensive array of cell-surface receptors for neuroactive biomolecules19,23,24 have made it challenging to determine whether, when and how multiple inputs are integrated by a subset of astrocytes to generate specific states that form astrocyte ensembles that are responsible for particular cellular outputs15,18,24,25. This is because the field has lacked adequate tools to explore behaviourally relevant astrocyte ensembles (BAEs) in an unbiased manner at the single-cell level as well as in a brain-wide manner, which would enable ensemble-specific molecular dissection and functional perturbation.

To agnostically and holistically identify BAEs, we developed a brain-wide astrocyte Fos tagging tool that enables permanent genetic access to BAEs that express Fos due to a specific experience. Although behaviourally relevant stimuli-induced astrocyte Fos mRNA22 and c-Fos protein18,26 have been observed in selected brain regions, its brain-wide profiling remains largely unexplored. We systematically validated a novel genetic and imaging strategy for whole-brain BAE tagging, demonstrating astrocyte selectivity, Fos sensitivity and temporal regulation (Extended Data Figs. 1–3). First, using a CNS-wide-transducing adenovirus (AAV) vector (AAV-PHP.eB) with an astrocyte-specific GfaABC1D promoter27, we achieved widespread, astrocyte-selective (97.3–99.5%) expression (Extended Data Fig. 1). Second, we tested whether using AAV-PHP.eB to express Cre-dependent mNeonGreen (mNG) can serve as a marker of transient astrocytic Fos induction in Fos-iCreERT2 (TRAP2) mice28. This intersectional approach aimed to drive astrocytic mNG expression only when the Fos promoter was active during fast-acting 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) administration, enabling behaviour epoch-specific astrocyte Fos tagging across the CNS. As a positive control, we virally expressed the astrocytic Gαq-coupled designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) hM3Dq, a strong inducer of astrocyte c-Fos26,29,30, combined with 4-OHT and the hM3Dq agonist clozapine N-oxide (CNO) intraperitoneal injection. hM3Dq stimulation yielded approximately 282 mNG+ astrocytes per mm2, and significantly lower tagging in controls (Extended Data Fig. 2). Third, to probe the temporal dynamics of Fos-mNG tagging, dark-adapted mice were exposed to light at various intervals relative to 4-OHT administration28. Tagging peaked within a 6-h window around 4-OHT administration, with an approximately 22-fold increase in astrocytes in visual cortex compared with those in somatosensory cortex, indicating regional specificity and dependence on local neuronal activity (Extended Data Fig. 3). Collectively, these experiments validated our behaviour epoch-specific, brain-wide BAE tagging strategy.

To broadly explore BAEs in a learning paradigm, we used a contextual fear conditioning and recall task5,28 (Fig. 1a). TRAP2::AAV-PHP.eB-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG mice underwent three days of habituation to minimize contextual novelty and isolate associative components of fear learning and recall28,31. On day 4, one group received 3 foot shocks with immediate 4-OHT (FC), and another received 4-OHT immediately after recall 24 h post-FC (FR). Controls were non-shocked mice (NoFC) or fear-conditioned mice kept in the home cage for 24 h and given 4-OHT without recall (NoFR). Shocked groups exhibited robust freezing in the conditioned chamber, indicating learning and recall (Fig. 1b). One week later, whole-brain serial two-photon tomography (STPT)32 enabled the detection of individual mNG+ astrocytes (BAEs) (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). After excluding ventricular niches for bona fide astrocyte counts (Methods), BAE counts across 677 regions covered approximately 80.7% of the brain (Supplementary Table 2).

Whereas the number of Fos+ neurons increased during both FC and FR, forming networks causally linked to fear memory traces—commonly referred to as engram neurons5,8,28, the density of Fos+ astrocytes during FC (FC-BAE; Fig. 1c) was seldom distinguishable from the NoFC control (NoFC-BAE). However, we found that the number of BAEs during recall (FR-BAE) was augmented across multiple regions (Fig. 1c). This was not simply reflecting delayed Fos upregulation after FC, because Fos induction was significantly higher in FR than in NoFR. Normalized comparisons across engram regions5 (Fig. 1d) showed a significantly greater number of FR-BAEs compared with FC-BAEs, particularly in the amygdala (Fig. 1e), the region long implicated in fear memory across species3,4,33,34,35. Consistently, in the lateral and basolateral amygdala (LA/B), astrocytic c-Fos protein was unchanged after FC or in NoFR versus NoFC, but FR induced a marked increase at 1.5 h with partial decay by 6 h (Extended Data Fig. 4). Consistently, the number of of FR-BAEs in the LA/B (FR-BAELA/B) was robust whether 4-OHT was given immediately or 3 h post-FR (Extended Data Fig. 5). These data indicate that astrocyte Fos promoter activity, and the associated surge in Fos mRNA and c-Fos protein expression, peaks within a biologically plausible window of 0–3 h following FR, but not following FC.

A recent study18 reported an increase in hippocampal astrocytic Fos after FC without habituation, contrasting with our findings (Fig. 1c–f). We hypothesized that this reflects contextual novelty: without prior habituation, novelty strongly drives astrocytic Fos. Supporting this, our ‘FC + novelty' group (FC in novel context with no habituation) showed widespread astrocytic Fos, including in CA1 (Extended Data Fig. 6). Thus, the CA1 astrocytic Fos is likely to signal novelty, whereas our habituated FC protocol reveals astrocytic ensembles that are more selectively engaged in learning and recall.

To holistically compare the anatomical positioning of BAEs with previously reported brain-wide Fos+ neuron distribution during FC and FR5, we analysed subregions from previously defined regions in which Fos+ neuron counts of FC and FR were significantly higher than in non-shocked controls, referred to as neuronal ‘engram significant brain regions'5 (Fig. 1e–g and Methods). The number of Fos+ neurons increased during FC versus non-shocked controls, whereas there was no apparent change in astrocytic Fos counts (Fig. 1f). By contrast, FR elicited a strong correlation between neuronal and astrocytic Fos induction (r = 0.56; Fig. 1g,h), suggesting that local astrocyte–neuron interactions may underlie FR-BAE formation22. Notably, amygdala subregions that displayed selective astrocytic Fos increases during FR (Fig. 1e) also showed parallel neuronal Fos increases (Fig. 1h, yellow dots).

To test whether astrocytic and neuronal ensembles are co-engaged within the same regions, we performed dual-colour Fos tagging in the amygdala of TRAP2 mice (Fig. 1i–k). Neuron-specific DIO-mCherry and astrocyte-specific DIO-mNG AAVs were co-injected, and four groups were analysed: NoFC, FC, NoFR and FR. Neuronal Fos increased after FC or FR, consistent with past reports5,8,22. By contrast, astrocytic tagging was minimal following FC and NoFR but was robustly induced after FR (Fig. 1i–k), replicating our brain-wide observations (Fig. 1c–h). These results confirm that astrocyte Fos induction in the amygdala is recall-specific and distinct from neuronal ensemble dynamics.

To identify mechanisms underlying astrocyte Fos induction, we combined pharmacological screening, circuit genetics, in vivo imaging and transcriptomics (Figs. 2–4). Growth factors that activate c-Fos in neurons36 did not trigger c-Fos signals in primary astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 7), indicating that the induction mechanisms of c-Fos in neurons and astrocytes are distinct. Given the accumulating evidence that astrocyte G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation upregulates c-Fos expression26,29,30, we then stimulated primary astrocytes with a variety of neurotransmitters that bind to GPCRs expressed in astrocytes11,22,23, observing that noradrenaline (NA) increased c-Fos signals (Fig. 2b,c). The astrocyte c-Fos signals induced by NA at 0.1 µM and 1 µM were both abolished by propranolol (Fig. 2d), which antagonizes Gαs-coupled β-adrenergic receptors (β-receptors), but not by prazosin or atipamezole, which antagonize Gαq-coupled α1-adrenoreceptors (α1-receptors) or Gαi-coupled α2-adrenoreceptors, respectively (Fig. 2d). The astrocyte c-Fos induction was resistant to the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM)37. The membrane-permeable Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin did not increase astrocyte c-Fos signals (Fig. 2d). However, the inhibition of cAMP production by the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 attenuated astrocyte c-Fos signals induced by the adenylate cyclase–cAMP activator forskolin, the β-receptor agonist isoproterenol or NA (Fig. 2d). Together, these data show that NA induces c-Fos signals in primary astrocytes mainly through Gαs-coupled β-receptors and subsequent increases in cAMP.

Astrocytes in vivo respond to both local circuits and long-range neuromodulators15. Our data (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 3d) suggest that local activity also contributes to Fos induction in vivo. Given the transcriptional differences between in vitro and in vivo astrocytes, notably the reduced expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3, encoded by Grm3) in cultured astrocytes17,38, which is abundantly expressed in adult in vivo astrocytes39, we heterologously expressed mGluR3 in primary astrocytes via AAVs to mimic the in vivo context (Fig. 2e). In mGluR3-expressing astrocytes, glutamate alone was ineffective, but in combination with NA it strongly enhanced c-Fos intensity (Fig. 2f,g). No such synergy was seen in mGluR3-negative astrocytes. Because Gαi-coupled GPCRs such as mGluR3 can enhance Gβγ–Ca2+ signalling when Gαq–phospholipase Cβ is co-activated29,40, NA may recruit α1-receptors (Gαq) and mGluR3 (Gαi) to cooperate with β-receptor–cAMP pathways (Fig. 2h). Supporting this, ionomycin-induced Ca2+ signals enhanced c-Fos when combined with NA, isoproterenol or forskolin (Fig. 2i). Thus, astrocytic c-Fos is driven primarily by β-receptor–cAMP and is further potentiated by convergent glutamate and NA signalling.

To test this convergence in vivo, we expressed neuron-specific hM3Dq in LA/B and locus coeruleus (LC), which mainly consists of noradrenergic neurons to stimulate them with CNO (Fig. 2j–m). The number of Fos-mNG+ astrocytes remained low when only LA/B or LC neurons were activated, but increased markedly when both were stimulated (Fig. 2j–m). This provides in vivo evidence that coincident local and noradrenergic inputs induce astrocytic Fos.

We next tested the necessity of local and far-reaching NA neural signals during FR-BAE tagging. TRAP2::AAV-PHP.eB-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG mice received one of four perturbations at the time of tagging: β-receptor antagonism with propranolol (Fig. 2n) or hM4Di-mediated silencing of LC neurons (Fig. 2o), amygdalar neurons (Fig. 2p) or amygdalar engram neurons tagged with the robust activity marking (RAM) system41,42 whose hM4Di-based silencing (Extended Data Fig. 8) is known to reduce fear memory recall41 (Fig. 2q). In all conditions, FR-BAE density decreased significantly (Fig. 2r), demonstrating dependence on both LC-NA and local engram activity.

To further test whether FR-BAEs reside in anatomical contexts where they could receive convergent inputs from both noradrenergic projections and local engram neurons, we performed dual-colour Fos tagging with neuron-specific DIO-mCherry and astrocyte-specific DIO-mNG AAVs in TRAP2 mice, combined with noradrenaline transporter (NET) immunostaining to visualize noradrenergic projections (Extended Data Fig. 9). Territories of FR-BAEs showed greater overlap with noradrenergic projections and FR engram neurons than those of non-FR-BAEs, with no change in astrocyte territory size. These findings indicate that FR-BAEs are positioned to integrate convergent inputs from noradrenergic projections and local engram neurons, supporting the model that their coincidence drives FR-BAE induction in the amygdala.

Our data (Fig. 2) support a convergence model in which NA and engram activity induce astrocyte Fos. However, since both activities occur during FC and FR8,43, the stronger astrocyte Fos induction during FR than FC (Fig. 1) raises the question of how astrocytes generate this selective response. To address this, we examined NA release and astrocyte cAMP–Ca2+ signalling dynamics across fear learning and recall using in vivo fibre photometry (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 8). We deployed AAV2/9-hSyn1-GRABNE2h44 to monitor bulk NA signals in the LA/B of freely behaving mice (Fig. 3a,b). During habituation 24 h prior to FC, NA signals were observed when the mice were placed into context A (CtxA; foot shock chamber) (peak ΔF/F = 0.142 ± 0.017), probably reflecting mild stressors and/or locomotion44 (NoFC; Fig. 3b). On top of the contextual NA signals, single foot shocks evoked enhanced and relatively fast (peak ΔF/F = 0.206 ± 0.04; half-decay = 4.3 min) NA responses in LA/B (FC; Fig. 3b). In addition, further enhanced (peak ΔF/F = 0.211 ± 0.022) and prolonged (half-decay = 13.5 min) NA signals were observed during the contextual FR (FR; Fig. 3b). The prolonged NA signals were absent in context B (CtxB) (Extended Data Fig. 10c,d), a neutral, non-conditioned context where mice show no freezing (Extended Data Fig. 10b), indicating that recall of contextual fear drives sustained NA signals.

We next used dual-colour fibre photometry (AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-cAMPinG1 and AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-RCaMP345) to measure astrocyte cAMP and Ca2+ signals (Fig. 3c). Consistent with the NA signals (Fig. 3a,b), cAMPinG1 signals increased during habituation and foot shocks, which fully decayed within about 2 min (NoFC and FC; Fig. 3d). On the FR day, however, astrocytes displayed a progressive increase in cAMP (FR; Fig. 3d), which was absent in CtxB (Extended Data Fig. 10e,f). β-receptor antagonism (propranolol) in vivo abolished the astrocytic cAMP signalling during FR (Fig. 3d), which suppressed FR-BAE induction (Fig. 2n,r) and freezing (Extended Data Fig. 10b′). Foot shock elicited astrocyte Ca2+ signals as reported previously46, and Ca2+ event frequency increased during FR (Fig. 3e). These data collectively indicate that fear experiences induce the enhancement of NA signals within the amygdala, which strongly trigger astrocyte cAMP signals through β-receptors during FR.

The increased astrocyte cAMP–Ca2+ signalling during FR raised the question of how astrocytes mount stronger responses during recall than during conditioning, despite NA release and engram neural activity occurring in both fear experiences. To address this, we examined experience-dependent molecular changes in astrocytes under NoFC, FC, NoFR and FR conditions. We dissected amygdala tissue 90 min after behavioural testing and isolated astrocytes by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using the ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit β2 (ATP1B2)47 antibody ACSA2 (Extended Data Fig. 11a) and performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). After quality control, we obtained profiles of 1,903 astrocytes (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 11b,c) and identified 4 transcriptionally distinct astrocyte clusters (AST1–4; Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 11d,e and Supplementary Table 3). We did not observe any noticeable shifts in the subcluster composition across conditions, suggesting that FC and FR do not alter cluster identity. Fos-positive astrocytes comprised 2.9–4.2% of total astrocytes (Fig. 4b), consistent with earlier data (Extended Data Fig. 4). Of note, FR astrocytes showed the highest Fos levels (Fig. 4b), in line with BAE tagging (Fig. 1). Whereas scRNA-seq provides a snapshot at a single time point (approximately twofold increase in FR versus FC; Fig. 4b), the Fos-TRAP system integrates promoter activity over hours, which is likely to account for the greater fold differences observed with tagging (more than 30-fold in FR versus FC; Fig. 1d,e).

Subsequent analyses revealed that Adra1a (α1-receptor) and Adrb1 (β1-adrenoreceptor) as the two dominant adrenoreceptor genes expressed in amygdalar astrocytes. Notably, both receptors were upregulated in the FC group (1.5 h post-FC) and further elevated in the NoFR group (24 h post-FC without recall), suggesting continued priming of astrocytes over time (Fig. 4c). This data suggests a model in which FC induces a molecular state change in astrocytes, with a latency, increasing adrenoreceptor expression to potentiate NA signalling and enable future repeated fear-evoked Fos induction during FR. The enhancement in astrocytic adrenoreceptor expression is likely to underlie the NA–β-receptor-driven cAMP signals during FR (Fig. 3c,d) and Fos induction in response to recall of strong fear memory a day after conditioning (Fig. 1). To test this model, we explored temporal changes in adrenoreceptor expression, their link to FR-BAE induction, and causal roles in Fos induction.

We examined the time course of Adra1a and Adrb1 expression following FC, using single-cell RNAscope on amygdalar sections collected at 1.5 h, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days and 14 days post-conditioning (Fig. 4d–f). Adrb1 expression was significantly increased from 1.5 h to 3 days post-conditioning (approximately twofold versus NoFC; Fig. 4e), but returned to baseline by 14 days. By contrast, Adra1a expression was increased at 1 day post-conditioning (Fig. 4e), showed partial decay by 2 to 3 days, and peaked again at 14 days. We calculated a co-expression index for each cell (relative Adrb1 expression × relative Adra1a expression; Methods) and found a peak at 1 day post-FC (Fig. 4f), followed by gradual decline. To test whether this molecular profile predicts the degree of astrocyte Fos induction during recall, we performed FR-BAE tagging at multiple time points post-FC (1 day, 2 days, 3 days and 14 days; Fig. 4g,h). Consistent with the adrenoreceptor co-expression time course (Fig. 4f), FR-BAE density peaked at 1 day and declined thereafter (Fig. 4h), suggesting a defined window for FR-BAE induction. Moreover, RNAscope further revealed strong Fos–Adrb1 correlation in FR astrocytes (Fig. 4i–k).

To determine whether these adrenoreceptors are causally required for FR-BAE induction, we performed astrocyte-specific knockdown of Adra1a or Adrb1 in the amygdala (Fig. 4l) using floxed mouse lines48,49,50, AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre-4x6T51 and Flp-based Fos-tagging AAVs (AAV2/5-Fos-FlpoERT2 and AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-fDIO-mNG). Knockdown of either receptor (Fig. 4m,n) significantly reduced FR-BAE density (Fig. 4o,p), indicating that both Gαq-coupled α1-receptors and Gαs-coupled β1-receptors are necessary for FR-BAE induction in vivo. Our earlier finding that the α1-receptor antagonist prazosin did not block NA-induced c-Fos induction in cultured astrocytes (Fig. 2d) probably reflects the downregulation of Adra1a in vitro17, highlighting the importance of in vivo validation. Collectively, our data support a model in which initial fear experience primes astrocytes to upregulate adrenoreceptor expression over time, creating a multiday molecular trace that allows future NA release upon repeated experiences (that is, recall) to selectively recruit the astrocyte ensemble.

Transcriptomics enabled us to probe molecular changes of FR-BAEs linked to functional outputs. We mined differentially expressed genes between Adrb1-positive and Adrb1-negative astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 12a) and identified Igfbp2 as highly upregulated in Adrb1-positive astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 12a,b). Our single-cell RNAscope revealed highly correlated expression of Adrb1 and Igfbp2 (Extended Data Fig. 12c–e), suggesting that astrocytic Adrb1 upregulation could promote Igfbp2 induction. Igfbp2 encodes the secreted protein IGFBP2, which was recently reported to be enriched in ‘peri-neuronal engram' Fos+ astrocytes of the amygdala after fear recall22.

Given that IGFBP2 and its binding partners, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), are crucial for synaptic plasticity52,53 and that chronic deletion of IGFBP2 disrupts synaptic transmission, circuit maturation and memory22,52,54, we hypothesized that IGFBP2 expression in FR-BAELA/B contributes to circuit de-stabilization and re-stabilization upon recall2,3. We tested this hypothesis with a spatiotemporally specific in vivo pharmacological perturbation of IGFBP2 (Extended Data Fig. 12f–h). We bilaterally infused an IGFBP2-neutralizing antibody52 (IGFBP2-Ab; 1 mg ml−1) immediately after FR in CtxA—that is, within the reconsolidation window during which memories become labile to be weakened or strengthened2. Mice received repeated daily infusions and FR sessions for five days (Extended Data Fig. 12f). IGFBP2-Ab treatment reduced freezing compared with controls (Extended Data Fig. 12g,h), indicating impaired memory stabilization; controls infused with IgG showed no change. Combined, our transcriptomics, RNAscope and pharmacological perturbation data indicate that a subset of astrocytes increases adrenoreceptor expression upon fear experiences, enhancing NA responsiveness and recall-driven induction of Fos and Igfbp2 to stabilize fear memory.

To directly examine the causal role of FR-BAE signalling in memory stabilization, we performed a loss-of-function experiment selectively targeting FR-BAEs in LA/B. We used iβARK, a genetically encoded 122-amino acid peptide that binds Gαq–GTP to suppress GPCR signalling26 (Extended Data Fig. 13a). In ex vivo Ca2+ imaging in amygdalar astrocytes, iβARK reduced α1-receptor-evoked Ca2+ responses relative to its mutant control, although some residual oscillatory activity persisted (Extended Data Fig. 13c,f,g), consistent with our prior findings in the striatum26. To improve efficacy, we developed iβARK2 by fusing the original peptide to a membrane-anchoring Lck domain, enabling more effective proximity-based inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 13a,b). iβARK2 showed robust membrane localization across astrocytic compartments, including fine processes (Extended Data Fig. 13d). Astrocytes expressing iβARK2 displayed significantly attenuated Ca2+ responses relative to both iβARK and the control iβARK2mut (Extended Data Fig. 13e–g). We next generated Cre-dependent AAV versions of iβARK2 and iβARK2mut for use in Fos-iCreERT2 TRAP mice to selectively target FR-BAEs (Fig. 5a,b). Remarkably, silencing FR-BAEs with iβARK2 impaired memory stabilization upon repeated recall (Fig. 5c), consistent with the behavioural effects observed upon neutralization of astrocyte-derived IGFBP2 (Extended Data Fig. 12f–h). Moreover, astrocytic IGFBP2 levels were significantly reduced in iβARK2-expressing mice compared with iβARK2mut controls (Fig. 5d), suggesting that suppression of GPCR signalling in FR-BAEs disrupts the recall-dependent transcriptional induction of IGFBP2 and compromises memory stabilization.

To further explore the causal impact of BAE signalling on neuronal engram and memory formation, we performed a gain-of-function experiment targeting astrocytic β1-receptors in LA/B. Astrocytes transduced with AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Adrb1 for Adrb1 overexpression (Adrb1-OE) showed significantly increased Igfbp2 expression compared with controls (Fig. 5f). Adrb1 overexpression also increased the density of FR-BAEs (Fos-mNG+ astrocytes) by around threefold relative to controls (Fig. 5g,h), indicating that astrocyte β1-receptor overexpression amplifies the recall-induced astrocyte ensemble.

We next functionally assessed the behavioural effect of the augmented astrocyte ensembles (Fig. 5i–l and Extended Data Fig. 14). We detected no differences in ambulation in an open arena or time spent in the centre zone during habituation between control and Adrb1-OE mice (Extended Data Fig. 14a,b). We then tested whether Adrb1 overexpression affected memory stabilization. With three-shock conditioning, both groups showed equivalent freezing during initial recall and second recall after reconsolidation (Fig. 5j), potentially owing to a ceiling effect. To create parametric space to detect enhancements in memory, we trained mice to a weak (one-shock) conditioning paradigm (Fig. 5i,k). Adrb1-OE mice did not show altered freezing during FR one day after FC; however, Adrb1-OE mice exhibited significantly increased freezing during the second recall (Fig. 5k), indicating enhanced memory stabilization following the reconsolidation after initial recall. In another cohort with three-shock conditioning, initial recall showed no significant difference in freezing between the groups (Extended Data Fig. 14i,j). However, we observed significantly enhanced freezing in an altered context (CtxB) in mice with Adrb1 overexpression compared with controls (Fig. 5l). These data suggest that overstabilization of the initial fear memory leads to generalization or a loss of memory precision41,55,56,57.

Finally, we explored whether fear generalization is accompanied by activity of engram neurons. We bilaterally injected AAV2/8-hSyn1-DIO-mCherry with and without AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Adrb1, and tagged engram neurons during FR. Mice were euthanized 1.5 h after the CtxB freezing test and the reactivation of FR engram neurons was assessed by c-Fos immunoreactivity (Fig. 5m–o). The overall number of mCherry+ neurons (FR engram neurons) was not significantly different between groups, but the c-Fos levels in FR engram neurons in the Adrb1-OE mice, which showed fear generalization, were significantly higher than those in control mice (Fig. 5o). These findings suggest that the larger astrocyte ensembles contribute to enhance subsequent reactivation of engram neurons, consistent with the view that memory retrievability is not determined during memory formation, but may be regulated after memory retrieval8, and demonstrating that astrocytes are involved in that crucial process.

These data demonstrate that astrocytes can link discrete fear experiences across at least a day-long timescale. As postulated more than a century ago58 and recently implicated in brain computation11,25,59,60, astrocytes may integrate information on slower timescales than neurons. Whereas neurons and astrocytes have been traditionally compared over milliseconds versus seconds-to-minutes, our findings reveal a functionally significant mismatch on the scale of days. Unlike neurons that express the immediate early genes during both FC and FR5,8,28, astrocytes respond to fear conditioning (FC) with rapid Ca2+ and cAMP increases61, but undergo slower transcriptional state changes62. Our single-cell transcriptomics and RNAscope revealed that multiple days post-FC, without recall, astrocytes upregulated Adra1a and Adrb1, marking a learning-dependent state that facilitates heightened responses during repeated experiences (FR). This in turn drives expression of Fos and Igfbp2, supporting memory stabilization. The astrocyte ensembles identified in this study may partially meet the criteria for engram cells8 that undergo enduring biochemical changes upon experiences. However, our findings suggest that the astrocytic ensemble may not serve as a direct memory trace encoding experience-specific information like neurons because its perturbation did not alter initial fear recall. Instead, it may function as an eligibility trace for memory stabilization over days, creating a permissive microenvironment within circuits that supports the stabilization of memories related to repeated experiences. From a computational and bioenergetic perspective, astrocytes may underlie retrospective linking63,64, which benefits from spaced intervals over days between learning sessions65 by providing a slow modulatory trace that complements fast neuronal activity64, thereby offloading the energetically costly task of maintaining firing patterns in neurons across days and enabling more stable circuit transformations60.

Mounting evidence from animal3,4,57 and human imaging6 studies has highlighted the amygdala and NA in modulating long-term memory. Early pharmacological studies targeting protein synthesis66, β-receptors67, PKA35 or cAMP–CREB34 in the amygdala disrupted memory re-stabilization, which our findings indicate could partially be mediated by astrocytes. We show that astrocytes undergo learning-dependent increases in adrenoreceptor expressions, and manipulating these receptors alters memory stability, precision and neuronal engram representations. Notably, both NA input and reactivated neuronal engram activity are required to recruit astrocytic ensembles that stabilize labile memories. These findings imply that astrocyte ensembles may not simply be passive bulk substrates of NA signals, but instead exert behaviourally relevant, circuit-specific regulations through astrocyte-defined microcircuitry15,68. Disrupting the precise NA–astrocyte signalling through β1R overexpression led to fear generalization, suggesting physiological astrocytic roles in selective memory stability that constrain maladaptive updating. In this regard, targeting these astrocyte–neuron interaction mechanisms could be beneficial in treating cognitive and neuropsychiatric dysfunctions, including post-traumatic stress disorder, in which hyperactivity of the NA system is a prominent feature4,69.

Deciphering how diverse astrocyte responses link to multiple circuit outputs has long been a challenge15. Considerable effort has been devoted to probe24 or perturb11 astrocyte Ca2+ signals since they were first reported70, yet causal relationships are usually inferred from separate subjects, leaving input–output links unclear. Astrocyte perturbation in a bulk manner is also incongruent with the heterogeneity of astrocyte identity49,71, state62,72 and response59,73. Our approaches bridge this gap: by exploiting context-specific astrocyte state changes18,20,22, the brain-wide BAE tagging method enables broad exploration of ensembles causal for neural processing and behaviour. This framework facilitates research into astrocytic ensembles across diverse behaviours and disease conditions. Expanding such efforts will accelerate discoveries in computation and pathology that require understanding of multicellular interactions as a core attribute of brain biology.

Young adult (8- to 12-week-old) wild-type C57BL/6NCrSlc mice obtained from the Japan SLC, Fos2A-iCreERT2 (TRAP228, JAX 030323) mice obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, Adra1a flox mice49,74 obtained from RIKEN (RBRC11837) and Adrb1 flox mice50 (accession number CDB1068K, generated by RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research) were used for in vivo experiments. TRAP2 mice were bred and maintained in our animal facility, backcrossed with C57BL/6NCrSlc at least eight times before use for experiments. Wild-type C57BL/6NCrSlc female mice were obtained from the Japan SLC to obtain postnatal day 0–1 (P0–P1) pups. Experiments were done using both male and female mice. Number of mice used in each experiment is listed in the main text and/or figure legends accordingly. Mice were housed in groups of 2–5 in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room (23 ± 3 °C, 45 ± 5% humidity) under a 12-h light:dark cycle (lights on from 07:00 to 19:00) and given ad libitum access to water and laboratory mouse diet at all times. After fibre implantation, the mice were single housed under a 12-h light:dark cycle (lights on from 07:00 to 19:00) and given ad libitum access to water and laboratory mouse diet at all times. After fibre implantation, the mice were singly housed. All experiments were approved by the RIKEN Animal Care and Use Committee.

AAVpro 293T cells (Clontech, 632273) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco, 11995073) with fetal bovine serum (FBS; Cosmo Bio, CCP-FBS-BR-500) and 0.1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, 15240062). Cells were grown in a humidified cell culture incubation with 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

All plasmid constructs were generated using standard molecular biology techniques and the In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Clontech). The pZac2.1 GfaABC1D-Rpl22-HA plasmids (Addgene plasmid #111811) were digested with XhoI and NotI, which removed the Rpl22-HA sequence. Multiple cloning sequences (MCS) comprised of restriction enzyme sites that were absent from the backbone pZac2.1 plasmid were generated via gene synthesis (Eurofins Genomics) and incorporated to produce pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-MCS plasmids. The PCR-amplified DIO-GFP sequence from Addgene plasmid #28304 was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCAG-tdTomato (Addgene #83029) between EcoRI sites to generate pCAG-DIO-EGFP-tdTomato. The PCR-amplified DIO-EGFP-tdTomato was inserted into the XbaI and NotI sites of the pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-MCS plasmid to generate pZac2.1-GfaBC1D-DIO-EGFP-tdTomato plasmids. The PCR-amplified WPRE sequence from pFBAAV-CAG-XCaMP-R-WPRE (a gift from H. Bito12) was inserted into the NotI site of the resulting plasmid to generate pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-DIO-EGFP-tdTomato-WPRE plasmids. The plasmids were digested with NotI and AgeI, which removed the tdTomato sequence, and a PCR-amplified mScarlet-I sequence (Addgene #98816) was incorporated, and the resulting plasmids were digested with XhoI and KpnI, which removed the EGFP sequence, and the mNG sequence from Addgene #99135 was ligated using DNA ligation kit (Takara) to generate pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-mScarlet-I-WPRE plasmids. The mScarlet-I sequence was removed with restriction enzymatic digestion with PspOMI and NotI to generate pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-WPRE plasmids. The PCR-amplified hM4Di-mCherry sequence from Addgene #92286 was cloned into the PmeI site of pAAV-RAM-d2TTA::TRE-MCS-WPRE (Addgene #63931) to generate pAAV-RAM-d2TTA::TRE-hM4Di-mCherry-WPRE plasmids. pAAV-GfaABC1D-Flag-mAdrb1-WPRE, pAAV-GfaABC1D-mGrm3-mCherry-WPRE, pAAV-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A), pAAV-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK, pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A), pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK pAAV-Fos-FlpoERT2 and pAAV-GfaABC1D-FRT-mNG plasmids were designed by the authors and constructed by VectorBuilder. The PCR-amplified DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A) and DIO-Lck-mcherry-iβARK sequence from pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A) and pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK was clone into the EcoRI site of pAAV-GfaABC1D-MCS-4x6T-WPRE (Addgene #196417) to generate pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A)-4x6T and pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK-4x6T. pAAV-GfaABC1D-mGrm3-mCherry-WPRE was digested with EcoNI and AccI to remove mGrm3-mCherry, and PCR-amplified mGrm3 was cloned back to the backbone to generate AAV-GfaABC1D-mGrm3-WPRE plasmids. The PCR-amplified XCaMP-Gf-WPRE from the pFBAAV-CAG-XCaMP-Gf-WPRE plasmid (a gift from H. Bito75) was cloned into the NcoI and HindIII site of pAAV-hSyn1-cyto-mRuby3-iATPSnFR1.0 (Addgene #102557) to generate pAAV-hSyn1-XCaMP-Gf-WPRE plasmids. The mCherry-CAAX sequence digested with EcoRI of the pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-mCherry-CAAX plasmid (a gift from T. Takano76) was ligated into the EcoRI and EcoRV the resultant plasmids to generate pAAV-hSyn1-mCherry-CAAX-WPRE plasmids. All constructs were sequenced before use. All our constructs have been deposited to Addgene in the Nagai Lab repository for unrestricted distribution (http://www.addgene.org/Jun_Nagai, Supplementary Table 4).

Recombinant AAVs were generated by triple transfection of AAVpro 293T cells (Clontech, 632273) using polyethylenimine (PEI; Polysciences inc., 24765-100). Cells were cultured up to 50–70% confluency in DMEM (Gibco, 11995073) with FBS (Cosmo Bio, CCP-FBS-BR-500) and 0.1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, 15240062). The plasmids and PEI were mixed with Opti-MEM (31985-088) and kept for 5 min at room temperature. The mixture was combined with a DNA mix which contained pAAV Capsids, pHelper (Agilent Technologies, 240071-54) and pAAV transgenes. All these plasmids had a concentration of 4.2 μg per dish. The DNA mix was then applied with PEI/Opti-MEM, and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Then, this solution was added to the cells and incubated for 24 h. After incubation, the medium was changed to DMEM with 2% FBS and 0.1% antibiotic-antimycotic. Viral particles were collected from the medium at 120 h post-transfection. Cell pellets were centrifuged (3,500 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was filtered by Setricup (Merc, S2HVU02RE) and pellets were resuspended in FBS-free DMEM and freeze-thawed three times. In the case of PHP.eB capsid virus production, the supernatant was resuspended in DMEM and fractured by harshly pipetting. Thawed pellets were centrifuged (3,500 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) again and the supernatant was filtered by Setricup (Merc, S2HVU02RE). Media containing viral particles were centrifuged (22,000 rpm, 2 h, 4 °C) by Optima XE-100 (Beckman Coulter, A94516). The pellets were collected with 10–50 μl PBS and clarified by centrifugation (4,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant-containing viral particles were stored at 4 °C. AAV titre was analysed by quantitative PCR (QuantStudio 12 K; Applied Biosystems) using primers designed to selectively bind AAV2 inverted terminal repeats (forward: 5′-AACATGCTACGCAGAGAGGGAGTGG-3′, reverse: 5′-CATGAGACAAGGAACCCCTAGTGATGGAG-3′).

All surgical procedures were conducted under general anaesthesia using continuous isoflurane (induction at 5%, maintenance at 1.5% to 2% vol/vol). Depth of anaesthesia was monitored continuously and adjusted when necessary. Intravenous administration of AAV-PHP.eB (50 µl to deliver 2.5 × 1012 genome copies (GCs) per mouse) was performed by injection into the retro-orbital sinus of TRAP2 mice. Two weeks after AAV-PHP.eB GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-WPRE or AAV-PHP.eBGfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-mScaret-I-WPRE injections, mice were administered 4-OHT for inducing Cre recombination under the Fos promoter (Fos tagging) and then returned to their home cage until they were euthanized 7 days after tagging. In some cases, Fos tagging was performed using the FLP–FRT system (fDIO), and mice were euthanized one day after tagging. For stereotaxic microinjection of AAVs, mice were fitted into a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments) with their heads secured by blunt ear bars and their noses placed into a veterinary grade anaesthesia and ventilation system (VetEquip 911103). The surgical incision site was then cleaned with 70% ethanol (vol/vol). Craniotomies (1–2 mm in diameter) were made powered by a high-speed drill at specific coordinates based on the bregma position. Bilateral viral injections were conducted using a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments) to guide the placement of beveled glass pipettes (World Precision Instruments, 1B100-4) into the regions of interest: the basolateral amygdala (anterior–posterior (AP): −1.48 mm, medial–lateral (ML): 3.3 mm, dorsal–ventral (DV): 5.00 mm to bregma) and LC (AP: −5.4 mm, ML: 0.85 mm, DV: 3.7 mm to bregma). Total of 0.3 μl of AAV was delivered at 0.1 μl min−1 using a syringe pump (SmartTouch Pump, World Precision Instruments). The glass pipette was withdrawn 5–10 min after the infusion to prevent the backflow. Mice were then sutured, returned to their home cage, and allowed to rest for at least two to three weeks before any assessments were conducted. AAV titres (GCs per ml) were adjusted with sterile saline to deliver the indicated genome copies into the regions of interest: AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-WPRE (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-hM3Dq-mCherry (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/DJ8-RAM-d2TTA::TRE-hM4Di-WPRE (3.0 × 1013), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Flag-mAdrb1-WPRE (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/9-rTH-Cre (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/8-hSyn1-DIO-hM3Dq (1.0 × 1013), AAV2/8-hSyn1-DIO-hM4Di (1.0 × 1013), AAV2/8-hSyn1-DIO-mCherry (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/DJ8-Ef1a-hM3Dq (4.8 × 1011), AAV2/DJ8-Ef1a-hM4Di (4.0 × 1012), AAV2/5-hSyn1-mCherry-CAXX (3.0 × 1012) AAV2/9-hSyn1-GRABNE2h-WPRE (2.7 × 1012), AAV2/1 GfaABC1D-cAMPinG1-NE (1.3 × 1013), and AAV2/1 GfaABC1D-RCaMP3 (1.5 × 1013), GfaABC1D-GCaMP6f (1.1 × 1013), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-iβARK-mCherry (1.3 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-iβARK(D110A)-mCherry (1.3 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK (1.3 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A) (1.1 × 1013), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK-4x6T (3.0 × 1013), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A) (3.0 × 1013), AAV2/5-Fos-FlpoERT2 (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-fDIO-mNG (1.0 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre-4x6T (1.2 × 1013).

4-OHT (Sigma, H6278) was dissolved at 25 mg ml−1 in 100% ethanol with agitation at 37 °C for 15 min and was then aliquoted and stored at −20 °C for up to several weeks until use. Before use, 4-OHT was redissolved in ethanol by shaking at 37 °C for 15 min and corn oil (Sigma, 259853 and S5007) was added to give a final concentration of 3 mg ml−1 4-OHT. The ethanol was evaporated by incubation at 50 °C. The final 3 mg ml−1 4-OHT solutions were always used on the day they were prepared. All 4-OHT injections were delivered intraperitoneally at 50 mg kg−1 2–4 weeks after AAV injection into TRAP2 mice for inducing Cre recombination under the Fos promoter.

CNO (Tocris, 4936) was administered intraperitoneally 0.5 h before the initiation of behavioural assessments. CNO was administered intraperitoneally 20 min before 4-OHT intraperitoneal injection. Propranolol (MedChemExpress, HY-B0573) was dissolved in dH2O at 100 mM and stored at −20 °C. The final solutions were always used on the day they were prepared.

Mice were placed on doxycycline (40 mg kg−1, Bio-Serv, F4159) chow 24 h prior to and for at least 1 week after viral injection, switched to doxycycline-free chow 48 h before recall, and euthanized 24 h later. IGFBP2 antibody was infused bilaterally through implanted guide cannulas targeting basolateral amygdala. Infusions were performed using an internal cannula connected to a 10-µl Hamiltion syringe. One microgram of IGFBP2 antibody (1 mg ml−1, 1 µl per site) was infused into mice immediately after a fear recall paradigm at 400 nl min−1 using a syringe pump (SmartTouch Pump, World Precision Instruments).

Mice were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for fixation. The dissected brains were post-fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% PFA in PBS, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS. The brains were embedded with OCT compound (Sakura Finetek Japan, 4583) and sliced into coronal sections with a thickness of 50 μm at −20 °C using cryostat (CryoStar NX70, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 956960). The sections were washed with PBS 3 times for 5 min each and stored in 50% glycerol (Fujifilm, 075-00616) in PBS at −20 °C. For staining with c-Fos antibody, the sections were permeabilized with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 (Nacalai tesque, 35501), incubated at room temperature for 3 h, and then incubated with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1% normal donkey serum (NDS, Sigma-Aldrich, D9663) at room temperature for 1 h for blocking, and then incubated at 4 °C overnight in blocking buffer. With the following primary antibodies, Triton X-100 was used at 0.1% for permeabilization and PBS containing 1% NDS was used for blocking and antibody reactions: rat anti-GFAP (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 13-0300), mouse anti-S100β (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich, S2532), goat-Sox9 (1:100, R&D systems, AF3075) mouse anti-RFP (1:500, MBL, M155-3), rabbit anti-RFP (1:500, Rockland, 600-401-379), mouse anti-NET (1:2,000, MAb technologies, NET05-2) and rabbit anti-c-Fos (1:5,000, Synaptic Systems, 226003). After washing with PBS 3 times for 10 min each, the sections were incubated at room temperature for 2 h in blocking buffer with the following secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rat, Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-chicken, Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-goat, Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-chicken (1:1,000, Abcam, ThermoFisher and Jackson ImmunoResearch). The sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight in blocking buffer with secondary antibodies when staining with anti-c-Fos antibody. After washing with PBS 3 times for 10 min each, the sections were mounted on slides (Fluoromount-G, Southern bio, 0100-35) and visualized under a confocal laser microscope (Olympus, FV3000) and a fluorescent microscope (Olympus, VS200). Immunoreactivities were analysed using ImageJ software (NIH). The numbers of c-Fos+ neurons (Fig. 5o and Extended Data Fig. 8b) and astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 4b) were quantified based on a consistent c-Fos intensity threshold for each experiment. This threshold was defined such that the number of c-Fos+ neurons or astrocytes corresponded to the values previously reported18,42,77. Number of cells, field of views, sections and mice used in each analysis is listed in the main text and/or figure legends accordingly.

Mice were singly housed in a light-proof chamber for 48 h. On the day of tagging, mice were exposed to 1 h of light inside the chamber and injected intraperitoneally with 50 mg kg−1 4-OHT either 24 h, 12 h, 6 h or 3 h before or 0 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h or 24 h after the termination of light exposure. Mice were returned to the dark chamber for an additional two days and then returned to a regular light-dark cycle until the time of euthanasia seven days after tagging.

Behavioural tests were performed during the light cycle between 07:00 and 19:00. Temperature and humidity of the experimental rooms were maintained at 23 ± 2 °C and 55 ± 5%, respectively. Background noise (55 dB) was generated by a white noise generator (Ohara). All the experimental mice were transferred to the behaviour testing room at least 1 h before the tests to acclimatize to the environment and to reduce stress. Mice were habituated by freely exploring the conditioning chamber (CtxA) that consisted of a square partition (30 × 30 × 15 cm; 100 lux and no odour) with a grid floor wired to a shock generator (Ohara) for 15 min per day for 3 days. On the fourth day, they were either fear conditioned (1 time or 3 times shock; 2 s, 0.3 mA) (FC group) or presented with no shocks (NoFC group) in the conditioning chamber. One day after the conditioning, mice were either returned to CtxA for 3 min for fear memory recall (FR group) or kept in their home cages (NoFR group). Freezing durations exceeding 70% in the conditioned chamber 1 day post-conditioning with 3 foot shocks or exceeding 50% 1 day post-conditioning with a single foot shock, are considered indicative of sufficient conditioning. All the experimental mice received intraperitoneal injections of 4-OHT (50 mg kg−1) immediately after the task for Fos tagging. Freezing was automatically measured throughout the testing trial by the TimeFZ4 software (version 2021_7_29, Ohara) and subsequently processed by a blinded investigator. The chambers were cleaned with 70% ethanol between tests. In some cases, 10 mg kg−1 Propranolol (MedChemExpress, HY-B0573) was administered by intraperitoneal injection to mice 0.5 h before, and 2.5 h and 5.5 h after 4-OHT-based Fos tagging in order to block β-adrenergic signalling throughout the tagging timeframe. In some experiments using DREADDs, mice were injected with CNO (1 mg kg−1) 10 min before the task in CtxA. For experiments in Fig. 2n in which CNO was used for silencing neuronal activity or propranolol was used for antagonizing β-adrenoreceptor signalling to test their roles in astrocyte Fos induction during fear memory recall, both were administered with consideration of their pharmacokinetics. Propranolol was given both before and after the behavioural session to ensure effective β-receptor blockade throughout the several-hour Fos-tagging window (Extended Data Fig. 3), given its short half-life78 (~1.5–2 h), whereas CNO was given once before the session owing to its prolonged effect79 (>6 h). Freezing was measured for 3 min in the CtxB chamber, which consisted of a rhombic partition (30 cm × 60 cm × 15 cm, 10 lux and 1% acetic acid odour) with a flat floor (Ohara).

Mice were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with PBS, followed by 4% PFA in PBS for fixation of brain tissues. The dissected brains were post-fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% PFA in PBS and stored in PBS at 4 °C until embedding. To oxidize agarose, 2.25 g agarose (A6013, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 100 ml of 10 mM sodium periodate (S1878, Sigma-Aldrich)/50 mM phosphate buffer and stirred gently for 2.5 h at room temperature in the dark. The oxidized agarose was filtered on a bottle-top vacuum filter (0.2 μm, 569-0020, Thermo Scientific) washed 3 times with phosphate buffer and resuspended in 50 ml of phosphate buffer to make 4.5% oxidized agarose solution. The oxidized agarose solution was boiled with a microwave oven to melt the agarose and kept at 60–65 °C. The brains were pat-dried and embedded in oxidized agarose solution with a plastic mould (18646A, Polysciences). For covalent crosslinking between oxidized agarose and the surface of the brain, borate/borohydride solution was prepared the day before use by adding 0.2 g sodium borohydride (452882, Sigma-Aldrich) in 100 ml of prewarmed (40 °C) borate buffer (50 mM borax, 221732, Sigma-Aldrich; 50 mM boric acid, B6768, Sigma-Aldrich; pH 9.0–9.5) in the chemical fume hood. The agarose block was removed from the mould, soaked in borate/borohydride solution to initiate crosslinking and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The block was washed and kept in phosphate buffer at 4 °C until imaging.

The agarose block was mounted on a glass slide using Loctite 401 glue immediately before imaging. STPT was performed with the TissueCyte 1400FC system (TissueVision) equipped with Coherent Chameleon Ultra II laser (Coherent) or Spectra-Physics Insight X3+ laser (MKS Spectra-Physics) and a Nikon 16× water-immersion objective (MRP07220, NA: 0.8). The laser wavelength was tuned at 1,000 nm. Brains were coronally sectioned with a built-in vibrating microtome at 50-μm thickness with a frequency of 60 Hz and a speed of 0.5 mm s−1. Four optical z-planes were taken at 50 μm, 62.5 μm, 75 μm and 87.5 μm below the cut surface of the tissue block. To scan an entire coronal plane, individual tile images were acquired (832 × 832 pixels per frame, resolution at 1.382 μm per pixel) by moving the stage between each tile. Following the full scanning of a coronal plane, a 50-μm section was cut away by vibrating microtome and imaging of a new cut surface repeated to acquire optical sections covering the entire brain from the caudal to the rostral side (~320 coronal sections). The raw image tiles were first trimmed and subjected to flat field correction, then stitched into 2D mosaic coronal section images using the Autostitcher software (TissueVision). The signals from the green channel (500–550 nm, mNG signal) and from the far-red channel (>600 nm, background) were simultaneously acquired, and the latter was used to subtract background from the green channel to enhance the signal to noise ratio. Each region of the whole brain was aligned and segmented according to the Mouse Brain Atlas (NeuroInfo, MBL Bioscience, BN-200). Owing to the high quality preservation of tissue architecture during imaging, we semi-automatically performed alignment to a standard mouse brain atlas, segmentation of 839 brain regions, and detection of single Fos-tagged mNG astrocytes (BAEs), defined by their territories that typically displayed diameters of approximately 40 to 60 μm with ~10-µm-wide cell bodies68 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). Consistent with our intersectional genetic approach, we rarely observed neuron-like mNG-positive cells, with larger cell bodies (>~20-μm diameter) and elongated processes (>~50-μm). We only found these cells in regions nearby ventricles and the midline where well-characterized GFAP-positive neural progenitor cells reside48,80, and they were excluded in subsequent analyses. As a result, using this brain-wide analysis approach we successfully quantified the density of BAEs in 677 brain regions that accounted for 80.7% of the whole brain.

To observe correlation between Fos+ astrocytes and neurons, we used the same TRAP2 (Fos-iCreERT2) system28 used by Roy et al.5, but instead with a Cre-dependent mNG reporter expressed in Fos+ astrocytes, allowing comparison of Fos+ cell counts from anatomically matched regions between studies. The regions of interest were first narrowed to the 117 engram-signifiant regions defined by Roy et al. Then, to ensure analysis of bona fide astrocyte-tagged regions, areas with possible neuronal leakage (mNG+ neuron-like cells), particularly near ventricles were excluded (see above). In addition, high-level hierarchical structure areas (such as midbrain or thalamus) with extremely high total counts that skew correlation analysis were also excluded. In the end, this selection yielded 75 regions for subsequent correlational analyses. Changes in Fos+ astrocyte numbers (FC–NoFC and FR–NoFC) were calculated using the non-foot shocked control group as the baseline, consistent with Roy et al. Supplementary table 1 from Roy et al. provided region-by-region counts of Fos+ neurons in non-foot shocked controls, FC and FR groups, enabling us to extract the corresponding changes in Fos+ neuron numbers for each of the 75 regions. Pearson correlation analyses between these neuronal and astrocytic Fos+ cell count changes were performed.

For image visualization in 3D, low-resolution image stacks were created across all four channels. These stacks were downsampled to 25 μm per pixel resolution in the x and y axes, while the inter-slice distance was maintained at 50 μm, resulting in a voxel resolution of 25 × 25 × 50 μm3. To minimize high-frequency artifacts, median filtering and Gaussian smoothing were applied to the coronal images prior to downscaling. The processed 3D image stacks were stored in the NIfTI format, and the world coordinates were adjusted to align roughly with the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework v.3 (CCFv3)81. For registration to the CCFv3, the Allen STP-1675 template (filename: P56_Atlas.nii.gz; available at https://scalablebrainatlas.incf.org/mouse/ABA_v3#downloads) was used as the reference image. This template, generated from STPT averaged over 1,675 specimens, was combined with corresponding atlas annotations (filename: P56_Annotation.nii.gz). Image alignment was performed using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs)82. An affine registration was first applied at 3 scales (downscaling factors of 4, 2 and 1) with Gaussian smoothing of 2, 1 and 1 voxels and 250, 200 and 50 iterations, respectively. This was followed by deformable (SyN) registration at four scales (downscaling factors of 8, 4, 2 and 1) with Gaussian smoothing of 4, 2, 1 and 1 voxels and 1,000, 500, 100 and 50 iterations, respectively, using mutual information as the metric. After computing the transformation, individual image stacks and atlas labels were mapped to and from the CCFv3 image space. After aligning with the NIfTI world coordinates, cell positions were mapped to the Allen template using the antsApplyTransformsToPoints function from ANTs. Brain regions from the Allen atlas annotations were then assigned to individual cells based on their locations in the CCFv3 image space.

Astrocyte primary cultures were obtained as previously described with some modifications83. In brief, cerebral cortical tissues were isolated from P0–P1 neonatal mice and dissociated with a scalpel, gently agitated in 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, 25300-054), and rapidly strained with a Falcon 100 µm cell strainer (352360). Dissociated cells were seeded at a rate of four brains per bottle on poly-d-lysine-coated bottles. The cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, 11995073) supplemented with FBS (Cosmo Bio, CCP-FBS-BR-500) and penicillin-streptomycin. When the cells reached confluence after several weeks, the culture bottles were gently shaken at 120 rpm overnight at 37 °C to remove non-astrocytic cells. Astrocytes were then detached using Trypsin-EDTA, replated onto poly-d-lysine-coated bottles, and after 1–2 weeks, cultures were shaken again at 120 rpm for 4 h. Astrocytes were then re-seeded on coverslips in 12-well plates at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells per well, which were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, with the medium being changed every 2 to 3 days.

Five days after re-seeding, primary astrocytes were incubated with tetrodotoxin (TTX at 1 µM, Fujifilm, 207-15901) to eliminate the potential effect of neuronal firing, for at least 5 min to allow adequate equilibration, together with the following inhibitors, blockers or chelators indicated for each experiment unless otherwise described: prazosin hydrochloride (MedChemExpress, HY-B0193A), atipamezole hydrochloride (Tokyo Chemical Industry, A2956), propranolol hydrochloride (MedChemExpress, HY-B0573), BAPTA-AM (SIGMA, A1076), and SQ 22536 (Tokyo chemical industry, Q0105). The cultures were then incubated with the following growth factors, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators or neuropeptides in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 1.5 h: l-glutamic acid monosodium salt hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, G5889), GABA (Sigma-Aldrich, A2129), ATP disodium salt hydrate from yeast (Nacalai tesque, 01072-24), l-noradrenaline hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, 74480), dopamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, H8502), acetylcholine chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, A6625), serotonin hydrochloride (Alfa Aesar, B21263.03), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, Fujifilm, 028-16451), neurotrophin-3 (Fujifilm, 146-09231, 50 ng ml−1), neurotrophin-4 (Fujifilm, 142-06634, 100 ng ml−1), forskolin (Fujifilm, 067-02191, 10 μM), nerve growth factor-β (NGFβ, Fujifilm, 141-07601, 100 ng ml−1), epidermal growth factor (EGF, Fujifilm, 059-07873, 100 ng ml−1), PDGF-AA (Fujifilm, 163–19731, 100 ng ml−1), PDGF-BB (Fujifilm, 164–24031, 100 ng ml−1), Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF, Fujifilm, 032-23501, 100 ng ml−1), IGF1 (Fujifilm, 099-04511, 100 ng ml−1). The following agonist and ionophore were used: isoproterenol (MedChemExpress, HY-B0468) and ionomycin (LKT laboratories, I5752). Ninety minutes after incubation, primary astrocytes were fixed in 4% PFA (Nacalai Tesque) for 10 min, washed with PBS 3 times, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Nacalai Tesque) for 10 min and blocked with 1% NDS (Sigma-Aldrich, D9663) for 30 min. Primary astrocytes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-c-Fos (1:1,000, Synaptic Systems, 226003), rat anti-GFAP (1:1,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 13-0300), rabbit anti-IBA1 (1:1,000, Fujifilm, 019-19741), chicken anti-TUJ1 (1:1,000 Novus Biologicals, NB100-1612), mouse anti-OLIG2 (1:100, Millipore, MABN50). The cultures were washed 3 times in PBS for 10 min each, then incubated with DAPI (1:10,000, Sigma-Aldrich, D9542) and the following secondary antibodies (1:1,000) in PBS containing 1% NDS for 1 h at room temperature: Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rat (abcam, ab150153), Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-mouse (abcam, ab175700), Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit (Abcam, ab175692), Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit (abcam, ab150067), Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-chicken (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 703-605-155). Fluorescent images were taken using a 20× objective lens (UPlanXApo 20×, Olympus) with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus, FV3000 with Fluoview). Immunoreactivity quantification of c-Fos was performed using ImageJ. The c-Fos brightness of GFAP-positive astrocytes were measured by the intensity of ROIs that encompassed the cell nuclei. In some experiments involving a heterologous expression of mGluR3, we applied AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Grm3 (800,000 multiplicity of infection) 5 h after re-seeding for expressing mGluR3 in primary astrocytes and incubated for 5 days before pharmacological experiments. Ninety minutes after stimulation with 0.1 µM NA and/or 100 µM glutamate in the presence of 1 µM TTX, primary astrocytes were fixed and stained as described above using primary antibodies: rabbit anti-mGluR3 (1:500, abcam, ab166608) and mouse anti-c-Fos (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc166940). It is noteworthy that the mouse anti-c-Fos antibody, different from the rabbit anti-c-Fos antibody used in other experiments, exhibited overall low immunoreactivity. However, this did not affect the quantification of c-Fos mobilization. Fluorescent imaging and quantification of c-Fos intensity were performed as described above.

AAVs for expressing the noradrenaline biosensor GRABNE2h on the neuronal cell surface, or calcium indicator RCaMP3 in astrocytes with cAMP sensor cAMPinG1 in astrocytes were unilaterally injected into the basolateral amygdala. Optical fibres were implanted above the injection site two weeks post-injection to capture emission of fluorescence signals, with recordings conducted one week after fibre implantation. For fluorescence signal collection, mice were tethered to a patch cable, and a 465 nm LED light (Doric, 40–50 µW at the tip of patch cable) or a 560 nm LED light (Doric, 40–50 µW at the tip of patch cable) was used to excite the signal, with an isosbestic 405 nm LED light used to correct for movement artifacts. Mice tethered to the patch cable were habituated in a testing chamber for 5 min on the day of recording. A time-division multiplexing scheme was used, where the 465 nm, 560 nm and 405 nm LED lights were emitted alternately at 20 Hz (turned on for 24 ms and off for 26 ms), with the timing precisely controlled by a programmable pulse generator (Master-9, AMPI). Each excitation light was reflected by a dichroic mirror and coupled into an optical fibre cable (Doric, 200 μm in diameter, 2 m in length, NA 0.57) through a pinhole (200 μm in diameter). The fluorescence signals were detected by a photomultiplier tube with a GaAsP photocathode (H16722-40; Hamamatsu Photonics) and digitized by a data acquisition module (USB-6341, National Instruments). A custom-written LabVIEW program extracted signals at a sampling frequency of 1 kHz in real time. Fluorescence signals collected during each light pulse were averaged, after dropping the first and last 2 samples (1 ms each) to eliminate potential noise caused during the alternation of LED lights. The data were smoothed using moving average and corrected for bleaching correction by fitting to least-squares linear. The fluorescence response was calculated (fitted 465 + 1)/(fitted 405 + 1) − baseline. The baselines of GRABNE2h and astrocyte cAMPinG1 signals were identified during periods of no spontaneous signals in home cages for 1–2 min before the context exposure. Signal analyses were performed in Python (v.3.0.0) using JupyterLab (v.3.6.7, Project Jupyter). Numerical computations and data handling were conducted using NumPy84 (v.1.26.4) and Pandas (v.2.1.4, NumFOCUS). The area under the curve of fluorescence traces was calculated with scikit-learn (sklearn, v.1.2.2, RRID:SCR_002577), and half-decay times of signal responses were extracted. Astrocytic RCaMP3 signals were bandpass filtered between 0.0003 and 1 Hz with SciPy85 (v.1.11.4). Peaks of Ca2+ signals were defined as data points exceeding 4× s.d. above the baseline mean, with baseline noise estimated from ≥20 s intervals lacking spontaneous activity in home cage recordings before context exposure. Signal traces were visualized with Matplotlib86 (v.3.8.0).

Coronal amygdalar slices were prepared from adult mice with AAV injection26,87. In brief, animals were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated with sharp shears. The brains were placed and sliced in ice-cold modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing the following (in mM): 194 sucrose, 30 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4 and 10 d-glucose, saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. A vibratome (DSK NLS-MT) was used to cut 300-µm brain sections. The slices were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at 32–34 °C in normal ACSF containing (in mM); 124 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4 and 10 d-glucose continuously bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Slices were then stored at 21–23 °C in the same buffer until use. All slices were used within 2–6 h of slicing. Cells for all the experiments were imaged with a 16× water-immersion objective lens (Nikon, N16XLWD-PF, MRP07220, NA: 0.8) with Nikon two-photon laser-scanning microscope (A1R MP) equipped with a 920 nm wavelength laser (Alcor, Spark Lasers). To image GCaMP6f signals, astrocytes located in the LA/B and typically ∼20 to ∼30 µm below the slice surface were selected for imaging. Images were acquired at 1 frame per second. Slices were maintained in ACSF (124 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM d-glucose and 2.0 mM CaCl2) through a perfusion system. Phenylephrine (PE, Tocris Bioscience 2838) was applied in the bath in the presence of 300 nM tetrodotoxin (Cayman Chemical 14964) were applied in the bath at least 5 min prior to recording to allow adequate equilibration. A constant flow of fresh buffer perfused the imaging chamber at all times. Spontaneous Ca2+ activity was recorded for 3 min (0 µM PE), followed by a 2-minute bath application of 1 µM PE, a 5-min washout, a 2-min application of 3 µM PE, and a 5-min washout. Ca2+ signals were processed in ImageJ (NIH) and presented as the relative change in fluorescence (ΔF/F).

Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane 90 min after the initiation of behavioural paradigms and transcardially perfused with PBS (30 ml for 2 min). The amygdala was freshly dissected out using a Brain Matrix (Ted Pella, 15067) and was placed into cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (14025092, Gibco) containing 10 mM HEPES (17514-15, Naclai Tesque), 0.54% glucose (16806-25, Naclai Tesque), 5.0 µg ml−1 actinomycin D (A1410, Sigma-Aldrich), 10 µM triptolide (T3652, Sigma-Aldrich) and 27.1 µg ml−1 anisomycin (A9789, Sigma-Aldrich), as previously described88,89. Then, the tissue block was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 3 ml enzyme solution (HBSS, 10 mM HEPES, 0.54% glucose, 0.5 mM EDTA (15575020, Invitrogen), 1.0 mM l-cysteine (10309-41, Naclai Tesque), 5.0 µg ml−1 actinomycin D, 10 µM triptolide and 27.1 µg ml−1 anisomycin) containing 20 U papain per mouse (LS003127, Worthington Biochemical). The tissue was then homogenized by passing through a 18 G needle and was further incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Following homogenization using a 20 G needle, the resulting cell suspension was centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. The homogenate was separated by gradient centrifugation with 30% Percoll (P1644, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS at 500g for 25 min at 4 °C (no brake). The pellet containing astrocytes at the bottom of the tube was then collected and washed once with PBS containing 2% FBS and 10 mM EDTA before staining. Fc receptors were blocked with Fc block (2.4G2, BD Bioscience) for 10 min at 4 °C before incubation with primary antibodies. Cells were stained with antibodies directed against CD11b-BV786 (1:200, M1/70, BD Bioscience), CD45-APC-Cy7 (1:200, 30-F11, BioLegend), O1-eFluor660 (1:200, 50-6506-82, eBioscience) and ASCA2-PE-Cy7 (1:200, 130-116-246, Miltenyi Biotec) for 40 min at 4 °C. Additionally, cells were treated with hashtag antibodies to label source samples (TotalSeqB0301-B0310, B0312 and B0314, BioLegend). After washing, cells were sorted using a CytoFLEX SRT (Beckman Coulter). Data were acquired with CytExpert software (Beckman Coulter). Post-acquisition analysis was performed using FlowJo software, version 10.9.0. Single-cell libraries were generated and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer. Sequence reads were processed and aligned to the mouse genome (mm10, GENCODE vM23/Ensembl98; https://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A.tar.gz) using CellRanger 3.0. Initially, genes expressed in <3 cells and cells with <100 genes and mitochondrial reads <6% were excluded from the analysis. Pericytes were removed from amygdalar cells based on Pdgfrb. Hashtag oligos (HTOs) were demultiplexed using HTODemux and singlet cells were used for subsequent analysis. Principal component analysis was performed on the expression data matrix using the Seurat. Thirty principal components were used for generating tSNE plots. Transcriptomic clusters were identified from a total 1,903 amygdalar astrocytes with resolution set to 0.4. Differentially expressed gene candidates from a comparison of Adrb1-positive and Adrb1-negative astrocytes were estimated using Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test.

Cryosections were prepared as described above and stored at −80 °C. RNAscope in situ hybridization was performed using RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v.2 with TSA Vivid Dyes (ACDBio, 323270), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sections were washed for 5 min with PBS, and then heated at 60 °C for 30 min before post-fix. After dehydration in an ethanol series, hydrogen peroxide was applied for 10 min at room temperature. The sections were washed with ddH2O twice, and then incubated in Target Retrieval Reagents for 5 min at 90–100 °C. A wash with ddH2O for 15 s was followed by a dehydration with 100% ethanol for 3 min and dried at room temperature. Then, the sections were incubated with Protease III for 30 min at 40 °C. The sections were washed with ddH2O twice and then incubated with probes Mm-Fos (ACDBio, 316921), Mm-Adra1a (ACDBio, 408611), Mm-Adrb1-C2 (ACDBio, 449761-C2), Mm-Igfbp2 (ACDBio, 405951) and Mm-Slc1a3-C3 (ACDBio, 430781-C3) for 2 h at 40 °C. Thereafter, the sections were washed twice with wash buffer for 2 min between incubations at 40 °C. The sections were incubated in AMP1 for 30 min, AMP2 for 30 min and AMP3 for 15 min at 40 °C, then incubated in horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 15 min, fluorophore for 30 min and HRP-blocker for 15 min at 40 °C for each channel. In the staining of mCherry, slices were washed in 0.1 M PBS 3 times for 10 min each, followed by immunohistochemistry that was performed as described above. Following primary and secondary antibodies used: rabbit anti-RFP (1:250, Rockland, 600-401-379), Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit (1:1,000, Abcam, ab175692). Finally, the sections were incubated with DAPI at room temperature, removed DAPI, and mounted in Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen, P36934). Images were obtained in the same way as immunohistochemistry described above except with a step size of 0.5 µm. Images were processed with ImageJ. Astrocyte somata were delineated using Slc1a3 signals. The intensity of Fos, Adra1a, Adrb1 and Igfbp2 signals within the somata were measured. To account for differences in somata sizes, the signals were normalized using Slc1a3. Subsequently, the normalized signals were z-scored within each sample to evaluate gene expression across a heterogeneous cell population. This approach facilitated the robust identification of cells exhibiting high gene expression relative to the population mean. In Fig. 4e,f, adrenoreceptor-positive cells were identified based on scRNA-seq data, selecting the top 50% of cells ranked by Adra1a expression and the top 20% of cells ranked by Adrb1 expression. Co-expression index of Adra1a and Adrb1, calculated by relative expression level of Adra1a to NoFC median multiplied by relative expression level of Adrb1 for each cell. In Fig. 4j, the correlation analysis of Fos and Adrb1, expression levels were evaluated using z-scores of RNAscope signal intensity to assess gene expression across a heterogeneous population of cells, enabling robust identification of cells with high gene expression relative to the population mean. Specifically, we identified astrocytes with z-scores greater than 2 in RNAscope Fos signal intensity as Fos-high astrocytes, capturing 3% of the astrocyte population with significantly elevated Fos expression, consistent with scRNA-seq data in Fig. 4c where Fos-positive astrocytes occupied 4% of the total astrocytes analysed. Similarly, Adrb1-high astrocytes were identified using z-scores greater than 0.5, capturing 26% of astrocytes, also in line with scRNA-seq data in Fig. 4c where Adrb1-positive astrocytes occupied 20% of the total astrocytes analysed. In addition, Igfbp2-high astrocytes were identified using z-scores greater than 0.5, capturing 24% of all astrocytes in Extended Data Fig. 12d,e, which is consistent with scRNA-seq data indicating that Igfbp2-positive astrocytes occupy 24% of the total astrocytes analysed.

Most statistical tests were run in Prism 10.1.2 (GraphPad). The specific tests used are indicated in the figure legends and Supplementary Table 1. All tests were two-sided unless otherwise noted. Astrocyte Fos count analyses across groups for each brain region were run with R v.4.3.2 on RStudio v.2023.12.1.402 and relied on the tidyverse, car, dunn.test and dplyr packages and base R functions aov(), TukeyHSD() and p.adjust(). The data were first analysed with Levene's test for homogeneity of variance. Brain regions that passed Levene's test (P > 0.05) were followed by a one-way ANOVA test with Tukey's honest significant difference test and regions that failed Levene's test (P < 0.05; no homogeneity of variances) were followed by the Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's post hoc test and Bonferroni adjustment. False discovery rates were calculated across groups and brain regions from post hoc P values using the Benjamini–Hochberg method.

Mice were randomly assigned to experimental groups, and mice assigned to different experimental conditions were run in parallel. Mouse experiments and analyses were done blinded to group allocation. Tissue samples that yielded insufficient cell counts (less than 30 cells) during scRNA-seq quality control were excluded from the study. The results of statistical comparisons, n numbers and P values are shown in the figure panels or figure legends along with averages. n is defined as the numbers of cells, sections or mice throughout on a case-by-case basis; the unit of analysis is stated in the text or in each figure legend. In the figures, summarized data are shown as mean ± s.e.m. with a scatter plot and P values are indicated by asterisks: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.

a, Schematics showing the Gαq GPCR signalling cascade and the blocking of which with iβARK. Left: iβARK, a 122-residue inhibitory peptide from β-adrenergic receptor kinase26, directly binds to Gαq subunits and thus sequesters them to block subsequent Gαq-GPCR-induced signalling cascades.

Men's Brains Shrink Faster than Women's. What That Means for Alzheimer's

Women's brains age more slowly than men's, but they still have higher rates of Alzheimer's disease

During ageing, men experience a greater reduction in volume across more regions of the brain than women do, according to a longitudinal study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The authors suggest this means that age-related brain changes do not explain why women are more frequently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease than men are.

“It's really important that we understand what happens in the healthy brain so that we can better understand what happens when people get these neurodegenerative conditions,” says Fiona Kumfor, a clinical neuropsychologist at the University of Sydney, Australia. This study adds to scientists' understanding of typical brain ageing, she adds.

Nearly twice as many women are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease as men, and ageing is the biggest risk factor for the disease. This has prompted research into age-related sex differences in the brain. “If women's brains declined more, that could have helped explain their higher Alzheimer's prevalence,” says co-author Anne Ravndal, a PhD student at the University of Oslo.

Previous research investigating sex differences in brain ageing has shown mixed results, Ravndal adds. Several studies have found that men experience greater loss of total grey matter and hippocampus size compared with women, whereas other work has reported a sharper decline of grey matter in women.

The latest study included more than 12,500 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans from 4,726 people — at least two scans per person, taken an average of three years apart — who did not have Alzheimer's disease or any cognitive impairments and were control participants in 14 larger data sets. The researchers compared how the individuals' brain structures changed over time, looking at factors including the thickness of grey matter and the size of areas that are associated with Alzheimer's disease, such as the hippocampus, which is essential to memory.

Overall, men experienced a greater reduction in volume across more regions of the brain than women did. For example, the postcentral cortex, which is responsible for processing sensations of touch, pain and temperature, as well as the body's own position and movements, declined by 2.0% per year in men and by 1.2% annually in women.

Kumfor says the results suggest that men age faster than women do. Men also have a shorter life expectancy.

If these changes did have a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, the study would have shown that women experience a greater decline in areas associated with the disease, such as the hippocampus and precuneus, which are involved in memory, says Amy Brodtmann, a clinician researcher in cognitive health at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.

Ravndal says the results point to other possible explanations for the sex differences in prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, such as differences in survival or susceptibility to the disease.

That sex differences in brain volume don't seem to play a part in the condition is not entirely surprising, says Kumfor, because neurodegenerative conditions are complex. Understanding the disorders will require longitudinal studies involving people with Alzheimer's disease, to compare how their brains change over time. “Just looking at age-related changes in brain atrophy is unlikely to explain the complexities behind it,” she adds.

Although the study is robust, further investigations with more diverse data sets are needed, says Brodtmann. For example, people included in the study had high levels of education — a protective factor against Alzheimer's disease — meaning that they were not fully representative of the general population. The data sets also lacked information about other factors that influence a person's risk of Alzheimer's disease, such as ethnicity and the age at which women experience menopause.

The authors say that when they adjusted their analysis for education level, some parts of men's brains no longer showed a steeper decline than occurred in women. When they compared men and women who were predicted to live for the same number of years, rather than those of the same age, the two groups' brains declined at similar rates.

A new randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial suggests that a single round of low-dose radiation therapy could offer a safe and effective alternative for people suffering from painful knee osteoarthritis.

Participants with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis experienced notable pain reduction and improved mobility within four months of receiving the treatment. The radiation exposure was only a tiny fraction of what is used in cancer therapy. Because the study included a control group that underwent a simulated treatment, researchers were able to clearly separate genuine treatment effects from placebo responses, which are common in osteoarthritis trials. Early results from this Korean study were presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Annual Meeting.

"People with painful knee osteoarthritis often face a difficult choice between the risks of side effects from pain medications and the risks of joint replacement surgery," said Byoung Hyuck Kim, MD, PhD, principal investigator on the trial and an assistant professor of radiation oncology at Seoul National University College of Medicine, Boramae Medical Center. "There's a clinical need for moderate interventions between weak pain medications and aggressive surgery, and we think radiation may be a suitable option for those patients especially when drugs and injections are poorly tolerated."

Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting an estimated 32.5 million adults in the United States. It develops as the cartilage that cushions bone ends wears away over time. The condition often targets the knees and hips, limiting mobility and diminishing quality of life. Typical treatment begins with lifestyle adjustments and pain-relief medications, with surgery considered when symptoms become severe.

Low-dose radiation therapy has long been used in European countries such as Germany and Spain to treat joint pain, where it is widely accepted. However, Dr. Kim noted that before this study, rigorous placebo-controlled evidence was scarce, and awareness of the treatment remained low among clinicians in other parts of the world.

"There is a misconception that medicinal, or therapeutic, radiation is always delivered in high doses," he said. "But for osteoarthritis, the doses are only a small fraction of what we use for cancer, and the treatment targets joints that are positioned away from vital organs, which lowers the likelihood of side effects." In this study, he explained, the radiation dose was less than 5% of what is typically used in cancer therapy, and no radiation-related side effects were observed.

The multicenter study included 114 participants with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis, recruited from three academic hospitals in Korea. They were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a very low dose (0.3 Gy), a low dose (3 Gy), or a control group that received simulated (sham) radiation. In the placebo group, patients went through the same setup as those receiving treatment, but no radiation was actually delivered. Each participant underwent six treatment sessions without knowing which group they were assigned to.

To ensure the results reflected the true effects of radiation, the researchers restricted the use of additional pain relievers, allowing only acetaminophen as needed during the four-month follow-up period. The effectiveness of treatment was evaluated using internationally recognized standards, identifying a participant as a "responder" if they achieved meaningful improvement in at least two of three measures: pain, physical function, and overall assessment of their condition. Participants also completed separate questionnaires addressing pain, stiffness, and mobility. No treatment-related side effects were reported.

After four months, 70% of patients in the 3 Gy group met responder criteria, compared to 42% in the placebo group (p=0.014). Outcomes in the 0.3 Gy group were not significantly different from the control group (58.3% improved, p=0.157), indicating the 3 Gy regimen drove relief beyond placebo effects.

Meaningful improvements in the composite score of pain, stiffness and physical function were reported more often in the 3 Gy group (56.8%) than in the placebo group (30.6%, p=0.024). For other secondary outcomes, including the amount of pain medication needed, there were no significant differences.

Dr. Kim said this trial differed from previous research in two critical ways. "The sham-controlled design helped rule out placebo effects, and we limited stronger analgesics, which made differences between groups more clearly attributable to the radiation itself," he said.

"In previous studies, drugs such as NSAIDs or opioids were also used during the intervention or follow-up period. But using these pain relievers could mask the effects of radiation therapy," he said. Because analgesic use was limited to acetaminophen only during the four months of follow-up in this trial, "that means the differences between treatment groups are more clearly attributable to the low-dose radiation therapy itself."

Responses in the placebo arms were substantial -- about 40% met the criteria for treatment response without true radiation -- but are consistent with rates reported in prior osteoarthritis trials of injections or medications and in at least one similar European study, Dr. Kim said. "It was surprising, and it underscores how important placebo-controlled designs are in osteoarthritis research. We need to examine this more closely in future studies."

Radiation therapy may be best suited for patients with underlying inflammation and preserved joint structure, he explained. "For severe osteoarthritis, where the joint is physically destroyed and cartilage is already gone, radiation will not regenerate tissue," Dr. Kim said. "But for people with mild to moderate disease, this approach could delay the need for joint replacement."

He emphasized that low-dose radiation should be considered as part of shared decision-making alongside standard measures such as weight loss, physiotherapy, and medications. "In clinical practice, responses could be even stronger when radiation is properly combined with other treatments, and patient satisfaction may be higher than with current options alone."

The research team is completing 12-month follow-up to assess durability of benefits and to correlate symptom relief with imaging-based measures of joint structure. Planned studies also include larger, pragmatic trials to evaluate outcomes in specific subgroups and health-economic analyses comparing low-dose radiation with injections and medication regimens.

The relationship between the sites means an earthquake in one zone can trigger an earthquake in the other in a phenomenon called “stress triggering.”

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Researchers hoping to unravel the dance of earthquake movement in North America's West Coast discovered a disturbing fact: Two of the world's largest fault lines sometimes work in conjunction. History, as it turns out, shows that an earthquake in either the Cascadia Subduction Zone or the San Andreas Fault can trigger an earthquake in the other. 

In a new study published in the journal Geosphere, researchers from Oregon State University—led by Chris Goldfinger, a marine geologist and geophysicist—show evidence of what's called “partial synchronization” of the northern San Andreas Fault and Cascadia Subduction Zone. Partial synchronization basically means that an earthquake event in one zone has a history of triggering events in the other, and the historical evidence of “significant interaction” between the two (and the potential for more in the future) should be taken as a warning. 

The core piece of evidence of this relationship comes from the seabed. The team mined 130 sediment cores (dating back 3,100 years) from the Mendocino Triple Junction—where the Cascadia Subduction Zone's Juan de Fuca plate and Gorda plate (under the North American Plate) rendezvous with the San Andreas Fault off the coast of northern California. There, the sediment layers showed unusual turbidite (the layers formed by marine landslides moving the ocean floor) action, which is often a telltale sign of an earthquake. 

A typical turbidite features coarse sediment at the bottom with the finer silt settling at the top. At the Mendocino Triple Junction, however, that structure was flipped and “seem[ed] to be upside down with all the sand at the top,” Goldfinger told Scientific American. “And as far as we know, gravity hasn't changed.”

That likely implies those unique turbidite formations were stacked by two earthquakes, one from each zone, in quick succession—a matter of years or even minutes apart. The study shows that eight of the turbidite bends have “substantial temporal overlap” between the Cascadia Subduction Zone and the San Andreas Fault, and that the last major synchronization earthquake event occurred around 1700.

Goldfinger compared the situation to tuning a radio to convert incoming signals. “When you tune an old radio, you're essentially causing one oscillator to vibrate at the same frequency as the other one,” he said. “When these faults synchronize, one fault could tune up the other and cause earthquakes in pairs.” 

Just because it's been over 300 years since the last paired quake, however, it doesn't eliminate future possibilities. “We could expect that an earthquake on one of the faults alone would draw down the resources of the whole country to respond to it,” Goldfinger told The Guardian. “If they both went off together, then you've got potentially San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver [B.C.] all in an emergency situation in a compressed timeframe.”

While there were only eight major events, the evidence showed the two areas were so closely linked that near-simultaneous quakes weren't so much a rarity as a rule. 

“In the paper we stuck to the geology instead of dwelling on the potential doom and gloom,” Goldfinger said. “But it's pretty clear that if something like this happened—and we think the evidence for it is strong—we need to be prepared.”

A natural sweetener derived from the Stevia plant could have a previously unknown superpower.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Few people like going bald—there's a reason why hair growth is a multi-billion industry. One of the leading causes of hair loss is androgenetic alopecia, otherwise known as pattern hair loss, which impacts up to 50 percent of both men and women. One of the most widespread medications for baldness, which is the active ingredient in products like Rogaine, is minoxidil (originally developed to treat high blood pressure).

While this treatment has helped many people grow hair, it does come with a few downsides. Standard treatments typically have poor water solubility and skin permeability, so some hair growth experts resort to applying minoxidil with microneedling, a technique that punctures small holes in the top layer of the skin to stimulate growth factors and increase the medication's absorption. 

As described in a new study, scientists from China and Australia have developed a dissolving patch that can perform this microneedling work while also delivering a dose of minoxidil to the scalp, and it's derived from a somewhat unlikely ingredient: Stevioside (STV), the natural sweetener derived from the Stevia plant. The results of the study were published in the journal Advanced Healthcare Materials.

“Using STV as a novel solubilizing agent, we incorporated minoxidil into a dissolving microneedle patch, which was used to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of minoxidil and overcome the limitations of traditional carrier single-function approaches,” the authors wrote in the study. “This method not only enhances drug penetration into skin but also eliminates other issues associated with traditional topical formulations, such as slow onset of action and/or inaccurate dosing.”

As the authors note, while testosterone doesn't directly cause baldness, the enzyme 5α-reductase converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone, which triggers the apoptosis (or death) of keratin-producing cells in the epidermis. Minoxidil, however, suppresses certain enzymes and inhibits androgen receptors, which has the net effect of decreasing the formation and binding of dihydrotestosterone. It also boosts aromatase, which converts testosterone into estradiol—a kind of estrogen that further stimulates hair growth.

To test their new idea, researchers used mouse models with androgenetic alopecia and tested their new patch against standard treatments. In 35 days, scientists saw hair regrowth in 67 percent of the target area, compared to only 25 percent from the control group—a promising start for this Stevia-based hair loss treatment. Of course, mice are one thing, and humans are another.

“While the mouse model results are promising, human hair growth cycles differ, and androgenetic alopecia is influenced by multiple factors,” Lifeng Kang, a co-author of the study from the University of Sydney, told Gizmodo. “Therefore, clinical trials are essential to confirm efficacy and safety in humans.”

Unwanted hair loss isn't a thing of the past (at least, not yet), but science has it in its crosshairs—no pun intended.

The author has become somewhat notorious in physics circles for groan-inducing takes. That's not to say everything she has produced is bad, because it's not, but she has taken a hard turn into audience capture and speaking over-confidently far out of her area of expertise. It will be interesting to see how the experts respond to this paper, if they do at all. Given the format I'm not sure it's actually designed to be submitted for publishing or if it's just formatted in academic paper style and uploaded to arXiv for some other reason. Note that virtually anyone can register for and upload a document to arXiv, so this being on arXiv.org doesn't imply anything specific.

Sounds like she is doing Youtube to earn some bucks off it, then? Usually, you'll stir up a controversy or make bold claims to create engagement, which in turn pleases "the algorithm".

reply

Lately she's been dabbling with soft support for well known grifters like Eric Weinstein, though last I heard she stopped short of actually endorsing his theories. I think there's just too many views to be had by courting that audience, so it becomes irresistible to engage with. The best thing a good physics communicator could do would be to completely ignore the well known physics grifters and focus on the quality content, but instead she has been leaning toward defensing Weinstein and others.

Swearing in a research paper is new thing to me. Might pass arxiv pre-published stage but definitely not a peer-reviewed one. But I doubt this will ever get published.

Perhaps you can just assume a radius where the electon self-repulsion energy equals its own mass, by m = E/(c^2).

Also, the reference to “known links between the solutions of Yang-Mills theory and those of gravity” (Y-M equations describing charge and EM field) seems to speculatively imply that charge-related information is encoded in the geometry of spacetime, alongside gravitational effects

Probably sums up what the book would be complaining about. No experience, didn't actually do any fact checking, makes claims we are supposed to just believe and call it science.Second video doesnt seem to have any content from the book either.Color me surprised.

I've watched Hossenfelder's videos for years and whilst yes - she might perhaps be overly critical of a lot of things - I don't at all accept that she has weird, conspirational leanings.

Seattle University President Eduardo Peñalver — credited with “a legacy of growth and innovation” — is leaving to become president of Georgetown University, the two Catholic Jesuit institutions announced Wednesday.

Peñalver, who has led Seattle U. since 2021, will step down March 31, 2026, and start in his new role at Georgetown in Washington, D.C., on July 1.

During his tenure, Seattle U. launched a “Technology Ethics Initiative,” designed to “convene and inspire productive discussions about the role of transformative technologies for a just society.” The initiative is led by political science professor Onur Bakiner, whose current research examines AI governance models.

Last year, the university welcomed Father Paolo Benanti, an advisor to Pope Francis on artificial intelligence and technology ethics, as a distinguished visiting professor. Peñalver moderated a conversation between Benanti and Microsoft President Brad Smith for employees on the company's campus in Redmond, Wash.

Like many institutions, Seattle U. has experienced increased enrollment demand in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines. It has also partnered with local tech corporations, including Amazon and Microsoft, which helped fund the $100 million Center for Science and Innovation.

At Seattle U., Peñalver helped launch new academic programs and integrated Cornish College of the Arts into the Seattle U. community.

“This was not an easy decision,” Peñalver said in a message to the university community, “but one I make with gratitude for all that we have accomplished together and confidence in the university's continued momentum. While I am excited about the opportunity to continue my work in Jesuit higher education at such a pivotal moment, I am also sad to be leaving Seattle University and the Pacific Northwest, which will always be my home.”

Peñalver was raised in Puyallup, Wash., and attended Henry Foss High School in Tacoma before he went on to graduate magna cum laude from Cornell University in 1994.

He studied philosophy and theology at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar and earned his bachelor's degree from Cornell University and law degree from Yale Law School. He also clerked for former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, and prior to Seattle U., was dean of Cornell Law School.

“President Peñalver is an exceptional leader steeped in the Catholic and Jesuit tradition who brings a wealth of experience in higher education, a global mindset, a commitment to social justice and academic excellence, and a bold vision for Georgetown's future,” said Thomas Reynolds, chair of Georgetown's board of directors, in a news release.

Peñalver will succeed Interim President Robert Groves, who has led Georgetown for the past year after former President John DeGioia stepped down from his role in 2024 to recover from a stroke.

A U.S. Border Patrol video featuring antisemitic lyrics went viral on X on Tuesday after far-right users discovered it had been posted to Facebook and Instagram. The video, which included the lyrics “Jew me” and “kike me,” was deleted from the platforms on Wednesday morning, though it's not clear whether the offensive content was taken down by Border Patrol or Meta.

The 13-second video appears to have been posted to Instagram in August, but was pinned in the Reels section of the official Border Patrol page, making it more visible to a wider audience. The video only gained widespread attention late Tuesday on X, where far-right extremists celebrated a signal that was clearly intended for them. The Instagram video had 3.4 million views when Gizmodo viewed it Tuesday night.

The audio used in the clip comes from Michael Jackson's controversial 1995 song “They Don't Care About Us.” The song includes the lyrics “Jew me, sue me, everybody do me/ Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me.”

The lyrics were criticized at the time for being antisemitic, though Jackson defended his words, insisting he didn't intend for them to be offensive. The singer, who died in 2009, issued an apology and later released an edited version of the song.

The video starts with footage of someone adjusting a bodycam before viewers see Border Patrol agents walking around with guns. Another shot shows a truck hauling Border Patrol dune buggies, and then a shot in the desert where a dune buggy kicks up dust behind it.

Gizmodo saved a copy of the Border Patrol video before it was taken down from Instagram and Facebook.

The video is very short, making it clear that the choice of lyrics was the intentional focus. Viewers are obviously meant to hear the antisemitic aspects, since it's more or less the only audio in the 13 seconds being presented. DHS didn't respond to questions from Gizmodo on Wednesday morning.

Comments on Instagram included people who clearly understood the message of the video as antisemitic. One commenter replied, “based song choice,” which was liked by the Border Patrol account. Another commenter wrote, “if you know you know.”

Comments from the far-right on X were even more explicit, including “This deserves 6 million likes and shares,” a reference to the number of Jews who died in the Holocaust.

Other commenters on X marveled at how mainstream their far-right and antisemitic ideas were becoming, with one person writing, “This movie is taking a strange turn. It's strange to me because I never thought I'd see this in the mainstream—it was always underground.”

And while it's accurate to describe the shift as “strange,” it was entirely predictable after President Donald Trump was inaugurated for a second time in January. Billionaire Elon Musk really kicked off the tone of the era with two Nazi-style salutes. Musk later denied he was making Nazi gestures, but many of his supporters clearly took it as a sign that they could drop the mask. Steve Bannon, a former top advisor to Trump, made the same salute not long after.

Trump himself has also said some extremely antisemitic things, including when he used the term “shylock” at a rally in July.

“No death tax, no estate tax, no going to the banks and borrowing from, in some cases, a fine banker. And in some cases, shylocks and bad people.”

In fact, there's an entire Wikipedia page devoted to collecting examples of Trump's antisemitism.

U.S. Border Patrol is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which has been posting far-right extremist content since Trump took office for a second time. In a tweet on Tuesday, DHS posted just one word, “Remigrate,” a term more popular in Europe among the far-right that refers to ethnic cleansing through deporting non-white people.

DHS also posted a video that included the words “Save America” in a typeface that's clearly meant to evoke Nazi-era imagery.

The dog whistles from DHS are blaring foghorns at this point

DHS has frequently posted fascist propaganda using copyrighted material without permission, something that sometimes gets the content removed from the major social media platforms.

The people of DHS often know they're the bad guys, like when they responded to questions from John Oliver's HBO show by talking about the “heroism” of Darth Vader. The late-night host was asking about a video posted by Gregory Bovino—the new face of anti-immigrant operations in the U.S., with his frequent appearances on TV—where Vader is destroying rebel forces labeled with things like “gang member,” and “fake news.”

Is a lot of this trolling? Sure, that's one defense of it. But at some point, you own the words and images that you push into the world. And if you spend all day, every day saying racist and antisemitic things, people have to start taking you at your word.

Not to mention the fact that DHS has real power in the world to upend lives and has no business joking or “trolling” the American people. Agencies under DHS, like ICE, are currently harassing and arresting people for looking Latino. And that often includes American citizens.

Ironically, DHS said back in April that social media would be screened for “antisemitism” by any foreign nationals in the country. In reality, DHS was looking for anyone who opposed the war in Gaza, falsely equating such a position with antisemitism. The U.S. State Department announced Tuesday it had canceled the visas of six people who had written negative things about Charlie Kirk.

Antisemitism runs deep in the modern Republican Party. Politico published leaked texts from the Young Republicans on Tuesday, which included messages like “I love Hitler.” Vice President JD Vance defended the texts and dismissed criticism as “pearl-clutching.” And guys like Vance know their audience. They can be dismissed as shitposters, but they're some of the most vile racists on the planet, and they're becoming normalized in ways that would've been unthinkable even a decade ago.

Americans who are opposed to Trump plan to stage nationwide protests on Saturday, Oct. 18, for what's being dubbed another No Kings rally. Republicans have tried to characterize the upcoming protests as hate marches, falsely insisting they would be full of “Hamas supporters.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Wednesday that the reason the government hasn't opened yet is because of the upcoming demonstrations, a claim that makes no sense whatsoever.

“This crazy No Kings rally this weekend, which is gonna be the farthest left, the hardest core, the most unhinged in the Democratic Party, which is a big title. No Kings equals no paychecks,” said Bessent.

The No Kings rally, which is likely to include a wide variety of Americans who are opposed to Trump's fascist takeover of the country, has a website that allows people to find their nearest demonstration. It won't just be the “hardest core,” as Bessent puts it, if past protests are any guide.

Correction: This article originally stated that the Instagram video had been viewed 4.3 million times before it was deleted. It was 3.4 million. Gizmodo regrets the error.

While employees spend much of their day communicating and coordinating amongst themselves on projects, this effort is often undermined by the availability of specific individuals. When a colleague with vital information is away — whether on vacation or in a different time zone — the rest of the team must delay progress until that person responds.

Ashutosh Garg and Varun Kacholia, the co-founders of Eightfold — an AI recruiting startup last valued at $2.1 billion — believe that advances in LLMs and data privacy technologies can help solve some aspects of this costly problem. Earlier this year, they launched Viven, a digital twin startup with a mission to grant employees access to crucial information from teammates even when those colleagues are unavailable.

On Wednesday, Viven emerged out of stealth mode with $35 million in seed funding from Khosla Ventures, Foundation Capital, FPV Ventures, and others.

Viven develops a specialized LLM for each employee, effectively creating a digital twin by accessing their internal electronic documents such as email, Slack, and Google Docs. Other employees in the organization can then query that person's digital twin to get immediate answers related to common projects and shared knowledge.

“When each and every person has a digital twin, you can just talk to their twin as if you're talking to that person and get the response,” Ashutosh Garg told TechCrunch.

One major hurdle is that people just can't share everything with anyone who asks. Employees often handle sensitive  information or have personal files they want to keep private from the rest of the team.

According to Ashutosh Garg, Viven's technology solves that complex problem through a concept known as pairwise context and privacy. This enables the startup's LLMs to precisely determine what information can be shared and with whom across the organization.

Viven's LLMs are smart enough to recognize personal context and know what information needs to stay private — like questions related to an employee's personal life. But perhaps the most important safeguard is that everyone can see the query history of their digital twin, which acts as a deterrent against people asking inappropriate questions.

“It's a very hard problem to solve, and until recently, it was unsolvable,” Ashu Garg, a general partner at Foundation Capital told TechCrunch.

Viven is already in use by several enterprise clients, including Genpact and Eightfold. (Co-founders Ashutosh Garg and Varun Kacholia continue to lead Eightfold, splitting their time between that company and running Viven.)

As for competition, Ashutosh Garg claims that no other company is tackling digital twins for the enterprise yet.

He wasn't sure that there were no competitors when he first started thinking about the idea. So he called Vinod Khosla to ask about it. The legendary investor assured Ashutosh Garg that nobody is doing this and agreed to invest.

Ashu Garg of Foundation Capital was equally excited about Viven.

“When Ashutosh came to me and described the product, the big aha for me was: there's this horizontal problem across all jobs of coordination and communication, which no one is automating,” Ashu Garg told TechCrunch.

But just because there are no direct competitors now doesn't mean that other companies won't build digital twins for companies in the future. Ashu Garg said that Anthropic, Google's Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and OpenAI's enterprise search products have a personalization component. But, if they do enter this market, Viven hopes its “pairwise” context technology will be its moat.

Liberate, an AI startup automating insurance operations, has raised $50 million in a round led by Battery Ventures as it looks to scale its agentic deployments across carriers and agencies globally.

The all-equity round values the three-year-old startup at $300 million post-money, with participation from new investor Canapi Ventures and returning backers Redpoint Ventures, Eclipse, and Commerce Ventures.

The insurance industry has been navigating a difficult stretch, with rising operational costs, legacy system constraints, and increasing customer expectations. Specifically in the non-life segment, global premium growth is projected to slow through 2026, driven by heightened competition, weaker rate momentum, and new cost pressures, including tariffs, per a recent report by Deloitte. While some carriers experimented with AI, many early efforts stalled due to fragmented data and inflexible workflows. That is now changing, as insurers shift toward full-scale AI adoption — embedding it into the core of their operations rather than layering it on top. Liberate is stepping in to meet this shift head-on.

Founded in 2022, the San Francisco-based startup builds AI systems for property and casualty insurers, focusing on sales, service, and claims. At the front end, its voice AI assistant, Nicole, handles inbound and outbound calls to help sell policies or respond to service requests. Behind the scenes, a network of reasoning-based AI agents connects to insurers' existing systems, gathering context and generating responses that Nicole delivers — all without human intervention.

Liberate's AI agents are built to complete end-to-end tasks — not just respond to queries or escalate tickets. These include quoting policies, processing claims, and updating endorsements, among other routine functions.

The agents can also operate over SMS and email, allowing insurers to interact with customers across different channels while automating more of their day-to-day workflows.

“Insurance companies want to grow, but they're not able to do so,” Liberate co-founder and CEO Amrish Singh (pictured above, center) said in an interview. “It's the status quo where the opportunity is.”

Singh co-founded Liberate after nearly four years at Metromile, the car insurance firm owned by Lemonade, where he worked across both back-office operations and technology. He teamed up with Ryan Eldridge, Liberate's VP of engineering and also a former Metromile executive, and Jason St. Pierre, the company's CPO, who previously held roles at Twitter, Google, and Verily, Alphabet's life sciences arm.

Liberate's AI systems have helped increase sales by an average of 15% and cut costs by 23%, Singh told TechCrunch, adding that the startup now has over 60 customers and focuses on the top 100 carriers and agencies, which together represent 70% to 80% of the U.S. property and casualty insurance market.

The technology uses reinforcement learning tailored for long, regulated insurance conversations. Each interaction is auditable and includes human-in-the-loop safeguards to meet compliance requirements, the startup said.

Over the past year, Liberate has scaled from 10,000 monthly automations to 1.3 million automated resolutions, Singh stated. These include direct customer interactions via its voice AI, as well as back-office tasks handled by AI agents integrated into carriers' core systems.

Since AI systems can still make mistakes and are not foolproof yet, Liberate uses an internal tool called Supervisor to monitor all interactions between its agents and customers. The software flags issues or anomalies and escalates to a human when the AI's response may be off-track, Singh said.

“The advantage of servicing only one industry, and within that servicing only three specific use cases, is that you can put a lot more guardrails in place,” the executive noted.

Without disclosing the names of its clients, Liberate said that using its agents, hurricane claim response time dropped from 30 hours to 30 seconds.

The AI agents enable 24/7 sales operations, allowing customers to buy insurance even at midnight or early in the morning — times when human agents typically are not available, Singh said.

Before this round, Liberate raised a $15 million Series A last year. Its voice AI-powered omnichannel experience and ability to fully automate tasks by integrating into existing systems were key factors that drew investors to back the company at a larger scale.

“Mapping the process, modeling it, and making sure that all the systems connections are in place, well tested, and appropriately designed so that you can complete the task, not just communicate, is what Liberate is doing,” Marcus Ryu, a general partner at Battery Ventures, told TechCrunch.

Ryu, who previously worked with property and casualty insurers at Guidewire Software, focuses on enterprise software, fintech, and insurtech investments at Battery Ventures. He is joining Liberate's board.

The Series B funding will be used to expand Liberate's reasoning capabilities and support broader deployment across insurers. The startup has raised $72 million to date and currently employs around 50 people.

Seattle startup Electric Era today unveiled a sleek, interactive EV charging device that uses artificial intelligence to converse with drivers as they're juicing up their vehicles. 

The company builds electric vehicle charging systems that are typically deployed at convenience stores and other businesses. The modern-looking new unit — dubbed RetailEdge — can provide information on a vehicle's charging status, suggest how much power is required to reach the next destination, give information on loyalty points earned at a partnering business, and even tell jokes.

“This is a next generation charging dispenser that does more than just charge cars. It can talk to drivers, it can answer their questions. It can provide them an intelligent and immersive interface while they stop to charge and shop,” said CEO and co-founder Quincy Lee. 

RetailEdge incorporates in-house-designed hardware and software, including bilingual AI technology that can integrate with business partners' existing systems. The chargers also include payment interfaces. While some competitors cut costs by using off-the-shelf components, Lee said his startup achieves efficiency by developing custom solutions.

“We are a uniquely capable team of designing very low cost products that have heightened product capabilities,” he said. 

Electric Era launched in 2019 and distinguished itself by pairing its DC fast-charging systems with giant batteries to help deliver and store power needed by recharging EVs. The company has served 72,000 drivers in the past year and has 130 charging stalls deployed in roughly a dozen states. Lee said he expects those numbers to at least double by the end of next year.

The company has 40 employees and has raised $20.5 million in equity funding plus $8.9 million in debt financing.

Today's announcement comes as EV charging infrastructure continues expanding despite policy headwinds. Republican leaders recently canceled tax credits for EV purchases, but charging stations are proliferating.

Bloomberg reported that the number of public charging stations in the U.S. increased by 19% in the first nine months of this year, with 780 high-speed stations added in the third quarter alone.

“The charging map is also being filled in by restaurants and retail stores, which increasingly see [charging] cords as a way to attract customers,” Bloomberg reported — which is the sector targeted by Electric Era.

The startup will keep selling its original charging units alongside RetailEdge. Lee described his products as “cost competitive” but didn't share specifics.

Electric Era has so far avoided the charging cable thefts that plague many installations, as thieves sever the cables for the copper and other metals they contain. Lee suspects the company's units are going into locations with more activity and employee oversight, but he recognizes the vulnerability.

The issue is particularly acute in the Seattle area, where Electric Era will be installing 32 ports over roughly the next eight months. The region has been hard hit by thieves targeting not only charging sites but also utility and telecommunications infrastructure.

Lee said his team is “constantly lobbying” state leaders to pass laws that protect this sort of essential infrastructure.

Photographer Qingrong Yang was visiting Yundang Lake near his home in Fujian province, China, when he captured the stunning scene in the photo above.

Yang regularly goes to this lake to photograph feeding frenzies—when birds fly low over the surface to grab fish leaping to escape underwater predators. During this one, he snapped a photo at the exact moment a ladyfish snatched its prey right out from under a little egret's beak. It won Yang the Behavior: Birds category award in the 2025 Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition.

This annual contest, organized by the Natural History Museum in London, showcases the best wildlife photos of the year. Read on to see more of this year's jaw-dropping award winners.

Marine conservation photojournalist Shane Gross waited for several weeks to capture this rarely seen peppered moray eel behavior on D'Arros Island, Amirante, Seychelles. Peppered moray eels can hunt both above and below the water's surface and are well-adapted to the intertidal zone. These three were scavenging for dead fish when Gross spotted them and snapped a photo.

Photographer and biologist Javier Aznar González de Rueda explores the complex relationship between humans and rattlesnakes throughout the U.S. He spotted this black-tailed rattler on the road at night outside of Fort Davis, Texas. González took this picture as the snake raised its tail and began rattling to ward off the perceived threat of the snake handler who moved it from the road.

While hiking in the Lepini Mountains of central Italy, teenage wildlife photographer Andrea Dominzi stumbled upon abandoned machinery in an area once logged for beech trees. Soon, he realized he wasn't the only observer. A longhorn beetle of the species Morimus asper made the perfect subject for this photo. Framed as though the beetle is looking out over the disturbed patch of forest, tells a poignant story of habitat loss and hope for renewal.

Wildlife photographer Dennis Stogsdill had spent days searching for wild cats in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, when a call came over the radio. A caracal—a medium-sized wild cat known for its impressive leaping ability—had been spotted at Ndutu Lake. When Stogsdill arrived, he found the cat hunting lesser flamingos and took this striking photo of the hunter proudly displaying its catch.

Nature photographer Georgina Steytler spent years looking for the gum-leaf skeletonizer caterpillar, also known as the “mad hatterpillar.” While exploring Torndirrup National Park in Western Australia, she noticed eucalyptus trees with skeletonized leaves—a sign that the animal had been grazing there. Once she found her subject, she took this backlit image showcasing its bizarre headgear, made up of the old head capsules it keeps every time it sheds its skin.

Wildlife and nature photographer Luca Lorenz snapped this photo of a curious harbor seal popping its head above water off the archipelago of Heligoland, Germany. Lorenz minimized the lens aperture to bring the full expanse of the sea into focus and captured the texture of the ocean surface as rain pattered against it.

Post-doc researcher and wildlife photographer Quentin Martinez found this group of lesser tree frogs during a rainy night on Kaw Mountain in French Guiana. These vibrant frogs had gathered for a breeding event, producing short, shrill calls to attract mates. This species breeds only during heavy rainfall, assembling in huge numbers to mate for just a few hours.

Wildlife and landscape photographer Wim van den Heever is the overall winner of this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year awards—and the winner of the urban wildlife category—for this haunting image. It took Heever a decade to capture this perfectly framed image of a brown hyena standing before the dilapidated ruins of an abandoned mining town in Kolmanskop, near Luderitz, Namibia.

Brown hyenas are the rarest hyena species in the world, and their nocturnal, solitary nature makes them challenging subjects to photograph. They are known to pass through Kolmanskop on their way to hunt Cape fur seal pups or scavenge for carrion that washes ashore along the Namib Desert coast.

Cybersecurity firm F5 Networks says government-backed hackers had “long-term, persistent access” to its network, which allowed them to steal the company's source code and customer information.

In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, F5 said it now “believes its containment actions have been successful,” after first discovering the hackers in its network on August 9.

The Seattle, Washington-based company, which specializes in providing application security and cybersecurity defenses for large companies and governments, said the hackers had access to its BIG-IP product development environment and its knowledge management systems, which included source code and publicly undisclosed security vulnerabilities.

F5 said it wasn't aware of any modifications to its software while in development, nor was it aware of any exploitation of the vulnerabilities. The company published several updates on Wednesday for its BIG-IP platform to fix the undisclosed security flaws and urged customers to patch them.

The company also said the hackers downloaded configurations and implementation information about some of its customers' systems, files that could help hackers find and exploit potential design weaknesses, and potentially hack into those customers' systems.

F5 said in the notice that the U.S. Department of Justice allowed the company to delay its public disclosure. An F5 spokesperson would not say for what reason the delay was allowed, but the DOJ can allow companies to hold off on notifying the public if there is a “substantial risk to national security or public safety.”

F5 has over 1,000 corporate customers and serves more than 85% of the Fortune 500, the largest public companies by revenue, including banks, tech companies, and critical infrastructure companies.

The U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre warned on Wednesday, following F5's disclosure, that hackers could “enable a threat actor to exploit F5 devices and software.”

CISA said in an email on Wednesday that it has ordered civilian federal agencies under an emergency directive to patch their systems by October 22, citing the security risks.

The company did not attribute the attacks to a particular government or nation-state-affiliated hacking group, and F5 spokesperson Dan Sorensen declined to answer TechCrunch's questions beyond the company's published statement, including how many customers are affected and if it was known how the hackers broke in to begin with. 

F5 is the latest tech company in recent years to have been hacked by government hackers, including Microsoft — by China, and Russia, at least twice; cloud and enterprise technology firm Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and several other companies as part of the broader Russian cyberattack on the software maker SolarWinds.

Cybersecurity and networking company F5 disclosed that a “highly sophisticated” nation-state threat actor infiltrated its internal systems this summer, stealing portions of the company's BIG-IP source code and details about software vulnerabilities.

The Seattle-based company disclosed the incident Wednesday in an SEC filing and a customer memo, saying the attacker maintained “long-term, persistent access” to some of its product development and engineering systems before the breach was contained.

F5 said it learned of the intrusion on Aug. 9, and that the U.S. Department of Justice authorized a delay in public disclosure. The company said it believes its containment efforts have been successful and that it has seen no new unauthorized activity.

F5 shares were down more than 3% in early trading Wednesday.

Some of the breached files contained configuration details for a small percentage of customers, the company said, and those customers are being notified directly.

F5 said it has no evidence that the attackers accessed CRM or financial data, or tampered with its software supply chain. Independent reviews by NCC Group and IOActive confirmed that the company's build and release systems were not modified.

The company also said the attackers did not reach its other major product lines, including NGINX, F5 Distributed Cloud Services, or Silverline.

F5 released software updates for several products, including BIG-IP, F5OS, and BIG-IP Next, urging customers to patch immediately. F5 is providing a threat-hunting guide and new tools to help users harden systems and monitor for suspicious activity.

F5 is one of Seattle's largest public tech companies, with a market capitalization around $19 billion and thousands of enterprise customers worldwide, including 80% of the Fortune Global 500. Its hardware and software sit in the middle of much of the world's internet traffic, providing load-balancing, application delivery, and security services for major corporations and government agencies.

While F5 products themselves have been targeted in the past — including a vulnerability in 2020 and the “Velvet Ant” malware campaign uncovered in 2024 — this appears to be the first publicly disclosed breach of F5's internal systems.

Separately, F5 announced Wednesday that Michael Montoya resigned from the company's board and became its chief technology operations officer. Montoya was most recently COO at New York-based cybersecurity company BlueVoyant. 

F5 reported revenue growth of 12% to $780 million in its most recently fiscal earnings, with GAAP net income of $190 million, up from $144 million in the year-ago period.

Apple on Wednesday announced its new M5 chip along with the new iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and Vision Pro, all powered by the new chip.

These devices are now available for preorder, with shipping and in-store availability expected on October 22.

The M5 chip will allow the new devices to run faster than their predecessors. Apple says the chip has over four times the peak GPU compute performance compared to the M4. Johny Srouji, Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Technologies, added in a statement that it “ushers in the next big leap in AI performance for Apple silicon.” 

For the new iPad Pro, Apple touts that the chip brings “up to 3.5x the AI performance” of last year's Pro and up to 5.6x faster than the iPad Pro with M1.

Other upgrades include Apple's C1X cellular modem with up to 50% faster cellular data performance and the N1 chip for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Thread connectivity. Additionally, the new iPad Pro has faster storage read and write speeds and faster charging of up to 50% in around 30 minutes.

Adding more power to the iPad Pro seems like a logical step for Apple to take, as the tech giant is pushing it to feel more like a laptop. With iPadOS 26, the tablet is getting more intuitive window displays, the Preview app, and the ability to create folders for better organization. 

The pricing starts at $999 for the 11-inch model and $1,299 for the 13-inch, with color options in black and silver.

The new 14-inch MacBook Pro is expected to be even faster than its predecessor, featuring upgraded graphics performance (up to 1.6 times better), a higher memory bandwidth of 153Gbps (increased from M4's 120Gbps), and improved storage speeds.

It also boasts a battery life of up to 24 hours.

The price starts at $1,599, and it is available in space black and silver.

Vision Pro is also set to receive the M5 chip, replacing the current M2.

The M5 chip enhances display rendering by 10%, supports refresh rates up to 120Hz (up from 100Hz), and accelerates AI-powered features, making them 50% faster. Additionally, battery life improves by 30 minutes, providing up to 2.5 hours of general use and three hours of video playback.

The upgraded Vision Pro also comes with a Dual Knit Band to give users a more comfortable fit. It's available in small, medium, and large. The price remains at $3,499.

The announcement of the new Vision Pro follows reports that Apple is shifting its focus toward developing smart glasses instead of overhauling its VR headset.

Without much fanfare, Apple has unveiled three new flagship products today via a press release—no special event, no prerecorded show. That might be because the new iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and Vision Pro don't change the mold—they're identical to their predecessors—but internally, they're debuting Apple's highly anticipated M5 chip.

All of the devices are available for preorder today and go on sale October 22. Here's everything you need to know.

The M5 processor is the heart of the announcements today, as it powers all the new Apple hardware. It's built on the 3-nanometer process, with a 10-core GPU and a neural accelerator in each core, which Apple claims improves performance in GPU-based AI workloads and provides four times the peak GPU compute performance over the M4 chip.

Graphics performance in general is 30 percent higher than the M4, and the 10-core CPU offers 15 percent faster multithreaded performance. (Apple claims this is the “world's fastest CPU core.”) The 16-core Neural Engine has also been enhanced, which should mean Apple Intelligence and other AI tasks (like transforming a 2D photo to a spatial scene) should be faster. Apple says there's a 30 percent increase in unified memory bandwidth, allowing larger AI models to run on the device, but it also helps deliver better performance for the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine.

It has been roughly a year and a half since the debut of the M4-powered iPad Pro, but the new M5 iPad Pro tablets don't change much outside of the processor. You still have two sizes to choose from: 11 or 13 inches. Both of them feature fast charging—you can get 50 percent in 30 minutes when using a compatible charger—though annoyingly, Apple only includes a 20-watt USB-C power adapter in the box.

Both feature Apple's N1 networking chip that debuted in the iPhone 17, which includes Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread. Also in tow is the C1X 5G modem from the iPhone Air for 50 percent faster cellular performance and 30 percent less power usage than the M4 iPad Pro. Over its predecessor, you'll see a 3.5X boost in AI performance, 1.5X faster 3D rendering with ray tracing, up to 1.2X faster video transcode performance in Final Cut Pro, and 2.3X faster AI video upscaling performance in DaVinci Resolve. The 256- and 512-GB models use 12 GB of unified memory now, twice as much as before, and the faster memory bandwidth means everything gets a speed boost.

Many of the other specs are the same. They're just as thin as before, feature Apple's Tandem OLED display technology, and can hit 1,600 nits at peak brightness. You still get the nano-textured glass upgrade if you want to reduce glare on the screen. Speaking of the screen, Apple says there's a new capability for these iPads to drive external displays at up to 120 Hz; if you already have a 120-Hz screen, a new Adaptive Sync feature will ensure the lowest possible latency between iPad and monitor.

As before, the 11-inch iPad Pro costs $999, and the 13-inch iPad Pro starts at $1,299. They're compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro, Apple Pencil USB-C, Magic Keyboard, and Smart Folio.

Interestingly, Apple did not completely revamp its MacBook Pro lineup with the M5 chip. Instead, there's just one new model: a 14-inch MacBook Pro with four storage options (512 GB, 1 TB, 2 TB, or 4 TB) and three unified memory options (16, 24, or 32 GB). The base version starts at $1,599, like before, but if you max out all of the upgrades, it can cost as much as $3,369. We'll likely see M5 Pro and M5 Max chip options in 2026 alongside a 16-inch MacBook Pro.

You'll see similar speed increases like on the iPad Pro M5—3.5X faster AI performance, 1.6X faster graphics over the prior M4-powered MacBook Pro, and 2X faster SSD performance. Otherwise, this is the same 14-inch MacBook as before, with the claimed “24-hour” battery life, mini-LED display with the nano-texture glass option, a six-speaker system, and a 12-MP webcam. There are three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI, an SDXC slot, a headphone jack, and the MagSafe charging port.

Widely regarded as a miss with consumers, Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset is back but with no major changes to the hardware. Well, there's a new head strap: the Dual Knit Band. It's included in the box, and Apple says it's soft and cushioned, allowing for a comfier fit. The headset is now powered by the M5 chip, which enables faster performance, sharper details throughout visionOS 26, and better battery life. Specifically, Apple says the M5 renders 10 percent more pixels on the micro-OLED displays than before, and the refresh rate can also jump up to 120 Hz.

Battery life is now two and a half hours of general use, as opposed to just two hours on the original Vision Pro. That extends to three hours with video playback.

Unfortunately, the price remains firm at $3,499. It's arriving right before Samsung is expected to unveil its Android XR mixed-reality headset, Project Moohan, which will hopefully come with a lower price tag.

MINTernet is the latest in the growing field of home 5G internet services


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Several cell providers have hopped on the 5G home internet service bandwagon, with T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon offering service in select areas across the United States. Now, a new player is entering the fray: Mint Mobile. Mint Mobile is a subsidiary of T-Mobile, which is a known quantity in this segment, and its new service is called MINTernet.

Unsurprisingly, MINTernet operates on T-Mobile's nationwide wireless network, offering unlimited 5G service. Now, whenever unlimited data is mentioned in the 5G realm, you should always look at the fine print. In this case, Mint Mobile says that once you consume over 1TB of data within your billing cycle, "network speeds vary and may be reduced." This is similar to the T-Mobile Home Internet policy, where the restriction is implemented after exceeding the 1.2TB threshold.

Regarding the speeds you can expect, the "Broadband Facts" label for MINTernet indicates that typical download speeds will range from 133 to 415 Mbps, while uploads should reach a maximum of around 55 Mbps. As for latency, expect to see 16 to 28 ms in most situations.

MINTernet costs $40 per month if you opt for the introductory 3-month offer, and this price is contingent upon paying the entire cost upfront ($120). However, if you already have a Mint phone plan (or intend to add one at the time of signup), your monthly cost drops to $30 ($90 upfront).

A 6-month plan is also offered at $45/month ($270 upfront) or $35/month ($210 upfront) with a phone plan. Finally, there's a 12-month plan that drops back down to $40/month ($480 upfront) or $30/month ($360) with a qualifying phone plan. All customers will get a free 5G gateway (modem/Wi-Fi router) with their order, along with a 14-day money-back guarantee.

Considering that MINTernet runs on T-Mobile's 5G network, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that my first run-in with its 5G home internet service ended in disaster in 2022. However, I revisited the service in 2024 with much better results, averaging over 600 Mbps for downloads and over 50 Mbps for uploads. T-Mobile Home Internet costs $50/month with autopay, so if you tick the right boxes, MINTernet will save you up to $20/month.

There's no better time to check the social media accounts of your favorite sports team than when that team is winning and you want to bask in the shared experience with other fans.

The vibes are especially good right now for the Seattle Mariners, who less than a week ago dispatched the Detroit Tigers in an earth-shaking 15-inning thriller, and this week jumped to a 2-0 series lead against the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League Championship Series. 

Game 3 is at T-Mobile Park Wednesday, and a team behind the scenes will be ready to react to the next big play on the field or fan moment in the stands in hopes of transferring the energy in the ballpark across the city and region and as far as the internet will take it.

“This home stretch of the season and then into the postseason has been a really fun time for us,” said Tim Walsh, senior director of digital marketing and social media for the Mariners. “It's cool because we have a lot more eyeballs on our content now, and it allows us to really showcase what we've been doing this whole season, and even more so over the last few years.”

Walsh joined the Mariners in 2020 after managing social media for more than four years with the New York Mets. A Long Island, N.Y., native, he said it's become evident during his five years that Seattle is a baseball and sports city. And he thinks the Mariners' unique collection of players and personalities, combined with an energized fan base, make his job especially enjoyable.

Walsh works with teams across the Mariners organization, managing social accounts for everything from the Mariner Moose to T-Mobile Park to the farm system. Content creators, videographers, graphic designers and others all funnel their work to the social team for use on channels including Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and more, in search of a coveted young demographic.

“Instagram in particular for us this year has been awesome,” Walsh said, adding that the Mariners passed 1 million followers this season. “I feel like the team playing well, combined with a really good strategy and a really good group of people producing the content leads to tremendous success from a social standpoint, in terms of engagement growth and the numbers that we measure ourselves by.”

The goal is to provide a mix of content to reach many different types of fans and to serve a variety of purposes for the organization. As the only team to never reach a World Series, there's a lot of emotion around what the Mariners are trying to accomplish, and the social feeds capitalize on that to engage fans. The hype video below is a good example.

Walsh also enjoys pushing a casual “group chat mentality” that can be a relatable tone to strike, leaning heavily on memes, pop culture references and trending content. Here's a strange and simple example that drew 26,000 likes and elicited this comment: “Mariners social media manager is my hero.”

The late season and playoffs have been filled with a number of viral fan moments, spotlighted by the social team and other media organizations. There was the fan who caught Cal Raleigh's historic 60th home run ball and unselfishly handed it to a little kid, or the fan in Detroit wearing a “Dump 61 Here” shirt when he caught another Raleigh smash and got himself a meeting with Raleigh and a trip to Seattle.

“One of the things we try and do is weave our fans into all of the content that we're sharing, because they are so important. They create an incredible home field advantage, unlike anything else in baseball,” Walsh said.

Taking fans behind the scenes is also important. The Mariners have experimented with GoPro cameras in the announcer's booth to catch personalities such as Rick Rizzs calling the action. But a video last Friday night (below), captured from the perspective of pitcher Luis Castillo exiting the dugout to join his team's celebration on the field, drew national applause.

Walsh credits the players for letting the social team get close to the stories that matter to fans, like when a “hidden camera” captured Julio Rodriguez getting called up to the big leagues or when rookie Cole Young got his news and made an emotional call to his family.

“Some things are going to do better than others, but I think we're not afraid to fail,” Walsh said. “I think that's really important in the social space — trying new things and not being afraid to do things that might not click or resonate in the way that you were hoping for.”

As much as the social team prides itself on reacting to key plays or viral moments of each individual game, Walsh is equally proud of the preparation his team puts in to be able to move quickly. Captions, scripts, graphics and videos that are prepared in advance enable the team to be ready for the unpredictable. 

“We don't want to get too far ahead or jinx, but we have to prep, to be ready for what's next and to tell those stories in a fun, unique way,” Walsh said. “So that when a crazy moment happens in a game, or fans start wearing shoes on their head, we're able to jump on it.”

No word on M5 Pro or Max, yet.

After teasing a new product launch on X earlier today, Apple has just announced the 2025 refresh to its 14-inch MacBook Pro lineup, now equipped with the shiny new M5 chip. The press release, accompanied by a separate M5 announcement, was just published on the company's website, unpacking the new laptop in great detail. It's largely an iterative update, with the new chip nicely slotting in for yesteryear's M4 in an otherwise largely unchanged package.

There are no design tweaks or exciting features to speak of. The chassis, including the 14-inch Mini LED display, is identical to previous models — just like all the other core features such as ports, speakers, keyboard, trackpad, and even the 12 MP webcam. The battery is once again quoted to last 24 hours in video playback, and you still only get Wi-Fi 6E. However, the SSD is 2x faster compared to last gen, and you can now spec it up to 4 TB, twice as much as previous gen.

 




It's clear that Apple is entirely focused on what's inside, the latest generation of its homegrown M-series silicon — M5. This swap is what likely enables the memory bandwidth to be upgraded from 120 GB/s on the M4 to now "over 150 GB/s" on the M5.

The SoC package includes a 10-core CPU, a 10-core GPU with "a Neural Accelerator in each core," and a 16-core NPU for on-device AI. The M5 chip is built on TSMC's N3P node and has a faster GPU that can deliver 1.6x more FPS in games, 20% faster multi-core CPU performance, and 1.7x quicker render times in Blender — all versus the M4. Apple even says it's 86x more powerful than Intel-based Macs in AI applications.

The price for the new 14-inch MacBook Pro remains the same as last year, with the base model starting at $1,599, offering you a 512 GB SSD and 16 GB of RAM. Keep in mind that, just like M4, the base M5 isn't available on the 16-inch models as they start out with a Pro chip (so, presumably M5 Pro). The device is available to pre-order right away, with general availability beginning next week on October 22. Alongside the MacBook Pro, Apple also refreshed the Vision Pro and the iPad Pro with the new M5 chip.

 




The tablet gets Apple's in-house C1X modem and N1 networking chip that brings Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6 support, offering faster connectivity across the board with 30% less power usage compared to the M4 iPad Pro. On the other hand, the mixed reality headset now has a new Dual Knit headband, also available for purchase separately for $99. Therefore, M5's improvements in performance, battery life, and AI-powered workflows are present on the Vision Pro and iPad Pro as well.

Accompanying that is the fresh software for each of these devices, including the MacBook Pro, with the latest OS versions adding newer features and, of course, the Liquid Glass visual overhaul. Prices remain the same as last gen for both the iPad and Vision Pro as well.

Apple's Vision Pro is getting its first big upgrade since its release, and just like all the products Apple announced today, everything centers on the M5 chip. According to Apple, the introduction of the M5 brings quite a few benefits to the Vision Pro experience, including “10% more pixels on the custom micro-OLED displays,” which should equate to a sharper, better-defined viewing experience. A new 10-core GPU architecture will also enable ray tracing and very likely make gaming feel even more immersive, particularly when it comes to rendering light and shadow.

On top of that, the M5 will bump the Vision Pro's refresh rate to 120Hz, helping to reduce ghosting and make watching pretty much any experience involving lots of motion look even smoother. If you're worried about AI performance, the M5 will also perform better on that front. Apple says native AI experiences like Personas and spatial video run 50% faster, which may not be the most important metrics in the world, but they will be a boon to those who don't like waiting around for things to load. As you might expect from Apple silicon, the M5 sounds like a step up generation-to-generation, but it's not just about performance; the chip is also bringing much-needed battery improvements.

Apple says the M5 Vision Pro is rated for 2.5 hours of general use and three hours of video playback. That last one is especially important considering that the Vision Pro is still positioned as the best headset for long-form content thanks to its premium display. Speaking of wearing the Vision Pro for hours at a time, Apple is also introducing a new Dual Knit Band that has both upper and lower straps. That might not sound like the most mind-blowing upgrade, but having used the previous Vision Pro myself, I predict that extra support will go a long way, especially since the headset weighs between 600 and 650 grams. The band will also be sold separately for $99.

One thing you won't be getting in this generation is a discount. With the M5 and upgraded head strap, the price this generation will remain the same—which is to say, $3,500. That's a heck of a lot of money for a headset, but if you're in the market for a very expensive toy and have the cash to spare, this Vision Pro is shaping up to be the best, most performant one you can buy.

You can preorder the M5 Apple Vision Pro starting today, and the headset hits shelves on Oct. 22.

Apple's 3nm M5 is here


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Cupertino just launched its 5th-generation Apple silicon, the M5 chip, with the company saying that it has embedded a neural accelerator in each GPU core, allowing it to run AI workloads much faster. Aside from that, Apple says that the base M5 chip now has a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU, giving the newer processor two extra cores in both the graphics and general compute departments compared to the previous generation's entry-level SoC.

“M5 ushers in the next big leap in AI performance for Apple silicon. With the introduction of Neural Accelerators in the GPU, M5 delivers a huge boost to AI workloads,” Apple Senior Vice President of Hardware Technologies Johny Srouji said. “Combined with a big increase in graphics performance, the world's fastest CPU core, a faster Neural Engine, and even higher unified memory bandwidth, M5 brings far more performance and capabilities to MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Apple Vision Pro.”

Although it still uses 3nm technology from TSMC, the N3P process node used on the M5 (versus N3E on the M4) delivers improved capability through slightly higher transistor density. The company says that it has four times the peak GPU performance when it comes to AI processing over the M4, and that it offers up to 45% better graphics quality, plus third-generation ray tracing capability. There's also a 30% bump in memory bandwidth, with the speed going from 120GB/sec to 153GB/sec in the M5, and, of course, a 15% improvement in multithreaded performance.

Apple's press release mostly focuses on the chip's better performance in artificial intelligence workloads, but we're also hopeful that these numbers will translate to a better gaming experience on the Mac. Unfortunately, we don't know how the chip will perform compared to its competitors from AMD and Nvidia in the 14-inch MacBook Pro, as we haven't seen benchmarks yet. However, a leaked Geekbench result of an M5-powered iPad Pro showed the base M5 matching the M4 Max and beating every other competitor in the single-core test.

Those who want to be on the latest, cutting-edge Apple hardware can now pre-order the Apple M5 chip inside the MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Apple Vision Pro. The company expects these devices to ship on the 22nd, with in-store availability arriving on the same day.

Those who are already on Apple M3 or newer should wait for third-party benchmarks to appear, just so they know if the M5 is worth upgrading to or if they should wait a couple more years. We also don't have the Pro and Max versions of the M5 (or the M4 Ultra) just yet, but the company typically waits a few months before releasing them to the public.

Apple's top-end iPad models will be first in line to showcase Apple's more powerful silicon, just as the iPad Pro with M4 did last generation. The new M5 iPad Pro is thin—even slimmer than the latest iPad Air—and it packs the same tandem OLED display and 11- and 13-inch flavors. It may essentially be a spec bump over last year's Pro model, but if you were planning on running endless tiled windows with iPadOS 26, that still makes it your best bet.

The new M5 chip is the highlight. It promises faster AI performance than its M4 predecessor thanks to new neural engines built into each of the 10 GPU cores. That could lead to 3.5 times better performance when using apps that leverage AI. The new iPad Pro also includes what appears to be the same 10-core CPU—with four performance and six efficiency cores—as the new MacBook Pro 14 with M5. This means an enhanced ray-tracing engine is coming to Apple's tablets, and that the new iPad Pro could be slightly better than the M4 silicon at 3D rendering.

Beyond the chip bump, the new iPads now support options for Apple's own optional C1X cellular modem and N1 wireless chip that debuted in the iPhone 17. Apple also promoted similar memory write and read speeds to the M5 MacBook Pro 14. Memory bandwidth has jumped to 150GB per second, which should make multitasking slightly faster on the new version than it was on the 2024 iPad Pro. Otherwise, the 11- and 13-inch models both support WiFi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread connectivity.

Why do you need a more powerful Apple tablet? Well, beyond the creative apps that require more horsepower, Apple promoted that the latest updates to iPadOS would enable users to have multiple apps on their screens at once. You'll still find your workspace constrained—even if you opt for the larger screen—but if you were planning on using your tablet for multitasking with several intensive programs running in the background, you may be better off with the more expensive iPad.

The 11-inch model of the new M5 iPad Pro starts at $1,000; you'll need to shell out $1,300 for the 13-inch version. Each comes with 256GB of storage at base, and if you jump for the 2TB options, prepare to spend $2,000 or more. That's without opting for 5G connectivity, the $130 Apple Pencil Pro, and the $300 Magic Keyboard. All options start shipping Oct. 22

ASML has enough. For now.

The chief financial officer of ASML has told Bloomberg that the lithography giant is well prepared for China's export controls regime on rare earth elements and technologies for their mining and refining. The company has long lead times for its advanced tools, so it has plenty of raw materials in stock to support short-term demand from its clients. What happens after the company's reserves deplete is something unclear, though.

"We have long lead times, and therefore, also in our supply chain, we make sure that we have the materials in that we that we need for the next couple of months," said Roger Dassen, CFO of ASML, in a conversation with Bloomberg.

Under the new export control rules China imposed last week, companies have to get an export license to ship such rare earth materials as holmium, thulium, or ytterbium, or products based on these materials, from China's Ministry of Commerce. Furthermore, China imposed its export controls beyond its own borders on products containing rare earth materials originating from China if their value content within that product is more than 0.1% starting December 1, 2025.

This decision of the Chinese government could essentially stop all the supplies of all rare earth materials and products containing them across the world, something that could harm ASML, which uses a number of them inside its DUV and EUV lithography systems, metrology tools, and inspection tools.

However, Dassen downplayed the possibility of halting production after December 1, saying that the company's supply planning and long production cycles give it enough flexibility to absorb temporary disruptions. Meanwhile, the company now has over a month to buy rare earth materials or components containing them before the new export controls regime is enacted.

Speaking of China, ASML re-emphasized that it expects demand from its customers in the People's Republic to drop in 2026 due to the revocation of fast-track VEU license exemptions for Micron, Samsung, SK hynix, and TSMC, as well as softening demand from local chipmakers.

"When we look at China, we believe that the demand of our Chinese customers is going to be significantly lower in 2026 than it has been in 2024 and 2025 when we had very strong business there," said Christophe Fouquet, chief executive of ASML, during the company's earnings call with investors and analysts.

Everything is an Xbox now, right? If that's the case, why can't we mod our smart fridge or smart toaster with screens to transform them into the rough approximation of an Xbox gaming machine? The hard truth is that there is no unified sense of “Xbox” anymore. That's epitomized by the $1,000 Asus ROG Xbox Ally X handheld. It's the first piece of real gaming hardware with an Xbox name to roll out in five years. Despite the moniker, it's far more of a PC than it is any flavor of Xbox console. And thanks to Microsoft's efforts to fix Windows for a small screen, it's one of the best handheld PCs yet.

The ROG Xbox Ally X can certainly compete with Valve's Steam Deck, and it can do so without worrying about kernel anti-cheat compatibility. The one point it can't compete on is price. At $1,000, the ROG Xbox Ally X will seem like an overindulgent splurge that won't net you the ease or comforts of a true-blue console. And though it has better graphics potential than Valve's handheld, maximizing its capabilities requires coaxing.

If this is what we can expect from “Xbox” going forward, then console gamers had better get used to their new PC playground—whether that means adjusting power and graphics settings or dealing with Windows' penchant for bugs and missing settings. But it also means a cleaner, more gamer-focused experience than any other handheld Windows device released over the past several years can match.

Asus ROG Xbox Ally X

It's the first step on a long road to reinventing the Xbox brand. In the meantime, it's one of the best handheld PCs you can get, despite one glaring bug.

Pros

Cons

The real innovation of the Xbox Ally is the new “full screen experience,” or FSE. The built-in software finally alleviates the excruciating experience of forcing Windows 11 desktop to run on a 7-inch screen. Now, a hit of that newfangled Xbox button pulls up most (but not all) of the features and apps you need. Even better, you can access games across the most popular game launchers with a few quick taps. Plus, the device promises better performance on this version of Windows. In our tests, that proved true compared to devices with similar specs.

The new UI is imperfect, and the software is far from complete. You'll still find game launchers or incongruous settings that require you to muddy your screen with your grubby fingerprints. There are options missing—some are still stuck behind Windows settings—and I've experienced concerning issues with the device depleting standby power, as if leaking juice like sand through an hourglass. Since this handheld has the entire weight of Microsoft's gaming arm behind it, I hope updates come swiftly and that the FSE makes its way to more handhelds than just the one bearing Microsoft's Xbox logo.

Still, this isn't the Nintendo Switch 2 of the Xbox brand. The Xbox Ally is the kind of device to make me imagine what a true merging of PC and Xbox could be. It could prove an expensive disaster—or a glorious (but still expensive) shift to the entire gaming landscape.

Xbox told me that Microsoft and Asus started working together shortly after the launch of the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X to craft the new handheld. What, can't you tell? It's the two prongs on both sides of the device that the two partners in crime claim was modeled directly on the Xbox wireless controller. When you hold the controller and Xbox Ally up together, you'll see the similarity isn't 1-to-1—not that it matters. Each prong holds a rumble motor that feels far more present than those of other unibody handhelds do.

Despite all that, I wouldn't go as far as to say it's more ergonomic than flat body designs. I can curl my digits around a Steam Deck and play comfortably just as well as I can with the ROG Xbox Ally X.

This is still a PC. With that in mind, you have access to two USB-C ports (one being USB-4 compatible, for hooking up external devices like an eGPU) on top alongside a microSD slot and a headphone jack. There's no port on the bottom to enable a Switch-like dock. In fact, all your regular Steam Deck docks you bought for other handhelds may not work as well with the two grips sticking out from the body. My Steam Deck Dock from Gulikit does not fit the Xbox Ally, even though it's perfectly usable with past handhelds.

While I didn't find the grips supremely comfortable, there's another extra benefit to the controller-like design. My wrists never fell asleep as I lost circulation while playing while lying down, like they often do when I'm using my personal Steam Deck or Switch 2. I like to play my handhelds in bed, so the extra grips proved to be a plus despite making the handheld even thicker.

It weighs in at 1.58 pounds, which is barely any more heft than the original $800 ROG Ally X and lighter than other handheld PCs like the Legion Go lineup.

The triggers and bumper buttons also have a feel akin to the Xbox controller and its “Impulse” triggers with individual vibration motors. The sides of the device are sloped more than they are on the ROG Ally X, meaning I don't need to perform any crab claw gestures to access the LB and RB buttons. But if you were expecting the device to feel exactly like an Xbox controller, you'll end up disappointed. The A,B,X,Y layout is the same, but the look and feel of both the buttons and joysticks are far more ROG Ally than Xbox.

In the end, all that matters is if it feels good to play. I can comfortably say: It does.

Beyond the twin menu buttons, the only switch you need to care about for menu navigation is the new Xbox button found next to Asus' own Armoury Crate toggle. Hitting the button once brings up the Game Bar menu, delivering quick access to your game library across all launchers. Hitting the library button will take you to the Xbox app, where you can access Game Pass (you get a three-month Xbox Game Pass Premium subscription with the device; just don't forget to cancel) and Xbox Cloud gaming. It's here you'll also find your library of both games and supported apps, which mostly include game launchers.

Xbox gamers who have never had to even consider their consoles' power draw will now need to start thinking about TDP, or thermal design power. Despite originally telling me it was working on a replacement for power management, Microsoft left Asus' Armoury Crate software in this handheld. You can access the program from the Game Bar to tweak the power draw you're sending to the processor. More TDP means better performance at the cost of battery life. As a rule of thumb, you can stick to lower performance modes for two-dimensional or less intensive games. For everything else, shift it to “Turbo,” which ends up at 25W on battery power, or the max 35W if you have the device plugged in.

How does it fare compared to Valve's SteamOS, the Linux-based operating system made popular by the Steam Deck? Like SteamOS, the Windows FSE is a controller-first layout designed to make accessing the Xbox game store and your game library easier than it is on a desktop. Firms like Asus, Lenovo, and MSI have designed front ends to enable some easy access to your titles, but the FSE has come closest to a “console-like” feel.

When you hold down the Xbox button, you can easily swap between open apps. Want to access Steam's Big Picture Mode? It's a few taps away, with no need to muddy the touchscreen with your fingerprints. It's here you'll also see an option to open up desktop mode if there are platforms you can't access through the Xbox app.

Asus originally described the FSE to me as the system dual booting Windows. However, the improved performance is available in either variation.

As if you needed another reminder, this is a PC, not an Xbox console. A 2023 update redesigned the Xbox app so it could be navigated with a controller. There's still more work to be done on this front. You can't use the right stick to scroll. There isn't enough use of the RB and LB buttons for navigating through side-by-side menus. Beyond those hangups, what's particularly egregious is just how limited Microsoft made its first-party software. On the Linux-based SteamOS, I can drop into the desktop mode, install Emulation Station, and access it from the Steam Deck's home menu. The Xbox app will recognize apps like GOG Galaxy, Epic Games Store, Battle.net, and Ubisoft Connect, but it won't enable other apps you may load on. Accessing them requires entering the Desktop Mode. SteamOS can be tweaked to allow third-party apps to appear on the home screen, but Microsoft, being Microsoft, won't let you do the same with the FSE.

What's often lost in the rat race for better performance is the fact that small improvements mean a lot on a power-sipping device like a handheld: A 5 fps difference can determine whether a game is playable or not.

AMD's Ryzen Z2 Extreme offers only a marginal bump in performance compared with the Ryzen Z1 Extreme that hit the scene two years ago. However, the updates Microsoft made to Windows 11 also supposedly limit background tasks and boost performance. From what I experienced comparing the Lenovo Legion Go 2 to the ROG Xbox Ally X, that seems to check out. Asus' device displayed small performance gains (the delta varied by title, of course) at the same resolution and TDP.

There are areas in which Lenovo's handheld wins, of course. The Legion Go 2 contains 32GB of RAM; the Ally sports just 24 alongside its 1TB of SSD storage. The Legion also sports a massive 8.8-inch OLED display. After spending more than a week with the Xbox Ally's 7-inch IPS LCD, I miss those deeper black levels and contrast.

But for that specific upgrade, you have to drop the price equivalent of a new Nintendo Switch—$350 after recent price hikes. Lenovo's Legion Go 2 held the price record among AMD Ryzen Z-series devices with the astronomical $1,350 launch price of its AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme model. The same APU—or accelerated processing unit—can be found in the much more affordable ROG Xbox Ally.

At 1080p resolution and 35W when plugged in, I could get around 52 frames per second in Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam Deck settings. In actual gameplay, you'll see frame rates at just under 50 fps in most scenarios. At 30W, last year's ROG Ally hits around 46 fps. Other games, like Shadow of the Tomb Raider, see better uplift, with the new Xbox Ally X netting around 10 fps more than its predecessor.

Synthetic benchmarks may help us get a better idea of how much the device has improved. The Xbox Ally X netted around 400 points more than its predecessor did on 3DMark Steel Nomad Light and did 600 points better on 3DMark Time Spy. In actual gameplay, the difference is more minute, especially at the highest wattage. On some tests, notably 3DMark and games like Baldur's Gate III, the device didn't perform exceptionally better than the MSI Claw 8 AI+ running an Intel Core Ultra 258V. On others, the Ryzen Z2 Extreme underperformed Intel's mobile chip.

But the Z2 Extreme's secret weapon is that it performs better at lower wattages than previous generations did. When testing multiple games at 15-25W, relying often on AMD's FSR upscaling, I could finally achieve playable frame rates on titles like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Star Wars Outlaws. (Even on the “Turbo” profile, the device defaults to 25W when running on battery.) I found that I could run multiple current AAA games, and a few unreleased Xbox titles, at playable frame rates with just a bit of finagling in the graphics settings.

And here's another secret: You don't even need the FSE to get this boost. Xbox claimed the latest Windows build (which includes the FSE) would separately enhance the Ally's performance, and that has more than panned out. I updated the Lenovo Legion Go 2 to the latest Windows Insider Update without bothering to install the updated user interface. It displayed bigger performance improvements than the Ally had (perhaps influenced by the Legion's additional memory, which is the most significant difference between the two systems). The update moved the needle by 5 fps or more in games like Cyberpunk 2077 and up to 3 fps in Shadow of the Tomb Raider.

There's a voice in the back of my brain that's hard to ignore. It tells me to shake my fist at Microsoft in a “man yells at cloud” fashion over how simple this fix seems to have been. Are you telling me we could have had this level of gaming performance on Windows this whole time?

There's a “just fine” quality to the ROG Xbox Ally's 1080p display. It's a semi-glossy IPS LCD that lacks the “inky” qualities of OLED. I eventually tired of the large bezels surrounding the display, and the size makes it difficult to read text in RPGs like Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader and other RPGs. The screen is plenty bright indoors and in ambient light, but it's still not enough to survive direct sunlight. It didn't help that I was moving between the Asus model and the Legion Go 2 in quick succession; for some, the larger screen will probably be worth the extra heft. Still, the Ally's panel is serviceable in the same way that Apple's MacBook displays get the job done, even if it's the same damn screen every damn year and there's a big notch.

The 120Hz refresh rate, now a constant throughout three Ally generations, is more than enough for 3D titles. However, when you opt to play a game like Hollow Knight: Silksong or Hades II, and your game can easily net over 160 fps on the lowest power settings, you may start to feel a little cheated after paying $1,000 for a handheld like this.

Sound quality through the dual speakers was nothing to write home about either. Audio got plenty loud, but unlike when using the Legion Go 2, I wanted to reach for a pair of gaming headphones or earbuds more often. It wasn't terrible, and neither were the visuals, but the whole affair did feel a bit lackluster for a third-generation device in the Ally's price category.

Handhelds don't have great battery life. The Xbox Ally X, with its 80Wh battery, can claim more playable time than most other handhelds. The Lenovo Legion Go 2 and MSI Claw 8 AI+, with their larger screens and higher resolution, will sap energy faster. The Switch 2 has notoriously poor battery life, and you'll be lucky to get two hours out of that. Still, don't count on the Ally to get you through long-haul flights. I eked out around three and half playable hours of Hades II at low power before the device was begging for the sweet embrace of a power cable. More intense titles could cut another hour off that span.

The Xbox Ally X has other problems when trying to go to sleep. There were times I tried to put it to bed by hitting the power button, only to receive a gray screen and be prompted to restart my game.

There were also multiple instances in which I thought I'd successfully put my review unit to sleep via the power button, only to later find it had been sucking power for hours and eventually died. The fans would occasionally kick in while asleep, which indicates to me there's an issue Microsoft needs to fix before I can safely store the device away after a quick gaming session.

It's clear Microsoft was working on this software until the last minute, and that means there's still work needed to clear up these glitches. The issues were enough to diminish what would otherwise have been a glowing review.

High-end handhelds now cost more than $1,000. Sorry, but that's what we should expect from now until Sony releases a handheld PlayStation 6. The base ROG Xbox Ally, available in in white, features a lower-end Ryzen Z2A chip that I have not yet had the opportunity to fully test. That system is positioned to compete with the $550 Steam Deck OLED and Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS. Inevitably, because of tariffs and trade retaliations from China, we shouldn't expect many budget handheld releases aside from Nintendo's more restrictive hybrid console.

There's a part of me that believes prospective handheld buyers should hold off for the next generation. Today's Z2 Extreme devices are running on an RDNA 3.5 GPU. Tomorrow's may instead include a chip based on AMD's RDNA 4 architecture, which would mean access to AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution 4. That would offer improved AI upscaling, making games appear to run at higher resolutions than they actually are. The technology may be a staple of future consoles, and Microsoft and Sony will likely push developers to use it. The Xbox Ally X will be left out of the loop.

On the other hand, Microsoft seems keen to improve the FSE in preparation for a next-gen Xbox console. Hopefully, that means Xbox has enough incentive to fix what's broken and polish the experience to a squeaky-clean shine. Is that enough to make me abandon the Steam Deck? Maybe one day. Is it enough to give Xbox gamers the new hardware they're looking for? It'll depend on their tolerance for the PC gaming lifestyle.

A handheld Xbox has been rumored since at least the Xbox 360 era, where gaming forums were rife with speculation that Microsoft was about to face off against Nintendo's DS and Sony's PSP. If there was ever anything to the rumor, nothing came of it—until now, 20-odd years later, with Xbox's first genuine foray into portable gaming.

The Redmond giant isn't diving in solo, though—rather than its own dedicated device, Microsoft has partnered with Asus to deliver two distinct units, the entry-grade ROG Xbox Ally at $600, and the more powerful ROG Xbox Ally X at a somewhat staggering $1,000. These aren't so much Xbox handhelds as Xbox-branded handhelds, though, adding recognizable iconography onto what might otherwise be the next generation of Asus' own portables. The team-up delivers top-tier portable play—but a frequently confusing experience.

It's best to start with what the X-ROGs—not official terminology, but good shorthand for the pair—aren't. They're not Microsoft's answer to the Nintendo Switch 2, a bespoke console letting you seamlessly enjoy home-quality gaming on the go. Nor are they a take on the Steam Deck, a portable built around the Xbox ecosystem rather than your Steam library. Despite sporting the same signature “X” icon button as on an Xbox controller, these are handheld gaming PCs in Xbox drag, with all the good and bad that entails.

Both X-ROGs run a full version of Windows 11, with the Xbox app for PC's new “full screen experience” as the default user interface. Because these are PCs at heart, though, even if you're using the same Xbox account as on your Xbox Series X or Series S, your game library on the X-ROGs will only show titles included in the Xbox Play Anywhere program. Since you can only figure out what's not available by their absence, you may find a game you fancied playing on the go isn't an option. Along with the difference in how the library is sorted and filtered, it's not the smoothest transition for console players.

The overall UI also feels more cluttered than a handheld should, with a home screen that shows your recently played games above a bunch of “Featured” offers, a row of titles recently added to Game Pass, and more. It's a far cry from the stark, minimalist elegance of the Switch 2, highlighting how much is left to be desired in optimizing the Xbox for the handheld form.

Unfortunately, Microsoft is also crow-barring AI features in, with a new Gaming Copilot assistant (also coming to the desktop PC Xbox app). It's pitched as “your personal gaming sidekick,” recognizing what's happening onscreen and responding to voice inquiries for help on parts you're stuck on. It speaks in one of four “personalities,” including a cringey “heroic”—it's detestable, but thankfully optional, so I quickly deactivated.

Running Windows under the Xbox hood also means frustrations when it comes to software updates—is it just the Xbox app that needs an update or the whole system? Should you go through the Windows App store or the Windows Update tool? Will a future system update break your games? It's all a lot more convoluted than simply turning a console on and playing a game. And, while you can swap to a full Windows desktop view at any time—and even connect a mouse if you don't fancy battling through Windows' endless menus and submenus with the X-ROGs' thumbsticks or touchscreens—finding exactly what setting may need fiddling with when you just want to play a game can be a chore.

However, because the X-ROGs are fundamentally regular PCs, they're a lot more versatile than Nintendo's or Valve's efforts. Not only can you play media, browse, or do anything else you might do on a PC (even Office tasks, if you hate joy), but you can install any other PC gaming client—Steam, Epic, GOG, and more are all available. Better still, the Xbox app aggregates all games installed on the system into one library view, regardless of where they originate. You can even turn your ROG Xbox into an ersatz Steam Deck by running Steam in Big Picture mode (although some of its controller key bindings may not work).

The big win—pardon the pun—is that you can install mods with ease. While I've gotten a few mods running on my Steam Deck over the years, its Linux underbelly makes things trickier. On the X-ROGs, I've been able to use mods as easily as on my main gaming desktop, with no second-guessing if they'll actually work. It's a great feature that's facilitated by having standard Windows as the base.

But wait, there's a third UI player in the mix: Asus' own Armoury Crate SE software. Broadly, this is more of a device manager, with a dedicated button on both consoles to bring up a Command Center quick menu. This allows you to instantly switch power profiles, create custom control inputs, or set frame rate limits. It also offers a real-time monitor displaying useful system information like temperature, CPU and GPU performance, battery level and power drain, and the current frame rate.

However, fully open Armoury Crate and you'll find an array of far deeper controls, from granular system settings to tweaking color profiles of the LED rings that sit under each thumbstick. It also has its own Update Center—yet another to check—and its own unified library, distinct from the Xbox app's. After a week with the X-ROGs, I'm finally familiar with where functions live, but the learning curve is steep, and having essentially three central interfaces—Xbox, Windows, Armoury Crate—for a single device is ridiculous.

On this at least, the X-ROGs are no different from Asus' original ROG Ally or 2024's ROG Ally X, or even other Windows-based gaming handhelds, such as the Lenovo Legion S Go. Hopping between multiple UIs doing variations of the same thing has become a kind of jank that feels baked into the entire product category. If you're accustomed to that, you'll feel right at home with the X-ROGs, with all their foibles.

However, the Xbox branding here is likely to attract players who, while perhaps more committed than “casual” gamers, still want a slick, pick-up-and-play experience from a handheld. If you stick purely to the Xbox app, the X-ROGs can be close to that, but the more you want to get out of them, the less intuitive they are.

That's a lot to get your head around before getting started, but mercifully, it's worth it. Both the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X are significant improvements on Asus' predecessors. In fact, these might be two of the best handheld gaming PCs I've ever used—although the use case for each ends up being quite different.

At a glance, the X-ROGs might seem separated only by colorways. The ROG Xbox Ally comes in white with multi-colored A/B/X/Y face buttons, while the ROG Xbox Ally X opts for all-black with gray buttons. Both use the same 290.8 x 121.5 x 50.7-millimeter form factor, each subtly decorated with near-microscopic “XBOX ROG” lettering cascading vertically down the shell like The Matrix code. They look and feel distinctly premium, as you'd expect given their prices.

Ergonomics are superb, with angular grips feeling more like holding a conventional Xbox controller than the brick-with-a-screen of many handheld PCs. All inputs are within reach, from the traditionally asymmetrical thumbsticks to the textured shoulder buttons and satisfyingly chunky triggers. At the rear sit two macro buttons with customizable inputs. Despite being nominally heavier than a Steam Deck's 669 grams—the Xbox ROG Ally weighs in at 670 grams, the Ally X at 715 grams—the masterful design means they sit better in the hand and are more comfortable to use for long play periods.

Both models also use the same screen, a 7-inch, 1920 x 1080p, 16:9 IPS touchscreen panel with a 120-Hz refresh rate and 500-nit brightness. Buyers will want to get a screen protector—it's made of Gorilla Glass Victus, but given how often you'll poke or swipe the screen to navigate the system, added protection feels necessary. When it's not covered in finger smudges, this is a great, sharp display at its default settings, and its performance can be further tweaked in Armoury Crate, either manually or with quick-sets tailored to specific gaming genres.

However, at the prices these handhelds are coming in at, it's hard not to feel a bit shortchanged that the screen isn't OLED, even on the higher-priced ROG Xbox Ally X. These are essentially the same screens as on Asus' previous ROG Ally, and despite both X-ROGs offering a higher resolution and refresh rate, the Steam Deck OLED‘s perfect black levels and ability to deliver HDR does still give it a slight edge.

The X-ROGs more clearly diverge in function. Some differences are small—the Ally's triggers incorporate Hall effect tech, while the Ally X uses Microsoft's Impulse Triggers for more nuanced haptics. Both feature two USB-C ports at the top—and you can charge through either—but the Ally's are both USB 3.2 Gen 2 (with DisplayPort 1.4 output and Power Delivery 3.0 support), while the Ally X has one USB 4 port with Thunderbolt 4 compatibility, and one USB 3.2 Gen 2 (both with DisplayPort 2.1 out), giving more versatility.

Major distinctions come down to raw power. The Ally packs in an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor, 16 GB LPDDR5-6400 RAM, and a 512-GB SSD—no slouch, but wildly outclassed by the Ally X. The flagship model's Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme chip is an absolute beast, and it's backed up by 24 GB LPDDR5X-8000 RAM and a 1-TB SSD. The resulting difference is clear to see, both in performance and who each handheld is aimed at.

Installing Forza Horizon 5 on both, the Ally impressed initially, still meeting requirements for the game's “High” quality preset. However, the game automatically set the frame rate cap to 30 fps, while a buried setting within the Xbox app for the Ally itself (absent on the Ally X) was set to “automatically limit games to 720p” resolution. Turning that off and raising the frame rate to the 120 fps the Ally is hypothetically capable of, performance dived, resulting in slightly juddery races around Mexico. Plugging the Ally in, maxing its power profile to the 20-watt “Turbo” setting in Armoury Crate, and boosting just about every other possible metric improved things, reaching a high of 48 fps—eminently playable, but nothing amazing.

On the Ally X, however, Forza ran at a smooth 60 fps straight away, off battery. Again, lifting the frame cap to 120 fps, even the Ally X never quite hit that magic number, but it did hover around 78 to 85 fps, while plugging in and setting the console to its 25-watt Turbo max saw it occasionally crest over 90 fps. Similar performance differentials were observed on other demanding AAA games installed on each handheld, including Gears of War: Reloaded, Avowed, and Halo Infinite—the Ally struggled while the Ally X handled everything I threw at it.

The basic Ally can shine with less technologically demanding games, though. Hollow Knight: Silksong hits a consistent 120 fps, while some retro classics and indies installed via Steam—Final Fantasy IX, Dredge, and Owlboy among them—all ran without a hitch. Much like the Steam Deck itself, the Ally feels best suited to these smaller titles, which also have the benefit of not eating up the entire SSD. Forza alone required a full quarter of the Ally's storage, colossal install sizes being another reminder of a lack of optimization. Both X-ROGs use standard M.2 2280 factor SSDs, though, so they should be easily upgradable, and both support microSD cards too—again better for smaller, less demanding games to be installed on.

There's one other workaround for performance throttles or storage issues, though: cloud gaming, which is surprisingly well implemented here. Testing out Bethesda's DOOM: The Dark Ages through Xbox Cloud Gaming (other platforms such as Nvidia's GeForce Now are also accessible), it connected quickly, played without a single drop-out, and ran at a consistent 60 fps on both X-ROGs. I don't know what witchcraft Xbox has been doing backstage, but this is the best cloud gaming I've ever encountered.

Whatever and however you're playing, battery life is impressive for both X-ROGs. Even though the Ally X again has an advantage—packing an 80-Wh battery versus the Ally's 60-Wh—I regularly got around six hours' play out of both units between charges, depending on the game. Playing an hour of Hollow Knight: Silksong—again, not the most demanding title—on each took the Ally from full to 85 percent, while the Ally X dropped to 88 percent. Cloud gaming saw barely any drain on either, about 7 percent per hour, but locally installed Forza or Gears slurped up around 30 to 35 percent of a full charge on both X-ROGs in around 45 minutes. Even that's far less draining than I expected, rendering both units surprisingly viable for longer play.

Both X-ROGs stand out in the increasingly crowded field of handheld gaming PCs, thanks to strong design, comfort of use, and cross-platform versatility that outpace most of the competition. Neither model is perfect, but for its first venture into the handheld space, Microsoft gets a lot right in its partnership with Asus.

If you want a reasonably powerful gaming PC that can run small to mid-size games with ease, and even some more demanding ones in a playable if not astounding state, the ROG Xbox Ally is a great choice—especially if you're happy to turn to cloud gaming for the most demanding titles.

If you want uncompromising performance and high-end capabilities, though, the ROG Xbox Ally X is a clear winner. It breezes through everything the baseline Ally does, and delivers authentic AAA gaming to boot. It's exceptional. In doing so, it's clearly, unabashedly targeting the “hardcore” gamer—and it's going to financially bleed them for the privilege.

Those prices are by far the biggest obstacle for either model, but if you're able to splash out on a high-end handheld, these can take portable gaming to the next level.

'We clarify that MSI has never officially sold or distributed the GeForce RTX 5090 in China'


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


MSI has issued a statement clarifying that it does not sell Nvidia's RTX 5090 GPU, following a spate of rumors and a photograph circulating online depicting hundreds of MSI-branded cards at an unspecified location in the country.

Three days ago, a user on Reddit posted an image showing unattended pallets of RTX 5090 GPUs lying in a street in China. This prompted online chatter pertaining to a lack of enforcement for export controls, as the RTX 5090 is one of many high-end cards that are banned from export to China. Aware of the PR connotations of getting caught, or even accused, of dealing the GPUs in the region, MSI was quick to issue a rebuttal.

In a new statement posted on its site, the company has clarified that it had nothing to do with the RTX 5090 shipments spotted in China, and claims the global serial number tracking has confirmed they are parallel imports — when a genuine product is imported through questionable means, without the explicit permission of the parent company.

Dealers skirting export controls on high-demand GPUs remains a headache for Washington. Just recently, a Singaporean company was accused of helping smuggle $2 billion worth of Nvidia GPUs into the country. We've known for a while now that underground markets exist in the region, where cards are regularly modded with increased VRAM to make them better for AI applications.

All of this leads to a precedent where, even though Beijing shouldn't be the recipient of high-end AI cards on paper, reality begs to differ. Nvidia has made region-specific RTX 5090D and 5090D V2 models for China, but they carry neutered specs, which leads to shady, black-market shipments thriving. Nvidia has always held the position that China is an important market for the chipmaker, but that it, too, has nothing to do with how the region keeps getting its hands on banned GPUs.

 




MSI reiterated that it only sells its RTX 5090 in the U.S., Europe, and some Asia-Pacific markets, and that any unauthorized units obtained via grey channels are not covered under warranty. These illicit GPUs allegedly arrived in China through third-party resellers and retailers in overseas markets who bypassed regulations and illegally imported the cards.

While there was no word on any active investigations or whether the hardware manufacturer plans to take action, MSI did note that any products bought through non-official channels may have been resold or tampered with, and aren't eligible for warranty, repair services, or technical support. MSI is a Taiwanese company, a country that remains imperative in the ongoing U.S.–China trade war, and is an extremely sensitive region geopolitically. A significant portion of MSI's production facilities is located in Mainland China.

The GPU shortage during COVID could soon look like child's play.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AI datacenters are eating up the world's supply standard DRAM memory, NAND flash for SSDs, and hard drives. Adata chairman Simon Chen just made it extremely clear that in his three-decade tenure in the industry, he's never witnessed a simultaneous shortage of all of the aforementioned components, via a DigiTimes Asia report.

Chen goes on to explicitly state that Adata and its usual competitors aren't fighting between themselves for supply in what would be businesss as usual. Instead, cloud service providers (CSPs) — almost always AI datacenters in this day and age — are now gobbling up all available capacity of these components.

As if all that wasn't enough, Chen believes that the shortage of hard drives is incentivizing customers to try and purchase SSDs for non-volatile storage needs instead, further twisting the spiral of storage scarcity. Adata's sales team has purportedly gotten instructions to "sell sparingly" and "give priority to loyal customers" in turn.

Additionally, the inventory at upstream suppliers is charitably described as barebones, with only two to three weeks' worth of supply, down from the usual two-to-three months of capacity. In other words, that means that SK hynix, Samsung, Micron, Kioxia, and Western Digital are selling most everything they make to AI projects.

In case you're not entirely convinced of how big a deal Chen's suspicion-confirming statements are, Adata had a 11% share in the SSD market in 2024, and holds a 5% slice of the memory market. Those are small percentages, but they're for the entire world, meaning that Adata purchases memory and flash chips at large volumes and careful negotiated prices. The deals are likely done multiple months in advance, and Adata certainly would otherwise have far bigger negotiation power than, say, Joe's Discount Memory.

The company's stock price has climbed sky-high since August, and it hit a 15-year revenue high in Q2 2025. That's keeping in tandem with the general industry trend, with DRAM revenue jumping 17.1% in the past fiscal quarter, and enterprise SSD revenue boosting by 12.7%. Even CPU/GPU chipmakers are charging gigantic premiums for their top-shelf wares, too.

All of this AI-fueled demand is now affecting the supply chain for all modern consumer electronics. Most any advanced device, including phones, TVs, consoles, and cars, all need one or more of the components that are now in high demand. If you're on the fence on whether to purchase a new handset, computer, or television, you'd be wise to consider moving sooner rather than later. Even if AI isn't taking all of our jobs, it seems poised to take all of our silicon.

Rodney Scott, MBChB, MRCP, DipStat, PhD, Division Chief of Neurology, Nemours Children's Health, Delaware Valley, has received a prestigious National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director's Transformative Research Award. Dr. Scott will use the $2.6 million, five-year grant to investigate malfunctions in the brain's hippocampal region, aiming to identify patterns that could lead to shared therapies for patients with autism, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease.

"In disorders like autism, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's, the part of the brain called the hippocampus doesn't function properly. Current treatments target each disease separately, often with limited success," Dr. Scott explained.

Instead, our research will look for shared abnormal brain activity patterns across conditions. If found, we will develop novel methods of brain stimulation that could restore healthy hippocampal function across a range of disorders."

Dr. Rodney Scott, MBChB, MRCP, DipStat, PhD, Division Chief of Neurology, Nemours Children's Health, Delaware Valley

The NIH Transformative Research Awards promote cross-cutting, interdisciplinary approaches, supporting high-risk, high-reward research that could potentially create new paradigms for understanding disease and developing new therapies and preventive strategies.

Dr. Scott's project will analyze patterns of dysfunction in the hippocampus, the region of the brain that regulates memory and emotions. The research is based on the theory that autism, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's may share the same faulty mechanism-specifically, a disruption in the brain's neural networks. Through his NIH award, Dr. Scott and co-principal investigator Matt Mahoney, PhD, Principal Computational Scientist with the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, will devise living and computer models to pinpoint the disruption. Dr. Scott's research team will collect biological data, while Dr. Mahoney and colleagues will lead the effort to develop mathematical models. Together, the investigators will be able to examine a high volume of data and potentially accelerate the pace of discovery.

Dr. Scott joined Nemours Children's in 2021, continuing an accomplished career that has spanned hospitals in Zimbabwe, England, and the United States. He has made groundbreaking advances in the treatment and management of epilepsy, as well as the application of complex adaptive systems theories to neurological disease. In addition to his post at Nemours Children's, he is a Professor of Neurology and Pediatrics at Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University; and a Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Delaware.

"This high-risk, high-reward support from the NIH allows investigators like Dr. Scott to develop and rigorously test innovative ideas that are not in the mainstream," said Matthew M. Davis, MD, MAPP, Executive Vice President, Enterprise Physician-in-Chief, and Chief Scientific Officer, Nemours Children's Health. "Through this research, it may be possible to improve cognitive function and quality of life for patients with a broad range of neurological conditions, in childhood and adulthood. This project demonstrates Nemours Children's commitment to research and academic excellence in the pursuit of advancing science and improving health outcomes for generations to come."

A low-fat vegan diet that doesn't limit calories or carbohydrates could help people with type 1 diabetes reduce insulin use and insulin costs, according to new research by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine published in BMC Nutrition.

Insulin is a hormone that helps move glucose (sugar) from the blood into muscle and liver cells to be used as energy. People with type 1 diabetes must take insulin because their body doesn't produce enough. Some people with type 1 diabetes may need to take additional insulin, because they have insulin resistance, a condition in which cells don't respond well to insulin and glucose remains in the blood. Insulin resistance is strongly influenced by dietary fat, which can inhibit glucose from entering the cells.

The new research, which is a secondary analysis of a 2024 Physicians Committee study, compared the effect of a low-fat vegan diet to a portion-controlled diet on insulin use and insulin costs in people with type 1 diabetes. The analysis found that the total dose of insulin decreased by 28%, or 12.1 units, per day in the vegan group, compared to no significant change in the portion-controlled group. The reductions in insulin use in the vegan group likely reflect improved insulin sensitivity, or how well the body responds to insulin. Total insulin costs decreased by 27%, or $1.08 per day, in the vegan group, compared to no significant change in the portion-controlled group.

The 2024 study found that a vegan diet also led to an average weight loss of 11 pounds, improved insulin sensitivity and glycemic control, and improved cholesterol levels and kidney function in people with type 1 diabetes.

The new research comes as insulin prices in the United States continue to rise. Spending on insulin in the United States tripled in the past 10 years, reaching $22.3 billion in 2022, due to the increased usage and higher price of insulin, according to the American Diabetes Association. The inflation-adjusted cost of insulin increased by 24% from 2017 to 2022.

As insulin prices continue to rise, people with type 1 diabetes should consider a low-fat vegan diet, which can help improve their insulin sensitivity and reduce the amount of insulin they need, potentially saving them hundreds of dollars a year."

Older adults, especially those living with health conditions, who hold positive views about aging are more likely to engage in vigorous physical activity, according to a study led by the University of Surrey.

Surrey researchers found that how an individual's outlook on aging - whether they see it as a time of growth or decline - is a significant correlate of their physical activity levels.

The research, published on Healthcare, analysed data from 1,699 UK residents aged 50 and over, and found that positive views on aging were linked to a greater likelihood of engaging in vigorous activity. People with a higher number of non-communicable diseases - such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease - were more likely to engage in vigorous physical activity if they had a more positive view of aging.

Our research suggests that a positive outlook on aging could act as a psychological buffer, helping individuals stay active despite health challenges. Addressing people's beliefs about aging may be just as important as addressing their physical health needs, which should be considered when designing public health strategies to promote a healthy and active lifestyle."

Professor Victoria Tischler, co-author of the study and Professor of Behavioural Science, University of Surrey

The researchers propose that public health campaigns and interventions should support older people to maintain a positive attitude towards physical activity, even if they experience illness or long-term conditions. So, promoting positive views on aging can be important not only to promote health, but also to improve the quality of life in older people who experience one or more health conditions. These efforts could help older adults reframe aging not as a period of inevitable decline, but as a life stage where it is still possible to maintain an active and engaged lifestyle.

Dr Serena Sabatini, lead author of the study and visiting lecturer at the University of Surrey adds:

"The ultimate goal is to create a society where an active and engaged later life is not only possible but expected, even in the presence of health challenges."

Polyethyleneimines (PEIs) are extensively researched as non-viral vectors for gene and medication delivery because of their capacity to condense nucleic acids into nanoparticles known as polyplexes.1

Compared to viral vectors, PEIs have lower immunogenicity, higher loading capacity, and lower production costs.2

However, their clinical translation has been hampered due to low transfection efficiencies.3

The type of polyplex formation, which regulates cellular absorption and intracellular release, is an important element in managing transfection.

Effective delivery systems require polyplexes that are sturdy enough to avoid premature nucleic acid release, while remaining weak enough to release the payload at the appropriate time and position within the cell.4

Understanding the intermolecular interactions and conformational changes involved in polyplex synthesis and stability is critical for enhancing PEI-based delivery platforms. According to Mustafa et al., attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy is ideal for this application.5

It reveals molecular-level information about DNA structure and binding via vibrational modes of the phosphate backbone and nucleobases. This article shows how ATR-FTIR can be utilized to characterize polyplex production using linear and branching PEI architectures.

Mustafa et al. provide a detailed discussion of their procedures. ATR-FTIR measurements were taken using a commercially available FTIR spectrometer with a Harrick ConcentratIR2™ multiple reflection silicon ATR attachment.5

Two PEI structures were investigated: linear (LPEI, 15 kDa) and branching (BPEI, 10 kDa). Polyplexes were generated at N/P ratios ranging from zero to three in 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).

The final concentrations were three millimolar LPEI, five millimolar BPEI, and one millimolar DNA. Before measurements were taken, the samples were incubated for one hour at room temperature.

To confirm the spectrum interpretation, additional samples were generated at increasing sodium chloride concentrations (50-250 mM) to test for electrostatic interactions. All spectra were background removed, baseline corrected, and normalized.

Figure 1 shows ATR-FTIR spectra of DNA with increasing N/P ratios for LPEI and BPEI. With LPEI, the asymmetric phosphate stretching band at 1222 cm-1 shows a noticeable frequency shift as N/P rises, showing strong electrostatic binding to the DNA backbone.

This frequency shift also signals a conformational change in the DNA structure, from B to Z. Moderate alterations were found in the nucleobase ring stretching region (1400-1500 cm-1) and carbonyl band (1680 cm-1). These modifications imply that LPEI interacts weakly with DNA nucleobases.

The spectra of BPEI-based polyplexes exhibited no shift at 1222 cm-1, but a considerable intensity decrease and splitting of the 1680 cm-1 band, indicating interactions with nucleobases via intercalation, without major disruption of the phosphate backbone.

Salt screening assays supported these interpretations. Figure 2 shows that increasing NaCl reduced LPEI binding by around 70 %, consistent with electrostatic interactions. At the greatest salt concentrations, BPEI binding decreased by just 20-30 %, indicating that interactions with DNA nucleobases primarily aid binding.

This study shows that ATR-FTIR with the ConcentratIR2 accessory may successfully distinguish between binding modes in PEI-DNA polyplexes.

The 1222 cm-1 phosphate band detects electrostatic interactions between LPEI and DNA, while the 1680 cm-1 band indicates BPEI intercalation with nucleobases. These findings serve as a foundation for developing more successful non-viral gene delivery technologies.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Union (EU) announced today a new agreement to support the digital transformation of health systems and wider adoption of WHO's Global Digital Health Certification Network (GDHCN) in sub-Saharan Africa. This EU–WHO partnership will improve pandemic preparedness and accelerate progress towards better health and well-being for all.

The agreement was announced at the World Health Summit 2025 by Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems, Access and Data; Dr Mohamed Yakub Janabi, WHO Regional Director for Africa; and Mr Martin Seychell, Deputy Director-General of the European Commission Directorate-General for International Partnerships.

The GDHCN is a global system that enables countries to securely and reliably verify nationally approved digital health credentials across borders. The system builds on the European Union Digital COVID Certificate (EU DCC), which facilitated verification of vaccination, testing and recovery certification for international travelers connecting 76 countries and territories. However, only four countries from the WHO African Region-Benin, Cabo Verde, Seychelles and Togo-were able to join the EU DCC network.

Since its transfer to the WHO in 2023, the GDHCN has shown strong potential to support the digitization of the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP), commonly known as the Yellow Card, in alignment with the updated International Health Regulations (IHR). Making the most of its potential could enhance global vaccination tracking, reduce fraud, and simplify international health requirements.

Under the new joint agreement, which includes an €8 million EU grant spanning 2025 to 2028, WHO and the European Union will collaborate to bolster national efforts to advance the digital transformation of health systems in sub-Saharan Africa. WHO will provide technical and policy expertise, in collaboration with regional partners such as the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).

The EU investment is part of the Digital Health workstream of the Team Europe Initiative on the EU-AU Health Partnership, which brings together European and African stakeholders to build resilient digital health ecosystems across the continent, and aligned with the EU Global Gateway strategy.

The GDHCN supports countries in building trusted, interoperable digital health systems that directly benefit people - providing secure, portable health records accessible wherever they travel, including during health emergencies. Personal health records are managed securely by each individual country or their health system. These records cannot be accessed by other parties, including WHO.

The network is built on internationally recognized standards for privacy, data protection, and interoperability, and participation of countries is voluntary. The network fosters cross-border collaboration among countries and partners, strengthening health security today, while laying the foundation for more resilient, person-centered health systems for future generations.

Surveys of more than 1,000 Italian patients and clinicians uncover why oral steroid use remains widespread in asthma care, revealing gaps in guideline adherence, patient education, and access to advanced biologic therapies.

Study: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients with asthma: how far is clinical practice from the guidelines? Results from surveys of patients and doctors. Image credit: zlikovec/Shutterstock.com

A recent Frontiers in Allergy study examined usage patterns and barriers to adherence to oral corticosteroid (OCS) treatment guidelines for asthma in Italy. To do so, surveys were conducted with healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients.

Asthma affects an estimated 262 million people worldwide, with the highest incidence seen in children under nine. Globally, its prevalence has increased by about 15% between 1990 and 2019. In Italy alone, around 4 million people live with asthma, including approximately 200,000 with severe asthma (SA), a group that represents a substantial burden on healthcare resources and costs.

The management of SA often requires the use of long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs). Existing guidelines recommend the use of OCS only as a last option due to severe adverse effects, such as growth impairment in children and iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency. Despite this, OCS medications are commonly prescribed in asthma treatment. However, patients have their concerns, and research shows that about 44% of adults report worries about OCS use, sometimes leading them to reduce or discontinue treatment without medical supervision by HCPs. Therefore, a gap exists between clinical practice and guidelines, which needs to be examined.

To address the knowledge gap between guidelines and clinical practice concerning asthma treatment, the Respiriamo Insieme Association in Italy, in collaboration with Sanofi, conducted two surveys among HCPs (survey 1) and patients (survey 2). The current study documents the results of these surveys, which aim to reduce OCS dependence and enhance the quality of life of SA patients.

Survey 1 comprised seven closed-ended questions (six multiple-choice and one rating scale) and gathered insights into the OCS prescribing practices, barriers to proper use, potential overuse patterns, and adherence to current guidelines. Survey 2 explored patients' perspectives on awareness and involvement in treatment decisions, usage patterns, treatment adjustment and monitoring, education provided by HCPs, management of adverse events (AEs), and safety practices concerning OCS use.

A total of 366 HCPs completed the survey, and 82% preferred a 10-day OCS treatment duration. A duration of more than 21 days was preferred by 14% of HCPs, and the remaining opted for longer treatment durations. Ninety-nine percent of HCPs said that either more than 6 months of OCS use per year or 2 or 3 cycles per year was necessary to classify a patient as OCS-dependent. The remaining 1% thought a single cycle was enough. Concerning the annual cumulative corticosteroid use, 28% reported never keeping track of the total OCS dose for their patients, 40% reported doing this, 24% did this occasionally, and the remaining 8% based their calculations on prescribed OCS doses.

Twenty-seven percent of HCPs thought the maximum safe daily dose was 7.5 mg/day, while 43% put this at 5 mg/day. Twelve and 18% thought the safe limits were 2 mg/day and 10 mg/day, respectively. Regarding strategies to minimize the OCS dose in managing SA, 43% responded that changing the ICS/LABA combination was the most effective. This was closely followed by using biologic therapies (37%). More than half of the HCPs thought that a multidisciplinary approach is crucial to prevent adverse effects of OCS, and about 44% recommended monitoring visits for bone densitometry every two years.

Overall, patients and their families/caregivers completed 829 questionnaires, of which 468 belonged to patients with SA. Only two-thirds of patients with non-SA were prescribed OCS, compared with 95% of patients with SA. Around 47% of SA patients used OCS more than once, for at least two cycles per year, compared with 27% of non-SA patients. Overall, 13% of SA and 14% of non-SA patients reported having ceased OCS use. Forty-seven percent of SA patients and 24% of non-SA patients used OCS once a year or more without a valid prescription. Forty percent of SA and 31% of non-SA patients did not taper the dose when stopping, while 52% and 33% of SA and non-SA patients did, respectively.

In about 71% of SA patients, the physician involved them in the decision to take OCS, compared to 43% for non-SA patients. Physicians did not inform 45% of non-SA and 49% of SA patients about the possible alternatives to OCS, respectively. Concerning the long-term strategy, inhaler medications were common in the non-SA group, while biologics were most common in the SA group.

Twenty-two percent of non-SA patients reported being informed about adverse reactions, whereas 35% reported never being informed. Among the SA patients, 41% were informed about potential side effects, while 57% reported not being referred to a specialist. Most patients did not receive a bone health assessment. The study also found that about 40% of patients self-administered OCS at least once per year without a prescription, often due to fear of exacerbations or difficulty accessing healthcare. This reflects the ease of access to OCS without a prescription in Italy. A much higher proportion of SA patients acquired OCS without a valid prescription, relative to non-SA patients.

The findings show a significant discrepancy between guideline recommendations and clinical practice, and OCS use remains very high in Italy. Reducing unnecessary OCS use through biologic therapies could also help lower healthcare costs.

Several unmet needs and proposed systemic reforms: establishing a clearer and pragmatic definition of “OCS dependency,” improving patient education and shared decision-making, increasing access to multidisciplinary care (including psychological support), and using digital or diary-based monitoring tools to track OCS adherence and side effects.

A key limitation of the study was the inability to distinguish between respondents from pediatric and adult care settings. This may have led to misinterpretation of notable differences in OCS use between adults and children. Secondly, the study's cross-sectional nature exposes it to response bias, inaccurate self-reporting, and recall bias. Finally, the results may not be generalizable to other populations as the study was conducted on a selected set of Italian HCPs and patients.

The study underscores the persistence of high OCS use despite guideline recommendations, highlighting the need for coordinated education, standardized monitoring, and integrated psychological and specialist care to reduce unnecessary OCS exposure in severe asthma management.

Rapid and urgent action on food is needed if the UK is to reboot its flagging economy, save the NHS billions, ensure national food security, and meet climate commitments, according to a new report.

The Roadmap for Resilience: A UK Food Plan for 2050, calls for radical transformation, at a scale and pace not seen since the Second World War. It says if we do not act now, change will be forced upon us by increasing pressures and the UK will lurch from crisis to crisis, including from food price shocks, climate disasters and weakening economic productivity.

Acting now however, allows the UK to decide its own future, and must include three core transformations: more resilient farming, smarter land use, and healthier diets. Government must take the lead with "decisive and coordinated action", says the report, and proposes 10 key recommendations and a timeline to 2050.

The report is published as renewed attention is being given to global food system transformation, including through the EAT-Lancet Commission's latest report released earlier this month.

"Achieving this transformation has the power to deliver a food system where everyone in the UK has access to healthy and sustainable food," said Neil Ward, Co-lead of the Agri-Food for Net Zero (AFN) Network+, which coordinated the report, and a professor at the University of East Anglia (UEA).

Through these three transformations we can reduce pressure on the NHS and help people lead healthier and more economically active lives. Nature will flourish, emissions will fall and farming will be more resilient and secure for future generations."

Neil Ward, Professor, University of East Anglia

"Pressures from climate change, global shocks and poor diets mean significant change to our food system is inevitable over the next 50 years. However, if we act now, we still have time to shape our future, and positively impact national security, national health, economic growth and climate change. Our window to act is narrow though - if we do not, change will be forced on us by crisis," added Professor Ward.

The report had input from 150 scientists and industry professionals from across research institutes, farming, charities and the food industry, and is the culmination of three years of work by the AFN Network+, a project funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), with 3,000 members and led by a group of 11 universities and research institutes.

The report highlights that the UK food system is a significant source of national greenhouse gas emissions and will become the largest source of emissions by the 2040s. Meanwhile, poor diets cost the economy £268 billion a year in direct healthcare costs as well as indirect costs such as low economic activity, and 7.2 million people now live in food-insecure households - an increase of 80% in just three years. Adding to these challenges, the UK is vulnerable to supply chain disruptions, since it is dependent on imports for 50% of vegetables and 85% of fruit, despite these being essential to healthy diets.

The Roadmap calls for transformation in three key areas:

 

The authors set out 10 priority actions, urging the government to work in partnership with farmers, food companies and local authorities. These include:

Professor Tim Benton, Co-lead of the AFN Network+, said: "Every year of delay makes transformation harder and more costly. We call on all parties, public institutions, industry and civil society to unite to drive forwards the transformations highlighted in this Roadmap. Change is coming to our food system, but how we shape it is our choice to make."

Professor Charlotte Deane, Executive Chair of UKRI's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, said: "Agri-food remains one of the UK's most stubborn sources of emissions.

"The AFN Network+ has brought together a powerful community of research leaders and stakeholders across UK agri-food, third sector organisations, policymakers and agri-food industry professionals to tackle this challenge and now delivered a clear roadmap for change.

"Our investment has resulted in a legacy of insights which will help shape future land use and food strategy, supporting the UK's path to net zero."
The Roadmap for Resilience: A UK Food Plan for 2050 was developed by the AFN Network+, drawing on insights from across its community of more than 3,000 members. The AFN Network+ is jointly led by UEA, the University of Leeds, University of York, and the University of the West of England.

The first full-length structures of two heat shock chaperone proteins in a complex reveal the key structural region regulating their function, according to a new study from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The chaperone complex binds misfolded proteins and gives them another chance to fold correctly. This process is essential for cells because improperly folded proteins tend to aggregate, potentially causing a diverse array of diseases. However, the mechanism by which these two major heat shock chaperone proteins, Hsp40 and Hsp70, bind each other and misfolded peptides was unclear. The new structures enabled the scientists to identify how the cellular machinery works. The findings were published today in Molecular Cell.

"Heat shock chaperone proteins form the first line of defense against protein misfolding and aggregation, a precursor to many diseases," said corresponding author Charalampos Babis Kalodimos, PhD, St. Jude Department of Structural Biology chair.

We showed how these two particular heat shock chaperone proteins come together, revealing a previously unknown set of mechanisms explaining how they work in tandem, and how they can malfunction."

Charalampos Babis Kalodimos, Department of Structural Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital

Heat shock chaperone proteins are essential in most organisms, with similar versions present from bacteria to humans. Bacterial Hsp40 and Hsp70 are known to help misfolded proteins correctly refold, with decades of research into their function as chaperone proteins. The human versions of these proteins are also linked to several diseases. However, exactly how Hsp40 and Hsp90 bind a client protein and each other was unknown, because no one had been able to overcome the technical hurdles involved in capturing the massive full-length structure. 

Instead of using a single approach, the St. Jude scientists combined cryogenic electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and X-ray crystallography data to finally solve the bacterial complex's structure. They captured multiple forms of the structure, consisting of dimers (pairs) of Hsp70 interacting with dimers of Hsp40, in several different states of binding client proteins.

"Most importantly, we captured the full-length structures of the active and inhibited states, bound to an incorrectly folded protein," Kalodimos said. "But we also solved multiple smaller pieces. By assembling them together, they've given us a new model of how the Hsp40 and Hsp70 complex really functions."

Mutations in a specific region of Hsp40 are associated with an array of ailments, including many neurodegenerative diseases, but how those mutations disrupt normal functions was unknown. The region is rich in highly conserved amino acids called glycines and phenylalanines, though their exact functions were unclear. The structures revealed that this region of Hsp40 binds a client protein first, then a particular phenylalanine binds to the substrate binding site on Hsp70. That phenylalanine then pulls the misfolded protein into the substrate binding site, displacing itself, though the rest of Hsp40 remains bound to Hsp70. After the handoff, the misfolded peptide is then unfolded by Hsp70.

"We first uncovered the mechanism of handover, where Hsp40 gives the client to Hsp70 by initially tucking in a phenylalanine into the binding pocket, which subsequently transfers the client into the same site," Kalodimos said. "But then, by having structures of the complex in multiple states, we also saw how the complex releases client proteins."

The scientists found that when ATP, the energy currency of the cell, binds to Hsp70, Hsp70 changes shape, pushing the phenylalanine back into the binding pocket, which in turn pushes out the client protein and releases it into the cell. Afterward, Hsp40 leaves Hsp70 and is then available to bind another misfolded protein, starting the process again.

"We now understand mechanistically how the chaperones and protein client form this very big complex, how they are released, and how they cycle through these states," Kalodimos said. "Using that knowledge, we have a starting place to look for therapeutic interventions to compensate for disease-causing mutations, to exploit as drug targets in cancers or inspire next-generation antibiotics."

In a compelling Genomic Press Interview published today in Genomic Psychiatry, Dr. Najaf Amin unveils transformative insights that fundamentally reshape international understanding of depression genetics. The Oxford University Associate Professor, ranked among the top scientists globally in genetics and the top women in science worldwide, shares ground breaking discoveries that promise to revolutionize how researchers across continents approach major depression. With over 350 peer-reviewed publications and an exceptional h-index of 125, Dr. Amin has positioned herself at the vanguard of molecular epidemiology, challenging long-held paradigms about depression pathogenesis through innovative multi-omics approaches that extend far beyond traditional genetic frameworks.

The interview, published as part of the Innovators & Ideas series, reveals how Dr. Amin transformed early career setbacks into scientific breakthroughs that now influence research laboratories from Europe to Asia. Her journey from Pakistan to becoming one of Oxford's leading molecular epidemiologists exemplifies the power of perseverance in advancing global medical knowledge. When traditional genome-wide association studies failed to produce significant results for depression, Dr. Amin pioneered alternative approaches that have since yielded extraordinary discoveries benefiting researchers and patients worldwide.

Dr. Amin's identification of the RCL1 gene mutation represents a watershed moment in depression research, opening entirely new avenues for understanding the disorder's biological mechanisms. This discovery connects primate-specific interlaminar astrocytes to depression pathogenesis, providing researchers worldwide with novel therapeutic targets previously unexplored. Her work challenges the conventional view of depression as primarily a neurotransmitter imbalance, instead revealing it as a systemic disease involving multiple bodily systems.

The scope of her contributions extends beyond single gene discoveries. Leading the most extensive published studies on epigenomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiome in major depression, Dr. Amin has identified 124 metabolites associated with the disorder, with 49 being entirely novel discoveries. These findings, published in prestigious journals including Nature Communications and JAMA Psychiatry, provide the international scientific community with crucial biomarkers that could revolutionize diagnosis and treatment approaches globally.

The interview reveals Dr. Amin's paradigm-shifting perspective on depression as fundamentally a systemic disease rather than purely a brain disorder. This conceptualization transforms how researchers worldwide approach the condition, encouraging investigation of immune system disturbances, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction, oxidative stress, and metabolic perturbations. Her integrative approach, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and single-cell analysis, provides unprecedented molecular insights that benefit laboratories across continents pursuing personalized medicine approaches.

Dr. Amin emphasizes the critical importance of understanding feedback loops among biological, psychological, and social factors in depression development and maintenance. This holistic view influences treatment strategies globally, moving beyond one-size-fits-all models toward personalized interventions tailored to individual biological markers, life histories, and environmental contexts. The implications extend to public health policies worldwide, as her research demonstrates why depression contributes to higher morbidity and mortality through its effects on multiple physiological systems.

The interview provides intimate glimpses into the personal challenges that shaped Dr. Amin's scientific philosophy and resilience. Her transition from electronics enthusiast to world-renowned geneticist began with her own diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome at age 19, sparking curiosity about genetic mechanisms that would define her career. The narrative of overcoming significant personal and professional obstacles, including navigating academia as a brown woman from a developing country, resonates with scientists worldwide facing similar barriers.

Dr. Amin candidly discusses critical moments that nearly derailed her career, including the departure of her supervisor early in her doctoral studies and initial project failures that left her without publications. Her mentor, Professor Cornelia van Duijn, played a pivotal role in transforming these setbacks into opportunities for growth. This relationship exemplifies the importance of mentorship in fostering scientific excellence across cultural and geographic boundaries.

Her advocacy for equality, diversity, and inclusion in scientific grant awards and promotions addresses systemic issues affecting researchers globally. Dr. Amin's observation that she must invest "at least twice the effort" of many European counterparts to achieve comparable outcomes highlights persistent inequities requiring international attention and reform.

Looking forward, Dr. Amin outlines ambitious goals for experimentally verifying causal associations between genetic and environmental risk factors for depression. Her vision encompasses developing integrated models spanning the entire chain of causation from risk exposure to molecular perturbation to clinical outcomes. This comprehensive approach promises to benefit healthcare systems worldwide by enabling more effective prevention and intervention strategies.

The research particularly emphasizes understanding how discoveries apply across diverse populations, ensuring that advances in depression genetics benefit people regardless of geographic location or ethnic background. Dr. Amin's work on rare variants demonstrates that population-specific genetic factors require consideration in developing truly global solutions to depression treatment.

Her dedication to open-access publishing through Genomic Press ensures that these groundbreaking discoveries remain accessible to researchers worldwide, particularly those in resource-limited settings who might otherwise lack access to critical scientific literature. This commitment to scientific democratization amplifies the global impact of her research, enabling scientists everywhere to build upon her discoveries.

Dr. Najaf Amin's Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today's most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist's impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.

The brain's mechanisms for repairing injuries caused by trauma or degenerative diseases are not yet known in detail. Now, a study by the University of Barcelona describes a new strategy based on stem cell therapy that could enhance neuronal regeneration and neuroplasticity when this vital organ is damaged. The results reveal that the use of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), combined with stem cell-based cell therapies, could help in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases or brain injuries. 

The study, published in International Journal of Molecular Sciences, is led by Professor Daniel Tornero and researcher Alba Ortega, from the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences and the Institute of Neurosciences of the University of Barcelona (UBneuro). The study involves the decisive participation of a group of UB students who were awarded one of the gold medals in the international synthetic biology competition iGEM 2024, the most important international synthetic biology competition for young researchers. 

BDNF is a protein that is synthesised mainly in the brain and plays a key role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. Several studies have described its potential to promote neuronal survival and growth, findings that are now extended by the new study.

The findings indicate that BDNF can promote the maturation and increase the activity of neurons generated in the laboratory from donor skin cells. The skin cells must first be reprogrammed to become induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and then differentiated to obtain neuronal cultures."  

Daniel Tornero, UB's Department of Biomedicine and the CIBER Area for the Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED)

In this way, the study combines cell therapy with the production of BDNF in the same cells. This study confirms the beneficial effects of this growth factor in neuronal cultures derived from human stem cells, the same cells that are used in cell therapy to treat, for example, stroke in animal models.

"This strategy is being applied at an experimental level to design cell therapies and to generate laboratory models to help study brain diseases," says Tornero. When these neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are modified to continuously overexpress the BDNF protein, "we obtain more mature and active neuronal cultures, without altering the normal organization of their connections or the functional networks," explains researcher Alba Ortega.The study focuses on the more functional aspects of neuronal regeneration, such as neuronal activity and axon generation, which are directly involved in the integration of cells that are transplanted into the brain.

"In addition, cells that produce BDNF are able to attract axons — the extensions that allow communication between neurons — more efficiently. This chemo-attraction effect would be related to the production of this factor," says the researcher.

BDNF's ability to attract growing axons has been described previously. Now, the team shows this effect for the first time in neurons derived from human stem cells using a microfluidic chip system. This innovative technology — with two chambers that isolate populations of neurons with or without the ability to produce BDNF — makes it possible to grow populations of neurons communicating through small channels and thus observe precisely how they interact with each other.

"The cells that produce BDNF generate a concentration gradient in these channels, which we believe guides and facilitates the formation of neuronal projections in a specific direction," says student Santiago Ramos, representing the group of students who have contributed an innovative perspective to the conceptual and experimental design of the study.

Neurodegenerative diseases and neuronal injuries, which are increasingly frequent in the population, are one of the major challenges for healthcare systems. As the endogenous regenerative capacity of the human brain is very limited, lesions only partially recover and affected patients are often left with motor and cognitive sequelae. In this context, there is an urgent need to design strategies that complement these endogenous brain mechanisms with human stem cell-based therapies to promote neuronal repair, functional integration and more efficient recovery.

In this regard, the team plans to transfer these results to animal models, a line of research developed for some time in this laboratory to improve human stem cell therapy in ischaemic stroke lesions affecting the cerebral cortex.

The application of preclinical advances in patients will mark a turning point in the treatment of many neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are still many obstacles to implementing stem cell-based therapies and avoiding potential side effects (tumour generation, etc.). Some international clinical trials based on stem cell transplantation for the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease (in Japan, Sweden and the United States) are showing promising results.

"Although there are many challenges, progress in Parkinson's clinical trials shows that we are closer than ever to applying these therapies safely in patients with stroke or other neurodegenerative diseases," the experts conclude.

Peginterferon-α treatment exhibits low rates of the serological conversion rate of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and the negative conversion rate of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, with significant myelosuppression leading to treatment discontinuation in some patients. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may ameliorate liver inflammation and modulate immune responses. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of combining TCM with pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN) α-2b and its impact on myelosuppression adverse effects.

This study included 117 HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients who started initial antiviral therapy at Xiamen Hospital of TCM between June 2018 and January 2023. According to the treatment regimen, patients were divided into the observation group (n = 56, receiving PEG-IFN α-2b combined with Licorice 15 g, Angelica sinensis 20 g, Poria 20 g, Paeonia lactiflora 20 g, Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae 20 g, Radix Bupleurum Chinense 20 g, Mentha piperita 3 g, Ginger three slices for more than six months) and the control group (n = 61, receiving PEG-IFN α-2b alone). This study retrospectively analyzed etiological indicators, liver biochemical indicators, and blood routine tests before and after treatment.

After 24 and 48 weeks of treatment, the observation group demonstrated significantly superior outcomes to the control group in quantitative reduction of hepatitis B surface antigen, the serological conversion rate of HBeAg, and the reduction in HBV DNA quantification (P < 0.05). By week 48, the HBV DNA negative conversion rate in the observation group (46.67%) was significantly higher than that in the control group (26.67%) (P < 0.05). Regarding safety, the incidence of myelosuppression in the observation group was significantly lower than that in the control group at both 24 and 48 weeks of treatment (P < 0.05)

Real-world findings demonstrate that adjunctive TCM significantly enhances the antiviral efficacy of peginterferon α-2b in HBeAg-positive CHB patients while concurrently mitigating treatment-limiting myelosuppression.

President Donald Trump takes questions live from the White House following a presser with FBI Director Kash Patel.

President Donald Trump addressed the topic of moving FIFA World Cup soccer games out of Boston for a second consecutive day on Wednesday, after Mayor Michelle Wu made a statement expressing confidence in the current schedule. 

Boston and its surrounding communities are currently set to host seven matches when the World Cup comes to North America next summer. The slate includes five group-stage games, one Round of 32 fixture and the first quarterfinal on July 9.

During an Oval Office news conference touting his administration's crackdown on crime nationwide, Trump was asked again about Boston and crime. 

"Somebody said, 'Would we think about taking the World Cup away from Boston if they don't straighten it out?' The answer is yes. We have the right to do that with FIFA," Trump said.

Trump said the same thinking applies to the 2028 Summer Olympics, which are currently set for Los Angeles.

"So if we think that LA is gonna be bad, that applies a little bit to the Olympics, too, but we'll talk about FIFA first. You know, FIFA is very hot," he said. "If we think there's any reason that, whether it's Boston or anywhere else, that they're not doing their job, we're going to take those World Cup games and move them someplace else."

On Tuesday, Trump initially said he would consider calling FIFA President Gianni Infantino to urge having the games moved away from the Boston area over safety concerns, after a violent incident in the city last week saw over 100 people take over a street, resulting in the fiery destruction of a police car. 

Wu responded to Trump's threat in a statement to Fox News Digital on Tuesday evening. 

"Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions," she said. 

Wu made the statement after Trump called her "radical left," but also "intelligent" while making the initial threats. 

"We can take them away. I love the people of Boston. And I know the games are sold out, but the mayor is not good. There are worse than her. At least she's intelligent. You know, some are extremely low IQ. Those bother me more. She's intelligent, but she's radical left," Trump said.

"The answer is yes, if somebody's doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location,' and he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it, very easily he'd do it. And this is the right time to do it." 

Fox News Digital has reached out to Wu's office for further comment. 

Trump has previously suggested he could declare cities "not safe" for the 104-game soccer tournament and alter a detailed hosting plan that FIFA confirmed in 2022. It includes games at NFL stadiums near New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

FIFA Vice President Victor Montagliani said earlier this month at a sports business conference in London that it's the organization's decision where games are played. 

"It's FIFA's tournament, FIFA's jurisdiction, FIFA makes those decisions," Montagliani said. 

Among the seven matches that will be played at Gillette Stadium in the Boston suburb of Foxborough, there will be five group stage matches, one match in the round of 32 and a quarterfinal match on July 9. The news of so many big games was a surprise to local organizers.

"The later in the tournament, the more eyeballs," said Mike Loynd, head of Boston's World Cup organizing committee, when the schedule was announced last year. "For us, it's just a matter of excitement ... For us, it's a perfect schedule. I don't think FIFA could have done a better job."

The tournament is expected to bring $1.1 billion in local economic impact, create over 5,000 jobs, and generate more than $60 million of tax revenue throughout the region, according to organizers. They also expect that more than two million visitors will come to New England throughout the tournament's 39-day span.

Meanwhile, Wu has previously accused the Trump administration of being a party that "doesn't follow the law."

"At a time when this federal administration is already causing so much fear and harm in our communities, these threats are serious and consequential," Wu said in August.

The remarks came after the Trump administration warned it could sue or cut federal funds if cities refused to cooperate on immigration enforcement.

Kane missed a key spot kick in the 2022 quarter-final against France Julian Finney/Getty Images

Harry Kane has revealed his penalty miss against France in the 2022 World Cup was “the worst” he has felt in football but that he has used it as motivation ever since.

Kane, 32, is set to captain England at a third World Cup next summer, leading the team out in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

In the 2022 tournament in Qatar, England were 2-1 down against France in the quarter-final. With five minutes they were awarded a penalty, but Kane skied it over the bar.

Speaking after confirming qualification for 2026, Kane said that he does not think about it too often now, but that he used it as motivation to improve over the last three years.

“After another major tournament, you get over it and you get on with it,” he said. “I scored a penalty in the semi-final of Euro 2024, which was as high pressure as you are going to get.

“I always try and learn from those moments. After that penalty, I went 31 penalties, I think, without missing. I changed my technique a little bit, I improved, which I was proud of. That's what I will always try to do.”

Even after a stellar three years since Qatar, that is still his last World Cup memory, and so Kane will have to wait until June to change that.

“I'm looking forward to the next World Cup to try and put that right, to try and go further, to try and lift the trophy,” he added. “And the opportunity is always there when that is coming around. I think those moments only shape you as a person, as a player and it's definitely helped me to become a better player.”

The fact that the England captain made such an uncharacteristic error at such a crucial moment — England would have faced Morocco in the semi-final had they got there — made it so difficult for him to take.

“That was probably the worst that I have felt, in any moment,” Kane said. “Obviously I've lost finals before. To have that responsibility, it fell on my shoulders, and not being able to execute something that I've been to execute many times in my career. That was the hardest part to process and take. But as always as a sportsman, putting yourself in that situation, there's going to be moments where it doesn't quite go your way.”

Speaking on The Athletic FC podcast this week, former England goalkeeper Rob Green spoke about training with Kane as a young player and his penalty prowess.

“When he gets a penalty, he's that good — look at where he goes, his patterns, his foot movement,” Green said. “We looked at it and we went, ‘If he goes to my right, I've actually got no chance in saving it.'

“Now he's brought in the stutter as well. If you go early, you're dead, so that is just a microcosm because you stand there and you go, ‘Okay, he is the best I've seen at in certain areas.' On an angle within the ‘V' of the pitch, coming out from the goal, if he's in that area, he's the best I've seen at just finding the corner consistently.”



While this will be Kane's third World Cup, there are plenty of players in this England squad — Elliot Anderson, Djed Spence, Myles Lewis-Skelly — who have not been to a senior international tournament before.

“I just think they are the greatest tournaments to be a part of,” Kane said. “I spoke to some of the guys here who haven't experienced that yet, trying to tell them how excited they should be and it's a great thing to look forward to. For me, it's using those experiences to try and help some of the other lads and for them, it's just to go full gas and enjoy the experience.”

After steady improvement in recent years, Kane believes now is England's moment to aim to win.

The striker feels he is in the form of his life with Bayern Munich, but by the time of the next major tournament — Euro 2028, which England will co-host — Kane will be 34. He is targeting 100 England goals, having scored numbers 75 and 76 in Riga on Tuesday night, so he does not have imminent international retirement plans.

“We've been knocking on the door,” Kane reflected. “I remember talking to Gareth (Southgate) a long time ago about some of the other big nations, how you've got to get to semi-finals, to finals, it doesn't just happen overnight. You've got to keep being in those situations. And we've done that.

“But we know we're just at the bottom of the mountain still. To win a World Cup is going to be incredibly hard. We'll have to beat the biggest teams on the biggest stage. These moments, these feelings we've got together right now are important stepping stones to arriving in the summer, and being fearless against anyone.”

Trump doubled down Wednesday on his suggestion to move the games from Mass.

Trump doubled down Wednesday on his suggestion to move the games from Mass.

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu responded to Donald Trump after he suggested Tuesday that he could pull 2026 World Cup games from Gillette Stadium over "unsafe conditions" in Massachusetts, citing recent street takeovers.

Wu appeared on a podcast on Wednesday and said it would be unlikely that the games could change venues so late in the process. 

"Many, many months of planning now, much of it is locked down by contract, so no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it," Wu said.

On Wednesday, Trump doubled down on his suggestion to pull the games and on his attacks on Wu.

"Boston has a bad mayor who at least is a reasonable IQ person," Trump said. "She's got four areas that are wrong. Somebody said, would we think about taking the World Cup away from Boston if they don't straighten it out? The answer is yes, we have the right to do that with FIFA."

Boston was named a host city in 2022, with seven matches set to be played at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough. New England has been planning for the games since, estimating an $8 billion economic boost.  

"Just ongoing threats that are issued to individuals and communities who refuse to back down," Wu said.

Experts say the relocation of matches could invite legal issues. 

"Are they going to be able to recoup their losses that they already have, the contracts they've already put into place, that they already have guarantees in them?" Sports Event Management Expert Lee Esckilsen said.

World Cup host sites aren't up to Trump. The 11 U.S. cities — plus three in Mexico and two in Canada — are contracted with FIFA, which would face significant logistical and legal issues to make changes in the eight months before the June 11 kickoff.

“It's FIFA's tournament, FIFA's jurisdiction, FIFA makes those decisions,” the soccer body's vice president Victor Montagliani said earlier this month at a sports business conference in London.

Massachusetts Rep. Stephen Lynch says he is confident that the games will go on as scheduled at Gillette Stadium.

"It'll go well. I'm hoping the president won't do something silly or vengeful just to create more harm," Lynch said. 

In a meeting with Argentina's president Tuesday, Trump referred to his contentious relationship with Wu and alluded to violent car meets, including one in Boston's South End that left a marked police cruiser destroyed by fire — an incident that was part of several other similar attacks in Massachusetts over one weekend.

"I think she is hurting Boston. The answer is yes. If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, let's move it to another location, if I thought Boston was going to cause safety conditions for the World Cup," Trump said. "I could say the same thing for the Olympics."

					Philadelphia local news: Neighborhoods, politics, food, and fun				

Philly's local host committee for the 2026 FIFA World Cup unveiled its volunteer center in the East Market's Fashion District mall on Wednesday. 

Located in a two-story, 18,000-square-foot space that was previously used for events like the Banksy immersive exhibition, it will serve as the city's administrative hub for the tournament. It will also be the headquarters and main waiting point for volunteers, before they're sent out to key locations during the tournament — in and around Lincoln Financial Field, for sure, but also at the Lemon Hill fanfest, Philadelphia International Airport and other popular transport locations for the games.

Aubrey Walton, FIFA's executive director of host cities, said that it was one of the first volunteer centers to be fully operational across all 16 host cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

“Philly continually sets the bar for other host cities because you understand something fundamental,” she said. “Volunteers aren't just helping run the tournament. They are the tournament.”

The space is where tournament volunteers likely will spend most of their time while working on the tournament, and it comes packed with ways to avoid boredom during their down time. The walls are covered with tournament factoids and vibrant colors. There are TV screens, and tables for foosball and Teqball — a soccer-table tennis hybrid game. Displays that highlight the soccer history of Philly and the nation, much of it provided by the FIFA Museum, are all over. 

“This is really the clubhouse for the volunteers — the mothership, if you will,” said Alison Grove, Philadelphia Soccer 2026's volunteer lead.

Philadelphia Soccer 2026 said that the city had received 26,000 applications from the over 1 million submitted to FIFA during the volunteer application period. It was among the top in volunteer applications, FIFA said. Over 50% of the volunteer applicants for Philly were from outside the country.

After an interview and vetting process, which begins tomorrow, Philly plans to select just over 3,000 volunteers to train for the tournament.

Philly was part of FIFA's dress rehearsal for the World Cup, hosting eight games this past summer in the FIFA Club World Cup. Many of the volunteers at that tournament applied for next year's event and joined the “starting lineup” that will help screen and train the new applicants.

Among them was West Philly resident Mosab Mohammadi, who helped with the center launch.

“It really was an amazing experience full of memories,” he recalled about the past summer. “Meeting a lot of people from different backgrounds. We had a lot of international people, even at the Club World Cup. And we're expecting even more people at the World Cup happening next year.”

The tournament plans to have more than 65,000 volunteers involved across all its venues, the most ever for any sporting event.

“That's what's going to make the World Cup so special,” said City of Philadelphia Director Michael Newmuis. “Not just the matches, but the thousands of volunteers who will greet visitors, answer questions, share directions and show the world what Philadelphia is all about.”

The World Cup begins in Mexico City on June 11 and ends on July 19 at New Jersey's Metlife Stadium. Philly's Linc will host six of the tournament's 104 games, including a round-of-16 match on July 4 that will coincide with the country's semiquincentennial celebrations. Overall, FIFA expects 6.5 million fans to travel across the globe for the festivities. The first lottery draw for tickets just concluded and the second takes place  Oct. 27-31, with the time slots for the randomly selected applicants held in mid-November. High ticket prices and FIFA's early implementation of dynamic pricing and a “right to buy” token system have already drawn criticism.

June 11, 2026, will also be the opening day of Philly's fanfest location at East Fairmount Park's Lemon Hill, where fans without game tickets can watch a live broadcast of the action, along with music, food and other entertainment. Construction to enhance Lemon Hill began in September.

Grove said the hosting team is focused on creating a legacy that lasts long after the tournament is over.

“The World Cup is huge, but it's a moment in time. It takes years of preparation to bring it here and then they move on,” she  said. “So, what do we have to show for it afterwards? We're going to have a spectacular new park at Lemon Hill where we're hosting the fan festival. We're going to have new places to play and people to teach kids how to play soccer across the city and across the region.”

FIFA also contributed to that legacy with a $1 million donation, something it did for all 11 host cities for the Club World Cup. FIFA President Gianni Infantino said the money should go to soccer facilities in areas of need and activities with local associations.

Part of that legacy also involves helping to revitalize the Market East corridor, a section of the city that has struggled to thrive for decades and was the center of a tumultuous, failed bid to build a new arena for the Philadelphia 76ers.

“Our hope was to really be a catalyst for that, to set an example, inspire activation for certainly next summer, but in years to come,” Grove said. “We really hope that this provides a lasting legacy here on East Market and creates that turn that we've all been looking for.”

Part of that effort will be a food voucher program for volunteers to eat at restaurants in the area, Grove said.

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — From the moment Mauricio Pochettino named his 26-man squad for the United States' two World Cup tuneups this month, he repeated variations of the same message.

"Nobody's place is guaranteed," the coach said again the day before Tuesday's come-from-behind win over Australia that concluded the October international window.

Some questioned this approach. The argument against it, Pochettino acknowledged after Haji Wright's two goals led the Americans past the Socceroos, was that he needed to pick a starting lineup and stick with it to build continuity with just two more training camps left before the Argentine must pick his roster for the 2026 World Cup co-hosted by the U.S. next summer.      

Tuesday's victory validated Pochettino's strategy.

The former Chelsea, PSG and Tottenham manager rotated out more than half of his starting lineup from last week's 1-1 draw with Ecuador, and was rewarded. With star attacker Christian Pulisic forced to the locker room in the first half with what was later revealed to be a hamstring issue, the Americans overcame a 1-0 deficit for their first comeback victory in Pochettino's tenure.

"That's not a coincidence," the coach added.

Reserve midfielder Cristian Roldan set up both goals with beautiful passes to Wright, who was making his first start under Pochettino. Wright took his rare opportunity to start with aplomb. His second goal was particularly classy, and it could go a long way toward helping the big striker make his second consecutive World Cup trip.

"They've got fantastic players, and I'm sure these players will keep growing with this manager," Australian boss Tony Popovic said of the U.S. squad. "And I'm sure they'll have a large pool of players to choose from. I'd be pretty confident if I was a USA fan at the moment."

Slowly but surely, belief is growing among the American players, too.

"It gives us confidence knowing that even without one of our best players, we can continue to score goals against top teams," said U.S. defender Chris Richards.

This month's opponents were certainly that. Ecuador finished second in South America's World Cup qualifying tournament. The Aussies arrived riding a 12-game unbeaten streak dating back more than a year. They, too, will be back for the 48-team main event next June.

All three U.S. goals this month came without Pulisic on the field. Pochettino's side was also minus several other projected starters, including 2022 World Cup captain Tyler Adams and injured fullbacks Sergiño Dest and Antonee "Jedi" Robinson.

Captain Tim Ream was rested on Tuesday. So was Folarin Balogun, who had scored in each of his two previous appearances and eventually came on as a second half substitute.

In the thin air at Dick's Sporting Goods Park, the understudies got the job done.

But a perfect performance it wasn't. The goal the Americans allowed was weak. Richards and Roldan both admitted that they should've been quicker to react to the danger.

"In the World Cup, if you start the game in the way that we started and concede a goal like this, then it's difficult to have another chance," Pochettino said. "In all areas, we need to improve."

Still, the response was encouraging.

"After getting scored on, it was kind of like the punch that we needed to wake us up. A lot of teams would crumble, especially because it's a friendly,"Richards said. "People say they don't mean anything, but for us, it means everything. 

"Going into a World Cup, we want to win as many games as possible. We had to fight. We just kind of needed that wake-up. I bet they probably regret waking us up like that."

Wright was a worthy Man of the Match. But the award could've easily gone to Roldan, the 30-year-old Seattle Sounders veteran who had not played for the USMNT in more than two years before being recalled last month. Known as a glue guy, Roldan proved Tuesday that he can help on the field as much as in the meal room.

"I'm a player that doesn't necessarily get on the stat sheet a whole lot," said Roldan, who was an unused sub at the last World Cup in Qatar. "To contribute in that way, it's obviously amazing."

The U.S. will look to build on the win when they reconvene in the Philadelphia area next month for another pair of exhibitions.

"The next two games are going to be very difficult, like Ecuador and Australia," Pochettino said. "Paraguay and Uruguay are two very good teams, very competitive. And I think they are going to help us to continue growing."

Who starts those matches is anyone's guess.

"I think I have to continue to perform, Wright said when asked if he felt he'd helped make his World Cup case with the two goals. "If I just shut off now, chances will probably diminish. But I'm happy that it happened. And I try and build off that."

That's the idea.

"I am happy," Pochettino said. "I am not satisfied.

"I'm pleased, but I wanted more," he continued. "I wanted to see more. I wanted to perform better. I wanted to see individual players doing better. But that is my competitive blood. Because I always want to win, but I want to play better."

Trinity Rodman, one of the scoring stars of the Olympic gold medal run in Paris last year, is returning to the U.S. women's national soccer team in time for its match at Rentschler Field on Oct. 26.

Rodman, who scored three goals at the Olympics, including a game-winner in the knockout stage against Japan, has been sidelined much of the last 15 months managing recurring back injuries. But she has returned to her pro team and was called up to the 26-player USWNT roster announced Wednesday by coach Emma Hayes.

“We are extremely excited to get back together with the team,” Hayes said as the roster was revealed on Wednesday. “There has been a big gap from July until now and we've watched many club games. Now, it's time to start the build toward qualifying for the 2027 World Cup. We want to maximize every minute we have together, push the players, and keep the momentum going. These three fantastic games ahead of us will help us do that.”

From a modest beginning in CT, Patrick Agyemang is returning home a soccer sensation with USMNT



The U.S. team has three friendly matches lined up: Portugal on Oct. 23 in Pennsylvania and again in East Hartford on Oct. 26, then New Zealand in Kansas City on Oct. 29.

Stratford's Alyssa Naeher, who retired after a history-making career as America's goalkeeper, will be honored before the game at Rentschler at 4 p.m., following the U.S. men's deaf national team's friendly match against Germany, which starts at 1 p.m.

Rodman, 23, the daughter of former NBA star Dennis Rodman, turned pro in 2021, joining the Washington Spirit in 2021. She has been with the USWNT since 2022, making the 18-player roster for the Olympics.

Her back injuries kept her out until April 2025, when she scored a goal for the U.S. in a win over Brazil, and a recurrence kept her out until recently. But Rodman has five goals in 11 games since returning to the Spirit.

“When she came in in April, I think she really felt she was in a good place, but the reality was having so much adrenaline got us through that game,” Hayes told reporters on a Zoom call Wednesday. “But afterwards, that reality hit home that there were some issues in her back that were unresolved and, collectively with club and country, we took the time to say, look, we've got to get it right for the long term. And I think that club and country collaboration has really put her in the position she's in right now.”

CT's Alyssa Naeher posts third straight shutout as US women's soccer team clinches gold



Over her career, Rodman has played 47 games with USWNT, scoring 11 goals.

Hayes gave many of her European pro players a break from action during the summer, but has reassembled most of her top players for this game in East Hartford, in which she will probably have 23 active. The rest of her roster:

Forwards: Michelle Cooper, Catarina Macario, Trinity Rodman, Yazmeen Ryan, Emma Sears, Ally Sentnor, Alyssa Thompson.

Midfielders: Sam Coffey, Lindsey Heaps, Claire Hutton, Rose Lavelle, Sam Meza, Olivia Moultrie, Jaedyn Shaw, Lily Yohannes.

Defenders: Jordyn Bugg, Emily Fox, Lilly Reale, Tara McKeown, Avery Patterson, Emily Sams, Emily Sonnett, Kennedy Wesley.

Goalkeepers: Claudia Dickey, Mandy McGlynn, Phallon Tullis-Joyce.

Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed he could take World Cup matches away from US cities he deems “unsafe”. Here's what he said – and what powers he does and doesn't have

Which time? Tuesday was the second time Trump has threatened to take away World Cup games from US host cities on the basis of their political leadership or opposition to his policies. However, it's important to note that this suggestion of moving games is not something Trump has suggested organically, of his own volition. In both cases, the US president was responding to leading questions centered around the idea of moving games. 

On 25 September in an Oval Office event, a member of the White House press corps asked Trump about cities that have demonstrated against Trump's use of federal agencies for immigration and crime crackdowns. The reporter mentioned Seattle and San Francisco as two cities that have seen demonstrations, and pointed out that both cities are World Cup hosts (though San Francisco is not a host city, but part of the San Francisco Bay Area that will host games at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara). The reporter then asked Trump if the demonstrations could result in the loss of World Cup games from those host venues. 

“I guess, but we're going to make sure they're safe,” Trump said. “They're run by radical left lunatics and that don't know what they're doing.” 

Later Trump said that Chicago would be safe for the World Cup after he sends in federal agencies in a similar manner as Washington DC. Chicago is not a 2026 World Cup host city. 

“If any city we think is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup … we won't allow it to go to it. We'll move it around a little bit,” Trump said. 

Three weeks later, on 14 October, Trump was asked about another host city, Boston, even though the games themselves will be held in suburban Foxborough, Massachusetts. Towards the end of that day's press event, a reporter asked Trump about a recent “street takeover” in Boston that saw police officers attacked and a police car set aflame, and if the concerns raised by the incident could result in the revocation of hosting duties for next year's expanded 48-team soccer tournament. The reporter also asked if Trump would work with Michelle Wu, the Democratic mayor of Boston, to address the issue.

“We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. “Their mayor is not good … She's radical left, and they're taking over parts of Boston. That's a pretty big statement, right?”

Street takeovers, a social media-driven phenomenon that sees large crowds of people gather on city streets late at night to perform stunts in cars, have been a repeated nuisance in American cities since the Covid-19 pandemic shutdowns. Recent such gatherings have turned violent in Massachusetts, including in Boston. However, the gatherings are generally not seen as being tied to any particular political ideology, nor have they been touted as a large-scale safety concern for World Cup attendees. 

“If someone is doing a bad job, and I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni [Infantino], the head of Fifa, who is phenomenal, and say let's move it to another location,” Trump said on Tuesday. “And he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it. Very easily, he'd do it.”

Later in that same event, Trump for the first time broached the possibility of moving the 2028 Olympics from Los Angeles as well. 

“If I thought LA was not going to be prepared properly, I would move it to another location if I had to,” he said. “On that one I'd probably have to get a different kind of a permission, but we would do that.”

In short: No. At least not unilaterally. In the World Cup's case, the host city agreements are signed between Fifa, soccer's global governing body, and the local municipalities. Though the deal involves a public government, it is essentially a private business deal, and the US president does not have authority to cancel it on his own.

That said, Trump can apply pressure to the various parties to back out of the deal if he is truly committed to removing games from the cities in question. That could include withholding federal funding from the cities as he has for various other aspects of American life. It could also include an appeal to Fifa president Gianni Infantino, who has carefully cultivated a close relationship with Trump since the US president's return to office.

Theoretically, yes. We can say this with relative surety thanks to Seattle, which released the host city agreement it signed with Fifa. Within that agreement there is a clause (4.5, to be exact) that addresses the possible revocation of host city selection. The clause essentially states that by agreeing to be a World Cup host city, Seattle also agrees to do a number of different (and often expensive) things to increase public safety, including the deployment of additional security measures and transportation methods, plus the assumption of various financial liabilities.

Fifa could in theory point to that clause as reasoning for revoking Seattle's status as a World Cup host city if it feels like safety standards are woefully behind. It's hard to imagine it being all that likely, though. Any World Cup is a gigantic logistical affair, let alone one spread across three countries and 16 host cities featuring more teams than ever before. It's hard enough for Fifa to create the match schedule and oversee teams' travel. Introducing a reduction in venues, or a change in venues, or multiple of them, would be a gargantuan undertaking so close to the actual event. It's easy to assume it would be the subject of legal action on behalf of the host city as well. 

So far, it has been mostly promotional and/or threatening in nature. Trump convened a World Cup task force earlier this year headed by Andrew Giuliani, with a stated mission of “facilitat[ing] comprehensive planning, organization, and execution of the largest sporting events in the history of mankind.”

The federal government also has a role in approving visas for visitors from other countries, but processing times for those have ballooned to such a level that many fear that they won't have visas approved in time for the games themselves. 

There is also the public safety aspect. One can presume that FBI agents and potentially those from Homeland Security and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) will be dispatched to World Cup host cities with the stated intention of providing an additional layer of security on top of local police.

So far, Fifa president Gianni Infantino has said nothing publicly about Trump's threat. He did, however, find time to travel to Egypt to be alongside Trump at the Gaza summit – a curious move for someone whose role in the world is nominally about sports. 

Fifa vice-president Victor Montagliani, a Canadian, was far more direct speaking at a London conference in early October, responding to Trump's comments about Seattle and San Francisco. 

“It's Fifa's tournament, Fifa's jurisdiction, Fifa makes those decisions,” Montagliani said. “With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans. That's the beauty of our game, that it is bigger than any individual and bigger than any country.”

A Fifa spokesperson told Politico “Safety and security are of the utmost importance at all FIFA events worldwide and it is ultimately the government's responsibility to decide what's in the best interest of public safety. We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to fulfill all necessary requirements for a successful 2026 World Cup.”

Outside of Fifa, Wu responded to Trump's threat by pointing out that much of Fifa's host city agreements are “locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it.

“We're in a world where for drama, for control, for pushing the boundaries … ongoing threats … are issued to individuals and communities who refuse to back down and comply or be obedient to a hateful agenda.”

Only in cases of extreme and/or unexpected health and safety concerns, war, or other political disturbance. The 2003 Women's World Cup was the last senior-level tournament with that name to be moved – it was originally due to be held in China but was shifted to the US due to that year's Sars outbreak. 

Fifa also pulled the 2023 Under-20 World Cup from Indonesia after several members of that country's government and large sections of the populace opposed the inclusion of Israel in the tournament. Indonesia does not maintain formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has broadly supported Palestine. Indonesia later hosted that year's U-17 World Cup after Peru pulled out of hosting. 

The Olympics have been canceled due to wars or postponed a year in the case of Covid-19 and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but they have not changed host cities since 1908, when the eruption of Mount Vesuvius forced the Rome games to decamp to London.

Likely because he has made that topic a feature of his administration. It is the guise under which he has deployed the national guard, Ice, and other federal agencies to Washington DC, Chicago and other cities. The fact that safety is a genuine and justified concern at any major gathering of people – especially one as vast as the World Cup – makes it an easy line to fall back on for his administration.

That'll be the real test, won't it? When Washington has intervened in many other aspects of American life, the targeted institutions have often complied or tried to negotiate. It remains to be seen if Fifa or the IOC will take that path – if indeed Trump decides to pursue this at all.

Trump claimed Fifa president could ‘easily' move games

Wu says Trump comments are ‘targeting Boston values'

The mayor of Boston, Michelle Wu, implied the city was ready for a face-off with the US president Donald Trump over his claim he could order Fifa to remove World Cup games from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, 22 miles south-west of the city.

Wu appeared on local podcast “Java with Jimmy” on Wednesday to respond to Tuesday's criticism from the White House, which labeled the Democrat as “radical left”. Trump threatened he would make a call to the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, if Boston did not “clean up its act”.

“Much of it is locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it,” Wu said. “We're in a world where for drama, for control, for pushing the boundaries … ongoing threats … are issued to individuals and communities who refuse to back down and comply or be obedient to a hateful agenda.

“We are going to continue to be who we are and that means, unfortunately, we are going to be in a conversation in a way that is targeting Boston's values,” Wu added. “Ten toes down for Boston.”

Infantino appeared in photographs alongside Trump at the Gaza summit earlier this week. The Fifa president has also visited the Oval Office and presented World Cup and Club World Cup trophies to Trump as gifts.

On Tuesday, Trump was asked about recent disturbances in South Boston that included a police vehicle being set on fire. “If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni [Infantino] – the head of Fifa, who's phenomenal,” Trump replied.

“I would say: ‘Let's move into another location' and they would do that. He wouldn't love to do it. But he would do it very easily.” Trump also directly criticised Wu, saying: “Their mayor is not good … she's radical left, and they're taking over parts of Boston. That's a pretty big statement, right?”

Trump has made previous comments suggesting he would take up the same conversation with Infantino about moving games from Seattle and San Francisco, which are among the 16 host cities across North America.

The United States are joint hosts of the 2026 World Cup, alongside Mexico and Canada. The 48-team event is scheduled to be played from 11 June to 19 July next summer.

Donald Trump says he could call up the head of FIFA, Gianni Infantino, and he would do what he suggested.


          Sports correspondent

Wednesday 15 October 2025 19:11, UK

FIFA has told Sky News the US government does have the right to determine if cities are safe for the World Cup - after Donald Trump threatened to remove the Boston area from hosting.

The US president stepped up his criticism of crime in Democrat-run cities at the White House after previously claiming California could be stripped of matches at the FIFA event next year, and at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino is a close ally of President Trump's - attending his Gaza peace summit in Egypt this week - and is not pushing back on his World Cup interventions.

In a statement to Sky News, FIFA said: "Safety and security are the top priorities at all FIFA events worldwide.

"Safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety.

"We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfill all necessary requirements."

FIFA did not directly comment on changing any of the 11 venues in the US for the expanded 48-team men's football World Cup which will see the Americans host 78 of the 104 fixtures, including the final in New Jersey.

The remaining games are in Canada and Mexico.

Boston does not have matches itself, but the home of the NFL's New England Patriots is being used by FIFA for seven matches, 30 miles away in Foxborough, Massachusetts.

President Trump said: "If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni - the head of FIFA who's phenomenal - and I would say, 'Let's move into another location,' and they would do that.

"He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily."

President Trump and Mr Infantino first encountered each other during Mr Trump's first term in office, when the US was awarded the right to host next year's tournament.

They have popped up together at summits and meetings across the world since.

The FIFA president was even among those in attendance as Mr Trump and world leaders signed the recent Israel-Gaza peace deal.

Earlier this week, President Trump slammed Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu, and said the "radical left" was taking over Boston.

He made the comments while hosting Argentine president Javier Milei.

The Trump administration has already deployed National Guard troops to Washington, Los Angeles and Memphis in what he said was a bid to clean up crime.

Driving through the Highway 99 tunnel in Seattle could be pricier during next summer's FIFA World Cup.

With traffic expected to surge when the city hosts several matches, the Washington State Transportation Commission may temporarily hike tolls for the two-mile tunnel to defray additional costs associated with the international sporting event.

Commissioners heard Tuesday that their staff are evaluating potential increases of 50 cents and $1 that would be imposed between June 1 and July 15, 2026, the period in which six World Cup contests are scheduled at Lumen Field in downtown Seattle. 

State lawmakers directed the commission to consider a temporary increase and use the money to cover added costs of managing traffic around the stadium and throughout the Puget Sound when fans flood the region in those six weeks.

Doing nothing is an option too, said Carl See, the commission deputy director. While commissioners need to keep in mind the impact of the influx of visitors, they also need to remember any increase “may have an impact on those who have no interest” in taking part in what will be a “monumental event” for the state, he told the panel.

The Pacific Northwest will host 13 World Cup matches — six in Seattle and seven in Vancouver, B.C. Conversations have been underway for months on how to avert monumental backups at the U.S.-Canada border and assist fans moving between the host cities.

About 750,000 people are anticipated to come to Washington state in the course of six weeks. In addition to matches, teams will be practicing at the University of Washington in Seattle and Gonzaga University in Spokane. There will be training locations and fan zones in the state, too.

State lawmakers earmarked roughly $24 million in the current transportation budget for World Cup-related expenses. Additional dollars were cribbed into the operating and capital budgets for security and field upgrades.

With transportation, there's $14 million for transit, including $5 million for expanding intercity bus service in the state, and another $8.25 million for operational improvements aimed at keeping people moving. 

There's $2 million for maintenance in the vicinity of the tunnel. Those dollars will come out of the tunnel toll revenue account. Lawmakers assumed that sum could be covered from a temporary toll rate increase but didn't mandate one.

Roughly 47,000 vehicles travel through the tunnel each day based on a July 2024 analysis.

Tolls vary based on time of day with higher rates in peak commute hours and lower rates on nights and weekends. They are collected in both directions as one exits the tunnel. 

Weekdays, the cost ranges from $1.25 to $1.85 per trip with a Good to Go pass. It is $1.25 on weekends. Drivers pay an extra 25 cents per trip with the Pay By Plate option, in which they register their license plate on a Good To Go! account without a pass. There is a $2 fee tacked on if you pay by mail.

What will be studied are potential increases of 50 cents per trip and $1 per trip that would be imposed at all times, including on weekends.

In December, staff will present the commission with projections of how much money might be generated from those assessments and how many drivers might choose to use local roads and Interstate 5 to avoid higher tolls.

See cautioned that he didn't want to “overpromise” what data would be delivered. If approved, this would be the first such temporary toll-rate hike, he said. Given the short six-week duration and uniqueness of the sporting event, it will be hard to model for every possible factor with precision, he said.

If the commission decides to proceed with a one-time temporary toll rate increase, it would conduct a rate-setting process including gathering public input on potential rate options.

Along with Haji Wright, who scored both goals Tuesday against Australia, Balogun has given the U.S. soccer team a desperately needed scoring threat.

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — It's one of those things that befuddles soccer's devotees as much as its critics.

The net is big, and the field is vast. So why do people in the sport often say that scoring a goal is the hardest thing to do?

It surely can't be that difficult to run forward, have a teammate pass you the ball, and shoot it in.

During the last men's World Cup in 2022, U.S. fans had to spend the Monday after Thanksgiving explaining to their office colleagues why a 0-0 tie — a most un-American result — against England was one of the best games the team has ever played.

The retort was obvious: If it was that good, why didn't they score?

Three years is a long time to wait for answers. But as next year's tournament draws closer, the new American squad may have finally found them.

Haji Wright is one. He carried his strong club form with Coventry City of England's second division into Tuesday's 2-1 win over Australia, scoring both U.S. goals with style.

Ricardo Pepi is another, though he hasn't shown it for a bit. He's just back from a long injury absence that has kept him from the national team since last November. Hopefully he'll return for next month's games, including a matchup vs. Paraguay at Subaru Park.

But the biggest answer is Folarin Balogun. Two-and-a-half years since he joined the senior U.S. national team, he has seized the mantle for his country.

The 24-year-old Brooklyn native has scored goals in two of the Americans' four games so far this autumn, taking his career total to seven tallies in 21 national team appearances. Both numbers likely would be bigger if not for shoulder and ankle injuries over the last 12 months.

“It was a fantastic and unique journey for me to begin playing with the men's national team,” Balogun said, a journey that included being recruited to the U.S. program with all the flash of a college football team chasing a quarterback.

He delivered an early payoff with a goal in the 2023 Concacaf Nations League final, and scored twice in last year's Copa América group stage — one of the only U.S. players who wasn't a flop in the tournament.

But then came those injuries, halting his momentum and that of the national team. We'll never know how much better things could have gone at this year's Nations League final four had Balogun been there.

“Last year was frustrating, being out for so long with a shoulder injury, but all I can do is just focus on the present and focus on what I can control,” Balogun said. “I've had the game[s], obviously, in the last camp [in September], and that was just important for me to be around the team again and just to reintegrate. And for me it's about building momentum, consistently being a part of the team, and being available — the most important thing for any athlete is to be available.”

When he said that, no one thought to ask if he knew that phrase was popularized by another former New Yorker years ago. But then again, Balogun was six months from being born when Bill Parcells departed the Jets in January 2001. (Of the current U.S. squad's 26 players, only 38-year-old Tim Ream was alive when Parcells left the Giants in 1990.)

“I want to prove that to myself, prove that to the coaching staff,” Balogun said of hoping to stay healthy. “And, yeah, I think once I'm on the pitch, and the longer I'm on the pitch, building confidence, good things are going to happen. It's a process, but I'm definitely happy with how it's going.”

So is manager Mauricio Pochettino.

“Well, what I like the most is that he is scoring,” he said earlier this week, a line that even soccer critics might like. “When they score is what I like the most in a striker. And then I think, his work ethic: available to drop and to play and to connect.”

As Pochettino spoke, he was interrupted by a banging noise from a nearby wall. Alas, it did not come from a chorus of those critics wishing to thank him. It was just the wind outside, flying down from the Rockies and slamming into a closed door.

“I think [there are] many things about the game, not only to score — that is what I like the most — but also it's the capacity to link with the team,” Pochettino said. “He's a player who can drop and play, as you see with our offensive players and midfielders, and going to the [open] space, running. [He] has a little bit of everything that I like.”

Just as significant as Balogun's form and skills are the players around him. Pochettino's 3-4-2-1 formation allows for the striker to get service in multiple ways, from the wingbacks out wide and the attacking midfielders more centrally. The ball might come through the air or on the ground, via a cross or via a threaded ball up the middle — the kind Balogun fizzed home against Japan.

“He's taken his opportunities, and that's all you can ask for [from] a No. 9,” fellow New Yorker Tim Weah said, referring to a striker's traditional jersey number. And he would know, as a former forward who now plays as one of those wingbacks for the U.S. and Italian club Juventus.

“We all know he's an amazing player and he can help us save a game,” Weah continued. “He's sticking his foot out in actions, he's running behind, fighting the defenders. … Hopefully we can feed him some more and get him some more goals.”

Nor is it a coincidence that the assist for Balogun's goal vs. Japan came from Christian Pulisic, and the one for his goal vs. Ecuador on Friday came from Malik Tillman. Their dynamism and creativity sets up Balogun to be his best, and that's a big part of why they're now atop the attacking midfield depth chart. 

Weston McKennie can add another element, as can Alejandro Zendejas, Brenden Aaronson, or Gio Reyna if he can regain a place on the squad.

“He's always going off the back shoulder — he's really difficult to deal with, because he's always dribbling, going at players, and also going in behind,” the Medford-born Aaronson said. “He's got two different [ways] that he can play: He can hold up the game, and he can also go in behind and create chances by himself. He's a really good player, and he's really good for this squad.”

Balogun appreciates how he fits in with his teammates, and with Pochettino's system.

“I feel like the manager gives us that freedom to just do what we want up there, and I think that shows in the way we play,” he said. “Everything's kind of just freestyle. But we're good enough players to figure it out, and he believes in us.”

As Balogun has grown into the U.S. team on the field, he has grown into the country off it, too. Though he was born in Brooklyn, he moved to London with his Nigerian parents after just a month. He has spent his entire professional career in Europe, only able to visit the United States for national team games and too-rare vacations.

So he makes the most of those moments when he can.

“I love being back here — especially in New York, my favorite city,” he said. “I definitely feel like I get my trips in. I would like more, and after my career, I think it's somewhere I would like to live. Being in Europe, balancing that with international football, I'm not going to get as much time as I want, but I definitely feel like I do get enough time there.”

U.S. fans in Philadelphia might have to forgive Balogun next month for his choice of city. But they know as well as his team that right now, he's on the way to the greatest trip home of all.

The U.S. women's national team will be back in action after 113 days. The program will play a three-game series in October against Portugal and New Zealand, and head coach Emma Hayes has named a 26-player roster for the upcoming matches. Two of the three games will feature retirement celebrations for Alex Morgan and Alyssa Naeher as the group aims to build off their previous meeting, a 3-0 win over Canada, in July.

"We are extremely excited to get back together with the team," said Hayes. "There has been a big gap from July until now and we've watched many club games. Now, it's time to start the build towards qualifying for the 2027 World Cup. We want to maximize every minute we have together, push the players, and keep the momentum going. These three fantastic games ahead of us will help us do that."

The three game window will begin against Portugal on Oct. 23 and Oct. 26 before concluding against New Zealand on Oct. 29. The expanded roster is to help manage player minutes and match load with the upcoming NWSL playoffs set to begin in November, and Hayes will only name 23 players on matchdays.

Forward Trinity Rodman returns to the USWNT camps for the first time since April. The lengthy absence was due to a back injury, and she has since returned to play with her club, Washington Spirit. Rodman scored the game-winner in her last USWNT appearance, a 2-0 win against Brazil. Gotham FC midfielder Jaedyn Shaw also marks her return to the senior team after featuring with the U-23 team since April. 

While Hayes is narrowing down her pool of players ahead of FIFA Women's World Cup qualifiers in 2026, there are still players earning first-time callups. Second-year San Diego Wave defender Kennedy Wesley was named to the roster and could make her senior debut over the three friendlies after spending time with the U-23 program earlier this year.

The October international window will have continued training camps running alongside the senior team. The U-23 program will be in Philadelphia, and the U-20 team will be in Kansas City, concurrent with the USWNT. The dual camps are an example of the U.S. Soccer's development philosophy, the U.S. Way, which focuses on and encourages increased opportunities for youth national teams.

Also returning to the roster are several Americans who play abroad. Five players, midfielder Lindsey Heaps, defender Emily Fox, forward Catarina Macario, midfielder Lily Yohannes, and goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, were given the summer window off. Alyssa Thompson joins the roster from Chelsea FC, her first call-up since moving to Europe. Each player is currently playing in the UEFA Champions League. Fans can watch every UWCL match across CBS Sports platforms , Paramount+, CBS Sports Network , and CBS Sports Golazo Network.

Take a look at the official roster:

Goalkeepers (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 2), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 4), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United, ENG; 3)

Defenders (8): Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC; 2/0), Emily Fox (Arsenal FC, ENG; 67/1), Lilly Reale (Gotham FC; 2/0), Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit; 8/0), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash; 6/1), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride; 5/0), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC; 110/2), Kennedy Wesley (San Diego Wave; 0/0)

Midfielders (8): Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC; 38/4), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 167/38), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current; 6/1), Rose Lavelle (Gotham FC; 113/25), Sam Meza (Seattle Reign FC; 2/0), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC; 9/2), Jaedyn Shaw (Gotham FC; 26/8), Lily Yohannes (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 8/1)

Forwards (7): Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current; 8/1), Catarina Macario (Chelsea FC, ENG; 24/11), Trinity Rodman (Washington Spirit; 47/11), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston Dash; 12/2), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville; 8/1), Ally Sentnor (Kansas City Current; 12/4), Alyssa Thompson (Chelsea FC, ENG; 22/3)

Dele Alli's hopes of sealing a move to Wrexham on a free transfer have disappeared after the Championship side confirmed the final place in their squad for the 2025-26 season has gone to returning star Ollie Rathbone. The former Como midfielder had been linked with a move to Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac's side after being released by the Serie A side but must now look elsewhere for a fresh challenge.

FIFA has issued a statement after US President Donald Trump threatened to change the host cities for next summer's World Cup.

The tournament will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada, with the final set to take place at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on July 19.

However, despite the competition being just nine months away, Trump has warned that he could intervene and change the host cities.

He claims he could contact FIFA President Gianni Infantino to pressure Democrat-run cities to take a tougher stance on crime.

At a cabinet meeting on Sunday, he said: “If somebody is doing a bad job and I feel there are unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location.'

"He wouldn't love to do it, but he would do it very easily.”

In response, a FIFA spokesperson told POLITICO: “Safety and security are of the utmost importance at all FIFA events worldwide.

"And it is ultimately the government's responsibility to decide what's in the best interest of public safety.

"We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to fulfill all necessary requirements for a successful 2026 World Cup.”

The United States are set to host two of the world's biggest sporting events in the coming years.

After next summer's World Cup, Los Angeles will stage the Summer Olympics in 2028.

Trump's latest comments are now the second time he has threatened to change World Cup venues.

City officials have since spoken out against Trump, stressing that they have spent several years preparing to host matches.

Lisa Gillmor, the mayor of Santa Clara, California, said: “Any suggestion that Santa Clara is unsafe is simply not based in fact.

"We have been preparing for these games for nearly 3 years, and we will be proud to welcome the world to Santa Clara for the World Cup next year."

Another official from a host city added that the agreements over which locations would stage matches were finalised back in 2017 and 2018.

The controversy is just the latest difficulty ahead of the World Cup.

Fans have already hit out at the prices, with the cheapest seats for the final starting out at $2,030 (£1,510), and the most expensive reaching $6,000 (£4,462).

FIFA has also adopted a 'dynamic pricing' system for the tournament, allowing ticket prices to rise sharply in response to higher demand.

And weather conditions could also pose a logistical challenge, with extreme heat likely to force later kick-off times.

Where do you even begin when talking about a legendary career like the one Angel City FC and USWNT superstar forward Christen Press has had? Today was the day plenty of women's soccer fans likely saw coming, but were absolutely looking to avoid. Even now, if you listen hard enough, you can probably hear a swelling of ‘la-la-la-la-la-‘ with hands over ears, hoping that if they don't hear the words, then it can't make it true. Unfortunately for the game, it is true, as Christen Press has announced her retirement from soccer, with these final two games in the NWSL 2025 season, being her last.

Thank you, Christen 🖤
Angel City Football Club forward Christen Press has officially announced her retirement from professional soccer, concluding one of the most accomplished and influential careers in the modern era of the sport.

“It's hard to find the words to say goodbye to a sport that has defined my life for over three decades. Football has given me everything, and I will miss being on the pitch so very much. Thank you to my family, friends, teammates, coaches, and community for this beautiful ride. I promise we will continue to reimagine sports in this next life!!” shared Christen Press as she reflected on her retirement.

In a statement, Angel City FC CEO and Co-Founder Julie Uhrman said “Christen retires as one of the most decorated and respected forwards in U.S. soccer history, a pioneer whose legacy is woven into the very fabric of our club. As Angel City's first signing, Christen's contributions to the club have been unparalleled. From her extraordinary skill and relentless competitiveness on the pitch to her unwavering commitment to making the game and our community more equitable, inclusive, and impactful. On behalf of everyone at Angel City, we thank Christen for everything she has given to the sport, our club, and future generations of athletes and fans.”

Christen Press wraps up her career as not only one of the best players this sport has ever seen, but as one of the most influential off the pitch that this sport has had the honor of knowing. She finishes as one of the leading scorers in USWNT history, netting 64 goals in her 155 International caps. She played a critical role in helping the National Team win back-to-back World Cup titles (2015 and 2019) as well as helping secure Olympic Bronze in the 2021 Olympic Games.

Then there's the domestic list of achievements. Press is a Hermann Trophy winner from her time at Stanford University, where she set multiple scoring records. She has played in four different leagues, WPS, NWSL, FA WSL, and Sweden's Damallsvenskan. She won the Golden Boot in Sweden as a member of Tyresö FF, scoring 25 goals in 26 appearances that season. In the WSL she featured in 14 matches for Manchester United where she scored four goals, but most will know her for her time in the NWSL, where she has played for Chicago Stars, Utah Royals, and most recently her hometown team Angel City FC, where she became the club's first signing back in 2022, acting as an ambassador for the club's mission of equity and inclusion. She has scored 49 regular-season goals across her 122 NWSL appearances.

Beyond her on-field achievements, Press has been a driving force in athlete advocacy and the evolution of women's sports. Through her company RE—INC, she has championed athlete ownership, creative expression, and social progress, continuing to shape the landscape of sport long after the final whistle. Which is what makes this announcement such a bittersweet moment. For so many women's soccer fans, she was the entry point. A creative, technically precise, high work-rate forward who made the game look easy at times. Exuding confident and kindness, Press has been the type of player even the most casual of ball knowers have heard about. Her impact on this sport will last for generations, and she retires as one of the most decorated and respected USWNT players. With just one last home match remaining in the 2025 NWSL season, expect the Los Angeles soccer legend to make it a day to remember, with what will likely be a packed BMO full of fans, family, friends, admirers and those who gained inspiration from Press all showing up to say their goodbyes, and thank her for the honor of being able to watch her approach this game not just with immense talent and ability, but with incredible dignity and strength.

The penultimate international break of 2025 may have robbed us all of club football action, but it at least made the 2026 World Cup picture a little clearer.

England, Egypt, Algeria, Ghana, South Africa, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Cape Verde punched their tickets for the showpiece event in North America in October, with the latter set to make its first appearance at the global football tournament. 

That brings the confirmed party guests up to 28 nations, with another set of fixtures in November expected to yield a few more RSVPs.

While FIFA's official world rankings provide a useful gauge of where each country stands in the international game, it doesn't exactly account for nuance. 

That's where we come in. Read on for the latest power ranking of the top 20 men's international football teams. 

20. Ivory Coast

FIFA ranking: 44

B/R September ranking: New entry

After dropping out of B/R's international power ranking in September, having landed in 20th in March's edition, the Ivory Coast is back.

While fellow World Cup qualifiers from Africa might be higher in FIFA's ranking—Algeria (38th), Egypt (35th), Senegal (18th)—the Elephants are the reigning Africa Cup of Nations champions, which gives them an edge in this context. 

Ivory Coast just pipped Gabon to the top of qualifying Group F courtesy of a 7-0 win over Seychelles and a 3-0 victory against Kenya in October. 

With that, the Elephants return to the World Cup after last appearing in 2014. In North America, they will be hoping to progress from the group stages for the first time in their history. 

19. Ecuador 

FIFA ranking: 24

B/R September ranking: 16

After landing as high as 11th in B/R's world football rankings in March, Ecuador has been gradually slipping away.

That high spot was as a result of incredible form in CONMEBOL qualifying, in which La Tri finished second. 

While Ecuador can be proud of that placement, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was helped by the underperformance of other South American nations.

In fact, while La Tri are undefeated in their last seven games, they have only won one, albeit an impressive 1-0 victory over Argentina. 

Momentum seems to be flagging a bit, and that's reflected in their drop in power ranking.

18. USA

FIFA ranking: 16

B/R September ranking: 18

In 10 games since the start of the Gold Cup on June 15, the United States has lost just two matches.

That might be an overly optimistic way of looking at the team's run of results, but it still reads well, and it includes games played in a tournament setting. 

The Stars and Stripes finished the October break with a draw against Ecuador and a victory against Australia, two teams that will also be playing in next summer's tournament. 

With Ecuador finishing second in CONMEBOL qualification ahead of Brazil, Uruguay, and Colombia, that 1-1 stalemate doesn't look as problematic either.

It's not exactly Earth-shaking form, but the Stars and Stripes are starting to look solid while approaching their co-hosting duties.

17. Japan

FIFA ranking: 19

B/R September ranking: 19

Japan has been disappointing since sealing World Cup qualification in March, with just two wins in six matches from June onwards.

However, on Tuesday, the Samurai Blue came back from 2-0 down to secure a 3-2 friendly win over Brazil.

Of course, it's easy to point to that result coming in an essentially meaningless game, but it demonstrates the team's resilience, and Brazil still put out a strong XI. 

For Japan, it's now about fine-tuning ahead of the World Cup in June, and more results like the one against the Seleçao Canarinho will set it up nicely for North America. 

16. Uruguay 

FIFA ranking: 15

B/R September ranking: 15

Uruguay has demonstrated a notable level of consistency in the last two international breaks, going undefeated in four games and winning three.

For a squad that was criticized for being frustrating in September's B/R rankings, that's a notable improvement.

However, with teams surrounding Uruguay performing at a similar level in the last few months, and the level of competition it faced not as strong—Peru (48th), Chile (57th), Dominican Republic (142nd), and Uzbekistan (54th)—it falls a place to 16th.

Friendly matches are an opportunity to rotate and test tactics, so underperforming is to be expected. Still, if La Celeste wants to establish a dark horse reputation for themselves heading into the tournament, like they have in years past, they will need some better results.

15. Norway

FIFA ranking: 31

B/R September ranking: 17

Norway stormed into September's B/R power rankings, and it looks intent on staying there on the way to its first World Cup appearance since 1998.

Largely thanks to the most deadly striker on the planet, Erling Haaland, the Scandinavians are at the top of qualifying Group I with a staggering goal haul of 29, seven more than the next top-scoring team, the Netherlands. The 25-year-old is responsible for 41 percent of them. 

As long as Haaland is around, Norway is a potent threat. Despite having the lowest FIFA ranking of any team listed here, they should not be underestimated. Rather, Norway should be feared. 

However, that reliance on Haaland was demonstrated in his absence on Tuesday. Without the Manchester City striker, Norway could only manage a 1-1 draw with New Zealand. 

Manager Ståle Solbakken will be frantically placing an order for bubble wrap. 

14. Belgium

FIFA ranking: 8

B/R September ranking: 13

Manager Rudi Garcia has brought a spark back to the Belgian men's national team. 

The Frenchman has guided the Red Devils to five wins in eight matches in charge, and they sit on top of World Cup qualifying Group J with a game in hand over North Macedonia.

Now, it looks certain Belgium will be heading to the World Cup, and the squad will be full of confidence after scoring 20 in the last five games

Despite North Macedonia playing at a standard well above their 63rd-place FIFA world ranking, the fact that the Red Devils couldn't crack them over two qualifying games—including a 0-0 draw in October—will be a mild concern. 

13. Italy

FIFA Ranking: 10

B/R September Ranking: 14

With two matches to go, Italy is still trailing Norway in qualification Group I. That means a trip through the playoffs is the most likely scenario to seal their spot in the global soccer showcase.

The Azzurri will surely fancy their chances should it come to that, but it's an extra layer of jeopardy they would undoubtedly rather not have to deal with. 

Italy has not qualified for a World Cup since the 2014 edition in Brazil, and being on the outside looking in once again will surely be too much to bear for the nation's football-mad fans.

Thankfully, Italy is on a good run of form, picking up five consecutive wins and scoring 18 in the process.

12. Mexico

FIFA ranking: 14

B/R September ranking: 10

Mexico is having a serious Gold Cup hangover. No wins in four games since lifting the trophy is a hugely disappointing run, with their co-hosting duties approaching.

Among those results was a crushing 4-0 home loss to Colombia in October. While the friendly fixture provided an opportunity to test potential options before the nation opens its doors in June, the nature of the defeat will dampen what would otherwise be jubilant preparations. 

While still the most promising among the host nations in terms of possible success, Mexico needs to turn things around with a little over six months to go.

11. Colombia

FIFA ranking: 13

B/R September ranking: 11

After no wins in six from November 2024 to the end of August 2025, some alarm bells were sounding for Colombia.

However, World Cup qualification was sealed in September, and Los Cafeteros have now won three of their last four while scoring 13 in the process.

James Rodriguez is still performing international miracles at the age of 34, scoring once and providing four assists in those fixtures. 

Meanwhile, Luis Diaz's hot start to life with Bayern Munich will give the South Americans even more hope for a long stay in the neighboring northern continent.

10. Croatia

FIFA ranking: 9 

B/R September ranking: 12

Croatia keeps plugging away, picking up decent results to keep them top of UEFA qualification Group L.

An away draw with Czechia in their most difficult remaining game of the qualifying stage would have been greeted positively, although the bafflingly brilliant form of the Faroe Islands will at least give the Vatreni cause for concern in their penultimate qualifying fixture.

While only three points separate Croatia from Czechia in second, the former has a game in hand, which at least provides some margin for error on the road to the World Cup.

9. Brazil

FIFA ranking: 6

B/R September ranking: 6

Consistency is an increasing concern for Brazil. Granted, that's difficult to achieve on the international stage, given issues with establishing chemistry and the difficulty of squeezing a raft of talent into XI spots.

However, for a team of Brazil's enviable selection options and a manager of Carlo Ancelotti's caliber, things don't look so promising ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

In six games in charge, the Italian has only managed to guide the Seleçao Canarinho to three wins. That includes a 1-0 loss to 77th-ranked Bolivia and a 3-2 collapse against Japan when they were 2-0 up.

There's a lot of work to do between now and June if Brazil wants to reestablish its previously feared reputation.

8. Morocco

FIFA ranking: 11

B/R September ranking: 9

By rights, Morocco should be much higher in the international power rankings.

Outside of the African Nations Championship—a tournament that European-based players don't participate in—the Atlas Lions have lost just once since January 2024.

However, the strength of opponents has to be factored in, with Morocco not often tested by low-ranked African nations. 

That's still a remarkable streak, though, and one that shouldn't be taken lightly. Victories breed victories, after all. 

With Achraf Hakimi in the form of his life, fresh off being ranked the sixth-best player in the world at the 2025 Ballon d'Or awards, he'll be a driving force as captain in North America.

7. Germany

FIFA ranking: 12

B/R September ranking: 8 

After a woeful run of form that saw Germany go winless in four matches from late March to early September (including three defeats), things are looking up for the Die Nationalelf.

With World Cup qualification looking in peril after a shocking opening-game loss to Slovakia, Germany has rattled off three consecutive wins to top Group A on goal difference.

That sets them up nicely heading into November's crucial qualifying games, where Slovakia will be waiting in the final, likely decisive matchup.

Still, just eight goals scored in four qualifying games will be troubling, especially since half of those came in a 4-0 victory over 96th ranked Luxembourg.

6. Netherlands

FIFA ranking: 7

B/R September ranking: 7

The Netherlands just loves scoring goals.

In the last three games, the Oranje have smashed in 11, conceding just two in the process. Take it back a little further, and the Netherlands has 20 goals in its last five games, with only three conceded. In October, the Dutch defense didn't surrender a goal.

For a nation that always seems to have an enviable collection of stars, the Netherlands has never won a World Cup final, despite reaching the tournament's climactic game three times.

With manager Ronald Koeman finding the secret to international scoring success while maintaining a stingy back line, the Oranje might again manage a deep tournament run.

FIFA ranking: 2

B/R September ranking: 4

France had the chance to seal 2026 World Cup qualification with a win on Monday.

While Ukraine ensured that wouldn't be possible after notching a 2-1 victory over Azerbaijan, France didn't hold up its end of the bargain, either.

Les Bleus stumbled to a 2-2 draw against world No. 74 Iceland, meaning they will have to wait until November to find out if they should buy some plane tickets to North America. 

A 3-0 win over Azerbaijan at least made October's international slate a little less concerning. However, manager Didier Deschamps might come under scrutiny for his tactics and team selection in the subsequent stalemate, when a win could have eased the pressure on his side significantly.

FIFA ranking: 5

B/R September ranking: 3

Portugal has been living a little dangerously, needing a late goal in two of its last three World Cup qualifying games to seal victory and conceding a late equalizer on Tuesday. 

If not for Dominik Szoboszlai's strike, A Seleçao would have confirmed their spot in the 2026 World Cup. However, they will now have to wait until November.

In addition to that disappointment, Portugal slips in the B/R power rankings because its results simply aren't convincing at the moment. 

While Cristiano Ronaldo found the goal (and then another) that took him to the top of the all-time World Cup qualifying top scorer list, his remarkable exploits are not enough on their own for Portugal to rely on.

FIFA ranking: 3

B/R September ranking: 2

After dropping from first to second in September's B/R power ranking, Argentina's descent continues as it lands in third. 

Although qualification for the World Cup had already been secured at that point, it succumbed to a 1-0 defeat against Ecuador in September. The 1-0 victory over 49th-ranked Venezuela that followed in October wasn't entirely convincing.

La Albiceleste did secure a 6-0 win against Puerto Rico on Tuesday, but beating the 155th-ranked team isn't much to be pleased about. 

Following a disappointing defeat in Ecuador and with little else to boast about from their recent outings, Argentina has slipped after more impressive results from another nation. 

FIFA ranking: 4

B/R September ranking: 5

England has steamed into second with the Thomas Tuchel train hitting full speed. 

A 3-0 friendly victory over Wales without Harry Kane was a welcome result for U.K. bragging rights, but the 5-0 win over Latvia was significantly more important.

With that, the Three Lions will have the opportunity to end 60 years of hurt in Canada, Mexico, and the United States, with World Cup 2026 qualification sealed.

England is the only European nation to confirm a berth in the competition so far, doing so with six wins from six in Group K and no goals conceded.

Tuchel's tenure started with a concerning lack of goals, but the German has well and truly opened the attacking floodgates. That's 13 goals in the last three games, with Kane providing just three of them. 

For a team that has been so reliant on its talismanic No. 9 for the better part of a decade, that's a really promising sign. 

Tuchel has been ruthless in his selection, relying on players who are showing their best form rather than counting on reputation, and it's paying off.

FIFA ranking: 1

B/R September ranking: 1

Spain simply looks unshakable at the top of B/R's international football rankings.

FIFA apparently agrees, having put the country at the summit of its own ranking list in September's update. 

If you ignore the penalty-shootout loss to Portugal in the Nations League final, La Furia Roja haven't been defeated since a March 2024 friendly against Colombia, in which usual starters were rested.

In October, Spain brushed aside Georgia and put four past Bulgaria with no reply, putting it comfortably atop Group E and within touching distance of automatic World Cup qualification. 

With inconsistencies from many of the typically favored nations, Spain must be considered the favorite when the action starts in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.

After a remarkable career that includes two FIFA Women's World Cup titles and recognition across multiple club leagues, U.S. women's national team and Angel City FC forward Christen Press has announced she will retire following the conclusion of the NWSL season. 

"It's hard to find the words to say goodbye to a sport that has defined my life for over three decades. Football has given me everything, and I will miss being on the pitch so very much. Thank you to my family, friends, teammates, coaches, and community for this beautiful ride. I promise we will continue to reimagine sports in this next life," Press said in a statement.

The long-time attacker, known for her iconic cut-backs and clinical finishing, leaves a profound impact on and off the field. As she closes her playing career with Angel City FC, the 36-year-old closes a chapter on an influential tenure in women's soccer. The California native built the beginning of her career at Stanford University and broke school records.

She became the all-time leading scorer with 71 goals, while also setting new benchmarks for career points (183), assists (41), and shots (500). She left the University as a Mac Hermann trophy winner and two-time runner-up at the NCAA Women's College Cup.

Press is part of a larger group of players who helped domestic league soccer grow in the United States. She was part of Magicjack in the WPS and was named 2011 Rookie of the Year. After the league folded, Press was among a wave of U.S. players who continued their club careers in Europe, and played in Sweden with Goteborg FC and Tyreso FF where she became the first American to win the Damallsvenskan Golden Boot (2013) and scored 25 goals in 26 games for Tyreso.

As the NWSL launched, Press returned to the states in 2014 to play in the new American league. She became the Chicago Red Stars' leading goal scorer with goals (35) during her time with the club. She later joined Utah Royals FC in 2018 after a brief return in Sweden, and also played in England's Women's Super League with Manchester United in 2021 before returning to her hometown, Los Angeles, and became Angel City's first player signing. 

The success across club performances led to titles at the international level. Press leaves the U.S. women's national team with 155 appearances and 64 goals, while being a key member of the USWNT's iconic era, winning back-to-back World Cups in 2015 and 2019, and a 2020 Olympic bronze medal. She was an integral part of the USWNT's legal battle against U.S. Soccer for equal pay.

Her impact had a ripple effect on and off the pitch and forever changed women's soccer in the United States when she came forward alongside former teammates and anonymous sources with her early experiences in NWSL. She discussed her time in Chicago and the conditions of a toxic workplace and abusive environment. The reporting led to more investigations into player wellness across women's American soccer, including the Sally Yates report and the NWSL and NWSL Players Association joint investigation report. 

Press' legacy will continue through advocacy, entrepreneurship, media, and philanthropy. She's been a long-time global ambassador and board Member for Grassroot Soccer, an adolescent health organization that uses soccer as a tool to educate and inspire youth in developing countries.

In 2019, she launched RE-INC, a gender-neutral lifestyle brand that aims to reimagine the status quo and create a more inclusive landscape in sports media. The RE-CAP Show she hosts alongside her wife, Tobin Heath, has become a platform to center female athletes and champion inclusivity. She's been vocal about the importance of visibility and respect for LGBTQ and Black players and communities. 

Her final season with Angel City has been a powerful comeback story. Press returned in 2024 following a grueling two-year journey that included four surgeries after tearing her ACL in 2022. She scored her first home goal since her injury in May 2025.

Press's career is an inspiring story of a great goalscorer who ultimately became a builder of greater things. As she savors her final moments on the field, she leaves the game in a far better position than she inherited. She'll be remembered not only for the records she broke or titles she won, but for the many she inspired along the way and the barriers she helped tear down.

President Donald Trump said he may call FIFA's president to suggest World Cup games be moved out of Boston if he believes there are safety concerns in the city.

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu responded after President Donald Trump threatened to pull FIFA World Cup games out of the city next year. 

"Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions," she said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.

Boston is currently set to host seven matches when the World Cup comes to North America next summer. The slate includes five group-stage games, one Round of 32 fixture and the first quarterfinal on July 9.

Trump made the suggestion that he would have games moved out of Boston while speaking to reporters on Tuesday while discussing an incident that happened in the city this week when a group of people took over one of the city's streets in a violent display. 

According to the Boston Police Department, over 100 people were involved in the takeover that involved street racing just after 2 a.m. on Oct. 5. Officers found people trying to attack police cruisers with fireworks, cones, poles and other items. One police cruiser was destroyed by flames and needed to be towed away from the area, officials said.

"We can take them away. I love the people of Boston. And I know the games are sold out, but the mayor is not good. There are worse than her. At least she's intelligent. You know, some are extremely low IQ. Those bother me more. She's intelligent, but she's radical left," Trump said. 

Trump added he would call FIFA President Gianni Infantino to have the games moved.

"The answer is yes, if somebody's doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location,' and he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it, very easily he'd do it. And this is the right time to do it." 

Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey addressed the violent incident in Boston on Tuesday.

"I'm committed to doing everything I can to get after this issue," Healey said. "That's my message today: No more.

"Not going to happen here. And if you do it, you're going to be punished. I'm serious."

President Donald Trump says he has the authority to "take away" 2026 World Cup soccer matches scheduled in Boston if he feels the city is unsafe.

Suggesting that parts of Boston had been "taken over" by recent unrest, Trump criticized mayor Michelle Wu and said on Tuesday, Oct. 14, that Boston – which is set to stage seven matches at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough during next summer's tournament – could have its games relocated with a phone call to FIFA president Gianni Infantino.

"If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who's phenomenal – and I would say, ‘Let's move into another location,' and they would do that," Trump said. "He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily."

Trump's remarks came during a White House appearance with Argentine President Javier Milei, days after Boston police reported multiple arrests tied to a late-night street gathering that turned violent. 

Boston was one of 11 U.S. cities, along with three in Mexico and two in Canada, selected three years ago to host matches for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Making changes to plans already in place just eight months before the tournament kicks off June 11 would create severe logistical hurdles.

"We could take them away," Trump said. "I love the people of Boston, and I know the games are sold out. But your mayor is not good."

Wu's office issued a statement that read: "Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions."

Trump also suggested that he would consider moving the 2028 Summer Olympics out of Los Angeles for similar reasons.

"If I thought L.A. was not going to be prepared properly, I would move it to another location if I had to."

At 36, Press has cemented her legacy as one of U.S. soccer's all-time greats.

Christen Press, one of the most celebrated players in U.S. women's soccer history, is officially hanging up her cleats.

At 36, the two-time World Cup champion and Angel City FC forward announced her retirement from professional soccer, sharing the emotional news in an interview with "Good Morning America" that aired Wednesday.

"I'm retiring from professional soccer, and I've decided that this is my last season and my last few games," Press said. "I feel a mix of everything. There's yes, there's relief, there's joy, there's excitement, there's fear, there's so much grief. I have so much grief, a part of me, a piece of me, I'm losing her."

Over the course of her remarkable career, Press earned 155 caps and scored 64 goals for the U.S. Women's National Team, helping lead the squad to two FIFA Women's World Cup titles.

Known for her speed, technical precision and calm under pressure, Press became a defining figure of the USWNT's golden era.

Her influence extended well beyond the field. As a trailblazer for equity in women's sports and a founding member of Angel City FC, Press helped shape the next generation of women's soccer in Los Angeles.

Three years ago, Press suffered a devastating knee injury that sidelined her for more than a year.

Despite a determined comeback and return to the pitch last season, she said her decision to retire came from wanting to choose her moment, not have it chosen for her.

"I thought I would wait until I didn't want to play anymore," she explained. "But I realized that time's never going to come and I can play, and my body can keep going. And I think it was really important for me to make this decision for myself before that became a different reality."

Press will play her final Angel City home game this Sunday, fittingly, not far from where her journey first began.

Soccer, Press added, has always been a family affair.

Her father, a former college football player, was the first to spark her love for the game.

"He had three girls, and so this is how he connected to us," she shared. "And I think because of that, it became so important to my mom to have that connection between my dad and I."

But it was her mother, Stacy, who became her source of strength during the most difficult moments of her career.

In 2018, as her mother battled brain cancer, Press didn't want to leave her side until her mom insisted she rejoin the national team. That same week, she scored a game-winning goal against Spain.

"My dad was upstairs watching the game on his iPad, and he ran downstairs to my mom to show her the goal," she recalled. "And my dad told me that my mom took his hand and she smiled and she actually passed away that night. And I think in some ways it gave her a little peace."

Press's next chapter will be one of partnership -- both in life and in passion.

Earlier this year, she and former teammate and longtime partner Tobin Heath revealed that they are married, after quietly tying the knot years earlier.

"There was a time where a lot was off limits and Tobin and I's approach was wanting to keep our relationship sacred and out of the public eye," she said. "We actually have been married long before this year. And you know, my manager, my family [were] just as surprised as you were, but everyone knew that I was in [a] committed relationship."

Together, the couple co-founded a media company and co-host The RE-CAP Show podcast, where they talk candidly about life, love, and the game that brought them together.

"It's authentic, because it is just the same conversations we often are having here at the house," she said.

Heath retired from soccer earlier this year, and Press admitted that her wife's decision influenced her own.

"She would absolutely hate me saying this, but a lot," she said. "I think it is time for my family to move on to our next chapter, we're going to be a part of this game forever, but it's time for it to look different for us."

As she is about to step off the field for the last time, Press said she feels grateful for her career, her family, and the city that raised her.

"I get to leave this game with a family, a dog, a wife, a house in the city that I grew up in that I love, and that feels like a really soft landing," she said.

Juventus have reportedly identified Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca as a potential future manager amid growing scrutiny on Igor Tudor. While the Bianconeri remain unbeaten in Serie A, frustration is mounting over their series of draws and lack of progress. Maresca, who has impressed in England, is seen as an ideal long-term fit for the Turin giants.

Colin Udoh reveals the role he played in 'helping' Nigeria secure a World Cup play-off place after their 4-0 win over Benin. (1:47)

South Africa's 3-0 win over Rwanda that booked them a place in the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico was not only a strong footballing performance but also a symbol of the resilience that coach Hugo Broos has instilled in the team.

Bafana Bafana faced a self-made crisis heading into the final game, as they trailed Benin by two points at the top of Group C. After relinquishing top spot by having their March win over Lesotho overturned for fielding the ineligible Teboho Mokoena, they dropped two more points in a 0-0 draw with Zimbabwe on Saturday.

However, Benin 's 4-0 defeat by Nigeria left Bafana with a fighting chance: Victory over Rwanda was all they needed to progress. In the past, this is the sort of opportunity that South Africa had become accustomed to squandering.

When Broos watched Bafana Bafana lose a decisive 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier to Sudan five years ago, when they needed only a draw to make the tournament in Cameroon, he saw a team backed by a relative abundance of resources but foiled by a lack of mental fortitude.

That match led to the departure of his predecessor, Molefi Ntseki, and the Belgian's subsequent appointment as head coach. Almost five years later, he has delivered on his mission to overhaul Bafana Bafana's belief in their own abilities -- with his focus on youth paying off.

"I saw the game against Sudan, and Bafana Bafana needed only one point, and when I see the way they played the game there in Sudan... I couldn't understand it," Broos told ESPN in 2021 after making early progress in changing the results and culture of the team. "You go until the end -- until you die -- but you need that point. This was not the mentality I saw.

"So then I started to see who was playing. There were so many players of 27, 28, 29 years old. Afterwards, there was someone who was telling me: 'Yes, coach, but those players are experienced.'

"I said: 'Yes, that's right, but if you do not play the younger players, then when are they going to have experience?'

"So, therefore, I started also with young players who had quality. This is the first thing they need to have, and that's why we have such good results."

That process has now paid dividends, with a dominant performance led by young players who were cool, calm and collected from the first whistle to the last. Bafana led 2-0 at halftime, courtesy of a long-range Thalente Mbatha strike and a curling finish by Oswin Appollis, before Evidence Makgopa's 72nd-minute header sealed the win that saw South Africa qualify for their fourth World Cup -- and their first since they hosted the tournament in 2010.

Broos, alone, cannot take credit for the development of players such as Mbatha, Appollis and Makgopa -- Orlando Pirates stars in their mid-20s -- but the former Cameroon head coach, who won the 2017 AFCON against all odds, was a driving force for South Africa's nationwide shift in attitudes towards young players. Makgopa, in particular, was a beneficiary, as he scored a brace on his Bafana Bafana debut in Broos' first match in charge -- a 3-2 win over Uganda in June 2021. Then at Baroka FC, Makgopa had not been fancied to lead the line at international level, but Broos took a chance on him and it paid off.

Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns -- the two dominant clubs in South Africa over the past decade -- also deserve their fair share of credit.

Sundowns have invested heavily under the ownership of Confederation of African Football president Patrice Motsepe, who bought a controlling stake in 2003 and then the remaining shares the following year. However, the culture of the club changed specifically during Pitso Mosimane's tenure as head coach from 2012 to 2020.

Off the back of a disappointing spell in charge of Bafana Bafana, a reinvigorated Mosimane led Sundowns to their first CAF Champions League title in 2016 -- only the second by a South African club; Pirates previously won it in 1995.

That triumph -- and Sundowns' dominance of the South African Premiership under Mosimane and successors Manqoba Mngqithi, Rhulani Mokwena and Miguel Cardoso -- forced their rivals to level up and take continental competitions more seriously.

None could quite match the financial might of Sundowns, but Pirates improved their talent development and recruitment structures -- and their streamlined squad has closed the gap on a Sundowns side now struggling with fatigue and player discontent after the FIFA Club World Cup, a tournament that saw them impress on the global stage but face struggles keeping their players away from prying eyes elsewhere in the world.

Broos has often encouraged Bafana Bafana players to move overseas, but facing an injury crisis heading into a decisive qualifier, he started with an entirely locally-based XI. South Africa started five Sundowns players -- Ronwen Williams, Khuliso Mudau, Aubrey Modiba, Mokoena and Thapelo Morena -- five Pirates players -- Mbatha, Appollis, Makgopa, Nkosinathi Sibisi and Sipho Mbule -- and one from TS Galaxy, Khulumani Ndamane.

That, alone, speaks volumes of the quality in South Africa's club football.

However, this is nothing new.

What is new -- first and foremost -- is the apparent end of the days when South African players were viewed as too comfortable and pampered to win when the going got tough.

Having finished third at AFCON 2023 in Ivory Coast, Bafana are among the favorites for the tournament in Morocco in December and January. At the World Cup, the goal will be to make the knockout rounds for the first time.

The qualification campaign exposed that the South African Football Association still has a long way to go before it can offer Bafana the support they need to reach their full potential; but if the mentality in the upper echelons of the organization still needs to change, the players and coach are now embodiments of the promise of what South African football is capable of being.

ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 741

UDINE, Italy — Israel lost hope of qualifying for next year's soccer World Cup on Tuesday, after defeat to Italy in a game that took place without major incidents amid boos, protests and a heavy police presence that included snipers on the stadium roof.

Italy won 3-0 in a game that had been placed in the highest risk category despite a breakthrough ceasefire deal that has halted two years of war in Gaza.

There were skirmishes between protesters and police on the streets of Udine at a pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel demonstration before the match, but no serious disruptions during the game itself. However, stewards had to act quickly to prevent a couple of fans from running onto the field carrying Palestinian flags.

“Today wasn't easy for us,” Italy coach Gennaro Gattuso said. “I want to thank the police who have done an incredible job in these days.”

The Israel team bus was escorted to the stadium by 13 police vehicles, including some from the special forces, and several motorbikes.

The sound of helicopters surveilling the city had filled the air since the morning, with drones spotted in the sky and snipers also seen on the roof of the Israel team's hotel.

In the city center, around 10,000 people attended an anti-Israel march, which stayed incident-free for nearly three hours before arriving at its final stop. Then about 50 people — with their faces covered — started clashing with police, who used water cannons and tear gas to try and disperse them.

The group was apparently trying to get past the police cordons to head toward the stadium, which is on the outskirts of the city. They threw metal barriers at riot police as well as flares and other objects and set fire to garbage cans.

Public broadcaster RAI said one of its journalists had to be taken to a hospital after being hit in the face by a rock.

Many shops and restaurants decided not to open on Tuesday and there were strict rules for those that did — including the removal of any outdoor furniture or other objects that could potentially be used as weapons.

Italy also played Israel a year ago in Udine, which was chosen because of the relative difficulty of reaching the city in north-east Italy, near the Slovenian border, and the ease of isolating the stadium, where roadblocks have been set up all around.

The area was declared a “red zone,” and supporters were strongly advised to arrive early because of rigorous checks, with everyone having to pass through metal detectors, too.

Less than 10,000 tickets were sold for the qualifier at the 25,000-seat Stadio Friuli and there appeared to be fewer people inside the stadium than at the demonstration.

The game had been in doubt last month when UEFA considered suspending Israel over the war and Udine Mayor Alberto Felice De Toni called for the game to be postponed.

“Honestly, it wasn't easy… for many days we were always there thinking that maybe there was the possibility of not playing the match,” Gattuso said. “We came, we prepared for it with an environment that we knew was not a festive environment and we felt that.”

There were boos from some fans when the Israeli anthem was played, but the rest of the stadium tried to drown that out with loud applause.

Israel created the better chances early on, with Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma forced into a fine save from winger Manor Solomon.

The Azzurri seldom threatened until Mateo Retegui put them ahead just before the break, after he was fouled and converted the resulting penalty with a right-foot shot into the top corner.

Israel came close to equalizing around the hour mark but Donnarumma saved a shot by Oscar Gloukh, before Retegui netted the second in the 74th by winning possession on the edge of the area, cutting inside and curling his effort into the top corner.

Defender Gianluca Mancini scored with a close-range header in second-half stoppage time to wrap up a comfortable win.

“We really played the game we needed to play. We had everything to lose today. We played very, very well,” Gattuso said after the game. “We all remember the match against Israel a month ago. They made us dance and took us for a ride,” he added, referring to the frantic 5-4 win against Ran Ben Shimon's side.

Italy secured itself at least a playoff spot as it attempts to avoid missing a third straight World Cup.

The Azzurri are second in their group, three points behind Norway and six ahead of Israel, which has played one game more than Italy, has only one game left and therefore has no chance of catching Italy.

Only the group winner advances directly to next year's tournament in North America. The second-place finisher progresses to a playoff — the stage where four-time champion Italy was eliminated during qualifying for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.

President Donald Trump suggested he will work to have 2026 FIFA World Cup games pulled out of Boston if the city's mayor, Michelle Wu, does not curb crime that recently included a violent street takeover targeting police.

Trump made the suggestion while taking questions from the media during Tuesday's meeting with Argentinian President Javier Milei at the White House, threatening to call FIFA President Gianni Infantino to have the games moved to cities that do cooperate, citing safety concerns.

“We can take them away. I love the people of Boston. And I know the games are sold out, but the mayor is not good. There are worse than her. At least she's intelligent. You know, some are extremely low IQ. Those bother me more. She's intelligent, but she's radical left,” Trump said. 

“The answer is yes, if somebody's doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location,' and he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it, very easily he'd do it. And this is the right time to do it.” 

Trump's comments come after a group of people took over one of the city's streets in a violent incident this week.

The president of a union that represents Boston police officers said that people who took part in a recent street takeover in the city were “hell-bent” on attacking law enforcement officials.

According to the Boston Police Department, over 100 people were involved in the takeover that involved street racing just after 2 a.m. on Oct. 5. 

Officers found people trying to attack police cruisers with fireworks, cones, poles and other items.

One police cruiser was destroyed by flames and needed to be towed away from the area, officials said.

Boston is currently set to host seven matches when the World Cup comes to North America next summer.

The slate includes five group-stage games, one Round of 32 fixture and the first quarterfinal on July 9.

Fox News Digital has reached out to Wu's office for further comment.

Trump added that he would also consider pulling the 2028 Summer Olympics out of Los Angeles for similar reasons. 

“I could say the same thing for the Olympics,” he said. 

“If I thought LA was not going to be prepared properly, I'd move it to another location.”

Wu has accused the Trump administration of being a party that “doesn't follow the law.”

“At a time when this federal administration is already causing so much fear and harm in our communities, these threats are serious and consequential,” Wu said in August. 

The remarks came after the Trump administration warned it could sue or cut federal funds if cities refused to cooperate on immigration enforcement.

Casper Ruud recovered quickly from a shaky start on Wednesday, producing a polished serving display to secure victory on his return to the BNP Paribas Nordic Open in Stockholm.

The second seed opened his campaign at the indoor hard-court ATP 250 with a 7-6(2), 6-4 win against the big-hitting Marin Cilic. After falling behind 1-4 in the opening set, Ruud found his rhythm with commanding serves and trademark movement to improve his season record in opening rounds to 14-3.

“It was a good match, I'm very happy,” said Ruud, who improved to 4-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Cilic. “Marin is a great player, very aggressive. He got a better start than me, so I just tried to get my form and rhythm back into the match. I'm really happy with the win.”

Despite his early deficit, Ruud soon took control from the baseline, combining precise groundstrokes with dominant serving to turn the match around. He held serve to love in four straight games in the first set and won all 12 first-serve points in the second, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Ruud's one-hour, 50-minute triumph provided a boost to his bid to reach the Nitto ATP Finals for the fourth time. The 2022 runner-up at the season finale is 11th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. In the quarter-finals, he will face Sebastian Korda.

The 2019 Stockholm champion, Denis Shapovalov, averted a scare against wild card Leo Borg in front of a vibrant atmosphere inside the Royal Tennis Hall. The Canadian failed to serve out the match at 5-4 in the second set, but eventually regrouped for a 6-2, 5-7, 6-1 victory.

Borg, the son of ATP No. 1 Club member Bjorn Borg, was aiming to record his third ATP Tour win, but he was unable to draw on the crowd support and contain Shapovalov in the decider. The third-seeded Canadian is into his fourth Stockholm quarter-final in five appearances at the ATP 250 and awaits Jacob Fearnley or Swedish wild card Elias Ymer.

Korda earlier overcame Kamil Majchrzak 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 in a thrilling two-hour, 33-minute contest. The American dropped just four of 28 points on serve, according to Infosys ATP Stats, in the final set to earn his 100th hard-court win, becoming the fifth player born in the 2000s to do so.

In first-round action on Wednesday,  Lorenzo Sonego kickstarted his quest for a second indoor title by defeating British qualifier Arthur Fery 6-4, 6-2. Sonego set a second-round meeting with Aleksandar Kovecevic, who led eighth seed Camilo Ugo Carabelli 4-6, 7-5, 4-0 when the Argentine was forced to retire through injury.

Marton Fucsovics eased past Jesper de Jong 6-1, 6-2 to book a clash with top seed and 2022 Stockholm champion Holger Rune.

ALMATY—Alex Michelsen didn't arrive to Kazakhstan for this week's Almaty Open until Monday, though he had his reasons. For the American reached his second career ATP Masters 1000 doubles final in Shanghai, ultimately finishing runner-up with Sweden's Andre Goransson.“It's good matches, it's good money and it's good pressure points as well,” he tells TENNIS.com.“It's obviously not anywhere near the same as singles, but you get the serve reps, the return reps, you get the reps at the net, and I think that's really beneficial to my game.”Getting himself back into a match day rhythm paid off two days later. On Wednesday, Michelsen made a winning debut inside the Almaty Arena, defeating local hopeful Beibit Zhukayev, 6-2, 6-3, to snap a five-match losing streak in singles, dating back to the Cincinnati Open.

“Definitely a tough go lately in singles, so super happy to end that little streak I was on. The altitude here, I feel like it's helpful for my game. Shots are penetrating a little more,” assesses Michelsen. “Beibit's got a massive serve, so I knew going in that he was gonna hold serve well. I think he might have hurt himself. I saw he had a lot of tape and his back was taped up.“I played super well at the baseline for the first time in a long time. A lot of positives going forward.”The world No. 36 evened his career indoor record to 10-10. When asked, Michelsen agrees it's a playing environment he should be generating more success from given his game. “I've definitely underachieved indoors,” he states before expressing that he “absolutely loves” playing under a roof.Against Zhukayev, his intent to finish at the net where possible was clear throughout their encounter.“The balls die like they do everywhere nowadays, but when they're not super dead, I think it's a little easier to be offensive. Especially in the altitude, the balls are flying a little more,” he says. “That's one of the key components of my game and I can be on my front foot looking to come forward.”

After his victory, the on-court emcee presented the 21-year-old with a Kazakh coin for his collection. Michelsen hasn't had much time to spare for sightseeing in the city hosting his latest tour stop. Beyond the quick turnaround from China, the two-person team working with the Aliso Viejo, Calif. native this week includes a familiar face and a new addition whose career-high ranking of No. 30 is equal to Michelsen's.“I'm here with Kristof Vliegen, new coach. As of now we're doing a little trial period,” he reveals. “So let's see how it goes. And then I'm with my trainer Byron (Manning), I've been with him for a couple of years.”A win Thursday over Aleksandar Vukic would send Michelsen through to his seventh tour-level quarterfinal of the year. The sixth seed is bidding to become the ninth first-time winner on the ATP Tour this season.“I definitely want to get a title. I was one point away last year in the Newport final, so that's one of the goals moving forward for sure,” wraps up Michelsen.

ALMATY—It's all in the details, some say.Daniil Medvedev is buying into that notion, as he continues settling into his new coaching team of Thomas Johansson and Rohan Goetzke.The 2021 US Open champion is coming off a semifinal showing at the Rolex Shanghai Masters, his first run to the last four of a 1000-level event in more than six months. As he describes the early goings of the collaboration, it's one that is honing in on touching up his existing brand of tennis.“I think my game is complete enough, but it needs a lot of small details to add here and there and that's what we're looking for,” he told press Wednesday in Almaty during the English portion of his pre-tournament press conference.“It's everything: forehand, backhand, volley, serve. It's already good enough because I was number one, but small details needs to be improved.”

Medvedev mutually ended an eight-year partnership with coach Gilles Cervara after his first-round loss to Benjamin Bonzi at the US Open. There wasn't much time to get acquainted with Johansson and Goetzke ahead of an encouraging Asian swing, where he also advanced to the Beijing semifinals after dismissing Alexander Zverev.“It's just a start. We made good results in China for sure. When you start playing better, you want to do more, and I know how to do more, but it's a step by step process for sure,” said Medvedev.“It's not also easy to judge because there are tournaments, so we had like a week in Monaco and then it's tournament after tournament. There is no time to really do something big, but so far it has been working well, so we'll see how it goes later.”

The Russian is seeded second this week in Almaty, behind Wednesday's practice partner and defending champion Karen Khachanov. He's well-acquainted with Kazakhstan, though this marks his first trip to the Apple City. Needless to say, Medvedev's liked what he's seen with the operation so far at Almaty Arena.“They do a great job, the federation and the tournament itself. For a 250, it's a really, really good one. Everyone who came here for the first time is telling this,” he shared.“I heard a lot of good things about Almaty. Getting in a bit late from Shanghai, I'm not gonna have much time to see the city. I went to the center once already.”

Naomi Osaka battled past defending champion Suzan Lamens in three sets to reach the Kinoshita Group Japan Open quarterfinals, but suffered an injury scare in the match's closing stages.

No. 1 seed Naomi Osaka came out on top of a 7-6(6), 3-6, 6-2 battle with defending champion Suzan Lamens to reach the Kinoshita Group Japan Open quarterfinals, but suffered an injury scare in the closing stages of the match that left her limping off court.

Osaka: Scores | Draws | Order of play

A high-quality contest had seen Osaka respond well to Lamens' challenge, raising her level to pull away from the surging Dutchwoman in the third set. But with Lamens serving down 5-0 but up 30-15, Osaka pulled up on her left leg. Lamens sprayed a backhand wide on that point, but won the next, and at 40-30 to Lamens, Osaka requested a medical time-out.

Returning to the court with her left thigh strapped and with her movement significantly hampered, a visibly distressed Osaka attempted to close the match out with first-strike tennis that bypassed extended rallies. She was unable to take two match points on her own serve at 5-1, double faulting on the first and netting a backhand on the second. However, she was able to get over the line on return, summoning up a backhand winner to convert her third match point.

"It was definitely really difficult -- I'm kind of sorry about my attitude," Osaka said in an on-court interview that had to be cut short due to her leg pain.

In press, Osaka was hopeful that she could continue in the tournament.

"I took Advils, so I think it feels better than what it is right now, but obviously it doesn't feel good," she said. "I couldn't really move that well. It's not good, but I think I'm a fast healer so it should be OK for my next match."

Prior to the injury, Osaka had managed to raise her level in key moments to take control of the contest. Both players took their time to fully settle -- Lamens lost the first eight points of the match, including consecutive double faults to open her first service game; Osaka then conceded nine straight points to go down a break. Lamens threw in an error-strewn game when attempting to serve the set out at 5-4, and at 5-5 in the ensuing tiebreak Osaka played her best point of the set to inch ahead.

Lamens swiftly put the disappointment behind her, finding her form with her lethal forehand to take the second set. At the start of the third, the 26-year-old seemed poised to pull away after winning the best point of the match, ending a 19-stroke lung-buster with a thumping forehand winner on the line. Osaka responded immediately. On the very next point, she came up with a hot shot of her own, ending a 12-stroke athletic exchange with a superb backhand angle.

"Emotionally, I was going through a lot in this match," Osaka said. "And then in the third set I tried my best to have no regrets."

Osaka is scheduled to face Jaqueline Cristian in the quarterfinals on Friday. The Romanian rebounded from a first-set whitewash to defeat No. 8 seed Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 0-6, 6-4, 6-2, avenging a first-round loss to the Spaniard in Beijing three weeks ago.

Hair journey update in Osaka ☺️

“This is a very weird video,” Osaka starts, laughing. “I've been really struggling with my hair for like the past two years. Like, during pregnancy and after pregnancy I lost my edges and stuff.“They're back now,” she adds proudly. “Well, kind of. Kind of! Don't look too closely. I also dyed my hair a lot, so I had to cut it off, blah, blah, blah. But I think it's back now.”According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, postpartum hair loss—known as telogen effluvium—is common after childbirth:“Postpartum hair thinning or hair loss… occurs when hormone levels drop back to their regular levels after childbirth… Postpartum hair loss usually ends about 6–12 months after giving birth. Most women see their hair returning to its normal thickness as their hormone levels stabilize.”Read More: Naomi Osaka opens up about body image struggles, pressure to “snap back” after giving birthOsaka welcomed her daughter Shai on July 7, 2023, after stepping away from tennis in late 2022. She returned to training just two weeks later and has since spoken openly about body image challenges and the pressure—self-imposed and external—to “snap back.”“Anyway, I've been wearing a ponytail, as you can tell, because I didn't know how to wear my hair,” Osaka says later in the TikTok. “And then I watched one TikTok yesterday—don't look too close, again—but I think we're back! Hey!”

An Oscar-nominated actress, Penelope Milford, celebrated for her captivating performances in “Coming Home” and “Heathers,” has died at age 77. As per a report in The Hollywood Reporter, her family confirmed she passed away on Tuesday in an assisted living facility in Saugerties, New York. The cause of death was not disclosed.

A post shared by Fernando Duarte (@fernandoduartegts1)

Milford was best known for her Academy Award–nominated role as Jane Fonda's free-spirited roommate in Hal Ashby's 1978 drama “Coming Home.”

 Her performance earned her widespread critical praise and placed her among Hollywood's most promising talents of the era.

Milford's film career included memorable roles in “Valentino,” where she portrayed a silent film star opposite Rudolf Nureyev, and Franco Zeffirelli's “Endless Love.” 

She later brought humor and heart to the cult classic “Heathers,” playing the empathetic school guidance counselor Pauline Fleming.

A post shared by Jodee Jernigan (@jodeejernigan)

Her work in “Coming Home” earned her one of four Oscar nominations for the film, alongside co-stars Jane Fonda, Jon Voight, and Bruce Dern. 

A post shared by Andrew Glazebrook (@glazy_uk)

Maggie Smith ultimately won the Academy Award that year for “California Suite”. Her portrayal of Vi Munson remains one of the most moving depictions of compassion and friendship in 1970s cinema.

A post shared by Chris O'Neill (@chrisoneill2020)

Before finding success on film, she honed her craft on stage, appearing twice on Broadway. She joined the 1972 cast of “Lenny” and later earned a Drama Desk nomination for her performance in the long-running Civil War musical “Shenandoah.”

Mildford's stage presence carried over into television and film, with credits in “The Last Word,” “Take This Job and Shove It,” “Normal Life,” and the acclaimed telefilms “Seizure: The Story of Kathy Morris” and “The Burning Bed.” Critics often praised her for bringing emotional intelligence and depth to every role she took on.

The actress rose to prominence in both television and film after getting her start on Broadway. Metro reported that she performed opposite Richard Gere in the acclaimed play “Richard Fariña: Long Time Coming and a Long Time Gone,” and the two later dated offstage.

Away from the screen, Milford also ran an art gallery in Los Angeles in the mid-1980s and dedicated time to teaching acting and performing in local theater (as reported by Variety). A devout Christian Scientist, she later moved to Saugerties in 2003, where she remodeled a historic home and stayed involved in her community.

Her brother, actor and musician Kim Milford, died in 1980 at age 37, as reported by The Huffington Post. She was briefly married to poet Michael Lally during the 1980s. She is survived by her brother Douglas and three nieces and nephews.

Her artistic legacy, from her Academy Award recognition to her lifelong devotion to creative expression, continues to inspire fans and fellow performers around the world.

It feels like we've lived a thousand lives since Red, White & Royal Blue first introduced viewers to the star-crossed love story of first son Alex Claremont-Diaz (Taylor Zakhar Perez) and Prince Henry of England (Nicholas Galitzine) in 2023. Galitzine has completely transformed his body to play He-Man in the upcoming Masters Of The Universe movie, for example. We also, uh, have a new president in the White House. If that latter update has you craving a sweet serving of political escapism, the team behind the original film is cooking up a sequel with a new director at the helm. But I'm A Cheerleader‘s Jamie Babbit will take the reins for the follow-up, officially titled Red, White & Royal Wedding, Variety reports. Looks like the palace may have to order a brand new giant cake; hopefully this one won't end up on the floor.

“After directing But I'm A Cheerleader in my 20s, I'm thrilled to be back in the queer love universe of Red, White & Royal Wedding,'” Babbit said in a statement. “We all need this kind of optimism, fantasy, and gay joy. I'm thrilled to work with this brilliant team.” The Red, White & Royal Wedding script was written by Gemma Burgess, original Red, White & Royal Blue director Matthew López, and Casey McQuiston, who wrote the novel the movie was based on in 2019. In their own statement, McQuiston thanked López for “all his hard work on the first movie and in co-creating this new story with me” and lauded Babbit for having “the vision, wit, and tenderness to take great care of Alex and Henry from here.” 

If you're looking for hints about where the story could go, don't look at Zakhar Perez. “I said, ‘Don't tell me anything,'” he recently shared when Variety asked him if there was anything he could tease. “Because if I'm asked about it, it's going to be tough to not Tom Holland it and talk a little Spider-Man.” Strays toward Holland's loose lips aside, Zakhar Perez did expound on why the first film felt so important when the sequel was announced in 2024. Red, White & Royal Blue was number one on Amazon “in countries where it's quite literally illegal to be queer,” he said. “I think it's just as important for those a part of the community and those that are not part of the community to watch this project and just learn something, enjoy it, laugh.” Prime Video has not shared a release timeline for Red, White & Royal Wedding as of this writing, but expect to receive that save the date in the mail soon.

	The Daniels' untitled movie is back on the Universal schedule, now set for Friday, Nov. 19, 2027. That's the Friday before Thanksgiving, which falls on Nov. 25 that year. 


	The next movie from the multi-Oscar winning Everything Everywhere All at Once duo is shrouded in secrecy. The movie's release will rep a little more than five years since Everything Everywhere All at Once hit theaters, that A24 title still anomaly at the specialty box office as theaters were fitting their footing roughly a year after their 2021 re-opening from Covid's closure. 


	The movie was originally scheduled for June 12, 2026 before being unset. The Daniels' movie takes the place of a reserved hold that Universal had on Nov. 19, 2027 for an untitled event movie. The pic is scheduled to open before Disney's Frozen 3 on Nov. 24, 2027. 

	











	Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert inked a five-year exclusive deal with Universal back in August 2022.

Everything Everywhere All at Once world premiered like a house on fire at SXSW in the spring of 2022 and went on to gross $77.1M domestic, $142.8M worldwide, becoming the highest grossing A24 theatrical release ever. 


Everything Everywhere All at Once won seven Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director for the Daniels, Best Actress for Michelle Yeoh, Supporting Actor for Ke Huy Quan and Supporting Actress for Jamie Lee Curtis.

	We've confirmed that Jim Carrey is in talks to star in Warner Bros.' live-action feature take of The Jetsons with Colin Trevorrow also eyeing to direct. 


	Trevorrow and Joe Epstein are in talks to write. 


	The original animated series was produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and aired on ABC from Sept. 23, 1962-March 17, 1963. There was an animated series reboot that ran from 1985-1987. 


	The show followed George Jetson, corporate suit dad, in future world of flying cars, high-rises and moving sidewalk escalators. He works for a cantankerous boss, Mr. Spacely. George's wife is Jane, posh teenage daughter is Judy, and little son Elroy. Rosie the robot is confined to chores.

			Watch on Deadline		







	One of Warners' more popular live-action takes of a Hanna-Barbera cartoon was Scooby-Doo which was released in 2002 and spawned a 2004 sequel, Scooby-Doo: Monsters Unleashed. Raja Gosnell directed both off a script by James Gunn (now Warner Bros' co-Head of DC). Freddie Prinze Jr starred as Fred, Sarah Michelle Gellar was Daphne, Matthew Lillard played Shaggy and Linda Cardellini broke out as Velma. Both movies grossed close to a half billion at the global box office. 


	Warners had no comment. Carrey, the No. 1 blockbuster star of original feature comedies in the 1990s and early aughts before those became extinct in the streaming era, has found success in franchises of late, specifically, Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog series playing villains Ivo Robotnik and, in the third installment, Gerald Robotnik. That trilogy had grossed north of $1.2 billion.

Wrong director!

KEVIN SPACELY OR BUST

Hear me out : RUPERT GRINT for George Jetson. Yes, he's only 37 but I feel like it could work really well. He fits the part (the hair! The vibe), has worked with WB on Harry Potter series…. He'd be an inspired choice. Cast Jim Carrey as the primary villain or as Spacely (and Danny Devito /Peter Dinklage as Spacey if not.) and boom. Maybe cast Samara Weaving or Isla Fisher as his wife??

WB should crack open the excellent Alexander and Karaszewski script that they wrote way-back-when for Turner Pictures – it's excellent.

He's a bit too old to play a father to a teenagers and little boy in my opinion . George is middle aged (in his 40s) in the show. But I'd watch Jim Carrey in any role so I won't complain. He'd be a better fit for Spacely.

Yeah, He would have been a great choice – 20 years ago. He's too old now for George I think. He may be too tall for Spaceley – maybe Cogswell?

NBC News is clearing out its newsroom ahead of parent company NBCUniversal's impending split. The organization plans to lay off 100 to 150 staffers as the larger company undergoes its divorce proceedings, Variety reports. It apparently couldn't let those employees go without playing a little mind game, however. The trade reports that “many” of the departing staffers will be encouraged to reapply for one of 140 open roles that remain active—despite the layoffs—across the company's news operations. Additionally, about a dozen of the eliminated roles are being “repurposed” as new roles, meaning those staffers will have the unique pleasure of applying for what will probably look at least a bit like the job they already had. (Representatives from NBC News did not immediately reply to The A.V. Club‘s request for comment on this story.)

The cuts represent between seven and eight percent of the news operations' staff, per Variety. At least they aren't coming totally out of the blue. Employees have reportedly anticipated this for weeks, as NBC News Group, the umbrella division that represents NBC News as well as CNBC and MSNBC, which will both be housed under new spin-off company Versant, is being split in two along with the parent company. Revenue from the latter two networks that previously supported the entire news operation will soon be funneled to Versant. Still, there may be some hope for laid off employees who want to stay with the company but don't want to just reapply for the same old jobs. Last week, NBC News Group Chairman Cesar Conde discussed plans to launch a new subscription product for mobile audiences and grow the company's focus on sports, Variety reports.

Unfortunately, NBC News employees aren't the only newsroom staffers bracing for cuts. Paramount Skydance is expected to slash up to 10 percent of CBS News' staff as new editor-in-chief Bari Weiss settles into her role. (A memo she sent to staff last week asking “how you spend your working hours” certainly didn't help morale.) CNN also laid off around 6 percent of its workforce earlier this year.

The lasting effects of Stephen King's horror novel It can be felt almost 40 years after the book was published, thanks to its traumatizing villain. And now Pennywise's origin story makes its way to the small screen in HBO's Welcome To Derry, which premieres October 26. The prequel series brings It‘s Bill Skarsgård back into the fold as the maniacal clown who gleefully terrorizes and attacks children. But the show also delves deep into the eerie lore of  its titular small Maine town, with stories inspired by the interludes in King's novel. Series co-creator Andy Muschietti, who helmed 2017's It and Chapter Two, tells The A.V. Club that he's been itching to get back to this franchise since the latter film was released in 2019. 

Set in 1962—a whole 27 years before the Losers initially encountered Pennywise in the recent films—Welcome To Derry introduces a new group of kids who become the creature's targets. Muschietti dubs them the “new Losers,” who investigate the disappearance of a friend in the sewers while confronting some of their darkest fears. Meanwhile, the adults (played by the likes of Jovan Adepo, Taylour Paige, Chris Chalk, and James Remar) embark on their own secret missions that unwittingly put them on the same dangerous path as the kids. All roads, of course, lead to Pennywise. 

The A.V. Club spoke to Muschietti about establishing Welcome To Derry‘s “intense” tone and aesthetic, bringing in a major King character, crafting a new narrative that ties into the Native American community, and how much we'll get to see of Skarsgård in that darn clown costume. 

The A.V. Club: What was it about the interludes in Stephen King's books that felt like compelling entry points for an It spin-off? 

Andy Muschietti: So there are two things here. One was we all shared a desire to go into the origins of Pennywise or the monster who became the clown. And part of that equation was the conversations I had with Bill Skarsgård while filming It Chapter Two. Both of us were excited about the prospect. We thought it would be a movie at first. But then life happened, and we went into different projects. But this idea kept coming back to me and took shape into something deeper and more extended. It was my curiosity that made me dig into the other parts of Stephen King's book, particularly the research and investigation done by Losers Club member Mike Hanlon that form the interludes that are shrouded in mystery. Mike just gets bits and pieces of information, and he tries to build this puzzle, but never gets to put all the pieces together. In a way, I desired to put those pieces together and create an expanded story about everything that happened in Derry before the events of the movies, and hopefully create a compelling, emotional story. 

AVC: The show takes place in 1962. How does this specific time period affect the arc and aesthetics of the show? 

AM: 1962 is the Pennywise cycle previous to the story in the movie, but in the book, the main story happens in 1958 with the kids. So that was exciting to us right away because even if it's not the same characters, we're going into a similar cultural era covered in the book. We wanted to capitalize on the fear of being in the Cold War and the panic of possibly being bombed by Russia. There's also another range of fears from this era I wanted to tap into from the kids' perspective, which is things like radioactive mutations. Using both those angles to help with the creation of this world, aesthetically speaking, was appealing. I treated this season as if it were a movie, in the sense that we got Chapter Two‘s production designer [Paul D. Austerberry] and costume designer [Luis Sequeira] because I wanted to preserve that cinematic feel. Everybody was very excited to jump into the early '60s and embrace not only the aesthetic parts but the deeper idiosyncrasies of what an American small town at that time was like.

AVC: Does the show match the film's tone in terms of creepiness, or did you get to change things since you have eight hourlong episodes? 

AM: I wanted to maintain the same tone of the movie because I wanted the movies themselves to maintain the tone of the book, which is terribly scary and graphically violent. There are heightened emotions, but there's also a lot of humor. The mandate for me was always being faithful to all that, but I will say the show does get more intense. We had the opportunity to make it creepier because it's a bigger canvas with more characters and more of their fears to explore. The intention is to take things to the edge and give audiences more than what they've experienced in the movies before. 

AVC: You directed the opening scene of the premiere, which is quite gnarly and further helps establish that creepy tone. 

AM: Yeah, I wanted to establish a sense of how no one is really safe in this world, which is a little bit of the same idea that we expressed in the first movie's opening with Georgie's death, which is pretty gruesome, and also with Adrian Mellon's death at the beginning of Chapter Two. In general, as an opening for the show, I wanted to create an augmented feeling that nothing is sacred or safe in Derry. The challenge was how to do it and make it more spectacular, especially for people who have seen the movies and understand how effective a graphic incident like the show's opening scene is. It all comes from what I mentioned before about my desire to make a creature that stems from what a kid's fear in the early '60s was, which is a mutant of some sort. 

AVC: Did you always sign up to direct four installments, or did that choice come about naturally while working on the scripts? 

AM: That part evolved a bit. I knew I wanted to develop and create the show with other writers, but I knew I couldn't direct all eight because that's a big task. I also wanted time to make other movies. But over the course of the first few months, as the drafts were happening, I realized that I wanted to do more, so I thought I'd direct episodes one and two for the specific reason of establishing certain new characters. I was committed to that. And then I said, “Well, of course I'll do the finale, too.” But the lead-up to our finale is so great that I didn't want to not be part of the penultimate episode. So then I committed to doing those four, and I love and respect the other directors who came aboard.



AVC: A huge source of tension in It is the disconnect between the kids experiencing Pennywise's terrors and the adults not necessarily believing them. How does that aspect factor into Welcome To Derry? 

AM: Yeah, that's the fog in Derry, when adults don't seem to see or pay attention to what's going on. It's mostly about the kids suffering. Kids are gifted with the ability to imagine things that don't exist, for good and for bad. Our monster is a creature made of belief and will obviously target and use that as bait, which is more effective on younger people. That's one of the reasons we wanted to go back to his origins, to understand more the how and why of It becoming a clown. This fog is based on what Stephen King perceives as a sort of real-life behavior and a larger reflection about childhood versus adulthood. There are moments when you become an adult where your imagination fades away, unless you carry the child that you were within you. We absolutely use it in our show as a love letter to memory and the child inside who keeps the imagination alive. The fog is the end of childhood. Adults don't pay attention to everything in the world of children; that's impossible to do when you're occupied with life stuff. When we don't listen to kids to the full extent that we should, things can get forgotten or overlooked, or brushed under the carpet. 

AVC: Another important arc seems to be about the Native American rituals and beliefs about the monster and how they tie into what the adults are doing.

AM: The intervention of Native characters in the book is very important, and we wanted to grab it and extend it. In the interludes, it unlocks the investigations of the Losers and makes them face reality differently. I was always very attentive to that in the book. Natives were the first people on this land and so the first people who encountered It. In many ways, their story is as or more important than the story that our Losers go through. But it's a big question mark in the book about how this happened. So we basically go into that in the show and open the drawer to create a story that might be unfamiliar to readers as well. It's a new narrative that connects to the Indigenous community. 

AVC: One of the main characters is Dick Hallorann, played by Chris Chalk, who fans of The Shining will be familiar with. What was the idea behind bringing him into Welcome To Derry in such a big way? 

AM: Dick has a very predominant role in this story. In the book, he's part of the Black Spot tragedy when it burned down, but that story is told in fragmented pieces. We don't know the full extent of Dick's participation, and that's what we wanted to find out here. We realized he plays a much larger role. Chris Chalk is exceptional in this. I hadn't known him before in person before casting him, and when I saw his tape, it blew my mind. He brought a great deal of mysticism, but he's also grounded. His character goes on a weird journey as someone who has “the shine” and is in conflict with that throughout.

AVC: We can't end without a tease of just how much we'll see of Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise.

AM: I cannot say when and how Pennywise appears because it would be a spoiler. Of course, we're going to see him incarnated in different ways, but eventually, we will see the clown that we all love to hate. There was an attempt to keep Bill not in the proximity of the new young actors to preserve that aura that he has when he's in costume and in character, at least just to preserve the first scene when they all see each other. But then, after that, everyone quickly became friends with Bill. He's very careful about the effect he has on people when he's in costume, but all the actors were very excited about Pennywise showing up on set.

Promise, the AI studio backed by Google, Peter Chernin's North Road and Michael Ovitz's Crossbeam, is launching The Generation Company, led by Nem Perez, to bring visual effects to traditional studios.

	An AI entertainment studio backed by the likes of Google, Andreessen Horowitz, Peter Chernin's North Road Company and Michael Ovitz's Crossbeam wants to bring its generative AI expertise to traditional studios and production companies.


Promise, led by Fullscreen founder George Strompolos, former YouTube executive Jamie Byrne, who most recently led creator partnerships for YouTube; and AI filmmaker Dave Clark, is launching a new division called The Generation Company, which will work with outside studios and production companies to deliver visual effects and sequences created with its tech.

	The Generation Company will be led by filmmaker and generative AI artist Nem Perez, who previously founded the virtual production and AI workflow company Storyblocker, and also directed music videos for the likes of Mac Miller, Nipsey Hussle, and Chance the Rapper.


	“With The Generation Company, Promise is bringing our GenAI filmmaking expertise to partners as a true creative ally, helping them achieve their vision and push ideas beyond the limits of traditional resources, timelines, and budgets,” said Byrne, the co-founder, president and COO of Promise. “Nem is a pioneer in applying GenAI to filmmaking, building on a career leading creative teams across entertainment, advertising, and music. His work with some of the world's top GenAI artists makes him uniquely positioned to help storytellers navigate this new frontier with both artistry and precision.”


	“I believe GenAI exists to serve the artist, opening the door to cinematic moments that might otherwise be impossible,” adds Perez, head of The Generation Company. “For me, it's about honoring the craft I've devoted my career to while embracing new tools that expand what's possible on screen. With human expression driving everything we do, filmmakers and creative partners who work with The Generation Company can bring their full vision to life on their own terms.”

	











	In addition to VFX and sequences, the company will also provide a team of AI specialists meant to advise creative departments like art, costume, props, and storyboarding.


	Promise was founded last year with the goal of building out a slate of films and series using generative AI tech. Earlier this year it raised more money, with Google and Crossbeam joining its list of investors, while also making its first acquisition: The tech-centric film school Curious Refuge, which teaches filmmakers how ton utilize advanced technology in their workflows.


	The Generation Company expands Promise's business further into the services world, seeking a piece of the production puzzle that has been most disrupted by technology, as studios seek more realistic and elaborate VFX while also seeking to manage costs.

	The eight-episode first season follows a mercenary (Sy) who embarks on a dangerous mission to rescue hostages in Libya. Trapped between warring factions and ruthless killers, he must navigate life-or-death choices while confronting deep emotional wounds. 


	The 2020 action thriller Extraction, directed by Sam Hargrave, was based on the graphic novel Ciudad by Ande Parks, with art by Fernando León González, and co-written by Joe and Anthony Russo. Hemsworth stars as an Australian black ops mercenary who takes on a mission to save an Indian drug lord's kidnapped son in Dhaka, Bangladesh, but the mission goes awry when he is double-crossed.

	











	A sequel, Extraction 2, was released in 2023, with the main cast reprising their roles. The movie brings back Hemsworth's Rake, who is tasked with a new mission — rescuing the battered family of a ruthless Georgian gangster from the prison where they are being held. AGBO produced both films.


	In addition to the Russo Brothers and Mazzara, executive producers include Angela Russo-Otstot, Scott Nemes, and Chris Castaldi for AGBO, Sam Hargrave, Eric Gitter, and Peter Schwerin, Netflix & AGBO: A Proven Partnership. Ari Costa produces for AGBO.

Karl Marx himself may have written that “history repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.” Still, not even the most dedicated members of Japan's Red Army Faction — a militant, “Communist Manifesto”-carrying group most famous for hijacking a JAL flight in the spring of 1970 — could have imagined their signature action would eventually be restaged as a slick and sprawling Netflix comedy combining the smirking political satire of “Burn After Reading” with the cold-blooded visual dynamism of a Park Chan-wook film. 

 










Sure, the Yodogo Hijacking Incident wasn't quite a tragedy, and “Good News” is just a bit too grounded to feel like a true farce, but the disconnect between the severity of what happened and the blitheness with which Korean director Byun Sung-hyun (“The Merciless”) has re-imagined it is striking enough to affirm Marx's point. I have to imagine that the hijackers would've been happy about that; bumbling and inept as they appear in Byun's movie, their conviction smacks of courage when compared to the spinelessness of the bureaucrats tasked with solving the crisis, all of whom care more about their own egos and careers than they do the 130 passengers whose lives are at stake.

Just droll, twisty, and stylish enough to forgive this 136-minute film for using a lot more runway than it needs to be airborne, “Good News” is a veritable caricature of middle-management — an epic parody of passing the buck. That so few of the actual facts have been changed, despite an impishly self-conflicting disclaimer that insists it was “inspired by real events” but also that “all of the characters and events portrayed are fictional,” only serves to strengthen Byun's damning portrayal of political cowardice.

For all of the lip service that Byun and Lee Jin-seong's knotted script pays to the relative nature of truth, however, “Good News” initially makes it easy to separate fact from fiction. Did heavily armed hijackers commandeer a Boeing 727 as part of their plan to further a worldwide revolution against the United States and its allies? Indeed, and an opening flurry of newsreel footage helps to confirm that we aren't completely outside of history. Did the Communists obsessively quote the boxing manga “Ashita no Joe” as a source of inspiration? Was their leader as handsome as “Tokyo Vice” star Show Kasamatsu, or their youngest member barely old enough to fly without parental supervision? Probably not. 

 










Did the crisis highlight the Kafkaesque absurdity of Cold War politics by sparking an international circle-jerk between various representatives from South Korea, North Korea, Japan, America, and the Soviet Union? You bet. Did the South Koreans rely on the help of a rumpled and mysterious fixer called “Nobody” (a Lupin the III-esque Sul Kyung-gu, his character wise enough to treat the whole situation like a cosmic joke) to goad everyone into action? I highly doubt it, but history tends to forget the people who refuse to accept credit for it. Ditto those who manage to avoid taking the blame.

“Good News” has plenty of fun exaggerating the personas of the different parties involved in the situation, from the violent JAL chairman who only cares about his brand, to the veteran airplane pilot who can't stop complaining about his hemorrhoids, and the Korean Central Intelligence Agency Director (Ryoo Seung-bum) who tries to wash his hands of this entire shitshow like a used car salesman desperate to move an old lemon off the lot. But the movie only really takes flight after the line between “tragedy” and “farce” begins to blur, like when a proactive air force “double parks” a jet in front of the 727 as it stops to refuel. (The visual of the two planes facing each other on the tarmac as the pilot scampers away from his vehicle is a real laugh-out-loud moment in a movie that tends to fall back on knowing smiles.) 

 










Funny as it is, that sequence pales in comparison to what happens later, when a young Korean Air Force lieutenant named Seo (Hong Kyung) has the bright idea of executing a double hijack. The Red Army Faction believes they're flying into Pyongyang, but Seo — in a standoff that's shot like a Sergio Leone spaghetti western, complete with ultra-wide framing, skintight leather chaps, and a few errant tumbleweeds for good measure — wrests control of the radio frequency from his North Korean counterparts and fools the hijackers into landing in Seoul's Gimpo International Airport instead. 

Remarkably, this part of the story is rooted in truth. Gimpo really was hastily outfitted to resemble Pyongyang in the hopes that the hijackers would believe they'd succeeded. Byun simply “yes ands” the record by imagining that an overweight local movie director was recruited to complete the illusion with a fleet of costumed extras waiting for the Red Army Faction on the “North Korean” runway. Like everyone else in this movie, however, the director wants to frame this story on his own terms (“If I can't capture this historical moment on film, I at least want to participate in it!”), and his eagerness to control the action risks creating new conflict. 

 










Not only does this display of egomaniacal buffoonery make for “Good News”' most effective setpiece, the sheer absurdity of the situation embellished by Byun's arch framing and previously unknown flair for dry comedy, it also epitomizes the core ethos of a film in which shaping the narrative is always more important than saving the hostages. Even the relatively noble and clear-headed Seo is motivated by the legacy of his father's sacrifice, which complicates his feelings about the value of heroism even as it pushes him to make the most of his moment in the limelight. 

“Good News” has no compunctions about depicting its characters — even and especially the South Korean ones — as narcissistic dolts. But these larger-than-life figures are as broad as their context is hyper-specific. That functional mismatch saps away at the comedy of a film clearly made to be enjoyed by a global audience. (Netflix is releasing it around the world at the same time, and the multi-language audio track will unhelpfully default to English for anyone who tries to stream the movie from America.) Pointed gestures toward the lingering tension between Japan and Korea — and between those two countries and the rest of the planet — are drowned out by tiresome bickering and exaggerated gags, like a meaningful conversation swallowed into the sound of an airplane engine screaming overhead.

 










Byun's visual playfulness is likewise compelling enough to compensate for the shortcuts in his storytelling — active camerawork and inventive CGI combine with Jo Hyoung-rae's heightened cinematography to imbue the film's airplane cabins and flight control towers with a vivid sense of theatricality. Yet the director is so eager to make a spectacle out of this scenario that “Good News” begins to feel as self-insistent as its characters. 

Perhaps that's by design, and Byun is bending his own form towards a damning commentary on universal self-interest — even in the face of a crisis. But the movie's soft-hearted underbelly fails to support that reading, and by the time the story finally arrives at its final moments, the unsparing cynicism that supplied its initial lift has been dragged back down to Earth by the weight of bland truisms. In a rich but increasingly disappointing film where everyone is trying so hard to pass the buck, it's only fitting that viewers end up holding the bag.

“Good News” will be available to stream on Netflix starting Friday, October 17.

EXCLUSIVE: Nia Long and Larenz Tate, stars of New Line's romantic drama Love Jones, who have more recently worked together on Lionsgate's Michael Jackson biopic Michael, are set to reteam once again on an untitled romantic drama from Sylvie's Love helmer Eugene Ashe that has been greenlighted at Netflix.


	Inspired by Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite, the debut album from R&B artist Maxwell, the film's logline is being kept under wraps. Ashe is directing from a script written with Kay Oyegun, a writer-producer best known for work on NBC's This Is Us.


	James Lopez, Charles D. King, and Poppy Hanks are producing for Macro Film Studios, with Maxwell, John D. Hammond, Long, and Tate serving as executive producers. Sources said the project was shopped to Netflix after being put into turnaround at Amazon.

Few contemporary films about unresolved childhood abuse — which is always unresolved, in the end, anyway — cut as narrowly close to the bone as Elliot Tuttle's two-hander masked as provocation, “Blue Film.” 

Rejected by mainstream film festivals before it premiered in Edinburgh this summer and NewFest in New York in October, this taboo-busting study of a masculine camboy confronted by the pedophile teacher who many years ago desired him holds back little and offers even less that's palatable to swallow. Its limitations as a stagelike piece aside, the movie wrings emotional complexity from a fraught, ever-shifting dialogue between a convicted child abuser and the student, now a late twenties sex worker, he spared.

“Blue Film,” which takes place entirely in a rented Hancock Park Airbnb in Los Angeles with only two actors, dares to go places I have not seen an American movie travel to in a while. There was an Israeli movie called “Princess” at Sundance in 2014, directed by Tali Shalom Ezer, which freaked a lot of people out. It was about a 12-year-old girl's “close relationship” with her mother's boyfriend. There was the 2011 Austrian movie “Michael,” directed by Michael Haneke protégé Markus Schleinzer, about an insurance salesman sexually abusing the 10-year-old boy locked up in his basement. These were shocking. Neither were American.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Tuttle, an American filmmaker himself who received support on the project from Mark Duplass of all possible collaborators, is willing to take you to those same dark places, ones that remind you of European directors who want to shake you with their frank psychosexual provocations. It's impressive where Tuttle, this second-time feature filmmaker, goes with his surprisingly humanistic and empathetic approach to material about abuse. One where a pedophile teacher's sexual fantasy about his former student's talent show performance emerges as oddly wistful.

“Blue Film” stars rising actor Kieron Moore as dom camboy Aaron Eagle (whose real name is Alex McConnell) opposite Reed Birney as his estranged middle school teacher, who reconnect over one night filled with conversations about desire, shame, and guilt. I'm not surprised festivals, allegedly such as Sundance and SXSW, looked away from it. Mainstream audiences will be alienated by this unapologetic exploration of quote-unquote aberrant sexuality, but those looking for a challenge in the vein of ‘90s films from Todd Solondz or Gregg Araki will feel seen in Tuttle's exploration of how abuse warps memory, and memory warps accounts of abuse.

In asking you to feel sorry for a pedophile while making a gay man his scene partner, “Blue Film” dances on the tricky line from early abuse to later-in-life sexual behavior. When the movie begins, we see Aaron (Moore), sweaty and hairy in white briefs and tattooed top-to-toe, putting on a live stream for his submissive followers. One of his anonymous fans offers $50,000 for an in-person meet-and-greet. Financially desperate, he agrees to spend the night with the client, who greets him sheathed in a balaclava with the promise of even more money and perhaps pizza if Aaron is willing to open up about himself.

 










That client, it turns out, is Mr. Grant, aka Hank, Aaron's long-ago teacher, and one who took a special interest in Aaron as a child. Some time while Aaron was in school, Hank was intercepted sexually assaulting a child on campus, was fired from his job, and received a prison sentence. With the mask off and Aaron stripped down yet again, their walls start to come down. Hank, he reveals, has now turned to religion as an atonement for his own torment, but his search for meaning has not been without other attempts at or contemplations of assaulting kids, as he tells Aaron.

Tuttle's script and camera pass no judgment on the characters, like when Aaron shares a bone-chilling story of childhood abuse while naked in a bathtub that may or may not be true, or when Hank also offers a sickening recounting of molestation he endured at the hands of a relative. The actors are as game as any you could imagine, working from a script that you can imagine a lot of people said “hell no” to.

Birney, 71, and best known for work in television and theater (“The Humans”), invites you to feel all his hurt, even as his world is a morally disturbed one we are made to live inside for the movie's running time. As Aaron, Moore, meanwhile, conceals deep wounds of his own, while also high on the power imbalance this situation has tipped his way, where Hank wants to know if he “still loves” Aaron. Another wrinkle is that the camera certainly wants us to also desire Moore, who is often next to naked, placing us at least adjacent to Hank's gaze.

 










Hank is also curious about whether he can still be attracted to adult whom he once desired as a child. He shaves Aaron head to toe to make him look more physically childlike in one of the film's queasier implications. What these two actors take on is undeniably brave, even as the movie tilts toward becoming suffocating, which is intentional. “Blue Film” is confined to a single environment, after all.

Cinematographer Ryan Jackson-Healy also shot the equally controversy-starting, Birney-led film “Mass,” about the ramifications of a school shooting for the parents affected. The DP knows his way around a tight room with just a few people, and the visual beauty of this movie (indeed, often cloaked in literal blues as night turns to dawn) helps alleviate the agonies on display.

Tuttle wisely avoids flashbacks or out-of-this-room context. We are stuck with these two people and our discomfort with them, even though we might also feel tenderness toward them. “Blue Film” nudges at a lot of tricky issues, like the question of whether being gay in the present day is somehow the result of inflictions of the past. And the parallel to that question is whether abuse can also beget more abuse, i.e. make you into a pedophile or sex offender. Hank says he knew who he was once his sexual fantasies in middle school, about his fellow same-age classmates, remained the same into adulthood. What Tuttle wants to attack here is this terrible fork-in-the-road notion that pedophilia and homosexuality stem from the same root.

 










Still, “Blue Film” does the rare work of listening with compassion to a pedophile such as Hank, and as an audience, you can either be curious about that or just let it make you uncomfortable. Hank is tormented by who he is, as is Aaron, but they are not the same person, and they did not come from the same place. “Blue Film” leaves you feeling a little bit ill, and very uneasy about how you're supposed to feel. But when most films either wouldn't dare go here at all, or would tell you how to feel about the material, that's rare and welcome.

“Blue Film” premiered at the Edinburgh Film Festival and NewFest. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

UPDATED: NBC News went through a round of layoffs on Wednesday, impacting about 150 staffers, as the network cuts costs as it prepares for the split of most of Comcast's cable networks into Versant.


	The job reductions are scattered throughout NBC News. They represent about 2% of the NBCU News Group workforce and a single-digit percentage of NBC News, according to a source familiar with the plans. Status newsletter, the first to report on the pending cuts, put the figure at 7% of the network's workforce.


	The cuts were across the board, and included those to teams devoted to issues of diversity, but those online verticals, such as NBC Out and NBC Blk, will continue, a source said.

	Staffers are being told that the layoffs are taking place because NBC News no longer will be providing newsgathering for two networks, not just MSNBC but CNBC. The two networks will be part of the collection of cable channels under the Versant umbrella. Also cited is the economic climate, as linear networks have been trimming staffs amid advertising shifts to other platforms.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The impacted employees, who are being informed of the elimination of their roles on Wednesday, will receive severance and outplacement services, and 60 days notification and benefits support, per the source. They will be able to apply for 140 openings across the newsgroup. About a dozen of the eliminated positions are being repurposed into new roles, and those laid off also can apply for those jobs.


	The NBC Digital News Guild, which represents staffers including reporters, editors and video journalists, has not received any official notice from management, a spokesperson said. In a statement, Susan DeCarava, president of The NewsGuild of New York, said, “What's clear: NBC management is prioritizing corporate profits at the expense of our hard-working members, without whom there would be no NBC News.”

	











	Comcast announced last year that it would spin off most of its cable networks, including MSNBC and CNBC, into a new company, later branded as Versant. The spinoff is expected to be completed by the end of the year, with MSNBC building up its own newsroom given that it no longer will have NBC News as a sister network.


	On Oct. 6, MSNBC no longer relied on NBC News correspondents and crews in their coverage, with the exception of Washington, D.C. operations. Those ties are expected to be severed next week, on Oct. 20. MSNBC also will be taking on a new name, MS NOW, or My Source, News-Opinion-World.


	In a memo to employees last week, Cesar Conde, chairman of the NBCU News Group, said that a planned NBC News subscription service will launch later this year, while NBC News will expand its sports hub as events like the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics and World Cup approach. He also said that NBC News would be launching a new marketing campaign.

If the layoffs were due to no longer needing to provide services for CNBC and MSNBC, then shouldnt there be growth jobs available at CNBC and MSNBC to manage those same functions?

Because CNBC and MSNBC are being phased out. Versant wasn't spun off to save legacy media, it was to manage the decline so Comcast could focus resources on new media acquisitions like CBS is doing with Bari Weiss.

The series, titled ‘Start of Watch,' will follow younger versions of Michael Connelly's characters.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


	The world of Harry Bosch continues to grow. 


	Cable and streaming outlet MGM+ has ordered a series called Bosch: Start of Watch, a prequel to the Bosch series that starred Titus Welliver as the title character, the LAPD detective from Michael Connelly's best-selling novels. Cameron Monaghan (Shameless, Gotham) will play the young Harry, and Omari Hardwick (Power) will also star.




Start of Watch will be the fourth series in the Bosch-verse, following Prime Video's Bosch, sequel Bosch: Legacy and spinoff Ballard, which was recently renewed for a second season. Franchise veterans Tom Bernardo and Brian Anthony co-created the series and will executive produce, with Bernardo serving as showrunner. The show is set to film in Los Angeles.

	Fabel Entertainment is producing, as it has for the rest of the franchise. Along with Bernardo and Anthony, Connelly, Henrik Bastin, Jamie Boscardin Martin and Jasmine Russ executive produce. Theresa Snider of Hieronymus Pictures is a co-EP.


	“We are thrilled to expand the Bosch universe with this compelling origin story that showcases how one of television's most beloved detectives became the man we know today,” said MGM+ head Michael Wright. “With Cameron Monaghan and Omari Hardwick bringing these complex characters to life, and the creative vision of Michael Connelly and our talented executive producers, Bosch: Start of Watch promises to deliver the gritty, authentic storytelling that honors the franchise's legacy while opening an exciting new chapter.”

	











Start of Watch will be set in 1991, with the 26-year-old Harry as an LAPD rookie under the tutelage of training officer Eli Bridges (Hardwick). “The series will explore a city on the edge, teeming with racial tension, gang violence, and a fractured LAPD,” the logline reads. “Amid routine calls and growing unrest, Bosch finds himself drawn into a high-profile heist and a web of criminal corruption that will test his loyalty to the badge and shape his future as the detective who lives by the code, ‘Everybody counts or nobody counts.'”


	“I'm deeply grateful to Michael Wright and the team at MGM+ for championing this next chapter in Bosch's journey with such remarkable care and integrity,” said Connelly. “Being able to see how Harry Bosch became the man we have loved for 10 seasons is a gift to me and his many fans. I can't wait to dig in with Cameron and the writers to explore this uncharted character territory.”

The album breaks the modern-era records for most albums sold and units earned in a single week.

	The first-week numbers for Taylor Swift's new album, The Life of a Showgirl, are, expectedly, massive. But even for an artist who has spent nearly two decades breaking her own records, these numbers are on another level entirely.


The Life of a Showgirl posts the biggest debut of the modern era (1991–present), shattering records for both single-week sales and equivalent album units (on the latest charts dated Oct. 18). Every single one of its 12 songs lands in the top 12 of the Billboard Hot 100 — a feat no artist has ever achieved before. And with this latest sweep, Swift has now occupied the entire top 10 of the Hot 100 three separate times. No other artist in history has done it even once.


	Those accomplishments alone would be enough to define most careers, but for Swift, they're just the beginning of another historic week. Across Billboard's album, song and genre charts, The Life of a Showgirl resets the record books — from streaming milestones to vinyl sales to chart longevity benchmarks.


	With the charts officially locked in, it's worth looking closer at just how many records this album breaks. She also makes historic starts at radio and sets a new mark for the most streamed song in a single week in the post-UGC era (2020-present).


	Below, we've rounded up every major Billboard chart record Swift breaks this week — and a few she extends even further — thanks to The Life of a Showgirl. Let's dive in.

The Life of a Showgirl earns Swift her 15th No. 1 album on the Billboard 200. She breaks out of a tie with Drake and Jay-Z for the most of all time among soloists. Among all artists, only the Beatles have more, with 19.


	Here's a look at the acts with the most No. 1 albums since the Billboard 200 began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in March 1956.


Showgirl earned 4.002 million equivalent album units in the United States in its opening week (Oct. 3-9), according to Billboard's data tracker Luminate, the largest weekly sum for an album since Billboard began ranking the week's most popular albums by that metric on the Billboard 200 in December 2014.


	Here's a recap of the top 10 biggest weeks, by units, since December 2014.


Rank, Artist, Title, Units, Chart Date


Showgirl sold 3,479,500 copies in pure album sales in its first week (purchases of digital downloads, CDs, vinyl LPs and cassette tapes). That is the single largest sales week for an album since 1991, when Luminate began electronically tracking music sales.


	Here's a recap of the top 10 biggest selling weeks by albums in the modern era (1991-present), ranked in order by sales volume.


Rank, Artist, Title, Sales, Chart Date


	Of Showgirl's 3,479,500 copies sold in its opening week, 1.334 million were sold on vinyl — the most sold in a single week in the modern era for an album on vinyl.

Rank, Artist, Title, Sales, Chart Date


	“The Fate of Ophelia,” the lead single from The Life of a Showgirl, raked in 92.5 million official U.S. streams in its opening week, according to Luminate. That's the most single-week streams for a song since Billboard removed all user-generated-content streams from its streaming tabulation on Sept. 19, 2020. Before that, UGC streams factored into Billboard's streaming methodology, and therefore, the Hot 100.

Showgirl earns Swift her 16th No. 1 on Top Album Sales, extending her record for the most since the chart launched in 1991. Here's an updated look at the artists with the most No. 1s:


Showgirl is Swift's 14th No. 1 on Vinyl Albums, extending her record for the most since the chart launched in 2011. Here's an updated look at the artists with the most No. 1s:


	Swift debuts all 12 tracks from Showgirl in the top 12 of the Hot 100, upping her career totals to the following:


	Swift holds the records for all seven of those categories among women. Among all artists, only Drake has more, with 25 top two hits, 32 top three hits, 43 top five hits, 69 top 10 hits, 140 top 20 hits, 218 top 40 hits and 361 overall entries.


	“The Fate of Ophelia” earns Swift her 13th career No. 1 song on the Hot 100, and eighth in the 2020s. She breaks out of a tie with Drake and Ariana Grande for the most leaders this decade so far. Here's an updated look at the artists with the most No. 1s in the 2020s:


	“The Fate of Ophelia” debuts at No. 8 on the Pop Airplay radio chart — the first top 10 arrival in the chart's 33-year history. It passes two hits that each started at a prior No. 12 best: Swift's own “Shake It Off” (Sept. 6, 2014) and Mariah Carey's “Dreamlover” (Aug. 14, 1993).


	“The Fate of Ophelia” debuts at No. 8 on the Adult Pop Airplay radio chart — the highest debut in the chart's nearly 30-year history. It also becomes Swift's record-extending 33rd top 10 at the format. She also debuts five other songs on the ranking this week, upping her career count to a record-extending 54 entries.


	All 12 Showgirl tracks occupy the top 10 spots of this week's Streaming Songs chart, upping Swift's counts to 17 top two hits, 24 top three hits, 36 top five hits, 68 top 10s and 191 entries. These are all the most among women and second-most overall, after Drake.


	Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia” becomes Swift's sixth No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200, lifting her past Ariana Grande for the most among women in the chart's five-year history. She also passes Drake for the most top five hits (23) and top 10s (42) and extends her record for the most overall entries with 188.


	Swift passes Bad Bunny for the most top five and top 10 hits on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart, upping her totals to 14 and 29, respectively. She also extends her record for the most overall entries to 167.

If you're wondering what members of the French 75 chat about when they're not breaking immigrants out of detainment centers or robbing banks, the answer is astrology. Or at least that's what the cast of Paul Thomas Anderson's “One Battle After Another” discussed in between firing prop machine guns and driving getaway cars in the vigilante thriller.

“We were all of us just there, chatting up in between takes, talking about astrology, talking about full moons,” Shayna McHayle, who plays French 75 member Junglepussy, told IndieWire. “Teyana [Taylor] was saying something about Scorpios, and I'm like, ‘I'm a Scorpio,' and Leo[nardo DiCaprio]'s like, ‘Yeah, I'm a Scorpio.' It was this whole thing.”

For McHayle, spending time on the set of a blockbuster action film with A-list talent was quite surreal, and not something she sought out, but the experience was “written in the stars.” While she's previously appeared in two films, 2018's “Support the Girls” and 2023's “The Perfect Find,” she's predominantly a musician who raps under the stage name Junglepussy. After Anderson saw her on tour with Tame Impala in 2022, however, he was so inspired that he created a character, also named Junglepussy, just for McHayle.

“My agent reached out to me like, ‘Paul Thomas Anderson wants your number. Can I give it to him?' He wants to talk to you directly,” McHayle said. “I was like, ‘Who? OK, yeah, give him my number.'”

The pair then met several times in New York City over the next few years, with Anderson telling McHayle he was crafting a far-left vigilante based on her stage persona. 

“I didn't know that it was like Junglepussy for real until it really got close to locking in,” McHayle said. “He gave me a hard copy of the script, and when I read it, I was like, ‘What the…? What is this?' When I saw my name in there, and I saw my lyrics in there, and I just saw all these pussy references, I was gagged.”

Even before shooting, however, astrology was a key topic of conversation. “Teyana's a Sag. Regina [Hall]'s a Sag. Alana [Haim]'s a Sag,” McHayle said. “One day, me and Paul were texting before we started filming, and he thought I was a Sag too. He's like, ‘Yeah, you know I got all these badass Sagittarius women in the French 75,' and I was like, ‘Yeah, I'm a Scorpio.' He was like, ‘OK, you're fired.'”

After reading the “One Battle After Another” script, however, McHayle asked Anderson to make some changes to her character. “He's writing and directing, so he wants to control everything,” she said, “But I was just like, ‘Paul, I am Junglepussy. This is me. I have to be Junglepussy after this movie. I was Junglepussy before this movie, and while I love the collaboration here that you're cooking up, I still have some non-negotiables.' There were things that I was like, ‘OK, hard no on this. Junglepussy would never, like ever.'”

 










Crafting a character that was a mix of her real-life persona and a fictional French 75 radical required some nuance from McHayle as an actor. “Because he reached out to me directly, and was so inspired by my music, even ‘This pussy don't pop for you,' having it like as a sign in the movie, which is how I've been performing it for the past decade, I knew there were a lot of things that he was drawn to, and I wanted to keep that part of me alive in the role,” she said. “But I also wanted to do some things that I wouldn't usually do, like shooting a machine gun out of a moving vehicle, like robbing a bank.”

McHayle channeled her stage persona while filming, especially during her instantly iconic bank robbery monologue. Walking across the tellers' counter amid the chaos of a stick-up, McHayle delivers a speech that serves both as a mission statement for the French 75 as well as a nod to Junglepussy's work. It's here that she tells the world, “This pussy don't pop for you.” But filming in front of the entire cast and crew was daunting. 

“That day, I just had to channel the same energy I bring to the stage whenever I do a big show,” she said. “I just had to channel that energy and do my thing.”

McHayle is “still gagged” at the magnitude of the film, and the stunts in particular. “The stunts were scary,” she said, laughing, “Like the car chase scene, we were in the vehicles, like we were in it. When the minivan takes that hard left, we were in it…I'm not even, like, a rollercoaster kind of girl. I prefer a ride over a rollercoaster, but this was like a rollercoaster ride from hell.” 

 










“I know Warner Brothers didn't want to get in trouble with me,” she added about the movie's safety protocols. “I just had to let go and trust they knew what they were doing, because they know they have to keep us safe.”

While “One Battle After Another” may only be McHayle's third movie, it's her second working with Regina Hall, whom she acted alongside in “Support the Girls,” where they both played employees of a Hooters-esque establishment called Double Whammies. McHayle described the reunion as “a dream.” 

“She is such a calming force,” McHayle gushes, “The role she plays as Deandra [in ‘One Battle After Another'] is just like steady, grounded. That's the literal energy she gives me when we work together on set. I just feel super calm around her. She's an OG, like that's my girl, just big sis vibes, like just super nurturing. I'm just like, ‘Girl, I can't believe this is my second movie with you.' Love her for life.”

McHayle is now manifesting a third Regina Hall collab and one “with more screentime for both of us.” She's also rooting for Hall to earn an Oscar for her performance. “She is truly such a force,” McHayle said. “I need her getting that Oscar. No pressure, but I want her to have it.” 

After filming wrapped in early 2024, McHayle had to wait patiently for over a year before she finally got to watch “One Battle After Another.” She was invited to a private screening at the IMAX theater at New York's Lincoln Square AMC for a morning viewing. “It was like me and some of the Christmas Adventurers, Tony Goldwyn and them,” she said. “We're in this big-ass theater, and everybody's in their own row and taking it all in.” 

 










McHayle brought a coffee and a croissant and, during her first watch, was mostly just assessing how much of her work made the final cut. “I was there ticking my boxes,” she said. “Like I know what I did, and I know what I didn't do. Now let's see what's in here. When I saw all the pieces just remained, I was like, ‘Oh, Paul is a real one. He was serious,' because you never know for real until it's done.”

Since her first screening, where she admitted to being “over-caffeinated” and “overstimulated,” she's seen the movie five more times, including in VistaVision. She's still “gagged” by the whole process, and knows there will be more to come. 

“For some reason, whenever I do me, do my music, make my art, I'm attracting these opportunities,” she said. “I'm just staying super open to expanding my acting career, because it's obviously something I can't run from, hide from, like it just keeps popping up. I am going to surrender to the process and to the full spectrum of my gifts, my artistry, and just keep being me.” 

Hopefully, that means Shayna McHayle x Regina Hall 3.0 in the near future. 

“One Battle After Another” is now in theaters from Warner Bros. Pictures.

The Latin star surprised the world in 2022 when he announced his retirement — but now he's back, with a renewed faith and a commitment to make "music with a purpose."


													By
												

	Leila Cobo


Chief Content Officer Latin/Español, Billboard


At some point during the past turbulent months, as he searched for purpose and faced the pressures of a very public divorce that engulfed both his personal and professional life, the music stopped for Raymond Ayala.


	“For the first time in my life, the muse shut down,” says the man long known as Daddy Yankee. “That had never happened to me before. Ever.”

	











	It wasn't supposed to be like this. In 2022, Daddy Yankee — that rare artist who has garnered both vast commercial success and respect from artists and the industry alike — surprised the world when he announced his retirement from music. He released what was supposed to be his last studio album, Legendaddy, and performed what was set to be his last tour, grossing $197.8 million and selling 1.9 million tickets, then the second-highest-grossing Latin tour in Billboard Boxscore history. But Ayala was spent.


	Then, on Dec. 3, 2023, at the tour's final date at Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot in San Juan, he made yet another shocking revelation: “Tonight, I recognize, and I'm not ashamed to tell the whole world, that Jesus lives in me and I live for him,” he told the 15,000 fans that packed his hometown venue. “A story ends and a new story begins.”


	Ayala immediately started spreading the word of the Lord, in music and in deed. He released songs brimming with positivity, traveled on missions to Africa, made impromptu appearances in churches in Puerto Rico and other Latin countries and saw firsthand the reaction to his new brand of “music with a purpose,” culminating with a Latin Grammy win for best urban song for “Bonita” (Pretty), a non-album single released in 2023.

	











	But in December 2024, Ayala's wife of nearly 30 years filed for divorce, and an initially amicable split turned sour amid a spate of legal disputes over his many businesses and assets, including his past catalog negotiations. Making music became even more difficult.


	“But it was part of the process to arrive at a total dependency on God,” Ayala now says. “He said, ‘Even if your muse is gone, remember, I am your muse. I am your inspiration.' Today, I'm making music and I'm building a new catalog.”


	I'm chatting with Ayala in a private dining room at a Brooklyn hotel — his first interview with the press since he announced his conversion to Christianity — over tea and fruit. He is 49 years old, but his trim physique (later, he'll go to the gym with pal J Balvin) and youthful, unlined face display none of the travails of an artist who grew up in Puerto Rico's housing projects and whose music career was jump-started by a gunshot to the leg that ended a promising baseball run.


	As Daddy Yankee, Ayala is widely recognized as the man who catapulted reggaetón from underground genre to global movement, in large part thanks to his 2004 smash, “Gasolina,” and the relentless string of global hits that followed. Today, he has 105 entries — including seven No. 1s — on the Hot Latin Songs chart, among them “Despacito” alongside Luis Fonsi and his most recent, “Sonríele” (Smile), which is currently charting. At the time of publication, Daddy Yankee was the No. 37 most listened-to artist on Spotify despite the fact that he has released only a few singles in the past two years.


	That is a testament to the power of the name and the man. “Without Daddy Yankee, there would be no J Balvin,” Balvin says. “He was, and continues to be, the source of inspiration that has so propelled me to elevate urban music to a global level.”

	











	Now Ayala has embarked on a dramatically different second act, with Jesus as a centerpiece and the goal of releasing music that's commercially successful but is “music with a purpose,” as he calls it, rather than religious music with evangelical lyrics.


	“Having a life of success is different from having a life of purpose,” Ayala replies when I ask what prompted his conversion and the ensuing shift in direction. “Before, my interest was transforming the industry [through music], and that purpose had to do more with business and money, influence, success. Now my purpose is to transform lives with that same instrument. They're very different purposes.”


	But the vehicle is still the same. On Oct. 23, Ayala will perform as Daddy Yankee at the Billboard Latin Music Awards, his first televised performance in three years. And he will release Lamento En Baile (Mourning Into Dancing), his first album since 2022 — and his first since publicly converting – on Oct. 16. The title comes from Psalm 30:11, which says, “You have turned my mourning into dancing,” and dovetails with its first focus track, “Sonríele,” a peppy merengue brimming with optimism.


	It's the first track Ayala has released under DY Publishing, as well as the first step in rebuilding his catalog. In October 2024, Concord purchased key elements of his music publishing and master-recording catalog, including chart-topping hits “Gasolina,” “Con Calma” and “Despacito.” According to Concord's website and Billboard reports, the agreement encompasses work from 2002 through 2019 and includes certain name, image and likeness rights. Prior to that acquisition, Billboard reported that parts of his catalog had been quietly acquired around 2021 by Cinq Music and a private fund that asked not to be named, which then sold those assets to Concord. (Concord, Cinq and Ayala himself decline to comment about specifics of the deals.)

	











	“Someone like [Daddy Yankee], someone who is as prolific as he is productive, we imagine it will happen fairly quickly,” says Jorge Mejía, president/CEO of Sony Music Publishing Latin America and U.S. Latin, which continues to administer all songs written by Ayala for the world. “This is not an unusual situation for us. Artists inevitably evolve throughout their careers — growth, change and reinvention are all part of the creative journey.”


	Ayala is releasing his new music on his own DY Records through a license deal with HYBE Latin America, which announced the signing in July in tandem with the release of “Sonríele” and is betting big on Daddy Yankee as its first major and established artist. “Obviously, partnering with [Daddy Yankee] is extremely important for us,” HYBE Latin America COO Juan Sebastián Arenas says. “We're partnering with a music icon, supporting a new project. Our goal is to tell the industry we're here to do something new. There's no one better than [him] to accomplish that.”


	Likewise, in HYBE, Ayala found a label partner that's young (HYBE Latin America launched in 2023), inquisitive and eager to break molds. This summer, Ayala, who has a big following in Asia, went to South Korea for the first time and shot the video to his upcoming single “El Toque,” incorporating elements of Korean dance.


	“I am my own manager now and I'm managing myself 100% alone, and I have good allies,” Ayala says. “HYBE is a good ally. They have a progressive mentality and they're in constant reinvention. That's very compatible with my new vision.”


If you listen closely, it's clear the seeds of Ayala's conversion were planted in his music long ago. On 2007's “Coraza Divina” (Divine Shield), for example, an autobiographic rap set over salsa tumbao that narrates his rise from the hood, he named a higher power: “Evil realized he was the chosen child and sought to destroy him/But you know what? I have a divine shield, the power to light my path,” he says in the chorus.


	“Many people don't know that I converted to the Lord for the first time at 19 years old,” Ayala says. “But I diverged from the path. My lyrics were clean, but I knew they belonged to the world, [not to God].”

	











	Still, in a genre rife with sexually graphic lyrics that often glorify drugs and violence, Ayala always stood out as a rapper with a conscience who delivered mostly G-rated material, but nevertheless oozed swagger and braggadocio. The strategy let him open the door for reggaetón to find success among mainstream Latin audiences and beyond: He was the first Latin urban artist to consistently place hit songs on radio when that medium was the key driver to success.


	But clearly, the content of Ayala's music went deeper than a commercial play. On 2004's Barrio Fino, the breakout album that includes “Gasolina,” there were tracks that referenced God and resilience. It's a theme that appears again and again in his work — through to 2016, when, unbeknown to the public, he privately converted. He didn't announce it, he says, “because I had many agreements I had signed and committed to” — label deals, recordings with other artists, brand deals, a major tour — “and I had to deliver.”


	Ayala is known for keeping his word. He's a man of habit and discipline: makes his bed every morning, works out, reads, eats healthy, goes to the studio, repeats. As the “Big Boss” of reggaetón and the urban movement itself, he couldn't conceive of not fulfilling his contractual obligations. So he kept his allegiance to Christ to himself, until that 2023 show where he told the world about his new path.


	“I wanted to get to where I am now and not owe anything to anyone,” he says. “I wanted to be in peace and complete liberty.”

	











	And he was, for a while.


Daddy Yankee's reentry into the world of music as an artist led by faith in Jesus initially appeared seamless. He returned with the single “Bonita,” an uptempo reggaetón fused with horns and merengue that was all about positivity and happiness.


	It was the first of a handful of tracks distributed through SoundOn, TikTok's distribution and marketing platform, prior to his HYBE deal, and it benefited from TikTok support and exposure. Users have created over 1.2 million videos with “Bonita,” which generated over 1.1 billion views, and Daddy Yankee-posted content got more than 48.5 million likes, 1.7 million comments and over 3.8 million shares.


	The fact was, Ayala had announced his retirement from music in 2022. “The perception was that Yankee had retired and [now] we wanted to say he hadn't,” says Gabriel Llano, head of artist services for U.S. Latin and Latin America at SoundOn at TikTok. “When he made this musical shift, we wanted users to take those songs of his with positive messages to tell their own stories.”


	After “Bonita,” Ayala released “Donante de Sangre,” a rap track where he addressed his conversion head-on for the first time. The song, which was also a metaphor for life, was used for a Red Cross blood donation campaign in Mexico, adding a dimension of social good to his new music.


	Other like-minded singles trickled out, even as, in October 2024, Concord announced its purchase of parts of Daddy Yankee's catalog. Then, on Dec. 2, 2024, Ayala made yet another surprise announcement.


	“After more than two decades of marriage and after many months of trying to save my marriage, which my wife and I share, today my lawyers respond to the divorce petition received [from] Mireddys,” he wrote in a letter shared to Instagram, referring to Mireddys González, his longtime wife and high school sweetheart. “I'm grateful for the time we shared, full of blessings and values, of love and with a beautiful family that will continue to be our priority.”


	González was not only Ayala's wife but also the president of his label, El Cartel Records, and a member of its board of directors. Within weeks of the divorce announcement, on Dec. 17, Ayala filed two legal motions seeking an injunction against González and her sister Ayeicha González-Castellanos (El Cartel's secretary/treasurer), alleging they withdrew tens of millions of dollars from his business bank accounts without authorization, according to court documents.

	











	It was the first of a series of back-and-forth complaints, some of which are still in litigation, that have been reported widely by the press and touch many aspects of Ayala's career and assets, including information surrounding the initial sale of catalog assets in 2021.


	Although the cases are public, Ayala has not spoken about them — save for perfunctory comments as he's gone in and out of court in Puerto Rico — and he declined to answer questions now. But he has definitely learned some things.


	“Be on top of everything, even if you have lawyers and accountants,” Ayala says. “Now I'm alone, so I have to be 100% [involved]. Things I used to delegate, I don't delegate anymore. It's my responsibility, and I feel good and I feel I've learned so much more. You think you know everything about the music business and the rules keep changing. The smallest things can make a great difference.”


	And, he cautions new artists, male and female: “Even if you're not famous or successful and your career is only beginning, get married with a prenup. Music is unpredictable.”


Whatever challenges Ayala has faced over the course of his lengthy career, they've been impossible to discern from the outside. Through the years he's been unflappable, even-keeled, scandal-free. He has never even been attacked on social media — a feat in this day and age. But the past year shook him up.

	











	“I've always taken good care of myself, [but now] I've learned to give myself more self-love,” he muses when I ask what he has taken from this experience. “It's very important to be clear on what self-love is and establish limits. All kinds of healthy limits. Learn how to say no. I learned that we sacrifice ourselves for many people, and you do it so much that you normalize it. And that's not the way it should be. You need to set limits. I've learned to be more assertive.”


	When I point out I always found him assertive, he nods. “I've always been assertive with those outside my close circle. But you also need to set limits on those close to you.”


	And eventually, Ayala learned how to make music again.


	“I never thought I'd be in this situation, but I found myself in it,” he says. “And the strength I found to record an album full of joy in the most unexpected moment of my life is what helped me regain my strength. When we're in the middle of a crisis, one of our biggest fortitudes lies in adoring and praising the Lord because it brings joy.”


	Despite the change in content and the change in purpose, Ayala intends to tackle the marketing and promotion of his “music with a purpose” with every tool at his disposal, something that has proved tricky in the Latin world for religious artists who previously made secular music. Many Latin acts, particularly from Puerto Rico, are devout Christians but don't share their beliefs in their music. And many others have publicly announced their conversions and released evangelical music with mixed results.


	“From a programming perspective … it will all depend on the lyrics,” iHeartLatino senior vp of programming Pedro Javier González says. “Yankee is being smart in how he's handling it. He knows he has global impact and is looking for the best way to take the message without alienating anyone. Up to now, it's been positive lyrics that don't sound religious. A lot of people are looking for this kind of content.”


	HYBE's Arenas agrees. “HYBE likes to send positive messages to the world, and I do see a trend coming with inspirational music, music that has undertones of faith,” he says. “We've seen it in the Anglo world, and we're starting to see it in Latin as well. I think there's an audience for these fans, but the right platform for the music hasn't existed before.”


	For Ayala, it's simply part of who he is now.

	











	“Everyone who's inside the faith has to go to the world and preach the gospel,” he says, an obligation that applies to all, not just pastors or evangelizers. “I can't simply convert and stay silent, you know? This isn't simply making Christian music; the challenge is to make the kingdom part of pop culture. My vision [in the past] was to transform the industry when they told me I couldn't. Now I'm in the same situation with a different purpose: revolutionize and reinvent.”

Through the development of new AI search tools, Musixmatch hopes to open up a new revenue stream for publishers and songwriters.

	Musixmatch, a lyric and music data company, has inked a series of AI-based licensing deals with Sony Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group and Warner Chappell Music, the three major music publishers. Done on a trial basis, this will now allow Musixmatch access to the majors' catalogs to develop AI tools, and as part of the agreement, the publishers will receive remuneration.


	According to a source close to the deal, a few examples of what these AI tools could become include a large language model (LLM) for song lyrics and metadata, strictly gated and geared toward music business professionals who can use it to search through catalogs more easily.


	With this, a film/tv company looking for the perfect song to license could ask for romantic songs or songs about protest from a certain time period. Other use cases for this type of technology could be analysis of trends in culture, like, asking “Why are love songs in decline over the last few decades?” or “What consumer brands were most frequently referenced in song lyrics last year?”


	Musixmatch might also use these trial licenses to develop AI tools for financial analysis and reporting to track the performance of a catalog over time. Prompts could include something like, “Show me my earnings in the U.S. on all streaming services from the beginning of this year and compare that to all sales from the beginning of this year.”


	Lastly, the licenses could unlock Musixmatch's ability to create motion artwork based on songs in the dataset. 


	This new announcement signals the opening of a possible new revenue stream for music publishers and Musixmatch, which, to date, is best known for its role in providing accurate, authorized lyrics to streaming and social media services like Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, Google, Amazon Music, iHeart Radio and Instagram. To date, the Bologna, Italy-based company has partnered with over 225,000 publishers and nearly 3 million songwriters.


	“We're looking forward to this collaboration with our trusted partners to build and share entirely new revenue streams together,” says Musixmatch founder/ CEO Massimo Ciociola. “Put simply: without songwriters, there can be no music industry. These agreements will ensure the writers of today and tomorrow are compensated for their creative works, not only in today's marketplace, but also in the dynamic, AI-powered world that is rapidly emerging. Our long-standing partnerships with rights owners enable us to confidently build new services that will properly compensate songwriters while delivering value to music publishers and all who recognize the power of a song to move culture and provide meaning to our world.”

T
he Palace Theater in Los Angeles was an odd place for a punk show. Its stage once featured worldwide stars like Harry Houdini. For many years it was an ornate movie theater. On this night in 2023, however,  the cavernous five-story building was filled with bearded, flannel-wearing, middle-aged former punks, most of whom came to see Nineties punk titans Unwound play a reunion for the 20th birthday of the archival record label Numero Group. One of these middle-aged punks (sans the beard and flannel) was a youth swimming coach named Chris Sheppard. As Sheppard wandered the venue he overheard a group of men about his age talking about one of the bands playing that night: “Who the hell is this band? How did they end up on this bill?” 


	The band was Everyone Asked About You — and Sheppard is a guitarist and one of the singers. The question cut deep, since Sheppard was already nervous about performing in front of the 3,000-plus in attendance (the largest show his band had ever played by several orders of magnitude). But it was also a question he and his bandmates had been asking themselves for months. How did they end up here? 

	











	Guitarist Collins Kilgore and keyboardist John Beachboard had asked their wives to stand by the front of the stage so there'd at least be someone there for them to play to. “When we started playing the first note,” Beachboard says, “they were thrown out of the way by kids immediately moshing and dancing.”

	“As soon as we walked out onstage, it was a bum rush of hundreds of teenagers and young 20-year-olds just running to the front of the stage,” Sheppard says. “Security didn't know what to do.” 

	











	“I think they were just as stunned as we were,” says Beachboard of their wives. “Because I think they were like, ‘Let's go up there and support our idiot husbands up there playing their little guitars and their little keyboards.'”  


	“We had a stage diver at that show,” Sheppard says. “We never played a stage tall enough to dive off of before.”

	Sheppard started Everyone Asked About You with his friends back in Little Rock, Arkansas, in the late 1990s when they were all teenagers. At the time, Little Rock punched well above its weight within the niche emo and hardcore scenes, anchored by bands like Chino Horde (whose guitarist, Jason White, went on to play for Green Day) and Soophie Nun Squad. After a few years, like most high school groups, Everyone Asked About You broke up and went their separate ways, never to think about the band again. In Sheppard's case, he stopped playing music altogether. “I sold all of my musical equipment in 2000 to move to Boston,” he says. “I hadn't played the guitar in 22 years.” 


	That was supposed to be the end of Everyone Asked About You. Then one day in 2015, Sheppard saw a YouTube video that would blow his mind. It was a recording of a band in Japan onstage playing the songs he'd written with his friends two decades ago. He says, “That was the first time I had any inclination that people outside of the, like, 65 people that ever saw us back in the Nineties knew who we were.”


	CHRIS SHEPPARD MET DRUMMER LEE BUFORD at Little Rock Central High School, and the two of them formed a band called the Low End Theory, playing Unwound-inspired noise rock. Eventually they started listening to bands like Rainer Maria and Braid, bands that came to define the “Midwest emo” sound of the 1990s, a softer and more melodic style of hardcore. The two began experimenting with their sound. Kilgore, who was a couple of years behind them at Central High, joined them for practice sessions. “What we were playing was lots of major chords. It had that pretty vibe, but the songs were fundamentally sad,” Kilgore says. They decided they needed a vocalist, preferably a female, to round out the group. Buford had noticed Hannah Vogan hanging around the benches on Kavanaugh Boulevard, a popular spot for Little Rock punk kids to congregate. He found out she went to the private school Pulaski Academy. He also found out she was taking opera lessons. Buford introduced himself, and invited her to join their band.

	The name Everyone Asked About You came from a children's book Buford found at Books-a-Million. Their songs had names like “Paper Airplanes, Paper Hearts” and “Sometimes Memory Fails Me Sometimes.” They played their first show with the local heroes Soophie Nun Squad, a chaotic band with anywhere from seven to 12 members, depending on the night, that played a fun and wild form of punk music that wasn't anything like Everyone Asked About You's sound. The bands they regularly played with were often aggressive, dramatic, and heavy. Their sound was more sweet and melancholy. “At the time, I wanted to be edgy and post-hardcore, post-punk kind of sound,” Kilgore says. “And then we were making this sort of twee stuff.” 


	The Little Rock punks were generally supportive of the band. “When we first started, a lot of that original Little Rock old guard had moved on and gone off to college, and it was just the high school kids left there carrying it on,” Sheppard says. “And Hannah and I were writing lyrics and singing from a perspective of kids in high school going through high school stuff.” They played in public parks and living rooms to an eclectic mix of hardcore punks, metalheads, and indie-rockers, and generally young people they knew from school and around their local scene. Their shows were always upbeat, with plenty of dancing and singing along. When they went on a short tour to play living rooms in other states, they found a less-positive reception. “I was a closeted gay kid and she was a Southern girl, and those are two perspectives that are, I think, unique within the scene that we were a part of,” Sheppard says. “And I think that's one of the reasons why I don't feel like we had any sort of traction or launch back then.” Ironically, they found that cities where there was an established “Midwest emo” scene were the toughest crowds of all. “It went over like the plague,” Kilgore jokes.  


	They put out a few singles and one full-length, all on vinyl, probably a few hundred copies of each, selling them through the mail or by hand at shows. Heartattack, a widely read hardcore zine, panned their record as “cutesy” and “queasy.” There was a feeling they were too late to their particular style of emo, and the scene had already moved on from twee teenage angst to a more technical, harder sound.


	“It had fallen a little out of vogue at that point,” says bassist Matt Bradley. 

	











	In the end, the band didn't break up out of acrimony. They simply grew up — graduating high school and moving on to jobs and college. Sheppard became a swimming coach. Vogan became a nurse. Buford became the drummer for the experimental metal band the Body (who developed a devoted cult audience with their intense and unusual sound). Bradley became a production designer for the Santa Fe, New Mexico-based art collective Meow Wolf. Beachboard opened a brewery in Little Rock. Kilgore became a lawyer in California. They mostly fell out of touch with one another. 


	IN 2015, A STUDENT AT KEIO UNIVERSITY in Tokyo was looking for some music that he and his classmates could play at an upcoming school festival. “There was a strong emo trend in our university music club,” says Akira Sasagawa, now a 33-year-old systems consultant in Japan. Sasagawa searched YouTube for old and obscure emo bands, and came across a 2012 upload of Everyone Asked About You's vinyl album. “Out of all the bands we listened to, EAAY stood out,” Sasagawa says. “We were also drawn to the low-fi, unpolished production — it gave their music a kind of authenticity that felt more real than anything overly polished ever could. It wasn't just music; it felt like someone was truly opening up to us.” 


	Unbeknownst to the members of EAAY, that YouTube video Sasagawa found already had more than 100,000 views, and interest in their band was growing. “When I first listened to that EP and the second song kicked in, I had just got into my first relationship, and something resonated with me,” says Onat Önol, who lives in Glasgow, but was a teenager living in Istanbul in 2015. That song was called “Me vs. You,” and it opens with Vogan singing the unapologetically cloying lines “Just between me and you, I think I'm in love with you/All of my waking time you're on my mind/I don't know why” over a driving drumbeat and guitar feedback. “I was just replaying it over and over, completely obsessed.” 


	“This is the definitive sound of being young, emotional, and insecure about your feelings and thoughts,” Önol says. “Which is really impossible to get right in music, for me at least. There are very few bands that I feel really get me, and that I get to a similar degree.” 


	By 2019, the YouTube video caught the attention of Ken Shipley, co-founder of the Chicago-based archival record label Numero Group. “I just thought it was cool, and it was a group from my era that I'd never heard of,” Shipley tells me. He knew Buford was a drummer in the Body, and he reached out to him through a mutual friend. Buford was skeptical, dismissive, and maybe even a little embarrassed. The Body played experimental noise and metal that is often described as “scary,” a far cry from the melodic, singsongy emo of Everyone Asked About You. “I don't think he rated the music that highly, but also, the idea that anyone would seem interested in this was pretty ludicrous,” Shipley says.

	











	Buford shared Shipley's email with his old bandmates, but they, too, wrote it off. “Lee and I laughed about it and then just kind of let it be,” Sheppard says.


	But Shipley didn't give up. He emailed Buford regularly, maybe once every six months or so, all while monitoring the growth in the band's video views and comments. “And then it wasn't until 2021 that I reached out to them and just was like, ‘Hey, I think that y'all are missing something here, and that this is having a moment,'” he says. “And how I knew that is just looking at the number of plays. The Rate Your Music reviews were super through-the-roof for it. And the YouTube comments, anytime you're seeing a song getting 400, 500, 600 comments — I mean, just affecting somebody enough to type 15 characters into a field, it's meaningful.” Eventually Shipley asked the band if they'd like to reunite and play the label's 20th-birthday party show with Unwound. At that point, Buford decided to get the band together on Zoom. 


	“I was 100 percent prepared to say, ‘Absolutely not,'” Sheppard says.


	“I definitely was like, ‘Who the fuck wants this?'” says Bradley. “Yeah, there's some YouTube video watches or whatever, but we were not a popular band in the Nineties.” 


	In the end, Beachboard convinced the rest of the band to do it. “If we were to tell this story at a bar to our friends and be like, ‘We got asked to play this big show with a bunch of our musical heroes, and we said no' — that would be a really shitty end to the story,” he says. 


	So, begrudgingly, they went to work. On Christmas 2022, they met up in Little Rock, the first time they'd all been in a room together in more than two decades. They helped one another relearn to play guitar, to sing, to be a band, and to try to reconnect with some distant, younger version of themselves. “When we first got together to play these songs that none of us had even really thought about or listened to in that 25 years, it took me straight back there to what it was like to play them and feel those things the first time,” Kilgore says. “Even our group dynamic kind of reverted back to the way that we talked to each other back then. It was fun. It was crazy. It was weird. It was a very strange experience, because I hadn't experienced anything like that in my life.” 


	“I was really good friends with Lee. I went to his wedding,” Beachboard says. “But I'm not sure we had talked in 10 years before this.” 

	











	They spent four days together rehearsing, reconnecting, and trying to find whatever it was in their music that was so captivating to the youth of today. And in February 2023, they took the stage in Los Angeles in front of the bearded, flanneled men who wondered who the hell they were, as well as the hundreds of kids who knew exactly who they were, and sang every word to every song.  


	After the show ended, they were shocked to finally come face to face with their new fans. Buford's band's booking agent told them he could get them on the bill at the San Francisco Noise Pop Festival the very next day. They've kept booking and playing more shows since then, meeting young fans — some of whom fly in from other countries just to see them. “It just keeps snowballing,” Sheppard says. “And each time I feel like it's more and more fun.”


	AS EVERYONE ASKED ABOUT YOU TOOK THE STAGE at Le Poisson Rouge in New York's West Village this spring, the packed club roared with delight. As the band played, their fans' dancing eventually turned into a mosh pit. Sheppard gently admonished the crowd: “Be careful of the people around you. Everybody enjoys music differently and you should enjoy it how you want to, but make sure you're not infringing on other people's spaces.” A cheer from the crowd, and the mosh pit turned into synchronized bouncing — pure kinetic energy — and singing loudly enough to be heard over the amplification.


	“Their fan base is so interesting. It was the coolest crowds we'd ever played for,” says Mabel Canty, the singer for the opening band that night, Birthday Girl DC. “They're probably in the same boat as us, where they've been fans for a while and never thought they'd be able to see them.” 


	Birthday Girl DC are a rising punk trio from Washington, D.C. Their members are all teenagers. In fact, on this particular night, it is Canty's 18th birthday. Canty's father and bassist Isabella Mackaye's uncle are members of the legendary D.C. punk band Fugazi. In a very real way, the tour where Birthday Girl DC opened for Everyone Asked About You personified the bridge between the Nineties punk scene and today. 


	Birthday Girl DC and Everyone Asked About You met thanks to Chris Wilson, who plays drums for the long-running punk acts Ted Leo and the Pharmacists and Titus Andronicus. When he plays with the Pharmacists, he says, “Our crowd is largely our age.” The first time he saw videos of the Everyone Asked About You show at the now-shut venue St. Vitus in Brooklyn, he was shocked at how young and energetic the audience was. When he met Birthday Girl DC during a show in Washington, he asked them if they had ever heard of Everyone Asked About You. “They literally screamed,” he says. He suggested he could introduce them, and the bands ended up touring together.

	











	Wilson went to watch the two bands play together in the basement of a Unitarian church in Philadelphia, a venue that has been hosting punk shows since 1993, where many of Everyone Asked About You's contemporaries played. Thirty years on, they played there to a crowd of teenagers who weren't even born when Everyone Asked About You first formed. Wilson, who lives in Philadelphia and attends shows at the church often, had never seen anything like it. “Seeing the younger people,” he says, “it was insane. It was like being at a show in 1995. It was incredible.” 


	“I was fully prepared for them to be dickheads,” Birthday Girl DC drummer Tess Kontarinis says, recalling her first meeting with the members of Everyone Asked About You. “But then I was like, ‘Oh, my God, these are my parents. They're my friends.' And it's an insane dynamic to have that and to make us feel so present and at home with them.” 


	“We listen to a lot of bands that are not together,” Kontarinis says. 


	“And then this band out of nowhere just reformed,” Mackaye says. 


	“With the exact same energy that they had,” finishes Canty. “I think a big reason why they still work and are so cool is because they all went on and lived really normal lives.” 


	Following its reunion in 2022, the band wrote and recorded a new album, Never Leave, for Numero Group in 2024. The music is a bit more polished, the lyrics a bit more middle-aged. Sheppard and Vogan sound different than their teenage selves, both in their voices and their lyrics, trading lines about things like cancer, death, losing your hair, giving pets anti-anxiety medication — grown-up stuff. The song “A Vigil,” written in response to the attack and death of nonbinary 16-year-old Nex Benedict in Oklahoma last year, features Sheppard earnestly crying out “Two-sided lies to save who from what? A fence post? A bathroom? A knife in the gut?” On the song “We're All Losing It,” they lament the sounds of their voices, reflect about their childhood, and in unison sing, “Wish I was an easier kid/When I was younger.” 


	Over the past couple of years, the band has continued to attract new fans, particularly through social media. “I think a lot of people discovered them through Numero, but also just on TikTok,” says Kali Flanagan, the 20-year-old bassist for the emo band Holidays in the United States. “People just using their songs in little videos.” 

	











	Everyone Asked About You songs show up in TikToks ranging from the standard fare of people getting ready for school or dancing alone in their bedrooms to clips of Ultimate Fighting Championship matches or NBA games. And when someone is curious about more than the six seconds of a song they hear on TikTok, they go looking for more. What they discover is an entire underground scene — one not too distant in the past, yet far enough to feel completely different from contemporary culture.


	“Everyone Asked About You was the first emo band that I got into,” Flanagan says. “And it was even before I knew what emo music really was.” 


	The lore and the sound of their early recordings all add to the mystery of the band for new fans. The fact that their original recordings were rough around the edges lends them some authenticity.


	“The recordings, they're fairly rough compared with a Fugazi record or something,” says Önol, the fan from Glasgow, “but they're going for it.”“Their production is they just plug in and play and then that's it,” Canty says. 


	It's a paradox, this idea that a band of people in their forties and fifties are seen by so many teenage punk kids as the most authentic representation of youth, especially when so many of the members of the band have a hard time relating to this generation. “These guys are so much less jaded and so much less uptight about music than we were,” Beachboard says. “I don't think I learned how to be that open with music until my early forties.” 


	“As open and as community-minded as we were, we were pretentious as fuck,” Bradley says. “These kids just don't have that energy.” 


	Ultimately, what could be fueling the excitement around Everyone Asked About You is the relative obscurity and unlikeliness of it all. While Bradley doesn't see teenagers as pretentious, there is a certain amount of hip “in-the-know” attitude to this band's fandom. 


	“There's a little bit of ‘I want to find something that nobody knows about,'” Sheppard says. “A lot of kids are looking for something more authentic and real.” 


	“It's just archival culture,” Flanagan says. “Finding something by itself or on its own that doesn't sound like it's from today.” 


	Shipley has built his label's success on this archival culture, and sees firsthand how young people today are mining the digital record crates for lost gems. “The Nineties are the Sixties — think about it from when you were a kid,” Shipley says. “All you heard was about peace and love and all that bullshit. And so that's just the same thing that they're hearing about the Nineties. It's like, ‘Oh, it's the last time before the internet.' They're nostalgic for a thing that they didn't get to experience.”


	“A lot of the young people are feeling some form of despair and want to be part of a community,” says Sheppard. “They're trying to figure out how to feel real connection with other people.”

	











	Today, Everyone Asked About You are preparing to go back out on tour this month, including a stop in their hometown of Little Rock. For now, this is the plan. Nobody has quit their day job. They play shows whenever they can negotiate the time off from work and their families. Meanwhile, their records continue to sell all over the world. 


	“It's worldwide. Is it massive worldwide? No, but they have an opportunity to go play in Japan, and I know that we've sold a bunch of their records in Europe, and it will grow as their notoriety grows,” Shipley says. “The more time we put into it, the bigger the thing's going to grow. And I have an enormous amount of patience for records and artists to bloom. I didn't get into this for one year, two years, or three years. This might take a decade. I'll be here.”


	The Nineties — the “last time before the internet” — represent a time when young people may have felt more connected to one another, when small things still felt really big and important, when something as superficial as a music scene still tied young people together and played a major role in forming their values, their personalities, and their friendships in ways that would last the rest of their lives. Whether that's true or not, it's something the band's fans seem to long for — and they seem to believe the band's mere existence proves it's possible.

	“I think it's really important to note that the reason that they had a successful reunion is because they are doing it out of love,” Canty says. “They just love being together, and they're all friends.” 


	“We're all rapidly approaching 50 years old,” Beachboard says, “rekindling friendships from junior high. I mean, nobody gets that opportunity.… Who gets these opportunities? It's not a story I've heard that many times before.”

The rapper paid loving tribute to the neo soul icon who died at 51 on Tuesday (Oc. 14) following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.

	Gil Kaufman



Lauryn Hill and D'Angelo were like twin stars birthing a new R&B universe in the late 1990s. The pair released just one collaboration, 1998's sensual, seductive “Nothing Even Matters” from Hill's Grammy-winning debut solo album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, but the song, and their friendship, clearly made a huge impression on the former Fugees rapper/singer.

	











	In an emotional post paying homage to D'Angelo in the wake of the singer's death at 51 on Tuesday (Oct. 14) due to pancreatic cancer, Hill lavished praise on D'Angelo for being a beacon of light for music, and fellow Black men, while lamenting that she didn't have more precious moments with the enigmatic “Brown Sugar” star.


	“People need reflection. I regret not having more time with you. Your undeniable beauty and talent were not of this world, and a presence not of this world needs protection in a world that covets light and the anointing of God,” Hill wrote. “You sir, moved us, stirred us, inspired and even intimidated others to action with your genius.”


	She added, “Thank you for being a beacon of light to a generation and beyond who had no remembrance of the legacy that preceded us. Thank you for charting the course and for making space during a time when no similar space really existed.”


	Though D'Angelo only released three albums in his lifetime, his beloved 1995 debut, Brown Sugar, followed by 2000's Voodoo and 2014's Black Messiah, Hill wrote that the singer's aching vulnerability and incomparable passion moved, and inspired, the culture. “You imaged a unity of strength and sensitivity in Black manhood to a generation that only saw itself as having to be one or the other,” Hill wrote. 

	











	“It is my earnest prayer that you are in peace, far away from selfishness, fear and/or controlling interests,” she added. “Far from possessiveness, far from greed, far from manipulation, far from exploitation, far from intentionally designed chaos and that you Brother are in peace, in bliss and in eternal light and fulfillment with our Father in heaven. I Love you and I miss you. May God grant peace and shelter to your family, true friends and genuine appreciators, Brother, King.”


	The post included a series of pictures of D'Angelo in the studio, as well as a snap of the two musicians in which D is giving one of his classic pensive, knowing looks and Hill is smiling as the pair lean their heads together. In a 2008 interview with Rolling Stone, D'Angelo reflected on his studio time with Hill, calling her “warm and sweet” and revealing that the original plan was to show up on each other's projects.


	“Originally, we were going to swap tunes for each other's projects because I was working on Voodoo at the same time and my keyboardist James Poyser was also working with her,” he said at the time of the producer/songwriter who has been a member of the Roots since 2009 and who has produced and written songs for a constellation of neo soul giants including Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Common and others. “I went to her house in New Jersey, she played a lot of songs for me and gave me a rough copy to listen to. When Lauryn and I went into in the studio together, I laid down my vocals in the course of an hour.


	Hill joined an emotional chorus of friends, fans and fellow musicians who paid tribute to D'Angelo on Tuesday, a roster that included Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Tyler, the Creator, Missy Elliott, Doja Cat, DJ Premiere and many more.

	Start with the laundry. Of the many times Bob Mould‘s band Sugar unexpectedly found itself at the center of pop culture in the Nineties, one in particular springs to mind for him: a 1992 festival in Belgium where Sugar were on the same bill as Metallica, Neil Young and Crazy Horse, Lenny Kravitz, and the Black Crowes. For Mould, who emerged from indie rock the previous decade with Minneapolis' mighty Hüsker Dü, it was far from a typical gig. “Being on the periphery of the excess of those times was pretty crazy,” he says. “It was very, very different than jumping in a van and doing a punk rock tour. It was like, ‘So, Metallica bring washers and dryers out with them. I get it now.'”


	Compared with his years in Hüsker Dü and the many decades after on his own, Sugar were a streaking comet in Mould's career: two albums and one EP in two years, then over and out. But within that compressed time, Sugar brought Mould, bassist David Barbe, and drummer Malcolm Travis as close to the mainstream as Mould would ever get. In addition to that Belgium festival, the band played others with headliners like the Cure, powering through sandblasters like “If I Can't Change Your Mind,” “JC Auto,” and “Your Favorite Thing,” which found a home on alt-rock radio.

	











	Now, 30 years after Sugar played their last show — and more than a dozen years after an attempted but abandoned reunion — the band has returned. The group teased something was in the works on social media last week and this week unveiled a newly recorded raver, “House of Dead Memories.” There are shows announced in London and New York, too, set for May 2026.

	











	Ironically, Sugar weren't even originally intended to be a band. Mould's first post-Hüskers album, Workbook, was critically lauded — “See a Little Light” was a college radio hit and found its way onto soundtracks — but the follow-up, the bleaker and tenser Black Sheets of Rain, received a more muted response. Mould plowed on, recruiting former Mercyland bassist Barbe and Human Switchboard and Zulus drummer Travis as his new rhythm section. As they were rehearsing in Athens, Georgia, to make a Mould album, the trio were invited to play a one-off show at the 40 Watt Club there.

	“We were like, ‘Sure, why not?'” Mould says. “It was already feeling like a band.” Next came a name, inspired by a packet on a coffee-shop table, and Mould unexpectedly had his first group after the glorious but often fraught ride that was Hüsker Dü. “I knew David and Malcom and their abilities and personalities, and I thought, ‘I bet this will work — I think it should work,'” he recalls. “And it did work.”


	Released in 1992, just after Nirvana's Nevermind and Pearl Jam's Ten messed with everyone's expectations of how rock could sound and sell, Sugar's debut, Copper Blue, was the right record at the right moment in the culture. “I was over in Europe in the summer of '91, playing a lot of festivals with Nirvana and Dinosaur Jr., and the table was getting set then for everything,” he says. “And to have Nirvana blow up like that, at the moment I'm coming back with a power-pop thing as opposed to what Workbook and Black Sheets were: I wish I could say, ‘Oh yeah, I knew this was coming.'”


	While not quite Nevermind in terms of sales, Copper Blue introduced Mould and his raging voice and guitar to a raft of Lollapalooza-minded kids — who probably didn't know much about his previous band but loved Mould's razor-edged songs and the MTV-friendly videos that accompanied them. “I got my ass handed to me a little bit by Black Sheets of Rain, so I went into Sugar with a little bit of ‘I'll show everybody,'” he says. “And everything sort of blew up immediately. I didn't wish for it, but when it happened It was like, ‘Well, here we are.'”


	With Sugar's success, Mould was thrust into a world of big-league alt-rock he'd only slightly experienced before. “It was a crazy time,” he says. “Whether I was in the office or doing press or writing and recording in the studio, I did not have a life beyond keeping that rocket in the sky for as long as I could. I wasn't a stranger to mainstream stuff, since Hüsker Dü was on The Joan Rivers Show. But when it's coming at you every day, that was sort of wild.”

	Late in 1994, Barbe told Mould he wanted to spend more time with his family, and the timing proved right for Sugar to wind down: A few months before, Kurt Cobain had killed himself. “Kurt's passing really hit me personally,” Mould says. “Sugar were in Atlanta, working in the studio, and to see Kurt Loder pop up on the TV and say, ‘Kurt Cobain is dead,' it was pretty demoralizing. It made me wonder, ‘What is this?' Kurt's situation was unique to him but not dissimilar to what was starting to happen when young people get really successful and lose track of things. And I thought, ‘Wow, this business is sort of harsh.'”


	Sugar played one week of shows in Japan early in 1995 and called it a day, with Travis moving on to other bands and Barbe shifting to academia (he currently teaches music business at the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business). In the 30 years since, Mould has made innumerable records on his own, ventured into DJ'ing and electronica, wrote scripts for World Championship Wrestling, and toured and recorded regularly with his current rhythm section, Jason Narducy and Jon Wurster. Sugar first resurfaced in 2011, as the 20th anniversary of Copper Blue approached. Mould, Barbe, and Travis got together and rehearsed for a possible reunion, but the musical vibe was not as inspiring as Mould had hoped. “I was a little resistant to the idea of going out on a 20-year thing,” he says. “I know a lot of people were doing it. So we got together and took a shot at it, and I think we all walked away thinking, ‘Eh, not right now.' At least for me, it was like, ‘I think I'm going to do what I'm doing.'”


	Last fall, as he was working what would be his next record, Here We Go Crazy, Mould began to sense a surge of interest in his old band, from music business folks who sensed a market and BMG, which was planning a Copper Blue reissue and a Sugar singles collection. “Fans have always shown interest,” he says. “But people in the business, whether it was BMG to different promoters around the country, were voicing things.” 


	Mould and Barbe had toured together, playing separate sets, but a year ago, the trio reconvened once more, at Barbe's Athens, Georgia, studio to play the old material. “This second time felt much, much better for all three of us, personally and as a former band,” Mould says. “So we started looking at getting back together to do a few things.”

	











	Earlier this year, they took the next step. When the band reformed 14 years ago, Mould had just written “House of Dead Memories,” which he never recorded but unearthed for Sugar's resurrection. “It's a failed-relationship song, nothing too unique for me,” he says with a chuckle. “But the riff is definitely a Sugar-type riff, and it was fun to get the three of us on the floor together to record for the first time in ages.” So much so, apparently, that the take of “House of Dead Memories” we're hearing is the first one. 


	In a curious bit of timing, another part of Mould's past will be resurfacing this fall. Arriving next month is 1985: The Miracle Year, a collection of unreleased Hüsker Dü live recordings from that pivotal moment in the band's history. Centered around a tape of an entire set recorded at Minneapolis' First Avenue club in January of that year, and fleshed out with other recordings from 1985, the album captures the blistering roar, frenetic energy, and punchy songs that Mould, Greg Norton, and the late Grant Hart made (along with covers of Donovan's “Sunshine Superman,” the Beatles' “Ticket to Ride” and “Helter Skelter,” and “Love Is All Around,” the Mary Tyler Moore Show theme song). It's a sound that, decades later, still surprised Mould when he heard the restored tapes. 


	“I was pretty speechless,” he says. “At that period, we were firing on so many cylinders at once that I never had a moment to stop and think. I just knew we were the best. I didn't know how much fire we had, so to hear it close to 40 years later, I was like, ‘Jesus Christ, this is insane.'”


	As Mould has talked about and written about in his memoir See a Little Light, Hüsker Dü could be an insane experience unto itself, thanks to tension between Mould and Hart, but the time frame of the collection brought back largely positive memories. “What we did in January '85 is in such contrast to whatever collapse happened in December of '87 and whatever animus happened in the decades after,” he says. “Grant and I were in touch, but it was a complicated, complex situation. We were very strong-minded, very stubborn, opinionated young men in a band. But 1985 was the year New Day Rising came out, and going into the summer Grant and I took full control of everything and we made ‘Makes No Sense at All' and then Flip Your Wig. Those were good times.”

	Mould particularly feels the absence of Hart (who died in 2017 of liver cancer) in the album's packaging. “Grant was always in charge of the art department, and it's been tough,” he says. “When a new designer comes along, I'm like, ‘Well, let me think about what Grant would have think of this.' People step in and do what they can. But for me personally, it's always, ‘What would Grant do with this?' It's a big chair to fill.”

	











	As far as Sugar, Mould says the response to their reunion announcement and “House of Dead Memories” will determine what to do beyond the two sets of concerts already set. “I don't want to get out too far in front of the skis, as they say,” he says. “People's reactions will probably guide a lot of the possibilities in front of us, whether it's more songs or more shows. All three of us are all in for whatever feels right. I just want to see if people are still interested.”

Justin Timberlake has paid tribute to D'Angelo, whose three solo albums — his debut, Brown Sugar, 2000's Voodoo, and 2014's Black Messiah — reshaped the landscape of soul music and helped ignite a new era. Following D'Angelo's passing on Oct. 14 at 51, Timberlake shared how the visionary's work impacted his own musical journey and how he had the opportunity to meet him backstage at Radio City Music Hall.


	“I'll never forget hearing Brown Sugar for the first time. It changed me. You changed me,” wrote Timberlake in his letter posted to Instagram Stories, calling the record the “most pivotal moment in establishing confidence in my own voice.” 


	“For the first time, I heard a sound that reflected the sounds I grew up with — early R&B but now it was intertwined with a modern edge,” he continued. “The chords and arrangement carried a mixture of church/jazz/funk, the harmonies delicately dancing with one another. It sat in my spirit and always will.”

	Timberlake went on to praise Voodoo as his “favorite mixed album of all time.” He added, “The legendary players and collaborators. The sounds, the way it made colors dance around my head. It grabbed me. It shook me. I was changed once again.” 

	











	The “Selfish” singer also said that the Voodoo tour stop at Radio City was “one of the best concerts” of his life. “You. Quest. Pino. Poyser. And everyone on that stage had just ripped the faces off that crowd,” Timberlake reminisced. “And then I was lucky enough to grab a sacred moment with you backstage. And tell you how in awe of you I was.” The singer said that his previously posted photo of him and D'Angelo was taken at that exact moment and when they met, he was “kind, under-spoken.” Timberlake added, “I will never forget that.”

	











	While Timberlake said he could go on about D'Angelo's breadth of work including his “favorite Lauryn collab,” to “put it the way I know best in this moment: you took R&B and put it in all capitals.”

Tuesday night saw each celebrity perform a special tribute dance, with contestants choosing to honor their parents, siblings, former co-stars, romantic partners and children.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



[This story contains spoilers from episode five of Dancing With the Stars season 34.]


	It was an emotional night in the Dancing With the Stars ballroom for Dedication Night, and to make the night even sweeter, no one was eliminated from the competition at the end of the episode.




	Each celebrity performed a special tribute dance to honor of someone in their life, delivering 10 emotional routines in honor of the cast's parents, siblings, former co-stars, romantic partners and children. (Read who the professional dancers would dedicate their own number to here.)

	Former professional dancer Kym Herjavec also returned to the ballroom, serving as the first official guest judge of the season.


	Finishing out the fifth week of season 34, the cast is noticeably dwindling down. Hilaria Baldwin was eliminated at the end of last week's Disney Night, making her the fourth contestant to exit the competition. No one was eliminated at the end of Dedication Night, meaning the remaining cast composed of 10 couples all moved onto the sixth week of competition.


	The remaining celebrities include Secret Lives of Mormon Wives stars Jen Affleck and Whitney Leavitt, Olympian Jordan Chiles, social media star Alix Earle, The Traitors season three winner (and Zac Efron's brother) Dylan Efron, actresses Danielle Fishel and Elaine Hendrix, Pentatonix's Scott Hoying, conservationist (and son of Steve Irwin) Robert Irwin and comedian-actor Andy Richter.

	











	Richter kicked off the night with an adorable salsa alongside his daughter. One of the most highly anticipated numbers of Dedication Night was Irwin's contemporary to Phil Collins' “You'll Be in My Heart,” which he devoted to his mother, Terri Irwin. And it proved to be a memorable one, as he earned his first three nines of the season, ending with a total score of 35/40 (after sending the entire ballroom into tears).


	Fishel dedicated her jive set to the Boy Meets World theme song to her former co-star William Daniels, also known as Mr. Feeny on the series. The performance landed the actress her first eight of the competition.


	Leavitt emerged as an early frontrunner during the first half of the competition, placing as the top-scoring couple for four consecutive episodes. Disney Night was the first time she and Mark Ballas pulled ahead as the only couple to place at the top of the leaderboard, and they notably earned the season's first nine. 


	However, Efron ended her top-scoring streak on Dedication Night, becoming the first celebrity to earn four nines, one from each of the judges. The Traitors winner performed his dance in honor of his little sister set to the tune of his elder brother, Zac, and Zendaya's song “Rewrite the Stars.” Trailing close behind Efron were Irwin and Earle, who both respectively scored 35/40 points.


	At the end of (most) nights of the competition, the couple with the lowest combined total of judges' scores and viewer votes is eliminated. Live voting takes place during the East Coast airing of each show and ends shortly after the final dance is completed.

	











	See the full list of scores for week five of DWTS season 34 (aka Dedication Night) below. 


	Andy Richter and Emma Slater: 24/40Robert Irwin and Witney Carson: 35/40Elaine Hendrix and Alan Bersten: 30/40Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas: 33/40Jen Affleck and Jan Ravnik: 29/40Dylan Efron and Daniella Karagach: 36/40Jordan Chiles and Ezra Sosa: 32/40Scott Hoying and Rylee Arnold: 30/40Danielle Fishel and Pasha Pashkov: 29/40Alix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy: 35/40


	Season 34 of DWTS airs and streams simultaneously on ABC and Disney+ on Tuesdays, with new episodes available to stream on Wednesdays on Hulu.

Pulitzer-winner Caroline Fraser maps the lives and crimes of Ted Bundy and his infamous peers—the Green River Killer, the I-5 Killer, the Night Stalker, the Hillside Strangler, and even Charles Manson—and explores an intriguing hypothesis: might environmental factors have played a role in the rise of serial killers in the 1970s and '80s?

Caroline Fraser is the author of Prairie Fires: The American Dreams of Laura Ingalls Wilder, which won the Pulitzer Prize. She is also the author of God's Perfect Child: Living and Dying in the Christian Science Church, and her writing has appeared in The New York Review of Books, The New Yorker, The Atlantic, Los Angeles Times, and London Review of Books, among other publications. Her new book is Murderland: Crime and Bloodlust in the Time of Serial Killers.

Something shifted for Mamoru Hosoda after he made Belle. That simple, small-scale Hosoda you loved for Mirai is gone. Now he's in his maximalism era and his latest, Scarlet, proves he might be there for a while. 2021's Belle saw the Japanese filmmaker exploring the virtues of grief through a modernist Beauty and the Beast retelling in a VR environment. Scarlet revisits the exploration of the virtues of grief and modernism, but this time with a gender-swapped, supernatural adaptation of Hamlet. To me, Hosoda is like the Guillermo del Toro of Japanese animators, as his ambitions exceed his grasp, but damn it, he cultivates a striking animated spectacle nonetheless.

MPA Rating: PG-13 (for strong violence/bloody images.)

Runtime: 1 Hour and 51 Minutes

Language: Japanese

Production Companies: Studio Chizu, Nippon Television Network Corporation, Sony Pictures Entertainment (Japan) Inc., Kadokawa Corporation, Toho Co. Ltd.

Distributor: Sony Pictures Classics

Director: Mamoru Hosoda

Writer: Mamoru Hosoda

Cast: Mana Ashida, Masaki Okada, Kôji Yakusho

U.S Release Date: December, 12 2025 (Limited) | February 6, 2026 (Nationwide)

Princess Scarlet (Mana Ashida) watches her uncle Claudius (Kôji Yakusho) carry out a coup and murder her father, the king, in medieval Denmark. She is banished and spends a large portion of her childhood in secret sword-fighting training. When Scarlet finally returns home, on a mission to exact her revenge, she is poisoned and falls into a coma. 

She finds herself in the "Otherworld," a paranormal purgatory where individuals from all backgrounds and eras — past and present — live side by side. She encounters Hijiri (Masaki Okada), a pacifist nurse. After discovering that Claudius is also there, Scarlet and Hijiri set out to find him on a perilous journey through the different badlands knowing that if they are killed in the Otherworld, they will vanish into thin air. However, during their journey, Hijiari makes every effort to persuade Scarlet that there is more to life than vengeance.

For better or worse, if you know Hosada's game, a lot of Scarlet will seem like the director revisiting his greatest hits. If you aren't, might I suggest taking a look at Belle and Mirai? Perhaps make it a double feature since Scarlet combines elements of both films: character-driven narrative and 3D-2D hybrid animation techniques. It might be overwhelming to take in at once if this is your first Hosoda. 

The beautiful animation quality from Studio Chizu is an improvement over their previous work, Belle included. Scarlet's initial set-up is just "girl Hamlet" drawn in 2D with gothic colors. Yet, once the titular rage-fueled princess enters the Otherworld, she gets hit with that colorful cel-shaded 3D beam, and so do her surroundings — once again taking cues from Belle. Contrary to Belle's VR world "U," which was overwhelming and only featured in segments of the narrative, Scarlet's supernatural Otherworld, where the majority of the story takes place, is grounded, sprawling, and fully realized. 

In this 3D landscape, Hosoda adeptly executes an epic scope for his protagonist and the action on her quest. The action sequences are intense and violent, making great use of the backdrop in 3D composition and movement, illustrating an insane level of combat as Scarlet's bright blue eyes see red — as bright as her hair — when she encounters Claudius' goons in the Otherworld. The film's swashbuckling Hamlet-echo-fighter heroine is still afforded the opportunity to get her hands dirty in numerous set pieces. 

In terms of aesthetics, Scarlet is more visually and narratively accessible than Belle. Its fantastical supernatural realm is reminiscent of George Miller's Furiosa, but with a medieval wardrobe, and if it were rendered in the same cel-shaded graphics program as The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. The backgrounds consist of deserted sandy wastelands, volcanic terrains reminiscent of Pompeii, with numerous dusty oases and storms. Besides that, there is a storm dragon with swords in its face that horrifically kills homicidal sinners with a single thunderstrike.

This is Hosoda, after all, and the man delivers on three separate themes simultaneously while exploring the Otherworld's setting and experimenting with time, all while flying by the seat of his pants. Scarlet is most successful when its subversive anti-war character arc is shaped by Scarlet's healing process, influenced by her developing relationship with Hijiri. His pacifism challenges Scarlet's worldview, offering reflection on her purpose outside seeking retribution. The two characters have a potent budding chemistry and a positive influence on each other's moralistic values. I love how during the action sequences, Scarlet, heeding Hijiri suggestions to not kill her foes, goes full Daredevil, kicking ass with brutality but still showing mercy. 

That said, the movie spends most of its time on our two heroes reflecting on the lives they used to live. There isn't much of a sense of urgency, which makes the already unnecessary two-hour runtime feel even longer. The lines between our reality and Hamlet do blur, particularly with regards to Claudius, the selfish dictator of an impoverished land, full of false promises of an “infinite land” that he had not been to himself, weaponizing his followers' desperation for his gain. And then there's the sloppily executed yet well-intentioned no-borders theme. Hosoda likes to show the Otherworld's melting pot in slow, rambling beats, like when Hijiri learns to hula dance with a Hawaiian woman. Yet the meandering lets some themes, primarily its no-borders/false-kings narrative feel underdeveloped. As the two reach Claudius' Castlevania-like castle, the tone intensifies in a snap, leaping into war-filled chaos, missing a bridging scene or two to add cohesiveness.

As it enters its second half, Scarlet fully symmetrizes as a maximalized adaptation of Hamlet and as an introspective journey of self-discovery through potent psychological and supernatural cues. I couldn't help but get excited when Rosencrantz and Guildenstern joined the battle to see how they would contribute to Hosoda's passionate vision. Even if it falters in its other themes when it gets too big for its britches, Hosoda compensates with unwavering sincerity throughout. At a certain point, it explained why it was programmed at NYFF, as they usually don't program animated features to the festival.

Even though I miss Hosoda's simple work, Scarlet is another stunning effort a visionary whose stories are frustratingly overambitious but still captivating.

The Big Bang and the age of the universe have plenty of evidence behind them, from the temperature of the cosmic microwave background to the measured expansion of the universe. Through a lot of work over the last century, we now believe the universe to be around 13.8 billion years old.

But it would not take much to refute this idea. If we were to find a star that is definitively older than this, it would show that the universe was around before 13.8 billion years ago. Enter star HD 140283, looking suspiciously non-metallic.

HD 140283, better known as the Methuselah star, is around 200 light-years from Earth, in the constellation of Libra. It is known to be a high-velocity, sub-giant star, and one of the closest metal-poor stars to our Solar System. 

"The high rate of motion is evidence that the star is simply a visitor to our stellar neighborhood," NASA's Hubble Mission team explains of the star. "Its orbit carries it down through the plane of our galaxy from the ancient halo of stars that encircle the Milky Way, and will eventually slingshot back to the galactic halo."

In the 1950s, astronomers found HD 140283 to be very metal-poor compared to other stars in the neighborhood, suggesting that the star was formed earlier in the universe, before it had become "polluted" by heavier elements fused in the center of other stars. In the early 2000s, astronomers attempted to age it, and came up with an even more surprising result. According to their observations and analysis using stellar evolution models, the Methuselah star's age was possibly around 16 billion years old.

The age of stars is pretty difficult to pin down, relying on measurements of their absolute brightness as well as their chemical abundances, and this was far from the final word on the topic. 

"Maybe the cosmology is wrong, stellar physics is wrong, or the star's distance is wrong," Howard Bond of Pennsylvania State University in University Park and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore said in a 2013 statement, after new measurements by the Hubble Space Telescope. "So we set out to refine the distance."

That team refined distance measurements to the star, an important step in figuring out a star's intrinsic brightness, which is fundamental in determining its age. Think of it like not knowing if you are seeing a torch held by an approaching stranger, or a very distant lighthouse. Placing the star's distance at a refined 190.1 light-years, and finding that it had a higher-than-predicted oxygen to iron ratio, the team aged the star to be a much less universe model-breaking star.

"Put all of those ingredients together and you get an age of 14.5 billion years, with a residual uncertainty that makes the star's age compatible with the age of the universe," Bond said, adding, "This is the best star in the sky to do precision age calculations by virtue of its closeness and brightness."

With uncertainty of around 0.8 billion years, at the lower end of the age estimate, it is at least not older than the universe is believed to be. Further studies have placed the star's age between 13.7 billion and 12.2 billion years, with another suggesting between 11.5 billion years and 12.5 billion years. 

The Methuselah star, named for the Biblical Noah's grandfather, described as dying at the age of 969, is likely not older than the universe, nor evidence that we have the age of the universe horribly wrong. But it remains the oldest star we have found in the universe so far. There are other candidates, such as J22132050-5137385, which is thought to be around 13.6 billion years old, give or take 2.6 billion years. Further measurements of this and others could knock the Methuselah star off the top spot, or else refine the age estimate downwards.

Superhero Globalist Conspiracy Theories over DC's K.O. in Titans #28, as well as Justice League Red #3 and Wonder Woman #26 (Spoilers)

Bleeding Cool mentioned that this might be coming… previously, I wrote, "DC's K.O. is coming. The big knockdown fight event, to take on Darkseid. But before any of this can happen, something is going to have to happen to the Earth. Everyone is going to have to be evacuated. The entire planet. The fight is coming, it is coming to Earth, and there can be no harm done to the bystanders. Darkseid plans to build a new Apokolips on Earth." Indeed, today's Justice League Red #3 by Saladin Ahmed and Clayton Henry sees Red Tornado prophesying such a future, and underlining the need to save Red Arrow, to stop it. 

Save the marksman, save the world.

But also it is a bit…

I mean, right? But while all that is going on, the Titans are dealing with the here and now. The DC K.O. battle is to find a champion imbued with Omega Energy to inherit the power of the Omega King rather than Darkseid. As I previously wrote, "it's down to the Titans, minus those in the competition, to evacuate a planet of eight billion people. Ships, teleportation, city shrinking, whatever comes to hand. Oh, and they only have a week." And in today's  Titans #28 by John Layman and Pete Woods are both published by DC Comics today, it comes to pass.

Rocketing populations into space in buildings that double as spaceships… and shrinking people to fit.

And it's not just the people who are being saved but also the supervillains.

Of course, as we saw in DC's K.O. #1, it seems that maybe that didn't work out as intended.

While on Earth, not everyone wants to go. As I previously wrote, …there are some who don't want to be evacuated. Who don't believe the superheroes. Who don't want to leave their homes, their possessions or their lives…."

…"And who have got placards to protest, presumably left over from COVID, or Absolute Power, dubbed "evacuation truthers". Amanda Waller taught humanity to mistrust the superheroes, and plenty, it seems, still think she was right…"

As we have seen from Moray Island in today's Wonder Woman #26 by Tom King and Daniel Sampere, they are not alone there either…

Mouse Man knows. Justice League Red #3 by Saladin Ahmed, Clayton Henry, Titans #28 by John Layman and Pete Woods and Wonder Woman #26 by Tom King and Daniel Sampere, are all published by DC Comics today.

The "MLB on FOX' crew preview the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the NLCS. 

Los Angeles Dodgers star Teoscar Hernandez revealed that he and his wife will be switching their living quarters while in Milwaukee to face the Brewers in the National League Championship Series. 

It isn't because their hotel isn't good enough, but rather, Hernandez's wife, Jennifer, is not fond of the rumors of paranormal activity connected to it.

The Pfister Hotel is historic in Milwaukee, and that's where the Dodgers have been staying for the start of this series. However, Hernandez said before Game 2 on Wednesday night that he and his wife are moving due to rumors that the Pfister Hotel is haunted.

This isn't uncommon, as Mookie Betts continues to book Airbnbs during the series in Milwaukee because of the haunting stories about the hotel. 

Hernandez said his wife heard some stories about alleged issues while staying at the Pfister from other Dodgers' significant others. The player himself doesn't care for the stories, though.

"I don't believe in ghosts," he said, via The New York Post. "I have stayed in there before. I've never seen anything or heard anything.

"But my wife is on this trip, and she said she doesn't want to stay there. So we have to find another hotel. But I've been hearing from other players and other wives that it's something happening in these couple of nights."

As for what Hernandez has heard from teammates, he said "some of the rooms, the lights goes off and on. And the doors, there are noises, footsteps, things like that, I don't know."

No matter the stories, Hernandez is focused on helping his team repeat as World Series champions, and he helped the cause early in Wednesday's game. Hernandez belted a home run as part of a two-run top of the second inning that gave the Dodgers the lead after the Brewers jumped ahead with a Jackson Chourio solo homer in their first trip to the plate. 

The Dodgers were able to stave off the Brewers' ninth-inning rally in Game 1 on Monday night, as Blake Treinen got Brice Turang to strike out to end the game with bases loaded for Milwaukee. 

If the Dodgers are unable to come away with a two-game lead in the best-of-seven series, there is a chance Hernandez and his wife won't have to return to Milwaukee.

NASA astronaut Don Pettit tests the Mould Effect in space.

NASA astronaut Don Pettit has helped YouTuber Steve Mould with the final step in his "weird chain theory": testing the idea in space.

In 2013, YouTuber and science communicator Steve Mould brought the "chain fountain", an unsolved problem in physics, to the attention of the wider public. The effect, sometimes referred to as the "Mould effect" for his work on it, is strange to see. Simply put, place a long chain in a container, pull one end out, and let it fall to the floor. Now watch as the whole chain seems to jump up out of the glass, before falling towards the floor.

     

The effect, though independently found by Mould, was known about before, even if it was unexplained. Since the effect was popularized by Mould, he, Mehdi Sadaghdar of YouTube channel ElectroBOOM, and several academic studies have attempted to explain it. Mould has also set the record for the biggest chain fountain.

    

What is really puzzling about the effect is how the chain appears to rise out of the glass before starting its downward journey.

"Motivated by the fact that the chain has a maximum local curvature, and the fact that the phenomenon does not happen with a chain that does not have this maximum bending curvature, the chain was modelled as a sequence of freely joined rods," a 2016 paper on the topic explains.

"When a rod is pulled from one end, the end attached to the part of the chain that is already moving, the rod tends to rotate around its center of mass; consequently, the other end will go down, towards the surface of beads, kicking the pile of beads. Finally, there is a reaction force to this kick that pushes the beads upwards."

Mould's explanation (see above for the full explanation, and an awesome chain fountain) is generally thought to be correct, after a long (and friendly) argument and experiments against ElectroBOOM (and further analysis by others). 

"In short, the chain rises above the pot in a fountain because of an extra upward force coming from the pot," Mould explains in his latest video, partly shot in space. "How strong does that force need to be, though? Well, it needs to be able to overcome the weight of this arc of chain that would obviously fall under gravity. And that's it. That's all you need."

Unfortunately, in order to test his idea, Mould needed gravity to disappear. This is where NASA astronaut Don Pettit came in. Pettit, who had been intrigued by Mould's videos, offered to test the behavior of chains on the International Space Station (ISS).

 

"According to the maths, that yanking of the chain has no influence on the ark at all. If gravity wasn't a factor, the ark would be fixed there in space even though it was being yanked downwards at one end. Or at least that's the theory," Mould explained. "That's what we want to test. We want to test the theory that a chain moving at constant speed will flow through its own shape so long as it isn't acted on by an external force like gravity."

In a phone call with Mould, Pettit attempted to tug on the chain and test whether the chain truly did flow through its own shape, supporting Mould's idea, or whether it did something else. Unfortunately, it's pretty difficult to get a chain to remain stationary in microgravity, with Pettit describing them as moving around like molecules. 

Mould suggested that instead they put a chain into a loop, and stretch it out to make a rectangular shape. Then Pettit could grab the longer sides of the rectangle-ish chain and set them in motion, pushing the top one right and the bottom left, for example. If he was correct, the chain should flow through that rectangle shape, rather than spread out into a circle as you might expect.

The setup was not ideal, and the two were limited by the ISS passing out of reach of communication satellites. However, before the informal experiment ended, they did appear to set chains in motion that followed their own shape, seemingly adding evidence to Mould's explanation for the effect.

"It was a great demonstration seeing it pass through the same path through the loop and your explanation about why it would eventually turn into a full circle due to friction was pretty adequate," Sadaghdar said, adding that he wouldn't have to embarrass himself by making another debunk video.

"Although you didn't quite demonstrate if the path will remain the same if the chain wasn't in a loop. Another simulation might be nice, but what would be better is to take 100m of chain into space and drag it behind you in a spacewalk. Do it."
