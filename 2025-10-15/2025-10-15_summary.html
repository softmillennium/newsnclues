If we don't organize and take action in the streets, says Mark Bray, “we're going to end up somewhere really bad.”

We speak with Rutgers University professor Mark Bray, who fled from the U.S. to Spain with his family after receiving death threats over his scholarship. He is the author of the 2017 book Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, which explores the history and tactics of anti-fascist movements in Europe, the United States and beyond. Turning Point USA, the conservative campus group founded by Charlie Kirk, had called for Bray's firing and branded him “Dr. Antifa.” This comes as the Trump administration has dramatically escalated its war on dissent following Kirk's assassination, using his death as pretext to launch an assault on activists, organizations and speech it disagrees with.

“What we're seeing today in the U.S. is increasingly fascist. MAGA, I believe — and I study fascism, I don't say this lightly — is a fascist movement,” says Bray, referring to Trump's political movement.

President Trump signed an executive order designating antifa as a terrorist organization, but Bray stresses there is no such organization; anti-fascism is a loose political movement or ideology akin to feminism, but Trump is using the label to “demonize resistance” to his policies.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: We begin today's show with the war on antifa that the Trump administration has ratcheted up in the aftermath of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk being assassinated last month. Yesterday, President Trump posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Charlie Kirk at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden.

Trump recently signed an executive order purporting to designate antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, even though it's not really an organization. Antifa is actually a shortening of the term “anti-fascist” and is a term that arose in Europe for the movement against the Nazis, both before and after World War II. The decentralized movement in the U.S. today draws on this history.

Several high-level Republicans have accused this Saturday's “No Kings Day” protests of being organized by antifa. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said last week the administration will take the, quote, “same approach” to antifa as it has to drug cartels it's bombed in the Caribbean. This is Bondi on Fox News last night.

ATTORNEY GENERAL PAM BONDI: That's one of the things about antifa. You've heard President Trump say multiple times they are organized, they are a criminal organization. And they're very organized. You're seeing people out there with thousands of signs that all match, pre-bought, pre-put together. They're organized, and someone is funding it.

AMY GOODMAN: This comes as Los Angeles County officials voted Tuesday to declare a state of emergency over ongoing federal immigration raids they say have, quote, “caused widespread fear,” unquote.

Violent attacks by federal agents at protests against immigrant raids have also been documented in Chicago and Portland. On Tuesday, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson [was asked] if he would call for more oversight of federal agents. He responded by complaining about a naked bike ride protest against ICE in Portland, Oregon, which Trump has called a war zone.

SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON: To demand oversight on federal law enforcement? I've not seen them cross the line yet, and that we have committees of jurisdiction who have that responsibility, but it's not risen to that level. What I've seen is the abuse of law enforcement by radical leftist activists. You know, most recently, the most threatening thing I've seen yet was the naked bicyclers in Portland who were protesting ICE down there. I mean, it's getting really ugly.

AMY GOODMAN: Experts are increasingly raising concerns the Trump administration's attacks on antifa are ungrounded in fact and law, and violate free speech rights.

For more, we're joined by someone who knows a lot about all of this. Mark Bray is a Rutgers University history professor, author of the 2017 book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook. Last week, he was forced to leave his home in New Jersey and move to Spain with his family after receiving death threats following Trump's push to categorize the anti-fascist movement as a domestic terrorist organization. Charlie Kirk's group, Turning Point USA, had also circulated a petition labeling him “Dr. Antifa” and calling for him to be fired.

In a remarkable development, Bray was at first blocked from flying out of the United States last week. He wrote on Bluesky, “Someone canceled my family's flight out of the country at the last second. We got our boarding passes. We checked our bags. Went through security. Then at our gate our reservation ‘disappeared.'” They later took another flight, and professor Mark Bray joins us now from Spain.

Thanks so much for being with us. I'm sorry you've gone through all this, Professor Bray. If you can start off by talking about why you left the country and what happened, as we try to follow what was happening to you at the airport?

MARK BRAY: Right. So, I published this book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, in 2017. I'm actually researching different historical topics now. But after Trump's executive order, a series of far-right trolls, online influencers started attacking me. I received a number of death threats. Someone published my home address on X. So I started to fear for the safety of my family staying in our home. More and more death threats came in, and I knew I needed to get away. Getting to another country, getting across the ocean would make us feel much more comfortable.

As you said, our first flight was mysteriously canceled at the last moment. My two small children were sobbing. We had to regroup. The next day, as you said — 

AMY GOODMAN: I want to ask: When you — 

MARK BRAY: — I told — yeah.

AMY GOODMAN: I just want to ask: When say your flight was canceled, you went to — what was it? Newark Airport? Or Kennedy?

MARK BRAY: Yes, Newark.

AMY GOODMAN: And you got — and you got your boarding passes, and you went through security. So you were all set. And you got —

MARK BRAY: Yes.

AMY GOODMAN: — to the gate. And what did they tell you?

MARK BRAY: Right. Well, there was an error. They had us step to the side to talk to the United worker at the desk. There were a series of phone calls and mumbling. And they basically said, at the last moment, someone had canceled our reservation — not the whole flight, just for the four of us, for me, my wife and our two small children. And this is around the same time that Andy Ngo and Jack Posobiec, two of the far-right provocateurs who had been harassing me online, were meeting in the White House with President Trump to discuss antifa. I just can't believe it's a coincidence.

AMY GOODMAN: And yet, you were able to rebook the next day, and you made it through security, and you actually made it onto the flight?

MARK BRAY: Well, this time, I was stopped, searched and interrogated by federal agents for an hour. And at one point, they took me into a side room, and my two kids saw what looked like very bad men taking me in another room, and they started sobbing. So, it was quite an ordeal even the next day. But I made it out. And frankly, I'm very fearful about the potential of returning, but hopefully, by next year, things will improve.

AMY GOODMAN: I mean, this is astounding. You weren't trying to come into the United States. You were trying to leave. And you are an American citizen — not that that should have mattered.

MARK BRAY: And I'm not being charged with any crimes. If anything, I'm the victim of crimes. I wrote a book eight years ago. I consider myself politically an anti-fascist — I detest fascism — but I'm not a member of any antifa group. I'm a professor. I'm a dad. I'm just trying to live my life here. But, of course, because the far right is trying to create a bogeyman term in “antifa” to equate protests with terrorism, I got caught up in the middle of this.

AMY GOODMAN: So, you are the author, Professor Bray, of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook. If you can explain what antifa is and what it means for President Trump to have issued this executive order calling it a terrorist — domestic terrorist organization? Is it even an organization? Talk about antifa now and through history.

MARK BRAY: Right. So, as you said, it's a term that is short for “anti-fascist” or “anti-fascism.” It's originally German from the era of opposition to Hitler. After World War II, anti-fascism continued throughout the world, and the specific European tradition of what they called antifa spread to other countries around the world. For example, in the U.S., you had Anti-Racist Action in the '80s and '90s, which was a network of decentralized groups across the continent organizing against the far right.

The term “antifa” really kind of made its appearance in the U.S. in the late 2000s, but it's not an organization. It's more of a politics or a movement. I liken it to feminism. Sometimes there are feminist groups, but feminism itself is not a group. There are antifa groups, but antifa itself is not a group. It's just sort of like more of a verb. It's a thing you do to organize against the far right in decentralized groups.

Trump, of course, doesn't care about any of that. It's a useful bogeyman term to demonize protest, demonize resistance, equate it with terrorism. And it's really, you know, an obvious page out of the textbooks about fascist and authoritarian leaders. It's so — it's such an obvious imitation of, you know, the kind of the Red Scare talk about communism, but applied to today.

AMY GOODMAN: It's very interesting you've moved to Spain. I mean, for years we've covered the Abraham Lincoln Brigadistas, Brigade, those Americans who went to Spain, where you are now, to fight against the fascist Franco. Many of them died. Many of them came back. And this was just before World War II. They were the most experienced, presumably, in fighting. But when a number of them signed up to fight in World War II, to fight Hitler, they were labeled “premature anti-fascists.” Can you talk about that? And they were not allowed to fight in World War II.

MARK BRAY: Right. So, there were a lot of activists and leftists in the U.S. and around the world who realized the threat of Hitler well before mainstream society. And a number of them journeyed over to Spain to fight in the international brigades. A significant number of them lost their lives. Some of them returned. They were blacklisted in the U.S.

And it is also worth pointing out that a number of Spanish Civil War veterans from other countries who ended up going to France after the Spanish Civil War played important roles in the French underground. And there was a tank battalion of Spanish anarchists that were among the first to liberate Paris in 1945. It's a fascinating history. It's the one that I — I teach a course on the Spanish Civil War.

So, it is strange to sort of have these things twisted around. And I ended up going to Spain because I'm a historian of Spain. But I've received a lot of solidarity and support from the social movements here. And actually, there's a general strike today in Spain for Palestine, as well — just to throw into your news report.

AMY GOODMAN: We had you on last in 2017 to discuss your book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, when it first came out. In the introduction, you wrote you hoped your work would promote organizing against fascism and white supremacy. Can you elaborate?

MARK BRAY: Right. So, anti-fascism has a broad history. In the U.S., certainly, there's the European-inspired antifa tradition. There's also a really good book called The Black Antifascist Tradition that talks about the role of anti-fascism in Black liberation struggles, Black Panthers and so forth, which I suggest people check out. So, it takes many different forms.

What it has in common is actually this impulse towards unity and putting aside the differences that often divide the left, in the interest of promoting the common struggle against fascism, against white supremacy. And what we're seeing today in the U.S. is increasingly fascist. MAGA, I believe — and I study fascism, I don't say this lightly — is a fascist movement. And if we don't organize, if we don't take action in the streets, we're going to end up somewhere really bad.

And for me personally, I felt like my situation was such that I had to get my family out of harm's way. But this story about me is about me, but it's not really about me. It's about attacks on academic freedom, free speech, the right to protest. We're in a really dangerous situation. And so, everyone, in their own way, needs to take action to try and organize against this.

AMY GOODMAN: I mean, it's interesting. You remind me of Timothy Snyder, as well as Jason Stanley, the two Yale professors, who also left the country. They've gone to Canada to teach, both having written books against fascism and tyranny. I wanted to ask you about U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi's comments, saying the administration will take the, quote, “same approach” to antifa as it has to drug cartels it's bombed in the Caribbean. The latest bombing, I think, took place yesterday, killing a number of people. Even Republican politicians, behind closed doors, are saying, “Where is the evidence?” for who these people are, who have been killed by the U.S. bombs. Mark Bray, your response to Pam Bondi?

MARK BRAY: Right. Well, the paradox of fascism is that while it's trying to gain power, it talks about the need for law and order, and to the degree that it gains power, it tramples all over the law. It does not care about the law or legality, due process, civil liberties. And so, this kind of call to murder people in this country, without, of course, even having gone through any due process — not that I'm in favor of capital punishment anyway, but that's another story — it is this kind of example of calling for the strongman, in Trump, to use deadly force, without any evidence, against people accused of made-up crimes that are being equated with — you know, at times, some of the Trump administration people have compared it to — ISIS to antifa, right? So, to me, it's really this kind of fascist attack on civil liberties.

And if they're equating protesters with antifa, and they're saying that they're going to use the methods used for the people in the boats in the Caribbean on antifa, the implication is they are ready to kill American protesters. And, you know, we know the history of Kent State — right? — where students were gunned down in the '60s. It could happen again if we're not careful. So we really need to be very vigilant about this.

AMY GOODMAN: Do you think progressive groups, groups that care about democracy, free speech, across the political spectrum, are pushing back enough around the attack on anti-fascists?

MARK BRAY: Well, you know, I think there's always room for more action. And I think that my main takeaway for viewers today is that whether or not you consider yourself an anti-fascist, anyone who has any critiques of Trump is potentially in the crosshairs here, because there's a concerted project from the top to equate protest with terrorism and to say anyone who's not a Trump supporter is basically the equivalent of ISIS. You can't make this stuff up. It's absolutely ridiculous. They don't care at all about grounding in fact or information. It's something that plays to their base and justifies attempts to step beyond due process to use, apparently, lethal force against dissidents. This is terrifying. And so, everyone really needs to do what they can to sound the alarm.

AMY GOODMAN: Finally, I wanted to ask you about the Rutgers students calling for the university to support you, wanting Rutgers President William Tate to issue a statement, a, quote, “Resolution in Support of Professor Mark Bray's Academic Freedom and Free Expression.” This apparently is slated for consideration and vote Friday by the Rutgers University Senate. Your response, Professor Bray?

MARK BRAY: Well, I've received a tremendous amount of support from the Rutgers faculty, from the student body and from the administration. I support that call. I hope it passes. I would very much appreciate a statement of direct support from President Tate. But, you know, to his credit, he did issue a statement in support of the free speech and academic freedom of all Rutgers faculty, which did not mention me directly, but I think, implicitly, supported my right to do my scholarship in accord with my job. But, you know, again, the Rutgers community has been fantastic, and especially given attacks on higher education across the country, the way that some subjects have been, basically, straight-up banned in states like Florida, I'm happy to be a professor at Rutgers.

AMY GOODMAN: Mark Bray, Rutgers University history professor, author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook. He's just moved his family to Spain after receiving death threats following President Trump's push to categorize the anti-fascist movement as a domestic terrorist organization.

Coming up, we speak with a professor at Stanford University, professor emeritus, about what — the deal that was made in Sharm el-Sheikh, and also about his own niece, who had been held hostage by Hamas in Gaza for 54 days, her husband killed. This is Democracy Now! Back in 30 seconds.

“For Trump, the leader of Argentina is more important than American families struggling with rising costs,” said Warren.

Republican Sen. Tim Scott (South Carolina) blocked a bill seeking to stop President Donald Trump's unprecedented $20 billion bailout of Argentina and its far right government on Tuesday, with Democrats criticizing Republicans' priorities as Americans languish under GOP cuts to social programs.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) tried to pass the No Argentina Bailout Act on Tuesday afternoon via unanimous consent.

In a speech on the Senate floor, she sharply criticized the Trump administration for giving far right Argentinian President Javier Milei a massive handout while gutting health care benefits for millions of Americans, causing prices to soar due to tariffs, and firing thousands of Americans working in key government agencies.

“[Treasury] Secretary [Scott] Bessent seems to be saying that the American economy can tank, and Americans can pay higher prices, but there will be no end to using American taxpayer dollars to bail out Argentina,” said Warren. “For Trump, the leader of Argentina is more important than American families struggling with rising costs for health care.”

The bill was blocked by Scott, who defended the bailout as backing “an important ally in South America” — an ally that, as Democrats pointed out, has been undercutting the U.S. on soybean exports and harming American farmers. 

As Democrats pointed out, however, Trump and Republicans may have ulterior motives for the bailout. Popular Information reported last month that hedge fund manager Rob Citrone, a billionaire ally of Bessent, has significant investments in Argentina — and thus has a large financial stake in the success of the country's economy.

The Trump administration also has political motivations for supporting Milei, a libertarian Trump supporter whose austerity measures caused poverty to skyrocket to above 50 percent in Argentina in his first six months in office.

Warren pointed out that the bailout is seemingly timed with Argentinian midterm elections coming up on October 26 which may lose Milei a majority in the country's legislature. 

“With global investors pulling their money from the country, trying to get off his sinking ship, and destabilizing its financial markets, his party's electoral chances looked really slim. So, Trump is sending 20 billion U.S. taxpayer dollars to bail out Argentina and prop up Milei so he can stay in power,” she said. 

Democrats also lambasted Republicans for supporting the bailout at the outset of the third week of the government shutdown, which is keeping thousands of federal workers in limbo and suspending crucial services supported by American taxpayers.

“Trump refuses to negotiate to keep the government open or prevent a massive spike in health care costs for Americans, but he's eager to shell out $20 billion of taxpayer money to bail out his authoritarian buddy in Argentina,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland), a cosponsor of the bill, when Democrats introduced the legislation last week. 

“All the while, Americans are stuck facing higher prices at the grocery store and higher premiums on their health insurance. We must put a stop to Trump's brazen scheme to put himself and his cronies ahead of the needs of the American people,” Van Hollen said.

“It's day 13 of the shutdown. What's Trump doing? Negotiating a budget deal? No. Preventing premiums from doubling? No. Stopping 15 million Americans from losing health care? No,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), another bill cosponsor. “He's meeting the Pres. of Argentina to reward him with a $20 billion bailout.”

Left-wing activists amplifying a story about a racist Young Republican group chat “need to grow up,” JD Vance has said.

The US vice-president dismissed the allegedly racist, misogynistic, and anti-Semitic messages as “edgy jokes” told by “stupid kids”.

Leaked messages from the Telegram group chat for Republican students, young staffers, and budding politicians, allegedly described black people as “monkeys” and “the watermelon people,” joked about sending their political foes to the gas chamber, and wrote: “I love Hitler”.

The group, which is not formally affiliated with the Republican Party or the Trump administration, is also said to have praised conservatives they guessed would support slavery, used racial slurs, and referred to rape as “epic,” according to Politico.

In one of the messages shared by Politico, a member said the group was “cooked” if the chat were ever leaked, meaning they would face serious consequences.

The Young Republicans group chat is said to have included members from New York, Kansas, Arizona, and Vermont.

It also included senior members of the club, a sitting senator, and staffers working for elected officials, according to MSNBC, several of whom have since apologised.

Following the publication of the messages, some members of the group chat lost their jobs or had job offers rescinded.

Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, called on Donald Trump to condemn the “revolting messages”, while Hakeem Jeffreies, his counterpart in the House, said GOP representatives had been “palling around with these racist, anti-Semitic and bigoted ‘Young Republicans' for years”.

“The more the political atmosphere is open and liberating – like it has been with the emergence of Trump and a more Right-wing GOP even before him – it opens up young people and older people to telling racist jokes, making racist commentaries in private and public,” Joe Feagin, a Texas A&M sociology professor, told Politico. “It's chilling, of course, because they will act on these views.”

The White House rejected any suggestion the group chat was linked with, or inspired by, Mr Trump's rhetoric.

“Only an activist, Left-wing reporter would desperately try to tie President Trump into a story about a random group chat he has no affiliation with, while failing to mention the dangerous smears coming from Democrat politicians who have fantasised about murdering their opponent and called Republicans Nazis and fascists,” Liz Huston, the White House spokeswoman, told Politico.

“No one has been subjected to more vicious rhetoric and violence than President Trump and his supporters.”

Asked about the Politico report, Mr Vance said outraged reactions amounted to “pearl-clutching”.

Referring to texts sent by Jay Jones, the Democratic candidate for Virginia attorney general, in which he joked about shooting a political rival, Mr Vance said: “This is far worse than anything said in a college group chat, and the guy who said it could become the AG of Virginia.

“I refuse to join the pearl-clutching when powerful people call for political violence.”

Later on Wednesday, Mr Vance implored critics to “grow up”.

“Grow up. I'm sorry, focus on the real issues don't focus on what kids say in group chats,” he said. “The reality is, kids do stupid things, especially young boys. They tell edgy offensive jokes, that's what kids do.”

In a statement, a spokesman for the Young Republicans' board of directors said: “We are appalled by the vile and inexcusable language revealed in the Politico article published today.

“Such behaviour is disgraceful, unbecoming of any Republican, and stands in direct opposition to the values our movement represents.

“Those involved must immediately resign from all positions within their state and local Young Republican organisations. We must hold ourselves to the highest standards of integrity, respect, and professionalism.”

More than two dozen Palestinian healthcare workers held hostage in Israel's torture camps were supposed to be released on Monday, October 13, according to Healthcare Workers Watch-Palestine (HWW), an organization that tracks Israel's attacks on Palestine's healthcare system.

“While not all releases are confirmed yet, the list includes 24 nurses, 7 doctors, and 2 paramedics,” the group said in a press release issued on Monday.

“While their release is warmly welcomed, there are at least 115 more Gazan healthcare workers who are still being held in Israeli detention,” HWW continued. “These include at least 20 doctors, of whom 15 are irreplaceable senior specialists.”

Of the 55 healthcare workers listed for release, Israeli soldiers abducted 44 from the hospitals where they were working; one person from an organized convoy to transfer patients through Israel-designated “safe routes”; and one person during a rescue mission, as per HWW.

Dr. Ahmad Mhanna, the director of Al-Awda Hospital, was not on the list, but was released on Monday, the group said. Israeli forces abducted Mhanna in 2023.

“During his captivity, Dr. Mhanna endured various forms of suffering and torture, yet he remained steadfast, holding firmly to his humanitarian and professional principles, believing that medicine is a calling before it is a profession,” the hospital said in a statement on Tuesday, as per CNN.

Renowned pediatrician Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, ​​the director of Gaza's Kamal Adwan Hospital, has not yet been released, according to news reports. On December 27, 2024, Israeli forces forced Abu Safiya to evacuate everyone in the hospital, approximately 350 people. That evening, soldiers stripped, shackled, blindfolded, and beat him, along with the rest of the male members of the medical staff, according to a new documentary, “The Disappearance of Dr. Abu Safiya,” produced by Al Jazeera Fault Lines. They abducted Abu Safiya, and burned down the hospital.

On Monday, pursuant to the ceasefire agreement, Hamas released all 20 living Israelis who had been taken on October 7, including at least two IDF soldiers, and Israel released approximately 1,700 Palestinian hostages who had been abducted over the last two years, including six children and more than two dozen men over 60. Approximately 250 Palestinians serving lengthy or life sentences were also freed, although about 150 were exiled to Egypt, as per Drop Site News. Israel threatened Palestinians in the West Bank with arrest if they celebrated the releases.

Since the genocide began over two years ago, Israeli forces have targeted Gaza's hospitals, ambulances, patients, and healthcare workers. Israel attacked close to 40 hospitals, and slaughtered more than 1,700 healthcare workers. The blockade forced doctors in Gaza to perform surgeries, including amputations, without anesthesia.

A year ago this week, Israel bombed the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Among the victims was Shaban al-Dalou, a 19-year-old software engineering student. Video captured the teenager, attached to an IV drip, engulfed in flames, burning alive. His mother, and at least three others, also perished in the attack.

Over the last two years, Israel has disappeared more than 400 healthcare workers from Gaza and the West Bank, according to HWW.

“Israel's systematic abduction of healthcare workers is a war crime which has decimated the hospital workforce in Gaza,” Dr. Muath Alser, the co-founder and director of HWW, said in a statement. “Israel must immediately and unconditionally release all the detained healthcare workers including the bodies of those tortured to death in detention.”

According to HWW, five healthcare workers were killed while held captive.

Healthcare workers detained in Israel's torture camps have reported to HWW that they were beaten, sexually assaulted with foreign objects, sexually humiliated, and hung from ceilings. A paramedic told the group he was hung from a ceiling and electrocuted.

“They put me in an overall that had electricity wires around it and put, like a headband with wires on my head,” they said, as per a report released last year by HWW. “I swear, it was so degrading, it was unbelievable. I was helping people as a paramedic, I never expected something like this.”

(The Carceral Report is using they/them pronouns for the victim as their gender is not included in HWW's report.)

A nurse said he too was hung from the ceiling, with his hands tied behind his back. His captor subjected him to penile torture and beatings.

“I endured this torture for about 19 hours,” he said. “When I woke up, I found myself in a place that looked like a clinic, but I wasn't sure if it was really a clinic or not. I didn't know if I had been given a blood transfusion or not. Then, they returned me to the same room, but the second time was worse.”

Earlier this year, The Guardian published harrowing testimonies from senior doctors and surgeons' — including from hospital director Mhanna, who was released on Monday — about the torture they endured while held hostage.

“I was taken to a military barracks where I spent 21 days,” Mhanna told his family in a letter, dictated to his attorney, as per The Guardian. “During this period, they took me to what they called the ‘Disco' – an interrogation room with deafening music and freezing temperatures. I slept on gravel, wearing only a thin tracksuit.”

They told him he would be released, but he was sent to Naqab prison, where Israeli prison guards routinely terrorize their Palestinians victims.

“They used to let the dog drink from a bowl of water and then pour the rest over me,” Mhanna said, as per The Guardian. “I fell to the ground because my legs were shackled. They laughed and kicked me in the side.”

He continued: “At one point, they forced me to stand for six hours in the cold, arms raised and shackled, before interrogating me. I told them the same thing every time: ‘I am a doctor. I do not belong to anything else.'”

Remarking on the ongoing U.S.–China rare earth export dispute, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said during an Oct. 15 news conference that if Beijing refuses to act as a reliable trading partner, the United States and its allies may have no choice but to decouple.

While emphasizing that decoupling—severing trade ties entirely or nearly so—is not Washington's desired outcome, Bessent said it could become unavoidable given China's posture in the current standoff over rare earth supplies.

The campaign is part of a larger $3.2 million contract that also includes paying pastors to produce content.

A newly-created firm called Show Faith by Works is embarking on a “geofencing” campaign to target Christian churches and colleges across the American Southwest with pro-Israel advertisements. The pastors and congregations themselves are seemingly unaware of this campaign, and some have concerns with Israel's methods to target Christians.

According to the firm's filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), Show Faith by Works will “geofence the actual boundaries of every Major (sic) church in California, Arizona, Nevada, and Coloardo (sic) and all Christian Colleges during worship times” and then “track attendees and continue to target [them] with ads” on behalf of Israel. The geofencing campaign is part of a larger $3.2 million contract that also includes trying to hire celebrity spokespeople and paying pastors to produce content.

RS reached out to hundreds of churches in California, Arizona, Nevada, and Colorado that were listed as potential targets of the geofencing campaign. None that responded were aware of the campaign. “We were not aware of that, no — you are the first to bring that to our attention,” said the press office for Bethel Church in Redding, California.

The project manager of the operation, Chad Schnitger, explained in an email to RS that the ads may include “invitations for Christians to visit one of our upcoming Mobile Museum exhibits, or to go to our website to learn more about the program, or to visit Israel with your church.” The firm's pitch deck describes the ads as “pro-lsreal (sic) and anti-Palestinian.”

The “Mobile Museum” Schnitger is referring to is a mobile trailer coordinated by his firm that will visit Christian colleges and churches highlighting atrocities from the Hamas attack on October 7, as well as “footage of IDF explaining the difficulty of fighting bad guys in hostile territory with civilians.” Schnitger confirmed the firm currently has one mobile museum exhibit, and that it would be ready to start travelling to churches and colleges in about a month.

Geofencing has long been a way for corporations to capture audiences by using their location services. It allows corporations to market their products using the location of mobile devices, triggering texts, in-app notifications, or mobile ads when users enter a certain physical boundary.

In an interview with RS, Megan Iorio, Senior Counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, described geofencing as a “privacy nightmare.” Iorio explained that data brokers vacuum up data from various applications that use location services, and then will either sell that data to marketing firms or offer marketing tools themselves. Then, users with location services enabled might, for instance, see an H&M advertisement if they walk within a certain radius of an H&M store.

Schnitger said that media reports covering the geofencing campaign have been “sensationalized” and pointed out that it's a common marketing tool; “It is not sending information back to a foreign entity; it's a way to deliver ads … This is a 1-way ad push using marketing tools that have been in place for over 10 years.” Iorio explained that while it is commonplace, the technique is “incredibly invasive.”

“The fact it has become so common and that foreign governments are now using it for targeted, precise influence campaigns shows how much we need regulation to stamp down on the practice. Today, it's the Israeli government looking to curry favor among Christians, but tomorrow it could be a foreign adversary looking to foment discord in a specific US city, and that has broad national security implications.” she added.

Some members of the communities listed as potential targets of Israel's geofencing campaign share these concerns about Israel using this marketing technique.

Micah, a mechanical engineer in Colorado Springs, has been conducting outreach to pastors and local newspapers in order to raise awareness that seven local churches were listed in the document as targets of the geofencing campaign. Micah circulated a document outlining his concerns, which RS obtained a copy of.

“What jumps out immediately is how the entire document talks about Christians as targets to be manipulated. This isn't respectful outreach — it's warfare language,” he wrote.

One of Micah's main concerns is that the firm is paying pastors on behalf of Israel. Show Faith by Works' pitch deck includes a plan to give stipends for “individual guest pastors, bilingual pastors, or pastors who match target demographics to record messages based on content creation targets.” Micah says that this “creates financial conflicts of interest where religious leaders become financially dependent on foreign government messaging, compromising their independence and integrity.”

Asa, Micah's brother, attends Scottsdale Bible Church in Arizona, one of the churches listed by Show Faith by Works. Asa said that Show Faith by Works' campaign is a reaction to Israel losing the support of America's youth. “This entire project is an attempt to regain the attention and hearts/support of Gen Z through the use of religious manipulation,” he said. Micah and Asa requested that RS exclude their full names to discuss the matter freely.

Schnitger is optimistic about swaying Christians' views on Israel. “For those who dislike Israel, maybe some of these exhibits and materials will change your mind.” Part of that effort is to stress anti-Palestinian talking points. The firm's pitch deck includes talking points about how “[P]alestinian and Iranian goals are not land-focused, but genocidal.”

Timothy Feldman, a software engineer in Plano, Texas, explained in an email to RS that he was upset to see his church listed as a potential target for Israel's geofencing campaign. “I am disgusted that a genocidal apartheid state is attempting to whitewash its atrocities by propagandizing the good people of Christ United Methodist Church,” said Feldman.

Despite the inclusion of Texas churches like the one in Plano in the pitch deck, Schnitger clarified in an email that the firm is currently not doing anything in Texas.

A church worker in Prescott, Arizona, saw his church on the list too and explained to RS in a phone interview that it's unclear how the pastors will respond. “The demographics in Prescott tend to be pro-Israel, so it's hard to know how the church leadership will react to this. All we can do is make people aware of it,” he said, requesting anonymity to speak freely about the issue.

The geofencing campaign will be overseen by Eran Shayovich, the Chief of Staff at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel. Shayovich is spearheading an initiative called “project 545,” which he describes as a campaign to “amplify Israel's strategic communication and public diplomacy efforts.” Shayovich is also the point of contact for Brad Parscale, Trump's former campaign manager who is coordinating efforts to train ChatGPT on behalf of Israel and integrate pro-Israel messaging into conservative media.

Some states have taken action against geofencing as a practice. In June, Oregon passed a law that prohibits the sale of precise geolocation information, following a similar provision passed by Maryland last year.

Lina Khan's FTC banned several data brokers from collecting and selling data from sensitive locations such as churches and military installations. While these companies — including Gravy Analytics and Mobilewalla — have attracted significant media attention over the last several years, there is an extensive industry of data brokers that continue to operate in the shadows buying and selling location data at places of worship.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

                                                                                In his famous tragic play Romeo and Juliet, the English playwright William Shakespeare wrote, “What's in a name?” As it turns out, there is quite a lot in a name, particularly a surname, which is commonly known as a person's last name in Western societies. A surname is written after the first name, which is also referred to as a given name or, traditionally, a Christian name. A closer look at the history of surnames reveals some fascinating insights into their origins.
  It may come as a surprise to some that up until about 1,000 years ago, surnames were                                    



                                                                                Rehearsal time is over. The world's best and most ambitious young pianists have descended on Warsaw for the Frederic Chopin International Piano Competition — for some, a gateway to classical music glory. 
Fans from around the globe snapped up tickets as much as a year ago. The lucky ones attended the opening night concert on Oct. 3 and will follow along as the contest builds to a thrilling climax on Oct. 20.
Winning the Chopin International — held every five years in the 19th-century composer's homeland — can raise the curtain to playing at venues across the globe and signing contracts                                    



                                                                                Continued from yesterday（延續自昨日）

While many early surnames in England were strongly influenced by the work people did, like Carpenter or Plumber, jobs were not the only factor. Physical characteristics, personal nicknames, geographical locations and even parents' first names also played a role.
  It's not hard to imagine how the color of a person's hair could have led to a surname like “Redhead” or “White,” while a darker complexion might have resulted in the last name “Black.” Meanwhile, someone known as a quick runner might have earned the surname “Swift,” while a clever or cunning individual could have been called “Fox”

Cancellations represent escalating government-wide campaign to suppress criticism of rightwing influencer

Civil liberties advocates are warning that the Trump administration's decision to strip visas from at least six foreign nationals over social media posts about Charlie Kirk's killing represents yet another example of dangerous government crackdowns on protected speech.

On Tuesday, the state department announced it was systematically identifying visa holders who “celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk”, declaring in a social media statement that “the United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans”.

The visa cancellations represent an escalating government-wide campaign to suppress criticism of Kirk, who was killed last month. The administration cut visas for nationals from Argentina, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, Germany and Paraguay.

“You can't defend ‘our culture' by eroding the very cornerstone of what America stands for: freedom of speech and thought,” Conor Fitzpatrick, an attorney at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (Fire) said in a statement to the Guardian. “The Trump administration must stop punishing people for their opinions alone.”

Visa revocations under these parameters “are censorship, plain and simple”, Carrie DeCell, Knight First Amendment Institute's senior staff attorney and legislative adviser, said in a press release.

“Mere ‘mockery' can't be grounds for adverse government action – whether revocation of broadcast licenses or revocation of visas,” DeCell said. “While the government can revoke visas for many reasons, the First Amendment forbids it from doing so based on viewpoint.”

The crackdown has ensnared foreign nationals for posts with minimal reach, raising questions about the extent of government surveillance of social media activity. Among those whose visas were revoked was a South African national whose commentary attracted just 2,344 views. The individual “mocked Americans grieving the loss of Kirk, saying ‘they're hurt that the racist rally ended in attempted martyrdom' and alleging ‘he was used to astroturf a movement of white nationalist trailer trash'”, according to the state department.

A German national also had their visa cancelled for a post written in German that translated to: “when fascists die, democrats don't complain.” The state department characterized this as celebrating Kirk's death and attempting to justify his murder.

The Brazilian stripped of his US visa is Tiago Santineli, a far-left standup comedian and online influencer who published a series of inflammatory tweets about Charlie Kirk after his assassination.

In one 16 September post, cited by the state department on Monday, the 33-year-old comedian, who has more than 430,000 X followers, wrote: “Charlie Kirk was the reason for a Nazi demonstration where they marched in tribute to him. Good riddance!”

In a second part of the tweet, not cited by the state department, Santineli refers to the fatal shot to Kirk's neck, writing: “If only someone had given Hitler this kind of tracheostomy before he had reached power. It's too bad that Little Charlie Deep Throat was killed by another by another right-wing conservative, it takes a bit of the fun out of it, but it's still worth it.”

The controversial Brasília-born comedian, who has nearly a million YouTube subscribers, published several other incendiary messages about Kirk's 10 September assassination. In one 18 September post, Santineli wrote beneath a photo of two well-known rightwing Brazilian politicians: “When are these [two] going to get the charlie kirk treatment?”

Santineli did not reply to a request for comment but writing on X on 1 October he said he had received an email from the US embassy revoking his visa. The Brazilian boasted that that made him “the world's first comedian to be banned from entering the US because of a joke”. “I can't go to the US,” Santineli wrote. “But the worst thing is that Charlie Kirk will never be able to leave hahahahahahahahaha.”

Another person singled out by the visa restrictions was Enrique “Kike” Gamarra, a veteran talkshow host who is often critical of Paraguay's conservative government. In a recent programme, Gamarra said that Kirk's killing “doesn't absolve the way he lived his life. Charlie Kirk was a son of a bitch and died according to his own rules.” Gamarra declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian.

Pro-government media in Paraguay celebrated the travel ban imposed on the broadcaster, which comes amid deepening ties between Trump's White House and Paraguay's president, Santiago Peña. 

The state department's actions draw on a vast surveillance apparatus established in 2019, when the department began requiring nearly all visa applicants worldwide to provide social media handles from platforms including Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn and Reddit used within the past five years.

The policy, adopted under Trump's first administration as part of “extreme vetting” measures, continued under Joe Biden, and expanded dramatically in March this year. A state department cable obtained by the Guardian at the time ordered consular offices to conduct comprehensive social media investigations of student visa applicants, with officers instructed to preserve screenshots of “potentially derogatory” content to create permanent records – even if posts were altered or deleted.

The March directive established sweeping new grounds for visa denials, writing that “evidence that an applicant advocates for terrorist activity, or otherwise demonstrates a degree of public approval or public advocacy for terrorist activity or a terrorist organization” could justify rejection.

It also mandated social media reviews of all students applying for visas, with fraud prevention units directed to flag and document content the administration deems threatening to national security.

The directive followed high-profile visa revocations and arrests targeting pro-Palestinian campus activism, signaling an aggressive expansion of how immigration enforcement could be wielded against political speech.

“The supreme court has been clear that noncitizens have a right to freedom of speech” Fitzpatrick said. “In America, no one should fear a midnight knock at the door because of their political views.”

Backlash as California governor rejects measure allowing preferential treatment for descendants of enslaved people

California's governor, Gavin Newsom, is facing backlash from progressives over his veto of a reparations bill that would have allowed universities to give preference to applicants descended from enslaved people.

Assembly Bill 7, widely supported by Democratic lawmakers, established that California colleges “may consider” preferential treatment for individuals who establish direct lineage to a person subjected to American chattel slavery before 1900. The legislation, one of several reparations measures Newsom has vetoed, did not compel institutions to change admissions policies, and supporters said it was carefully written to withstand legal challenges.

Proponents of the bill said that by focusing on connections to slavery, instead of race, the bill did not violate bans on affirmative action or the US supreme court's 2023 ruling against race-consciousness in admissions. AB7 also made clear that preferential treatment based on race remained unlawful and institutions could not violate federal law.

In a brief veto message on Monday, Newsom, a Democrat, said the bill was “unnecessary” since “institutions already have the authority to determine whether to provide admissions preferences”. He “encouraged” colleges to “review and determine how, when, and if this type of preference can be adopted”.

AB7 supporters and racial justice advocates said on Tuesday that the veto was a discouraging setback in the long-running reparations movement in California and they were taken aback by Newsom's opposition to a bill aligned with his stated commitment to address disparities stemming from slavery.

“As a Black Californian and Black American, I'm deeply disappointed,” Isaac Bryan, a Democratic assembly member and AB7 author, told the Guardian. “Black Americans are looking for deeper solidarity in this moment when the federal government is lethally rejecting our existence, our history, our employment in the federal government, our access to institutions of higher learning, and our rights to healthcare and nutritional assistance.”

Bryan said he was surprised by the veto, noting his bill had support from more than two-thirds of state lawmakers and compared with other bills this year, drew especially high numbers of supporters testifying in favor of it. Opposition did not show up to the final two committee hearings and Newsom never offered amendments that could have addressed his concerns, Bryan added.

“The greatest legacy of slavery is the wealth gap between Black Americans and other people in society,” Bryan said. “One of the ways we could have improved upward mobility would have been to allow greater access to institutions of higher learning … We're going to have to go back to the drawing board and fight for the tangible repair that folks deserve.”

Bryan said he was skeptical of Newsom's claim that the bill was “unnecessary”, noting that the legislature had previously enacted bills meant to bolster and codify existing state laws and policies. He cited Newsom's support of his 2024 reform bill to explicitly authorize alternatives to jail that were already happening in some communities, as well as California enshrining established abortion rights into its constitution.

“The veto message was unsatisfactory and hypocritical,” Bryan said. “When you call something ‘unnecessary' that is this important and meaningful, especially to Black Americans, that language is perhaps more harmful than was realized.”

Newsom's spokesperson declined to comment.

Legal scholars were divided about potential challenges the law might have faced. Two experts told the Los Angeles Times the bill was properly tailored to reduce legal risks by supporting a specific descendant community, while critics of the legislation said it was an unconstitutional workaround of affirmative action bans.

Bryan noted the state had poured significant resources into litigation to defend Californians and progressive policies during Donald Trump's second term. The state, he said, would have been well-positioned to defend AB7, and a court battle could have affirmed California's right to enact reparative policies, laying the foundation for future work.

He said he was also worried the veto would make California institutions less likely to pursue these kinds of admissions efforts without the explicit support AB7 offered.

The governor's legacy on reparations is mixed.

In 2020, he signed a first-in-the-nation law establishing a taskforce to study reparations for Black Americans. Last year, he backed legislation offering a formal apology for slavery.

Newsom recently supported the creation of the Bureau for Descendants of American Slavery, the first-ever permanent state agency dedicated to advancing reparative initiatives.

This week, however, he also vetoed a bill mandating the state investigate claims from families who say the government unjustly seized their property due to their race, with Newsom citing fiscal concerns. And he cited concerns about legal risks in his veto of a bill that would have set aside 10% of funds from a first-time homebuyers loan program for enslaved people's descendants.

Dr David C Turner III, who helped coordinate a coalition supporting AB7, said Newsom's veto “showed a lack of political imagination and lack of political will”.

Turner, a senior adviser for the Alliance for Boys and Men of Color, a national network of advocacy groups, said the rejection of the bill by a governor with widely discussed presidential ambitions, was part of a pattern of mainstream Democrats being “afraid of looking too politically woke and too politically left”.

“His opposition is leaning into fascist values and makes no apologies about it. So he needs to lean into progressive values and leftist populism and do the things that are popular because that will actually get him elected,” Turner said. “He wants to position himself as a champion of social justice issues and diversity and higher education … He apologizes for slavery, but when bills come across his desk to actually rectify these things, he vetoes them.”

Turner, who is also a professor of Black life and racial justice at University of California, Los Angeles, said he had seen first-hand the impact of academia's lack of diversity, noting that in his courses on social movements, community organizing, youth justice and other topics, he often has no more than six Black students in classes with 100 members.

“A lot of talented Black students opt to go to other places, because they want to feel as if their campuses are going to protect them,” he said. Signing AB7, he added, “would have sent a message to California's Black students and students of color more broadly that we see you and we are going to work to rectify the harm that we the state have caused in your communities.”

Bryan and Turner said AB7 supporters would redouble efforts to get policies enacted that directly address the lingering consequences of slavery and were hopeful the state's new bureau would create momentum.

Turner said campus groups should fight to make admissions more equitable at their institutions. While there will be discussions of adjusting language or strategies to get policies such as AB7 adopted, advocates' core intent would not change, he said: “We're fighting the long fight. This won't be the last time the governor hears from us. We're going to regroup and figure this out together, because that is the long tradition of organizing we come from.”

The U.K. government on Oct. 15 imposed its "strongest sanctions yet" against Russia, blacklisting five individuals and 35 companies, including oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil, as part of a package targeting 90 new entities and vessels.  

The measures aim to choke off Russia's vital fossil fuel revenues that fund its war against Ukraine.

According to the U.K. Foreign Office, both Rosneft and Lukoil conduct business in sectors of "strategic and economic significance" to the Russian government. 

The sanctions include asset freezes and restrictions on trust and transport services, extending the reach of previous U.K. and EU measures targeting Russia's energy sector.

Rosneft alone accounts for nearly half of Russia's oil production and 6% of global output. The oil and gas industry generated 113 billion euros ($131 billion) in tax for the Kremlin in 2024, about a third of its total revenue, covering 83% of military expenditures.

"At this critical moment for Ukraine, Europe is stepping up," U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said. "Together, the U.K. and our allies are piling the pressure on (Russian President Vladimir) Putin — going after his oil, gas, and shadow fleet."

"We will not relent until he abandons his failed war of conquest and gets serious about peace."

The new U.K. measures also target foreign companies that facilitate Russian oil exports, including India's Nayara Energy — in which Rosneft holds the largest share — and China's National Pipeline Group Beihai Liquefied Natural Gas Co. Ltd.

Three companies based in the United Arab Emirates — Novus Energy DMCC, Wissol Commodities FZCO, and Alghaf Marine DMCC — were also sanctioned for transporting or trading Russian oil. 

The U.K. also blacklisted 51 vessels belonging to Russia's so-called "shadow fleet," tankers that operate under opaque ownership and flags of convenience to evade Western sanctions.

Additional restrictions were placed on several Russian banks, the National Card Payment System, and technology firms operating in sectors deemed strategically vital to the Kremlin.

As Russia's traditional oil revenues continue to fall, the Kremlin has sought to expand its liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports to offset losses. In response, the U.K. extended sanctions to seven specialized LNG tankers and China's Beihai LNG terminal.

London's latest measures add to growing Western efforts to tighten enforcement of sanctions and restrict Russia's ability to reorient its oil trade through third countries.

The U.S. has not directly sanctioned Rosneft or Lukoil, but it has blacklisted some subsidiaries. 

Kyiv continues urging Western allies to tighten sanctions on Russia's energy sector, arguing that depriving Moscow of oil revenues would further limit its ability to finance its war against Ukraine.

CAPSAT military unit commander Col. Michael Randrianirina says 'we will be sworn in soon,' during a press briefing.Brian Inganga/The Associated Press

Madagascar's new military ruler Michael Randrianirina said on Wednesday he would soon be sworn in as president of the African island nation after a coup he led to oust President Andry Rajoelina. 

Rajoelina, who was impeached by lawmakers after fleeing abroad at the weekend, has condemned the takeover and refused to step down despite Gen Z demonstrations demanding his resignation and widespread defections in the security forces.

Randrianirina has told Malagasy citizens that the military has taken power and dissolved all institutions except the lower house of parliament or National Assembly.

“We will be sworn in soon,” the army colonel told a press briefing on Wednesday, a day after the High Constitutional Court invited him to serve as president of the former French colony.

“We took responsibility yesterday.”

Two sources close to him earlier told Reuters he would be sworn in as president in the next day or two.

Randrianirina said on Tuesday that a committee led by the military would rule for up to two years alongside a transitional government before organizing new elections.

Randrianirina was a commander in the elite CAPSAT army unit that played a key role in the 2009 coup that brought Rajoelina to power but broke ranks with him last week, urging soldiers not to fire on protesters.

Rajoelina fled Madagascar on Sunday aboard a French military plane, security sources told Reuters. He has said his life was at risk and is now believed to be in Dubai, according to three diplomatic and opposition sources. The 51-year-old former DJ himself rose to power in a coup in 2009 on the back of youth protests, becoming the world's youngest head of state at 34. But promises to improve living standards and eradicate corruption were never fulfilled.

Madagascar, where the average age is less than 20, has a population of about 30 million, three-quarters of whom live in poverty. Between its independence in 1960 and 2020, GDP per capita plunged 45 per cent, according to the World Bank.

As well as the CAPSAT unit, the paramilitary gendarmerie and the police have also broken ranks with Rajoelina.

Politico documented the use of slurs, including the N-word and a homophobic term, and antisemitic comments in chats

Some leaders of Young Republican groups throughout the country are facing major backlash after some of their racist and highly offensive messages in private group chats were revealed by Politico.

Democratic and Republican politicians denounced the language used and criticized the group. The Young Republican National Federation has called for resignations. The Kansas Young Republican group has been shut down and now a handful of those involved in the racist chat have lost their jobs.

The Young Republican National Federation called on those involved in the chat to “immediately resign from all positions” within the organization.

Politico on Tuesday revealed 2,900 pages of leaked chats from a Telegram group chat involving Young Republican leaders. The chats included racist and offensive language.

Members of the group, which included people actively working with elected officials and some attempting to take leadership positions in the national Young Republican organization, were aware that if the contents of their messages were revealed they could face severe repercussions.

“If we ever had a leak of this chat we would be cooked fr fr,” said Bobby Walker in the chat, who was recently made chair of the New York State Young Republicans.

But the Young Republicans kept typing away, sharing offensive messages and racist comments.

As Politico reports, members in the chat referred to Black people as monkeys and “the watermelon people”. They joked about killing political opponents by putting them in gas chambers. “I love hitler,” one chat member quipped, who also made antisemitic comments. Another participant called the mass rape of Indigenous people “epic”. One member expressed his support for Republicans he believed supported slavery. And a participant talked about driving a competing Young Republican opponent to suicide.

Politico documented that slurs and epithets, including the N-word and a homophobic term. The word “retarded” appeared more than 251 times combined in the chat.

Democrats were also quick to decry the Young Republicans' chat and politicians associated with the group's participants.

Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, said Republican representatives Mike Lawler and Elise Stefanik have been “palling around with these racist, antisemitic and bigoted ‘Young Republicans' for years,” adding that the representatives' “phony outrage” was only for show.

Kathy Hochul, the New York governor, expressed outrage at the messages.

“Some bad apples? These are the future of the Republican party,” Hochul said during a press conference. “This is so vile it's hard to find the words to put into context that these are people who are part of one of two major parties and they believe in gas chambers and rape and discrimination based on the color of people's skin.”

Hochul also called on the chat members to be kicked out of the Republican party. “This bullshit has to stop,” she added.

Republicans around the country have also tried to distance themselves from the chat participants, with one notable exception: JD Vance.

In a post on X, the vice-president pointed at Democratic candidate for Virginia attorney general Jay Jones, who was embroiled in a texting scandal of his own. It was revealed earlier this month that Jones texted a colleague about shooting a Republican political adversary.

Vance on X said Jones's comments were “way worse” than the Young Republicans' group chat, adding that he refuses to “join the pearl clutching when powerful people call for political violence”. Others on the right, who have denounced the Young Republicans' chat, similarly pointed to Jones's text scandal, including rightwing influencer Brilyn Hollyhand.

Outside social media, however, the Young Republicans' leaked chats have led to some to lose their jobs.

The former chair of the New York State Young Republicans at the time of the chats, Peter Giunta, was one of the most prominent participants. Giunta was fired from his position as New York assembly member Michael Reilly's chief of staff.

“The comments shared in the group chat that have been reported are extremely troubling and disappointing. They do not align with my values. As a result, Mr Giunta's assignment in my office has ended,” Reilly said in a statement to Staten Island Live.

Stefanik, a New York Republican representative who previously lauded Giunta for his “tremendous leadership” of the New York Young Republicans, decried the chat, with a spokesperson telling Politico that Stefanik “calls for any NY Young Republicans responsible for these horrific comments in this chat to step down immediately”. The spokesperson clarified the congresswoman did not employ anyone in the chat.

Stefanik then took to social media on Tuesday night, called the Politico story a “hit piece”, pointed to the Jones texting scandal and accused New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani of embracing “terrorist sympathizers”.

Another participant from New York, Joe Maligno, is no longer working for the New York state unified court system.

The scandal has also led to one Young Republican chapter to be placed on hold. The Kansas Republican party deactivated the state's Young Republican organization after Politico's report. Two top members of the state's Young Republican group were active in the chat, with Politico reporting that the group's vice-chair, William Hendrix, used the N-word more than a dozen times. Prior to the story's publication, Hendrix lost his job with the Kansas attorney general, Kris Kobach, due to the messages.

One of the chat's members, Vermont state senator Samuel Douglass, is facing calls to step down after the revelations. And Bobby Walker, who was slated to join candidate Peter Oberacker's congressional campaign, had his job offer revoked.

Experts are enforcing emergency measures to prevent the spread of the highly contagious neurodegenerative disease

Wildlife officials in Florida have discovered only the second case in the state of a deadly infection known colloquially as “zombie deer disease”, and are enforcing emergency measures to try to prevent a spread.

The highly contagious chronic wasting disease (CWD) was found during routine screening in the carcass of a young white-tailed doe that was struck by a vehicle in Holmes county, close to the Alabama border, early last month. The only previous recorded instance in Florida was in a four-year-old doe killed about a mile away in June 2023.

Experts are warning of a domino effect on wildlife management if the neurodegenerative disease, more prevalent in western and north-eastern states, is not contained. Although not harmful to humans, it has no vaccine or cure, and spreads easily through animal-to-animal contact, environmental contamination and ticks.

“This disease right now is probably the greatest threat to deer and deer hunting in North America,” said wildlife biologist Steven Shea, an expert in deer populations who manages more than half a million acres of species habitat in central Florida.

“Based on everything we know, CWD is going to continue to spread. Every instance where it's been tried to be contained and eradicated has been unsuccessful. So really what agencies are trying to do is basically slow down the spread, keep it in a relatively small area.”

The Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission (FWC) has implemented a special management zone and program of enhanced surveillance and monitoring in Holmes and neighboring Jackson and Washington counties. Test results are pending on 90 animals.

The disease is a so-called silent killer because an infected deer can live for several years without exhibiting symptoms. It will eventually succumb to brain tissue damage and experience a range of symptoms including weight loss, behavioral abnormalities, loss of coordination, excessive salivation and eventually death, according to the University of Florida's department of wildlife ecology and conservation.

The state's white-tailed deer population is estimated at up to 700,000, with about 100,000 hunted each year, making it Florida's most popular game animal.

FWC implemented special rules in the CWD management zone for the deer hunting season beginning later this month, including mandatory checking of all carcasses.

“Florida's early detection puts us in a best-case scenario for CWD management, as a smaller outbreak is more realistic to contain,” James Kelly, the commission's CWD surveillance coordinator, said in a statement.

“Hunters are our first line of defense in managing this disease. Each sample helps us track the spread of the disease and informs our strategies to manage it effectively.”

Shea said he feared a “domino effect” if CWD took hold in Florida.

“Hunters have to send a head in for testing, they're waiting on the meat, and if it comes back positive they have to discard the meat,” he said.

“So we're fearful the number of hunters of white-tailed deer will drop. Hunters are the major way we control deer populations in many areas of the country and if that goes away you're still going to have high numbers of deer, [but] there's going to be bigger impacts on vehicle strikes, and crop depredation.

“Hunters provide one of the largest revenue sources that supports all fish and wildlife management in North America and if fewer hunters are hunting there's less money that comes in to seed programs that help all wildlife, not just white-tailed deer.”

NEW YORK, NY, Oct. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 

VaynerX, in partnership with Muck Rack and Ipsos, today announced the release of a new research report, Inside Modern PR: Trust, Timing & Building Credibility – A Deep Dive Into Earned Attention in 2025. The report provides a comprehensive look at the evolving landscape of media consumption and attention, highlighting a critical new mandate for public relations practitioners. 

The research, which surveyed US consumers and brand leaders, reveals that while legacy media remains the anchor of trust (57% of consumers cite local news as their most trusted source), social platforms dominate the news diet for younger audiences (85% of 18–34-year-olds). This coexisting but nuanced environment demands that effective modern PR must fuse the credibility signals of traditional media with the scale and immediacy of social. 

Key Findings from the Report:

“There's a real opportunity for brand leaders that understand how to harness legacy and social media alongside their consumers,” said VaynerX CMO Avery Akkineni. “Effective modern PR strategies will consistently deliver evidence and resonance, while ensuring messages are authentic, verifiable, and everywhere. It's exactly what we're helping our clients do every single day across VaynerX.”

“This research echoes what communicators tell us every day, credibility isn't static, it's earned moment by moment,” added Greg Galant, cofounder and CEO of Muck Rack. “PR leaders are redefining trust in real time. The ones who will succeed are those who show up authentically across platforms, back their stories with evidence and build reputations that stand up to public scrutiny.”

“Truth and trust are the foundation of what we do at Ipsos, ensuring decisions - from the ballot box to the board room - are rooted in evidence and facts,” said Nick Mercurio, Chief Client & Growth Officer, Ipsos North America. “As misinformation fuels skepticism, it creates huge implications and a clear opportunity for brands. Companies that lead with honesty and consistency will be the ones to grow.”

MOSCOW, October 15. /TASS/. Moscow has always been guided by the Syrian people's interests in its relations with Damascus, Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with Syria's interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa.

"Russia has never treated Syria based on political circumstances or special interests. For all these decades, we have been guided solely by the interests of the Syrian people," Putin emphasized.

According to the Russian leader, Moscow has strong, genuine ties with the Syrian people. "Suffice it to say, hundreds and perhaps thousands of people are bound by friendships and marriages," Putin explained.

Hi, this is Kateryna Hodunova reporting from Kyiv on day 1,330 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story:

At least 1,076 Cuban nationals have fought or are fighting for Russia in Ukraine, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15.

Ninety-six are known to have died or gone missing in action.

The figures come after the U.S. earlier this month circulated an unclassified cable sharing details about Cuba's support for Russia's full-scale invasion, in which it claimed an "estimated 1,000 to 5,000 Cubans (are) fighting in Ukraine."

The information from HUR shared with the Kyiv Independent tallies with the lower end of the U.S. estimate, but also provides further insight into the recruitment process and training of Cuban nationals.

HUR claims they receive only two weeks of training at the Avangard training center in Moscow Oblast before being sent to the front line.

The information provided by HUR suggests that some Cuban nationals are tricked into travelling to Russia after being lured by the promise of lucrative construction work advertised on Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok.

Their travel is facilitated by "private intermediaries" who sometimes pay for flights, with Russian diplomatic institutions issuing tourist or work visas.

Denmark has pledged $171 million in military aid to Ukraine, while Sweden is considering the delivery of additional aircraft.

The $171 million aid will be used to support Ukraine's navy, repair tanks, and provide education and training for Ukrainian military personnel, according to a statement from the Danish Defense Ministry published on Oct. 15.

The package also includes initiatives targeting the maritime sector and armored vehicle maintenance. Funds are also allocated for fuel donations and support within rehabilitation zones, both implemented under NATO's auspices.

Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson, speaking ahead of the NATO defense ministers' meeting in Brussels on Oct. 15, said Sweden is prepared to expand its support through the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative and the aviation coalition.

According to Jonson, Stockholm aims to supply radar reconnaissance and early warning aircraft to Ukraine as an initial step, and will later consider the potential delivery of Swedish Gripen fighter jets.

The mayor of Dniproudne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Yevhenii Matvieiev, who was abducted by Russian military personnel, died in a Russian prison from multiple injuries, the Ukrainian media outlet Liga.net reported on Oct. 15, citing the Prosecutor General's Office.

According to the report, Matvieiev died on Sept. 7, 2024, while being held at Detention Center No. 3 in the city of Kizel, located in Russia's Perm Krai.

The cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma to the torso, resulting in multiple rib fractures and damage to the lungs and pleura, the Prosecutor General's Office said.

A pre-trial investigation is ongoing and is being led by Ukraine's Security Service (SBU).

Matvieiev was reportedly abducted at a checkpoint by Russian forces in 2022. His body was returned to Ukraine at the end of 2024 as part of a repatriation process.

Germany will provide Ukraine with an additional military aid package worth more than 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion), German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius announced on Oct. 15 during the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting in Brussels.

The package will include advanced air defense systems, precision-guided weapons, and ammunition.

"You can count on Germany. We will continue and expand our support for Ukraine. With new contracts, Germany will provide additional support amounting to over 2 billion euros," Pistorius said.

Germany will also deliver two additional IRIS-T air defense systems, accompanied by a large number of guided missiles and shoulder-fired air defense weapons. Anti-tank weapons, small arms, and secure communications systems are also expected to be part of the delivery.

Of the total amount, Germany will contribute $500 million to a NATO initiative supplying Ukraine with critically needed U.S.-made weapons, the alliance announced on Aug. 13.

The support will come through NATO's Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) mechanism, which coordinates funding for Kyiv's most urgent battlefield needs.

NATO should not overestimate Russia's capabilities, Secretary General Mark Rutte claimed on Oct. 15, attempting to subdue concerns about Moscow's hybrid activities targeting the alliance.

A cyberattack carried out by Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) caused over 66 million rubles (approximately $800,000) in damages to Orion Telecom, one of the largest internet providers in Siberia, a HUR source told the Kyiv Independent.

The provider itself reported the losses in a complaint submitted to Russian police following the attack. The company also admitted that the cyber operation led to a leak of users' personal data.

"One of the largest Siberian Internet providers, Orion Telecom, was immediately impoverished by 66 million rubles as a result of a special operation by the HUR MO cyber corps," the source said.

As a result, Orion Telecom has requested Russian authorities to launch a criminal investigation into the incident. Under Russian law, the provider could face an additional fine of up to 15 million rubles for the data breach.

Russia struck a combined heat and power plant and launched three massive attacks on Ukraine's gas production infrastructure over the last week, Serhii Koretskyi, the CEO of Ukraine's state-owned oil and gas giant Naftogaz, said on Facebook on Oct. 15.

Russian missiles and drones damaged gas infrastructure in Kharkiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv oblasts while drones hit the plant, as Moscow steps up its attacks on Ukraine's energy facilities and temperatures drop.

The new wave of attacks comes days after Russian strikes on Oct. 3 and 5 wiped out around 60% of Ukraine's gas production."Russian terrorists are committing new acts of terrorism, aimed solely at depriving Ukraine of gas, heat, and light this winter," Koretskyi wrote, adding that the company will "restore everything." Ukraine is currently reaching out to partners for further air defense, energy equipment, and funding for gas imports. The embattled country needs at least 13.2 billion cubic meters in its gas storage facilities for the winter, and could seek imports from the U.S. and Norway.

Palestinians rush toward trucks carrying aid from the World Food Programme as they drive through Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, on Wednesday.Abdel Kareem Hana/The Associated Press

Aid trucks rolled into Gaza on Wednesday and Israel resumed preparations to open the main Rafah crossing after a dispute over the return of the bodies of dead hostages that had threatened to derail the fragile ceasefire deal with Hamas. 

Israel had threatened to keep Rafah shut and reduce aid supplies because Hamas was returning bodies too slowly, showing the risks to a truce that has stopped two years of devastating warfare in Gaza and freed all living hostages held by Hamas. 

Here's what you need to know about Gaza and the Israel-Hamas war, including the ceasefire deal, the toll of the war so far and what comes next.

However, the militant group returned more Israeli bodies overnight, and an Israeli security official said on Wednesday preparations were under way to open Rafah to Gazan citizens, while a second official said that 600 aid trucks would go in.

Hamas returned four bodies confirmed as dead hostages on Monday and another four bodies late on Tuesday, though Israeli authorities said one of those bodies was not that of a hostage. 

The dispute over the return of bodies still has the potential to upset the ceasefire deal along with other major issues that are yet to be resolved. 

Palestinians voiced ongoing struggles as they have 'no food, no housing' in Gaza City.

Reuters

Israel has said that the next phase of the truce calls for Hamas to disarm and cede power, which it has so far refused to do. It has launched a security crackdown, parading its power in Gaza through public executions and clashes with local clans. 

Longer-term elements of the ceasefire plan, including how Gaza will be governed, the make-up of an international “stabilization force” and moves toward the creation of a Palestinian state have yet to emerge. 

Israelis return to Oct. 7 sites, but some don't see long-lasting peace

Twenty-one bodies of hostages remain in Gaza, though some may be very hard to find or recover because of destruction during the conflict. An international task force is meant to find them. 

The deal also requires Israel to return the bodies of 360 Palestinian militants killed in battle. The first group of 45 was handed over on Tuesday and were being identified, said Palestinian health authorities.

The war has caused a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, with nearly all inhabitants driven from their homes, a global hunger monitor saying famine was present in the enclave and health authorities overwhelmed. 

“Our situation is utterly tragic. We went back to our homes in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood and found there are no homes at all. There is no shelter. Nothing,” said Moemen Hassanein in Gaza City, with tents and shanties behind him.

Reuters video showed a first group of trucks moving from the Egyptian side of the border into the Rafah crossing at dawn on Wednesday, some tankers carrying fuel and others loaded with pallets of aid. 

Opinion: Donald Trump was the essential element for the Gaza ceasefire

However, it was not clear if that convoy would complete its crossing into Gaza as part of the 600 trucks that were due to enter the enclave on Wednesday – the daily number required under the ceasefire plan. Aid trucks entered Gaza through other crossings. 

The Rafah crossing with Egypt is due to be open for people to cross on Thursday with a European Union mission deployed there, two sources said. It was not immediately clear if there would be any restrictions applied on the movement of people.

The Palestinian Authority, which governs in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said it was preparing to operate the crossing. 

Some Palestinians awaiting medical evacuation told Reuters they had not yet received notification to prepare for travel.

Israel's public broadcaster Kan reported that Wednesday's aid deliveries would include food, medical supplies, fuel, cooking gas and equipment to repair vital infrastructure. 

“Humanitarian aid continues to enter the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom Crossing and other crossings after Israeli security inspection,” the Israeli security official said.

Underscoring the political challenges facing the truce, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, an opponent of the ceasefire plan, said on X that the aid delivery was a “disgrace.”

“Nazi terrorism understands only force, and the only way to solve problems with it is to wipe it off the face of the earth,” he added, accusing Hamas of lies and abuse over the return of hostages' bodies.

Several other Palestinian factions in Gaza have backed a days-long Hamas security crackdown as it battles local clans. 

The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, one of the groups backing the Hamas crackdown, described the clans being targeted as “hubs of crime.” Hamas has executed several people that it accused of collaborating with Israel.

The U.S. military's Middle East command called on Hamas to “suspend violence and shooting at innocent Palestinian civilians” and to disarm “without delay.” 

U.S. President Donald Trump, who brokered the ceasefire deal, this week endorsed Hamas' crackdown on gangs, while warning it would face air strikes if it did not later disarm.

Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas condemned the public executions after a video, authenticated by Reuters, showed masked gunmen shooting dead seven men in a Gaza street. 

Israeli forces inside Gaza have pulled back to what the truce deal calls a yellow line just outside the main cities. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said it would immediately enforce any violation of the line. 

President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants dead hostages held in Gaza back and warns Hamas 'if they don't disarm, we will disarm them.'

Aid trucks rolled into Gaza on Wednesday and Israel resumed preparations to open the main Rafah crossing after a dispute over the return of the bodies of dead hostages that had threatened to derail the fragile ceasefire deal with Hamas. 

Israel had threatened to keep Rafah shut and reduce aid supplies because Hamas was returning bodies too slowly, showing the risks to a truce that has stopped two years of devastating warfare in Gaza and freed all living hostages held by Hamas. 

Here's what you need to know about Gaza and the Israel-Hamas war, including the ceasefire deal, the toll of the war so far and what comes next.

However, the militant group returned more Israeli bodies overnight, and an Israeli security official said on Wednesday preparations were under way to open Rafah to Gazan citizens, while a second official said that 600 aid trucks would go in.

Hamas' armed wing said on Wednesday night that it would hand over two more bodies.

Hamas returned four bodies confirmed as dead hostages on Monday and another four bodies late on Tuesday, though Israeli authorities said one of those bodies was not that of a hostage. 

The dispute over the return of bodies still has the potential to upset the ceasefire deal along with other major issues that are yet to be resolved. 

Palestinians voiced ongoing struggles as they have 'no food, no housing' in Gaza City.

Israel has said that the next phase of the truce calls for Hamas to disarm and cede power, which it has so far refused to do. It has launched a security crackdown, parading its power in Gaza through public executions and clashes with local clans. 

Longer-term elements of the ceasefire plan, including how Gaza will be governed, the make-up of an international “stabilization force” and moves toward the creation of a Palestinian state have yet to emerge.

Twenty-one bodies of hostages remain in Gaza, though some may be very hard to find or recover because of destruction during the conflict. An international task force is meant to find them. 

The deal also requires Israel to return the bodies of 360 Palestinian militants killed in battle. The first group of 45 was handed over on Tuesday and were being identified, said Palestinian health authorities.

The war has caused a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, with nearly all inhabitants driven from their homes, a global hunger monitor saying famine was present in the enclave and health authorities overwhelmed. 

“Our situation is utterly tragic. We went back to our homes in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood and found there are no homes at all. There is no shelter. Nothing,” said Moemen Hassanein in Gaza City, with tents and shanties behind him.

Reuters video showed a first group of trucks moving from the Egyptian side of the border into the Rafah crossing at dawn on Wednesday, some tankers carrying fuel and others loaded with pallets of aid. 

Opinion: Donald Trump was the essential element for the Gaza ceasefire

However, it was not clear if that convoy would complete its crossing into Gaza as part of the 600 trucks that were due to enter the enclave on Wednesday – the daily number required under the ceasefire plan. Aid trucks entered Gaza through other crossings. 

The Rafah crossing with Egypt is due to be open for people to cross on Thursday with a European Union mission deployed there, two sources said. It was not immediately clear if there would be any restrictions applied on the movement of people.

The Palestinian Authority, which governs in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said it was preparing to operate the crossing. 

Some Palestinians awaiting medical evacuation told Reuters they had not yet received notification to prepare for travel.

Israel's public broadcaster Kan reported that Wednesday's aid deliveries would include food, medical supplies, fuel, cooking gas and equipment to repair vital infrastructure. 

“Humanitarian aid continues to enter the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom Crossing and other crossings after Israeli security inspection,” the Israeli security official said.

Underscoring the political challenges facing the truce, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, an opponent of the ceasefire plan, said on X that the aid delivery was a “disgrace.”

“Nazi terrorism understands only force, and the only way to solve problems with it is to wipe it off the face of the earth,” he added, accusing Hamas of lies and abuse over the return of hostages' bodies.

Several other Palestinian factions in Gaza have backed a days-long Hamas security crackdown as it battles local clans. 

The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, one of the groups backing the Hamas crackdown, described the clans being targeted as “hubs of crime.” Hamas has executed several people that it accused of collaborating with Israel.

The U.S. military's Middle East command called on Hamas to “suspend violence and shooting at innocent Palestinian civilians” and to disarm “without delay.” 

U.S. President Donald Trump, who brokered the ceasefire deal, this week endorsed Hamas' crackdown on gangs, while warning it would face air strikes if it did not later disarm.

Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas condemned the public executions after a video, authenticated by Reuters, showed masked gunmen shooting dead seven men in a Gaza street. 

Israeli forces inside Gaza have pulled back to what the truce deal calls a yellow line just outside the main cities. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said it would immediately enforce any violation of the line. 

President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants dead hostages held in Gaza back and warns Hamas 'if they don't disarm, we will disarm them.'

CHISINAU, October 15. /TASS/. The government of Moldova wants to completely abolish the autonomy of Gagauzia, head of the Gagauz autonomy Evghenia Gutsul told TASS in an interview, whose text was handed over by her lawyers.

"Chisinau's ultimate goal is to completely abolish the autonomy. They want to turn us into an ordinary region, governed from the capital, and to deprive the Gagauz people of their special status, for which we fought for generations. But I want to assure you and all residents of Gagauzia: we will not let them to put their plans into practice," she said.

On August 5, 2025, Gutsul was sentenced to seven years in prison on charges of illegal financing of the opposition party Sor. Apart from that, she was banned from being a member of any political party for five years and fined $2.4 million, the amount she allegedly took to finance her campaign. Her defense challenged the court ruling.

            President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to relocate World Cup matches set to be played next year in suburban Boston, after suggesting that parts of the city had been “taken over” by unrest.
    


            Foxborough, Massachusetts, home to the NFL's New England Patriots and about 30 miles from Boston, is set to stage matches as the US cohosts the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada. Trump was asked about Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu, a Democrat whom he called “intelligent” but “radical left.”
    


            “We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. “I love the people of Boston and I know the games are sold out. But your mayor is not good.”
    


            He suggested “they're taking over parts of Boston” without offering details, but added “we could get them back in about two seconds.”
    


            The Trump administration has already deployed National Guard troops to Washington and Memphis, and efforts to do so in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, have sparked legal fights.
    


            Wu's office did not react directly to Trump's threat, issuing a statement that read, “Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions.”
    


            Trump's comments came during his meeting with Argentina President Javier Milei and it wasn't immediately clear what he was referring to by parts of Boston having been seized. Earlier this month, however, there were multiple arrests in connection with a pro-Palestinian protest that turned violent on Boston Common. Four police officers were injured.
    


            Trump has previously suggested he could declare cities “not safe” for the 104-game soccer tournament and alter a detailed hosting plan that FIFA confirmed in 2022. It includes games at NFL stadiums near New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
    


Trump's travel ban allows athletes from affected nations into US for the World Cup and Olympics. Fans may be stuck at home



            World Cup host sites aren't up to Trump. The 11 US cities — plus three in Mexico and two in Canada — are contracted with FIFA, which would face significant logistical and legal issues to make changes in the eight months before the June 11 kickoff.
    


            “It's FIFA's tournament, FIFA's jurisdiction, FIFA makes those decisions,” the soccer body's vice president Victor Montagliani said earlier this month at a sports business conference in London.
    


            Trump nonetheless said, “If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who's phenomenal – and I would say, ‘Let's move into another location' and they would do that.”
    


            The president meant FIFA head Gianni Infantino, a close ally. Trump said Infantino “wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.”

The US State Department said on Tuesday that it has revoked the visas of several individuals who publicly celebrated the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Kirk, who co-founded Turning Point USA and rose to prominence by debating politics on college campuses, was killed by a sniper last month while speaking to students in Utah.

In a post on X on Tuesday – Kirk's birthday – the State Department said that the US “has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans.”

The department posted screenshots of messages and quotes it said were made by six people from Germany, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Paraguay, and South Africa.

An Argentinian national allegedly accused Kirk of spreading racist views and claimed he “deserved” to die, while a German national allegedly wrote, “when fascists die, democrats don't complain.” A person from Brazil was said to have written that Kirk “was the reason for a Nazi rally where they marched in homage to him” and had “died too late.”

The US State Department said the posts were “just a few examples of aliens who are no longer welcome in the US,” adding that it would continue to identify foreigners who celebrated Kirk's death.

A Mexican national said that Kirk “died being a racist, he died being a misogynist” and stated that “there are people who deserve to die. There are people who would make the world better off dead.”Visa revoked.

On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump posthumously awarded Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. Kirk's widow, Erika, received the medal on his behalf.

Dozens of people in the US have lost their jobs or been suspended for mocking or justifying Kirk's death. Although most Democrats condemned the killing, Trump and other Republicans have blamed the “radical left” for inciting political violence.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

AMOS YADLIN is Founder and President of MIND Israel. He is a retired Major General in the Israeli Air Force and served as the head of Israel's Defense Intelligence from 2006 to 2010.

AVNER GOLOV is Vice President of MIND Israel. From 2018 to 2023, he was a Senior Director on Israel's National Security Council.

 How the Country Can Bring Peace to the Middle East

 Amos Yadlin and Avner Golov

In his recent speeches in Egypt and Israel, U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly invoked the word “peace” when describing his vision for a new Middle East. He is right to do so. After decades of perpetual conflict, the region may be on the precipice of a genuinely stable future. As we argued in Foreign Affairs last December, Israel's battlefield achievements against Hamas and Hezbollah—together with the collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria—had created a rare opening for the Jewish state, the United States, and key Arab countries to forge a coalition capable of stabilizing the region and countering extremism. And developments since then have only made that vision more urgent and attainable.

Earlier this month, after two years of fighting, Hamas and Israel finally agreed to a U.S.-brokered cease-fire that could both end the war in Gaza and dismantle the terror organization. Israel and the United States have decimated Iran's network of proxies and struck the country's own nuclear and missile infrastructure, breaking the Islamic Republic's grip on much of the Middle East. As a result, these two regional spoilers are on the back foot. A better future, in other words, is very much within reach. Even Israeli politicians—foremost among them Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu—are speaking of peace again, after years in which that word had virtually disappeared from their lexicons.

That does not mean the path forward is obstacle-free. Israel is diplomatically isolated and extremely unpopular on Arab streets, in European squares, and on American campuses. Hamas is still the strongest political and military force in Gaza and has maintained support in the West Bank. Iran remains dangerous, even if it is weaker. And a radical Muslim Brotherhood, backed by Qatar and Turkey, is expanding its influence. Unlike in the past, these hurdles are all surmountable. But overcoming them will require a new regional coalition. This coalition will have to offer a moderate alternative to both the Iranian axis and Sunni jihadists. It will need to eventually expand into a broader Mediterranean partnership. And it must receive dedicated American backing.

Trump may have been disappointed not to receive the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. But in the eyes of most Israelis, he has earned it. The U.S. president imposed a cease-fire framework on Netanyahu, who had resisted popular demand for a deal that would have returned all hostages and ended the war. Trump did so while simultaneously getting Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey to exert heavy pressure on Hamas, which had also been reticent to sign such an agreement. It was a display of diplomatic finesse reminiscent of the shuttle diplomacy U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger deployed to end the Yom Kippur War in the 1970s.

The agreement Trump brokered is opaque. Many of its provisions remain undefined, and it appears that Washington offered bilateral assurances—perhaps even contradictory ones—to both parties. But this ambiguity is deliberate, designed to allow each side to declare victory. Israel's claim to victory centers on the return of all hostages, the military's dismantlement of Hamas as an organized force, and the creation of an international plan to eradicate its rule and disarm its militias. Israelis also get to maintain a security zone in Gaza until Hamas's disarmament is complete. Hamas, for its part, gets to declare that it withstood Israel's army for two years, forced its withdrawal from Gaza, secured the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners, put the Palestinian issue back on the global agenda, and extracted assurances that Israel will not resume the conflict.

The war in Gaza could reignite. Trump's 20-point peace plan unfolds in three stages, and only the first is underway and well defined with numerical parameters: the release of all Israeli hostages in exchange for the liberation of convicted Palestinian militants, coupled with the redeployment of Israeli forces outside central Gaza. Hamas will likely exploit areas of ambiguity even in this stage to slow the transition to the next phase, as recent delays in the return of hostages' bodies have demonstrated.

The second phase—disarming Hamas and establishing a new governing authority in Gaza with the participation of Arab and other international forces—will be far more difficult to implement. And should the parties fail to carry it out, Gaza could come to resemble Lebanon: formally ruled by a recognized government but effectively controlled by a militant organization. (Hezbollah has long dominated the Lebanese state.) In that case, Israel may once again find itself compelled to fight in Gaza wherever Hamas continues to operate.



Then there is the third phase. This stage calls for the creation of a pathway to Palestinian statehood and self-determination, conditioned on the full demilitarization of Gaza and sweeping reforms within the Palestinian Authority. It will be Israel's most significant contribution to the Trump plan, taking place after Hamas's dismantlement in the second phase. It will take far longer to see through, if it is even achievable.

Still, there is reason to be hopeful that this war, at least, is finished. Through a combination of pressure and inducements, Trump and his talented team have succeeded in forging an Arab-Palestinian front that supports the demilitarization of Hamas—an unprecedented achievement in a region where no actor has ever voluntarily surrendered its military capabilities.

The region's broader conflicts might also simmer down, thanks to the weakening of the Iranian regime. Israel's military campaign against Tehran severely damaged core components of its strategic apparatus, including its nuclear facilities, its missile systems, its air defenses, and, critically, its network of regional proxies. Israeli fighting in Lebanon, for instance, diminished the power of Hezbollah, which now faces mounting pressure from the United States and from Lebanon's government. The Yemeni Houthis continue to pose a threat to the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, but they are limited in their ability to hit Israel because of the country's excellent air and missile defense. The survival and broad recognition of Ahmed al-Shara's government in Syria further underscores Tehran's diminishing influence, especially given that Shara clearly wants to prevent Iranian meddling in the country. Meanwhile, the Iranian regime is struggling to keep its own country's economy running in the face of widespread sanctions. France, Germany, and the United Kingdom even recently reimposed the UN Security Council's sanctions, using the snapback provisions in the 2015 nuclear deal.

Still, the Iranian regime should never be underestimated, and it remains the Middle East's most patient and determined threat. Its leadership seeks revenge against Israel, and it will almost certainly study the war's lessons alongside its partners in Beijing, Moscow, and Pyongyang. Its nuclear infrastructure is bruised, but it has effectively dismantled the International Atomic Energy Agency's oversight of its nuclear program and still has several nuclear weapons' worth of enriched uranium on hand. It frequently threatens to alter its nuclear strategy and has hinted at leaving the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty or even obtaining a bomb. Iran is driven by a desire for vengeance against Israel and will use whatever weapons and cash it can scrounge up to proliferate and foster terrorism. It remains committed to perpetual conflict—which is why it is virtually the only government that did not welcome the end of the war in Gaza.

As it navigates a new future, Israel has a major advantage: its rock-solid relationship with Washington. For all the hand-wringing about the U.S.-Israeli alliance over the past two years, the two states coordinated more closely than ever after October 7, 2023. The results were excellent. The two countries' attacks on Iran's nuclear program, for instance, improved the United States' leverage in future negotiations without prompting escalation or regional warfare: all the predictions that U.S. attacks would provoke a regional war, close the Strait of Hormuz, prompt oil prices to skyrocket, and yield a wave of terror never materialized. Meanwhile, in Gaza, American diplomatic, financial, and military support allowed Israel to degrade Hamas and thus strike a deal to bring the hostages home. That doesn't mean the two sides were perfectly aligned; in private, U.S. officials pushed their Israeli counterparts to move toward peace, resulting in this month's agreement. Yet Washington showed that genuine influence over Israeli policy derives not from public reprimands or arms embargoes but from unwavering public support and closed-door pressure.

As a result, for the first time in the twenty-first century, the United States has reasserted its leadership role in the Middle East. It has achieved military success without the loss of a single American life and facilitated a peace that has been broadly welcomed across the region. Washington has demonstrated that sustained and strategic involvement in the Middle East can, in fact, reinforce the United States' position as a leading power—in contrast with its rivals. The region is not a quagmire of endless conflicts and financial burdens from which it must disengage.

But for Israel, relations with the United States are now the diplomatic exception. Almost everywhere else in the world, the country is facing a tsunami of condemnation. The harrowing images from Gaza have overshadowed the massacre of October 7. Distorted narratives—including claims that Israel deliberately starved civilians—were fueled by anti-Semitic networks and Hamas's global propaganda machine and compounded by Israel's own diplomatic shortcomings. This prompted recrimination from both the country's longtime critics and even some of its partners, including Germany and Italy. The consequences of all this anger are real. Arab governments, for example, have put a stop to their efforts at normalizing relations with Israel because they are fearful of antagonizing their constituents. Regional officials are also worried that Israel is aiming not just for security but for regional hegemony through military dominance and territorial expansion. But Netanyahu himself has said that Israel has no designs on Gaza, Lebanon, or Syria. The voices in his coalition who have called for annexing the West Bank face resistance from both the Israeli public and the Trump administration. Yet unfair as this reputation may be, Israel is nonetheless seen as a state whose conduct is fundamentally at odds with liberal values and as an unreliable regional interlocutor.

Israel is also staring down new regional competitors. Iran may be weakened, but Muslim Brotherhood–aligned governments in Qatar and Turkey have gained influence. Both states have leveraged their personal rapport with Trump to expand their regional influence, and both now coordinate closely with Washington on Syria, increasing their foothold there. Qatar has also extended its reach into Lebanon. After Israel's failed strike on Hamas leaders in Doha, Trump even compelled Netanyahu to apologize to Qatar. The White House then offered the country defense assurances that were reminiscent of NATO commitments.

Neither of these countries threatens Israel in the same way that Iran does—or to nearly the same extent. In fact, both played central roles in securing a cease-fire in Gaza, and they currently play a central role in keeping Iran weak. But they are not friendly to the Jewish state, either. Qatar, for example, continues to act as a patron of Hamas, and it amplifies anti-Israeli messaging via its Al Jazeera media network. Israel will thus need to carefully manage its relations with the two countries and push for a shift in their hostile policies, ideally in cooperation with Washington. Otherwise, they could fill the vacuum left by Tehran by propping up Sunni radicals from East Africa to the Middle East.

For Israel, diplomatic isolation, Iran, and Sunni extremism will cause continued headaches. Yet overall, the Middle East is becoming more favorable for Israeli interests. There is now a genuine opportunity to end hostilities between Israel and both Lebanon and Syria—and even to slowly normalize relations with both countries. There is also a chance to outright expand the Abraham Accords into the broader Muslim world. Indonesia—the world's largest Muslim-majority nation—represents a particularly significant opportunity. So does Somaliland, in the Horn of Africa, which seeks international recognition and occupies a strategically vital position in the struggle against the Houthis. If Azerbaijan, a long-standing Israeli partner, formally joins this regional force, it would strengthen its own relationship with the United States and reinforce stability across Central Asia. And a political change in Israel could further promote normalization discussions with Saudi Arabia and other Arab states.

Changes in geopolitics will also facilitate such talks. Today, countries across the world, including in the Middle East, are seeking more autonomy in their relationships, diversifying partnerships, and redefining their dependencies. They are more focused on acquiring advanced technology—which has become the currency of power—and maintaining stability. That means the Middle East's future will be shaped by actors who possess the military power to defend themselves and their allies without constant American intervention; the economic capability to rebuild and stabilize destroyed areas, and the technological excellence needed to link the region's economies to Asia and Europe—all while drawing on U.S. leadership when needed. And Israel, with its powerful military, strong tech industry, and ties to Washington, is the best partner most Arab states can find for running this gauntlet.

These countries can deepen their integration even without normalization. They could build a technological ecosystem that links the United States to the Gulf's infrastructure, its energy resources, and Israel's knowledge and innovation, for example, without doing so—and it would be far less politically sensitive. But either way, Arab governments will have to overcome their fears of angering their populations and plow ahead with regional integration.



Israel can simultaneously forge an even stronger relationship with Washington. The two countries should set up a new technological partnership, codified in a bilateral memorandum of understanding, predicated on equitable Israeli-American capital contributions across important tech sectors—including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, energy, and semiconductors. As part of this initiative, the United States should also extend defense assistance to Israel for the ensuing decade.

Most of all, the United States should help facilitate Israel's integration with its Arab neighbors. That means, most obviously, pushing for normalization. But it also means that Washington should ensure Israel's innovative tech ecosystem is connected to the Gulf's and invigorating the India­–Middle East–Europe Economic Corridor (better known as IMEC). To do so, Washington could name a czar specifically tasked with making this bloc of states more cohesive. The envoy would, in turn, help catalyze a technological ecosystem that bridges the Gulf's infrastructure with India's advanced services sector, both of which fit into the Trump administration's plans to turn the Middle East into the world's second most important tech hub, after the United States.

On the military front, the United States should set up a permanent security architecture that combines both Israeli and Gulf resources. It should establish a regional air defense apparatus controlled by the U.S. military's Central Command (popularly known as CENTCOM). But Washington should also establish a broader permanent joint command structure that oversees the region's maritime, cyber, and counterterrorism operations. This structure can feature Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and even Qatar—if it recalibrates its policies.

To further their cooperation, Israel, the United States, and the Arab states should expand their regional coalition into a broader Mediterranean partnership—a kind of pax Mediterranea—that promotes stability, prosperity, and technological progress across all its members. Israel and the United States should do so by convening a leadership summit featuring Arab partners as well as Cyprus, Greece, and Italy (with planned expansions to Azerbaijan, Germany, and India). There, these countries would collectively invest in joint defense procurement and military logistics; technology and energy, with a priority on innovations that can mitigate the effects of climate change and reduce food and water insecurity; and a joint financial institution. They would also figure out ways to support regional reconstruction and plan for how to respond to the many natural disasters that can afflict their shared region. The United States can invite Qatar and Turkey to participate in the coalition if they end their anti-Israeli policies, cease financing Hamas and other terrorist groups, and generally stop spewing propaganda.

A U.S.-backed Arab-Israeli coalition has long been the most viable path toward a stable Middle East. And today, it is more achievable than ever. The challenges—regional mistrust, a resurgent Muslim Brotherhood, and an Iran and a Hamas that are itching to act as spoilers—are real. But if the United States channels its renewed assertiveness and if local actors can align their power with purpose, the Middle East may finally move from perpetual crisis management into a sustainable order.

To achieve this vision, Washington and its regional partners do not need to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But they can certainly try to shift its trajectory in a more hopeful direction. To do so, these actors will need to embrace Trump's framework for a peace committee, which conditions any Israeli concessions on genuine Palestinian reform. The Palestinian Authority (or any other Palestinian government) will need to dismantle terror networks and end Palestinian incitement in schools, religious institutions, and the international arena. Israel will need to receive the remaining hostages' bodies and retain its security primacy in Gaza in order to prevent Hamas's resurgence and ensure that whatever administration follows is effective, made up of both Palestinians and international technocrats.

But regional integration cannot hinge on the Palestinian issue. A veto from Ramallah would almost assuredly doom the rest of this project—and, with it, the region's chance at long-term stability. It is instead time to prioritize peace through strength in its truest sense: not as a slogan, but as a strategy anchored in shared interests, credible deterrence, and the conviction that stability is best secured by those prepared to defend it.

Federal authorities have seized $15 billion in bitcoin from Chen Zhi, a Chinese-Cambodian kingpin accused of running a sprawling scam enterprise that relies on human trafficking and slavery, the U.S. Department of Justice announced on Tuesday.

The asset seizure is part of a broader criminal investigation into Chen and his conglomerate, Prince Group, a Cambodia-based business empire that prosecutors said masked one of Asia's largest transnational fraud and human trafficking networks.

Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich joins 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss the ongoing government shutdown and his take on Operation Arctic Frost that reportedly targeted Republican lawmakers' phone records.

A federal judge in San Francisco on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration from continuing government furloughs, granting a temporary restraining order sought by labor unions that argued layoffs were unlawful during the ongoing government shutdown.

U.S. District Court Judge Susan Illston, a Clinton appointee, ordered the administration not to issue any reduction in force notices to federal employees in "any program, project or activity," including any bargaining unit or member represented by the unions during, or because of, the shutdown.

"The evidence suggests OMB and OPM have taken advantage of the lapse in government spending–function to assume all bets are off and that the laws don't apply to them," Illston said.

            US District Judge Karin Immergut has ruled to extend her temporary restraining orders barring the deployment of the National Guard troops to Portland, keeping President Donald Trump's federalization efforts in limbo as legal challenges unfold.
    


            The ruling by the Trump-appointed judge blocks the federal troops from deploying to Portland for another 14 days. The orders were originally set to expire this weekend.
    


            The extension comes as the federal government challenges the judge's earlier ruling on deployment in a higher court as it works to crack down on Democratic-led cities it claims are stricken by crime and disorder.
    


            The president has cited  protests outside Portland's Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility to justify the callups of troops in the deep blue city.
    


            Leaders in Oregon have emphatically disputed the president's characterizations of their cities as “war-ravaged” and uncontrollably violent, arguing in court that the situation on the ground in Portland is nowhere as extreme as federal officials portray it to be.
    


            Protests in Oregon's biggest city over White House immigration policies started in June, with a declared riot and arson arrests in mid-summer. The scene was largely calm until Trump had declared late September he was sending 200 Oregon National Guard troops to the city.
    


            Oregon and Portland officials jointly sued following the announcement, and Immergut granted a temporary order barring the federalization of those Oregon troops.
    


            The federal judge then expanded that ruling a day later to include barring the deployment of any US troops when the Trump administration reassigned federalized guard troops in Los Angeles to Portland in an apparent effort to get around the initial order.
    


            A three-judge panel with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is still weighing whether the Trump administration should be blocked from deploying the Oregon National Guard to respond to ICE protests in Portland. They have yet to release a decision. The panel last week granted an administrative stay that allowed for the federalization of the Oregon National Guard.
    


            As Trump continues efforts to federalize National Guard members across the US for deployment to Democratic-led cities, the administration faces mounting legal pushback from states saying they don't need — or want — any federal help.
    


            After the state of Illinois and its largest city sued the administration last week, calling plans to move troops from the Illinois and Texas National Guards into Chicago “illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional,” a federal appeals court ruled that the troops in Illinois can remain under federal control but can't be deployed as the appeals process continues in the ongoing showdown between the Trump administration and the state.

A viral video captured a chaotic fight erupting at a San Antonio Whataburger over a food order mix-up, prompting seven arrests. (Credit: Facebook/Rebecca Noel)

A wild brawl was caught on camera in a Texas burger joint, leading to seven arrests. 

The San Antonio Police Department (SAPD) confirmed to Fox News Digital that officers responded to a Whataburger on Oct. 5 at 3 a.m. to reports of an assault in progress. Police said that the brawl began after "two parties were arguing over a mix-up of orders." 

Video obtained by Fox News Digital and posted by Rebecca Noel shows the fast-food fight. The video, which has more than 1,000 shares, captured a woman punching another woman on a counter when a man with a gray shirt walked up to them. Then, several men piled on, joining the brawl.

The scene continued to devolve into chaos with additional individuals joining in, with fists flying. The man with the gray shirt was thrown on the ground with six men punching and kicking him until he was captured curling up in the fetal position. 

At least three others were seen recording the altercation. One female bystander was heard attempting to break up the fight, yelling, "Stop. What the f--- is wrong with y'all?" She then called the police, who arrived to break up the fight.

The SAPD said that no major injuries were reported at the scene and all seven suspects were booked for assault causing bodily injury.

Noel wrote that the families involved will be pressing charges against the individuals, and they "will not stop until justice is served!!!" Fox News Digital has reached out to Noel for comment. 

"Instead of the staff acknowledging their error, they reportedly told the other customers, ‘They have your food,'" wrote Noel. "Moments later, those individuals confronted my son and his friends, and within seconds, the situation escalated far beyond a simple misunderstanding — to a violent assault."

Democratic lawmakers stormed House Speaker Mike Johnson's office on Tuesday, demanding that he swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz.

Democratic lawmakers stormed House Speaker Mike Johnson's office on Tuesday night, demanding that he swear in a newly-elected representative.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., joined arms and chanted "swear her in" with Reps. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M., and Nanette Barragan, D-Calif., as well as Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., as they marched on Johnson's office with members of their staff. Capitol Hill police officers blocked the lawmakers from entering the speaker's office.

Footage from various angles shows Jayapal and Stansbury messing with the sign in front of the speaker's office and getting into an altercation with one of the officers.

Grijalva won her special election on Sept. 23, but she still has not been sworn into office. Her vote would be the final vote needed for the House to approve a discharge petition relating to the Epstein files, put forward by Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky.

The petition, which is currently just one vote shy of passing, calls on the GOP-controlled House to vote to urge the Justice Department to release the files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Johnson, R-La., reacted to the incident on Wednesday, brushing off the action as merely a "political stunt."

"They stormed my office. Maybe you saw some of the video online that they themselves shared or someone did, they berated a Capitol Police officer, screamed at him. He was just merely standing at his post," Johnson said.

"It shows again their disdain for law enforcement, as we see all around the country, the Democrats and everyone in that party screaming, assaulting ICE officers. They did it right here in the Capitol last night. A few members of Congress went into the little foyer of my office and tore down a sign that I had up and, and just engaged in all sorts of political stunts and antics," he added.

Fox News correspondent Madeleine Rivera reports on President Donald Trump working to fund troops during the government shutdown. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., weighs in on the shutdown and his state's gubernatorial race.

An aircraft carrying War Secretary Pete Hegseth made an "unscheduled landing" Wednesday afternoon in the United Kingdom.

Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell announced on social media that on the way back to the U.S. from NATO's Defense Ministers meeting, Hegseth's "plane made an unscheduled landing in the United Kingdom due to a crack in the aircraft windshield."

The plane landed based on standard procedures and everyone onboard, including Hegseth, was safe, according to Parnell.

"All good. Thank God," Hegseth wrote in an X post. "Continue mission!"

Less than a month ago, President Donald Trump and the first lady had to transfer from Marine One to a support helicopter after a hydraulic issue forced an unscheduled landing at a local airfield on the way to Stansted Airport in England.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Sept. 18 the switch was due to a "minor hydraulic issue," and the president and first lady safely boarded the support helicopter.

No injuries were immediately reported, according to the Pentagon. (Omar Havana/Getty Images)

            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed US military leaders to verify that every member of the department watched the speech he delivered at an unusual gathering of senior officers in Quantico, Virginia, last month and reviews the policy changes he announced in the wake of that event, according to a memo reviewed by CNN.
    


            “Leaders at every level will ensure all personnel will either watch the full recording or read the official transcript of the speech, and review the policy changes no later than 31 October 2025,” the October 6 memo from Hegseth states.
    


            Hegseth's memo comes after he ordered senior officers to travel to Quantico for what amounted to a largely political speech that asserted his vision for how the military will physically look and act.
    


            He also offered a stark ultimatum during his speech: If you don't agree, resign.
    


            While Hegseth delivered his speech, in person, to hundreds of senior officers, the subsequent memo makes clear he wants to make sure the message reaches defense personnel at every level.
    


            Leaders “must inculcate our cultural shift and ensure every member of the Department of War understands my guidance,” Hegseth wrote in the memo, using the Trump administration's preferred name for the Defense Department.
    


            Asked about the new memo, a Pentagon spokesperson said that “The Secretary's speech was for the whole force and this memo just reinforces that guidance.”
    


            The directives that accompanied the speech largely roll back efforts made over the last decade focused on eradicating toxic culture in the military, both to decrease harmful behaviors like harassment, but also to meet practical needs of getting people in uniform and keeping them there longer.
    


            There was also a significant emphasis in Hegseth's speech on the fitness and appearance of service members. Hegseth told the room of senior officers he did not want to see any “fat” generals walking the halls of the Pentagon.
    


            Following Hegseth's speech in Quantico, the Texas Military Department removed seven National Guard troops that had been deployed to Chicago because they “did not meet mission requirements,” a Texas National Guard spokesperson told CNN.
    


            “These service members were returned to home station. The Texas National Guard echoes Secretary Hegseth's message to the force: ‘Our standards will be high, uncompromising, and clear,'” the spokesperson said.
    


            The troops, sent to Chicago as part of President Donald Trump's domestic-facing mission focused on crime, were replaced amid criticism on social media over pictures that showed some of the Guard members appearing to be overweight.

Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., discusses the ‘historic' Israel-Hamas peace deal that President Donald Trump helped broker on ‘Saturday in America.'

As Israel and Hamas lay down their arms after more than two years of war, the U.S. is stepping in to oversee the next phase of the deal as a peacekeeping force is formed. 

Sources tell Fox News that all 200 U.S. troops had arrived in Israel by Tuesday night and will operate out of a base in Israel. Additionally, a U.S. Military C-17 transport plane packed with command-and-control equipment and supplies arrived Tuesday.

Last week, negotiators working toward a Gaza deal participating in talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, asked U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) to brief both sides, sources tell Fox News. CENTCOM Commander Adm. Brad Cooper, along with Jared Kushner and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, briefed the Qataris, the Egyptians and the Turks on the Civil Military Coordination Center (CMCC).

Once the U.S. committed to providing heavy coordination, but no boots on the ground in Gaza, negotiators left to tell the Israelis and Hamas. From there, things moved quickly, and, as one well-placed source said, "They saw an opportunity and moved at lightning speed and took it." However, with speed comes risk as certain questions were left unanswered, such as who would be in the stabilization force in Gaza? Or, what is the mechanism for ensuring Hamas disarms?

Fox News has learned that the CMCC will be located a few miles northeast of Gaza, not at the Israel Defense Force's Hatzor Airbase, as some previously reported. The CMCC will be under U.S. leadership, but it will also have representatives from multiple countries and stakeholders, such as the United Nations and private aid groups. U.S. personnel will monitor everything going in and out of Gaza, and will oversee all logistics of delivering aid to the enclave.

While the center is expected to be operational in the coming days, Egypt, Turkey and Qatar have yet to decide whether their representatives will be based there.

TRUMP ENVOY WITKOFF VISITS IDF BASE IN NORTHERN GAZA AS PEACE DEAL ADVANCES, THOUSANDS RETURN HOME

Neither Jordan nor Egypt said they would be willing to send troops to stabilize Gaza, and it looks as though countries outside the region could be left to handle the situation, but nothing has been finalized. Additionally, outside countries willing to send troops would likely need a mandate passed by the U.N. Security Council, as well as approval from their own governments, giving Hamas more time to rebuild and fill the power vacuum.

Despite heavy losses in the war and international threats, Hamas fighters have shown signs that they are not ready to stand down. Since the start of the ceasefire, videos of extrajudicial killings by Hamas in public squares began circulating online.

"We strongly urge Hamas to immediately suspend violence and shooting at innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza — in both Hamas-held parts of Gaza and those secured by the IDF behind the Yellow Line," Cooper said in a statement Wednesday. "This is an historic opportunity for peace. Hamas should seize it by fully standing down, strictly adhering to President Trump's 20-point peace plan, and disarming without delay."

Fox News has learned of a massive effort taking place behind the scenes to plan and execute the rebuilding of Gaza. Part of the issue is the giant tunnel network under Gaza City. To rebuild the city, the tunnels will need to be filled to make the ground stable enough for construction.

The first phase of the deal remains ongoing as Hamas has failed to deliver all 28 bodies of deceased hostages, making it less clear when the second stage will begin. Israel has repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to getting all the deceased hostages' bodies so they can have proper burials.

On Monday, Israel received the bodies of four deceased hostages later identified as Yossi Sharabi, Binpin Joshi, Guy Iluz and Daniel Peretz. Israel received four more bodies on Tuesday, three of whom were identified as deceased hostages Staff Sgt. Tamir Nimrodi, Uriel Baruch and Eitan Levi. Israel said the fourth body did not match any of the hostages and was in fact a Palestinian. 

"Hamas is required to make all necessary efforts to return the deceased hostages," the IDF wrote on X.

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin discusses Democratic Attorney General candidate Jay Jones' controversial texts about political violence on ‘Hannity.'

Democratic Virginia attorney general candidate Jay Jones is facing backlash online over an X post that came in the wake of his texting scandal.

"As the father of two young boys, I know what it's like to feel the squeeze of grocery prices every week. I'm running for Attorney General to protect families' pocketbooks from rising costs — whether it's utility rate hikes or the price of berries," Jones wrote on X.

Many critics took issue with him framing the post from his point of view as a father in the wake of a texting scandal that has rocked Virginia politics.

The Republican Attorneys General Association chimed in, saying, "As the father of two young boys, you must think anyone who fantasizes about killing children is seriously deranged and unfit for office!"

Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, also responded by calling Jones a "dirtbag" and demanding he drop out of the race.

"'As the father of two young boys,' you should know that wishing death upon your political opponents' children is abhorrent. Drop out, dirtbag," Gill wrote.

While some critics dissected Jones' wording, Rep. Brad Knott, R-N.C., simply asked, "What's your take on political violence?"

JOE SCARBOROUGH TELLS DEM CANDIDATE JAY JONES TO LEAVE RACE OVER VIOLENT COMMENTS AGAINST GOP LAWMAKER

The scandal involving Jones came to light earlier this month when the National Review published text message exchanges between the attorney general hopeful and his former state legislative colleague, Republican House Delegate Carrie Coyner. In the exchanges, Jones appears to call for violence against then-Virginia House of Delegates Speaker Todd Gilbert, his wife, Jennifer, and their children.

"Three people, two bullets. Gilbert, Hitler and Pol Pot. Gilbert gets two bullets to the head," Jones wrote on Aug. 8, 2022. In a subsequent text he added, "Spoiler: put Gilbert in the crew with the two worst people you know, and he receives both bullets every time."

Coyner asked Jones to stop, adding, "It really bothers me when you talk about hurting people or wishing death on them."

Jones excused the tirade by saying he was asking questions. Coyner denied that was the case, saying that Jones was "talking about [hoping] Jennifer Gilbert's children would die."

"Yes, I've told you this before. Only when people feel pain personally do they move on policy," Jones replied.

Coyner told the National Review that she had not spoken to Jones since the exchanges, other than having short discussions about policy. She told the outlet in a statement that "what he said was not just disturbing but disqualifying for anyone who wants to seek public office."

YOUNGKIN SAYS DEMOCRAT AG CANDIDATE JAY JONES MUST 'STEP AWAY IN DISGRACE' OVER TEXTS ABOUT FORMER GOP LEADER

Jones acknowledged the text messages and apologized. In a statement to CBS News, he said, "I want to issue my deepest apology to Speaker Gilbert and his family. Reading back those words made me sick to my stomach. I am embarrassed, ashamed and sorry."

Democrats have largely avoided calling on Jones to drop out of the race or pulling their endorsements of the embattled candidate.

AI-powered driving will help with a growing shortage of drivers, rising costs and relentless demand for faster deliveries.

Road crews may soon get a major assist from artificial intelligence. Researchers at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute have developed a fabric embedded with sensors and AI algorithms that can monitor road conditions from beneath the surface. This smart material could make costly, disruptive road repairs far more efficient and sustainable.

Right now, most resurfacing decisions are based on visible damage. But cracks and wear in the layers below the asphalt often go undetected until it's too late. That's where Fraunhofer's innovation comes in.

The system uses a fabric made from flax fibers interwoven with ultra-thin conductive wires. These wires detect minute changes in the asphalt base layer, signaling potential damage before it reaches the surface.

THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY AUTONOMOUS TRUCKING

Fraunhofer researchers test AI sensors that detect road damage beneath the surface.  (Fraunhofer Institute)

Once the fabric is laid under the road, it continuously collects data. A connected unit on the roadside stores and transmits this data to an AI system that analyzes it for early warning signs. As vehicles pass over the road, the system measures changes in resistance within the fabric. These changes reveal how the base layer is performing and whether cracks or strain are forming beneath the surface.

Traditional road inspection methods rely on drilling or taking core samples, which are destructive, costly and only provide information for a small section of pavement. This AI-driven system eliminates the need for that kind of invasive testing.

Instead of reacting to surface damage, transportation agencies could predict and prevent deterioration before it becomes expensive to fix. The approach could extend road life, cut down on traffic delays and help governments spend infrastructure funds more efficiently.

ULTRA-THIN SOUND BLOCKER CUTS TRAFFIC NOISE DRAMATICALLY

The real power comes from combining AI algorithms with continuous sensor feedback. Fraunhofer's machine-learning software can forecast how damage will spread, helping engineers prioritize which roads need maintenance first. Data from the sensors is displayed on a web-based dashboard, offering a clear visual of road health for local agencies and planners.

The project, called SenAD2, is currently being tested in an industrial zone in Germany. Early results suggest the system can identify internal damage without disrupting traffic or damaging the road itself.

Smarter road monitoring could lead to fewer potholes, smoother commutes and less taxpayer money wasted on inefficient repairs. If adopted widely, cities could plan maintenance years in advance, avoiding the cycle of patchwork fixes that often make driving a daily headache.

For drivers, it means less time sitting in construction zones. For local governments, it means better roads built on data, not guesswork.

WILL AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS REPLACE DRIVERS BY 2027?

WASHINGTON (AP) — With every passing day of the government shutdown, hundreds of thousands of federal employees furloughed or working without pay face mounting financial strain. And now they are confronting new uncertainty with the Trump administration's promised layoffs.

Little progress has been made to end the shutdown as it enters its third week, with Republicans and Democrats digging in and convinced their messaging is resonating with voters. The fate of the federal workers is among several pressure points that could eventually push the sides to agree to resolve the stalemate.

“Luckily I was able to pay rent this month,” said Peter Farruggia, a furloughed federal worker. “But for sure I am going to have bills that are going to go unpaid this month, and I really don't have many options.”

The shutdown has a familiar feel for many federal employees who endured past stalemates — including during President Donald Trump's first term — but this time, the stakes are higher. The Republican White House is leveraging federal workers' jobs to pressure Democrats to soften their demands.

The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Trump and other Republican leaders have said the government must reopen before they will negotiate with Democrats on the health subsidies.




Government shutdownThe AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them?

Farruggia is the executive committee chair of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883, representing employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency that faced a wave of layoffs over the weekend. Like 8,000 other CDC employees who have been furloughed from the agency, he was already living paycheck to paycheck, and the partial pay that arrived Friday was his last until the government comes back online.

With the agency's leadership in turmoil and still rattled from a shooting, the shutdown and new firings mean “people are scared, nervous, anxious, but also really just exasperated,” Farruggia said. 

After Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said last week on social media that the “RIFs have begun,” referring to reduction-in-force plans aimed at reducing the size of the federal government, Vice President JD Vance doubled down on the threat Sunday, saying “the longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be.”

The layoffs have begun across federal agencies. Labor unions have already filed a lawsuit to stop the move by Trump's budget office.

In a court filing on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget said well over 4,000 federal employees from eight departments and agencies would be fired in conjunction with the shutdown.

Jessica Sweet, an Albany, New York, Social Security claims specialist who is a union steward of AFGE Local 3343 in New York, said, “I, myself, have a backup plan” in case she is fired during the shutdown, “but I know most people don't.” 

She says the Social Security Administration is already so short-staffed from layoffs earlier this year brought on by the Department of Government Efficiency, she doesn't fear a massive layoff during the shutdown. 

“The one thing this administration has taught me is that nothing is ever for certain, even if it's codified into law,” she said.

Having received a partial payment in her last paycheck, Sweet has begun reaching out to her local power companies to request that she not get charged late fees, since “my bills won't wait for me to eventually get paid.”

For some federal workers, this isn't their first shutdown — the last one, during Trump's first term in 2019, stretched a record 34 days. But this time, federal employees are being used more directly as leverage in the political fight over government funding.

The Republican administration last week warned that there would be no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a shutdown — a reversal of long-standing policy affecting roughly 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a White House memo. The move, which Trump later backtracked on, was widely seen as a strong-arm tactic.

Adam Pelletier, a National Labor Relations Board field examiner whose agency furloughed nearly all of its workforce on Oct. 1, going from roughly 1,100 workers to fewer than a dozen people, said he wouldn't mind if the shutdown continued if it meant meaningful progress toward gaining health care protections for Americans across the country — a key demand by Democrats for ending the stalemate. 

Pelletier, a union leader for NLRB local 3, said “right now, nothing is being investigated at the NLRB. There's no elections for unions or elections for decertifications. Basically nothing is happening.”

As for the financial strain on workers, he said workers can't even find alternate employment to weather the shutdown because “the ethics office that would approve of those requests is not staffed now.”

National Treasury Employees Union President Doreen Greenwald, which represents workers across dozens of federal agencies, said several of the union's members had been laid off as of Friday. The Treasury Department would lose 1,446 workers, according to the filing.

Greenwald said it was unfortunate that the Trump administration was using “federal employees as political pawns by furloughing and proposing to fire them all to try to cause pressure in a political game of chicken.”

“This isn't about one party or the other. It's about real people,” said Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees.

“The correction officer worrying about his next paycheck. The TSA officer who still shows up to work because he or she loves their country, even though they're not getting paid. No American should ever have to choose between serving their country and feeding their family,” Kelley said.

Kelley and other major federal worker union leaders gathered blocks from the Capitol last week, urging congressional leaders to find a solution and put “people over politics.” The event grew emotional at times, with union heads outlining the difficulties facing their members and the stakes growing daily.

Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, which represents 110,000 workers nationwide, called on both sides of Congress to find a resolution. He said Trump appeared to aim to “degrade, frighten, antagonize hardworking federal employees.”

Chris Bartley, political program coordinator for the International Association of Fire Fighters, said thousands of firefighters were showing up for work without pay out of a sense of devotion but stressed that could have broader consequences.

“Families go without income,” Bartley said. “Morale and retention suffer. Public safety is compromised.”

Live Updates


            • Major case: The Supreme Court heard oral arguments this morning in a major case that threatens to undermine the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Louisiana v. Callais centers on the creation of a second Black-majority congressional district in the state.
    


            • National impact: While the dispute is focused on Louisiana's congressional map, the outcome will have nationwide implications. Voting rights groups who warn that undermining some of the law's protections for redistricting risks “wiping out minority representation and re-segregating legislatures, city councils, and school boards.”
    


            • Potential future reversal: Signals from the conservative majority today have pointed to a potential reversal on the Louisiana map with a possible retrenchment of the landmark civil rights law.
    


            • 2026 midterms: How far the court goes could also impact the balance of power in the US House after the midterm elections. A ruling for Louisiana could prompt a redrawing of districts by other GOP-led states that would almost certainly give a boost to Republicans.
    


            The Supreme Court's conservative majority signaled deep skepticism today over a second majority Black district drawn in Louisiana, despite a lower court ruling that found the district was likely necessary to respect the landmark Voting Rights Act.
    


            At issue is a second majority Black district drawn in Louisiana following the 2020 census that elected Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat, to the House. The state drew that district in response to a lower court that found the state likely violated the landmark 1965 civil rights law with the initial version of its map.
    


            Key to the argument was Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who just two years ago was the deciding vote upholding the Voting Rights Act provision in a case involving Alabama's map. This time around, Kavanaugh repeatedly leaned into two points suggesting he had reservations with Louisiana's map.
    


            Kavanaugh, a conservative, and others signaled an interest in the Trump administration's approach to the Louisiana case. The Trump administration sided with Louisiana – and against the Black voters – but in a way that would likely erode the power of the Voting Rights Act while not gutting it entirely.
    


            Kavanaugh also returned to an argument about whether the Voting Rights Act can indefinitely require the drawing of “remedial” majority-minority districts. In other contexts, including college admissions, the court has ruled that such race-based decision making must have some sort of time limit.
    


            At one point, Kavanaugh quoted from earlier decisions suggesting that “race-based districting” embarks the nation on a “most dangerous course.”
    


            Early on, Chief Justice John Roberts – who joined with Kavanaugh and the court's liberals in the Alabama case two years ago – quickly sought to draw a distinction between that outcome and the Louisiana case, suggesting he didn't see the earlier precedent as controlling this case.
    


            The court's three-justice liberal wing focused much of its fire on Congress's intent in enacting the landmark Voting Rights Act in 1965: to root out discrimination that targeted African American voters. They have questioned the Trump administration's approach, suggesting it would require plaintiffs to meet a much higher standard than is required by the Voting Rights Act to find discriminatory maps.
    


            The Supreme Court's decision to hear arguments Wednesday on Louisiana's congressional map is highly unusual: It is a rare instance in which the justices are engaging in a do-over.
    


            The court already heard arguments in the Louisiana case in March, during its last term. Instead of handing down a decision in June, the court announced on its final day that it intended to schedule a new set of arguments in the case.
    


            Such re-arguments have often occurred in high-profile cases. Roe v. Wade, the case that established a constitutional right to abortion, was first argued in 1971 and again in 1972. The precedent was subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022.
    


Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark case that found school segregation unconstitutional, was argued in 1952 and then argued again in 1953.
    


            More recently, the high court argued the landmark campaign finance case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2009 and then again in 2010.
    


            The case before the Supreme Court is about Louisiana's congressional districts, but the decision will almost certainly have national implications.
    


            For one thing, it could ultimately reduce the number of representatives of color at all levels of government.
    


            Voting rights groups warn that a ruling in Louisiana's favor risks “wiping out minority representation and re-segregating legislatures, city councils, and school boards.”
    


            That would be most immediately apparent for Rep. Cleo Fields, a Black Democrat from Louisiana who represents the state's disputed 6th Congressional District. A ruling for Louisiana would almost certainly mean a significant redrawing of his congressional district.
    


            Because race and politics are often closely intertwined, a ruling in the case could change the balance of power in the House after the 2026 midterm election. A ruling for Louisiana could prompt a redrawing of districts by other GOP-led states that would almost certainly give a boost to Republicans.
    


            And because it's Louisiana, the case could also affect the districts of key House leaders, notably Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise – both Republicans who represent the state in Congress.
    


            A 39-year-old precedent, Thornburg v. Gingles, is playing a central role in the Supreme Court's oral arguments today over the Voting Rights Act.
    


            As part of its argument before the court, Louisiana officials have specifically called for the Gingles precedent to be overturned.
    


            The case dealt with North Carolina's legislative districts that were challenged by Black voters as violating the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court unanimously agreed with them.
    


            But the lasting legacy of the opinion is as the standard courts use to determine if a violation of the Voting Rights Act has occurred. Congress specifically declined to endorse the idea of “proportionality” – the idea that a third of districts should be available to Black candidates if African Americans make up a third of the population. Instead, courts look to the “Gingles factors.”
    


            First, a plaintiff must establish that a racial minority group is large enough and compact enough to make up a majority of a district. Second, plaintiffs must show that the group at issue is “politically cohesive.” Then, plaintiffs must demonstrate that the majority group (i.e. White voters) vote sufficiently together to defeat a minority group's preferred candidate.
    


            If a plaintiff challenging a map can meet those requirements, courts then look to what's known as the “totality of the circumstances” to determine if the district boundaries leave minority voters with “less opportunity than White voters to elect representatives of their choice.” Those can include factors like how much success minority candidates have in state elections as well as the state's past history of racial discrimination.
    


            Hashim Mooppan, a veteran attorney who has taken on several high-profile Supreme Court cases at the Justice Department this year, is now speaking on behalf of the Trump administration.
    


            Mooppan, a former clerk to the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, is the principal deputy solicitor general. Prior to joining the Trump administration, he was a partner at the Jones Day law firm.
    


            Even casual court observers may be familiar with Mooppan, a rising star who just argued another case before the high court involving “conversion therapy.” In that case, the administration sided with a licensed counselor in Colorado who is challenging the state's ban on the discredited practice.
    


            Mooppan was also a counselor to the solicitor general during the first Trump administration. The Trump administration is siding with Louisiana in the current redistricting fight.
    


            Justices often use oral arguments to signal to their colleagues how a case should be resolved, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh appears to using his questions about Louisiana's congressional map and the Voting Rights Act to do just that.
    


            Kavanaugh, a conservative, has repeatedly signaled an interest in the Trump administration's approach to the case. The Trump administration sided with Louisiana – and against the Black voters in the case – but in a way that is slightly less far reaching than the state's argument when it comes to the Voting Rights Act.
    


            The Trump administration has suggested that race might still be used in a limited way to redraw district boundaries in some circumstances. Louisiana has argued, by comparison, that race cannot be used at all. Just how that delta might play out in practice is not entirely clear but, at least in this case, Louisiana's current map would need to be redrawn under the Trump administration's approach.
    


            Kavanaugh, at one point, told the attorney for Louisiana that he thought the Trump administration's approach “solves a lot of the concerns that you've identified.”
    


            The lineup of attorneys in the case has affected the cadence of the Supreme Court's arguments in an unusual way. Because Louisiana switched its position – and no longer supports its own map – only one attorney stood before the justices to defend the current map, which includes a second Black majority district.
    


            That attorney was Janai Nelson, with the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund. She faced tough and skeptical questions from Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and others.
    


            Subsequent attorneys all believe that Louisiana's map should be tossed – based on different legal reasons. And now it is likely to be the court's three-justice liberal wing – Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson – who will likely do the most speaking.
    


            Edward Greim, an attorney who fought the IRS during the Obama administration over its scrutiny of conservative groups, is speaking on behalf of the “non-Black” voters who sued over the current version of Louisiana's map.
    


            Greim, a Missouri native and 2002 Harvard Law graduate, argued the same case when the justices heard it previously in March.
    


            Greim represented a group of Tea Party advocates in a high-profile, class action legal case alleging the IRS aggressively scrutinized conservative groups during the Obama administration. The case resulted in a settlement in 2017.
    


            Greim is arguing on behalf of a group of “non-Black” plaintiffs who alleged Louisiana's updated map violated the 14th and 15th Amendments, which were ratified after the Civil War.
    


            Justice Sonia Sotomayor stressed at one point that race has traditionally been used lawfully in the redistricting process as she pushed back on Louisiana's argument that it cannot be used to remedy violations of the Voting Rights Act.
    


            “Race is a part of redistricting always… Race is always a part of these decisions, and my colleagues are trying to tease it out in this intellectual way that doesn't deal with the fact that race is used to help people,” Sotomayor, the court's senior liberal member, told Louisiana Solicitor General Ben Aguiñaga.
    


            “Legislators might try to keep an ethnic community in one district. They might consider it to get a sense of which district to draw an incumbent into. They might review it to predict what kind of issues a district voter might be particularly interested in. They might use it to inform partisan goals,” she said. “We permit all of that.”
    


                    “What you're saying to us: ‘If you use it to remedy past, lingering discrimination, intentional discrimination, then you can't use it. You can use it to help yourself achieve goals that reduce a particular group's electoral participation, but you can't use it to remedy that situation.' That's what you want us to hold.”
                





            The congressional district that kicked off the current Supreme Court case is Louisiana's 6th District, currently held by Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat.
    


            The district slashes diagonally from Shreveport in the northwest of the state to Baton Rouge in the southeast for some 250 miles to create a district where Black residents make up some 54% of voters – up from about 24% under the old lines.
    


            Earlier this year, Chief Justice John Roberts referred to it as a “snake.” That's important because one of the traditional goals for mapmakers is to draw congressional districts that are “compact.”
    


            “If you look at CD6, what does ‘reasonably compact' mean?” Roberts said during the first arguments in March. “I mean, it's – it's a snake that runs from one end of the state to the other. I mean, how is that compact?”
    


            Several conservative Supreme Court justices signaled skepticism over the creation of a second majority Black district in Louisiana in the early stages of oral arguments Wednesday.
    


            In a mostly subdued series of questions, the conservative justices – notably Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh – asked questions that at least suggested concerns with Louisiana's drawing of a second Black majority district.
    


            It wasn't until roughly 45 minutes into arguments that some of them began raising fundamental constitutional questions about the use of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.
    


            Kavanaugh was perhaps the most important questioner during the first round. At one point, he quoted from earlier decisions suggesting that “race-based districting” embarks the nation on a “most dangerous course.”
    


            The Donald Trump-nominated justice also repeatedly returned to the question of whether states can rely on the Voting Rights Act to draw majority-minority districts indefinitely.
    


            Ben Aguiñaga, the top appellate attorney for the state of Louisiana, is at the podium on behalf of the Pelican State.
    


            A former clerk to Justice Samuel Alito and a Texas native, Aguiñaga has argued at the Supreme Court twice before, including once when justices heard this same case in March. He also argued on behalf of states who last year alleged that the government's efforts to combat online misinformation amounted to a form of unconstitutional censorship.
    


            Aguiñaga received his law degree from Louisiana State University in 2015 and clerked for US Circuit Judge Edith Jones on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.
    


            He spent a year as the chief of staff for the Civil Rights Division at the US Department of Justice during President Donald Trump's first administration. He was an attorney at Jones Day for nearly five years before joining the Louisiana attorney general's office in early 2024.
    


            When Justice Elena Kagan asked an attorney for Black voters in Louisiana what the “results on the ground” would be if the Supreme Court strikes down Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the lawyer made no bones about how devastating she believed the outcome would be.
    


            “Were Section Two to cease to operate in the way that you just described … what could happen? What would the results on the ground be?” Kagan, a member of the court's liberal wing, asked Janai Nelson.
    


            “I think the results would be pretty catastrophic,” Nelson responded quickly.
    


            She continued: “If we take Louisiana as one example, every congressional member who is Black was elected from a VRA opportunity district.”
    


                    “We only have the diversity that we see across the South, for example, because of litigation that forced the creation of opportunity districts under the Voting Rights Act.” 
                





            Justice Brett Kavanaugh is pressing on a point that is central to the case: Whether redistricting that takes race into account should be allowed to carry on indefinitely.
    


            It's potentially a signal that Kavanaugh is skeptical of the position raised by Black voters. The Supreme Court raised a similar point in striking down affirmative action admissions policies in 2023.
    


            “This court's cases, in a variety of contexts, has said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time,” the conservative justice asked.  “But that they should not be indefinite and should have an end point. What exactly do you think the end point should be?”
    


            Janai Nelson, representing the Black voters in Louisiana, has argued that the Voting Rights Act has a time limit built in, because states must redraw their maps with a new census every decade.
    


            One of the arguments Louisiana and critics of the Voting Rights Act is making is that the confusion around how to apply the law in redistricting has spurred a bevy of lawsuits, even as minority representation has increased and housing segregation has decreased.
    


            That line of attack has drawn some interest from conservative justices in the past.
    


            But an interesting brief from the Voting Rights Initiative at the University of Michigan Law School has made the opposition point: The number of vote dilution lawsuits based on Section 2 of the VRA, it says, has gone down.
    


            Janai Nelson, representing the Black voters in Louisiana, pointed to that brief early in her arguments on Wednesday.
    


            According to that brief, the number of Section 2 vote claims has almost halved over recent decades.
    


            “Courts today adjudicate far fewer Section 2 vote dilution claims, and find far fewer Section 2 violations, than in prior decades,” the brief claims.
    


            In his typical understated way, Chief Justice John Roberts threw some early shade in his opening question on the idea that Supreme Court already decided this case in favor of the Voting Rights Act two years ago.
    


            His pushback is important because the attorney for Black voters in the case noted the court just upheld the Voting Rights Act in a similar redistricting case dealing with Alabama two years ago. Roberts was having none of it – suggesting he doesn't believe the Alabama case resolves the issue.
    


            Roberts supported the Voting Rights Act in the Alabama case. His vote is likely up for grabs in the Louisiana appeal.
    


            In that case, Roberts said, the court “considered Alabama's particular challenge” not necessarily one that would apply to Louisiana.
    


            If the Supreme Court ultimately sides with Louisiana and overturns a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, the outcome will beg an obvious question: Why didn't the court do it two years ago?
    


            Way back in 2023, a 5-4 majority of the high court ordered Alabama officials to redraw that state's congressional map to allow an additional Black majority district. That outcome came even though Alabama raised some of the same arguments then that Louisiana is raising now.
    


            That decision came as a surprise, after oral arguments suggested a majority was likely on Alabama's side.
    


            And some of the language in that opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, is particularly striking when viewed alongside the arguments Louisiana is making in its appeal. Louisiana, for instance, has come out strong for the prospect that the Constitution requires a colorblind approach to redistricting.
    


            “The contention that mapmakers must be entirely ‘blind' to race has no footing” in the court's Voting Rights Act precedents, Roberts wrote in 2023.
    


            “The line that we have long drawn is between consciousness and predominance.”
    


            It would take only one justice to switch votes in that case, Allen v.Milligan, to land on a different outcome for Louisiana.
    


            Justice Clarence Thomas, a member of the court's conservative wing and its most senior associate justice, is asking the first question – which he almost always does these days during oral arguments at the Supreme Court.
    


            Thomas started off with a series of technical questions about the original court order striking down Louisiana's first map. Previously, the conservative justice has expressed skepticism about that court's decision – and he reiterated some of that skepticism on Wednesday.
    


            “There was never a full merits determination,” Thomas said.
    


            Thomas' position on the case is the clearest of all the nine justices. When the court declined to decide the Louisiana redistricting appeal earlier this year – holding it over for a second set of arguments – Thomas wrote separately to say he would have decided right then and there that the Voting Rights Act could not be used to justify creating another majority Black district.
    


            Thomas wrote then that the way a majority of the court has approached the issue is “broken beyond repair.”
    


            It's a point Thomas has been making for years. He has been joined at various times by fellow conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett.
    


            The unusual posture of the Supreme Court's major Voting Rights Act case means only one attorney will stand before the justices on Wednesday to defend Louisiana's congressional map. That task fell to Janai Nelson as oral arguments began just after 10 a.m. ET. 



            Nelson, a Fulbright scholar and former law professor, is the president and director-counsel of the storied NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
    


            Nelson is representing a group of Black voters who challenged Louisiana's first map under the Voting Rights Act. A lower court found that first version likely violated the VRA and that is what prompted the state to draw the second map, which is now at issue before the Supreme Court.
    


            Nelson received her law degree from UCLA and clerked for US Circuit Judge Theodore McMillian on the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals and US District Judge David Coar in Illinois.

            An American tourist was fatally stabbed and another wounded during an attempted robbery early Wednesday in the coastal town of Cascais, west of Lisbon, according to authorities.
    


            The incident happened near the Church of the Navigators, with emergency services receiving an alert at around 3:16 a.m., CNN Portugal reported.
    


            Investigators say one of the tourists was returning to his hotel when three suspects confronted him and tried to rob him. The victim resisted, was punched, and attempted to flee while calling a friend for help. When the second tourist arrived at the scene, he was also assaulted.
    


            The attackers fatally stabbed one of the men and seriously injured the other before fleeing.
    


            The three suspects have been arrested and are now being questioned by police. One of the men faces a homicide charge, while the others are accused of taking part in the assault.
    


            The victim's death was first reported by Correio da Manhã and later confirmed by CNN Portugal.
    


            Emergency medical teams from the National Institute of Medical Emergency (INEM) attempted to resuscitate the man, but the stab wounds were deep and struck vital areas, authorities said.
    


            The second victim was taken to Santa Maria Hospital in Lisbon. Despite suffering deep cuts to his face and arms, he is no longer in critical condition, according to hospital officials.
    


            The State Department told CNN it is aware of reports of an attack on two US tourists in Cascais, and stands ready to provide consular assistance.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to relocate World Cup matches set to be played next year in suburban Boston, after suggesting that parts of the city had been “taken over” by unrest. 

Foxborough, Massachusetts, home to the NFL's New England Patriots and about 30 miles from Boston, is set to stage matches as the U.S. cohosts the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada. Trump was asked about Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu, a Democrat whom he called “intelligent” but “radical left.” 

“We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. “I love the people of Boston and I know the games are sold out. But your mayor is not good.”

He suggested “they're taking over parts of Boston” without offering details, but added “we could get them back in about two seconds.”

The Trump administration has already deployed National Guard troops to Washington and Memphis, and efforts to do so in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, have sparked legal fights. 

Wu's office did not react directly to Trump's threat, issuing a statement that read, “Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions.”

Trump's comments came during his meeting with Argentina President Javier Milei and it wasn't immediately clear what he was referring to by parts of Boston having been seized. Earlier this month, however, there were multiple arrests in connection with a pro-Palestinian protest that turned violent on Boston Common. Four police officers were injured. 




Trump has previously suggested he could declare cities “not safe” for the 104-game soccer tournament and alter a detailed hosting plan that FIFA confirmed in 2022. It includes games at NFL stadiums near New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

World Cup host sites aren't up to Trump. The 11 U.S. cities — plus three in Mexico and two in Canada — are contracted with FIFA, which would face significant logistical and legal issues to make changes in the eight months before the June 11 kickoff.

“It's FIFA's tournament, FIFA's jurisdiction, FIFA makes those decisions,” the soccer body's vice president Victor Montagliani said earlier this month at a sports business conference in London.

Trump nonetheless said, “If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who's phenomenal -- and I would say, ‘Let's move into another location' and they would do that.”

The president meant FIFA head Gianni Infantino, a close ally. Trump said Infantino “wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — A senior adviser at the State Department and expert on Indian and South Asian affairs is accused by the Justice Department of printing out classified documents and storing more than 1,000 pages of highly sensitive government records in filing cabinets and trash bags at home.

Ashley Tellis, who has also worked as a contractor in the Defense Department's Office of Net Assessment, was charged in federal court in Virginia with the unlawful retention of national defense information after FBI agents who searched his home over the weekend found what they said was a trove of records marked as classified at the secret and top secret levels.

He was ordered detained Tuesday pending a detention hearing next week. One of his lawyers, Deborah Curtis, told The Associated Press that “we look forward to the hearing, where we'll be able to present evidence” but declined to comment further.

An FBI affidavit cites several instances over the last month in which Tellis is alleged to have printed on government computers, or asked a colleague to print, classified documents on topics including U.S. military aircraft capabilities. Surveillance video shows him on several occasions exiting the State Department and a Defense Department facility with a briefcase in which he was believed to have stashed the printed-out papers, according to court documents. 

Tellis also met multiple times with Chinese government officials in recent years, according to the affidavit. Tellis arrived to one 2022 dinner with a manila folder while the Chinese officials he was meeting with entered with a gift bag, the FBI says. The affidavit says Tellis did not appear to have the manila folder in his possession when he left the restaurant, but does not accuse him of providing any classified information during his meetings with the Chinese.




Tellis is a prominent foreign policy expert with a specialty in Indian and South Asian affairs. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace lists him as a senior fellow and the Tata Chair for Strategic Affairs. He also served on the White House National Security Council staff under Republican President George W. Bush.

This story has been corrected to reflect that Tellis is an expert on Indian and South Asian affairs, not Indian and South affairs.

 Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest on efforts to secure peace in the Middle East on 'Special Report.'

Two Americans were still among the deceased hostages held by Hamas on Wednesday, as the Palestinian terror group failed to meet the terms of President Donald Trump's peace plan.

Nineteen-year-old U.S.-Israeli dual citizen Itay Chen was initially believed to have been kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, while serving along the Gaza border, but was later declared dead by the IDF. His body is still held by Hamas in Gaza. 

Capt. Omer Neutra, 21, a fellow American-Israeli from New York, was killed in battle that same day, and his body remains in captivity.

TRUMP ISSUES DIRE WARNING TO HAMAS: IF THEY DON'T DISARM ‘WE WILL DISARM THEM'

"This two-year emotional roller coaster has reached one of its highest peaks," said Ronen Neutra, father of Omer Neutra, in an interview with Fox News Digital.

On Monday, Neutra met with Trump for an hour during the president's visit to Israel.

"We voiced our concern that no deceased hostage should remain in Gaza. We know we're dealing with a terror organization that exploits every grey area in any deal. While the living hostages were returned as agreed, we're already seeing violations," Neutra said. "The president assured us he would do everything to bring our children home."

Earlier Wednesday, Neutra and his wife went to sleep only at 3 a.m, after learning that the four bodies released by Hamas once again did not include their son — and that one of them wasn't even a hostage.

The U.S. hostage families met incoming SPEHA Director Adam Boehler. The families thanked President Trump and his administration for all they have done on the hostage crisis. From left, Ronen Neutra, Jonathan Dekel Chen, Adi Alexander, Orna Neutra, Yael Alexander, Adam Boehler and Ruby Chen (Ruby Chen)

"I expect the United States to exert strong pressure on the mediators," Neutra told Fox News Digital. "We've heard that Washington has spoken directly with Hamas in Egypt, and we demand full implementation of the agreement — or serious consequences: halting humanitarian aid, and stopping the movement of goods and people through the Rafah crossing.

"Our expectation is for President Trump to ensure that the two American citizens still held by Hamas — our son Omer and Itay Chen — are brought home for burial," he continued. "After two years of fighting for this, we deserve closure — and our son deserves proper burial in the land he loved and defended."

TRUMP HAS FREED MORE THAN 70 US HOSTAGES IN LESS THAN A YEAR; BIDEN RELEASED AROUND 70 IN FOUR YEARS

Under the terms of the agreement, Hamas was obligated to return all 28 bodies alongside the 20 living captives freed on Monday. However, the terror group has so far delivered only seven bodies — four on Monday and three more on Tuesday night — in clear violation of the deal. 

"There is a diplomatic effort to make sure the agreement is fulfilled," said Ruby Chen, the father of Itay Chen, the other remaining American held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza.

"Hamas did not provide the majority of the hostages yesterday, and we — the families — are, of course, very disappointed," he continued. "Especially as an American citizen, I'm disappointed that the United States was not able to bring my son back. We demand that the window of opportunity that exists today to release the remaining hostages not be lost."

Ruby Chen's son, IDF Sgt. Itay Chen, was serving along the Gaza border when he was taken hostage by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7. (IDF)

"The U.S. and the mediators must put pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages," Chen added, "and leverage the agreed-upon components — such as the release of Palestinian prisoners and the reopening of the Rafah crossing."

The Israel Defense Forces announced on Wednesday that one of the four bodies Hamas returned to Israel late Tuesday did not belong to any of the identified hostages.

Trump delivered a sharp warning to Hamas on Tuesday, vowing that the U.S. would act if the terrorist group fails to lay down its arms.

"They said they were going to disarm, and if they don't, we will disarm them," Trump told reporters at the White House while meeting with Argentine President Javier Milei.

Professor Hagai Levine, head of the health team for the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, described the emotional toll on families still awaiting news.

"It has a tremendous psychological impact — families cannot move forward until there is certainty, a proper burial, and full confidence regarding the fate of their loved ones," Levine told Fox News Digital.

"That's why bringing back all hostages — living and deceased — is critical for families, and for the nation as a whole, to begin healing," he added.

Levine explained that the identification and verification process for deceased hostages is carried out at the National Institute of Forensic Medicine in Abu Kabir in Tel Aviv.

"I'm in close contact with the staff at the institute," he said. "We have complete trust in them. They use advanced technology and multiple methods for identification — including individual markings, unique tattoos, fingerprints, DNA comparison with pre-acquired family samples, and full-body CT scans."

He cautioned that the process could take time, citing previous cases such as that of Shiri Bibas, whose body Hamas initially substituted with that of a Gazan woman before eventually returning her actual remains.

"Receiving the news is also a critical and emotional moment," Levine continued. "It can bring a measure of relief and closure, but it's also an extremely stressful time — and we're there to support the families. Those still waiting fear their loved ones will be forgotten. The mission isn't complete until everyone is brought back to Israel."

Israel's Kan 11 reported on Tuesday, citing Qatari media, that Egyptian teams had begun assisting in efforts to locate the remains of deceased hostages in Gaza.

Meanwhile, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum sent a letter to U.S. Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff, expressing their gratitude.

"We are immensely grateful and overjoyed to see 20 of our loved ones back home, finally reuniting with the families who have fought tirelessly for their return for so long. However, what we feared is now happening before our eyes. Only four deceased hostages are coming home today," the letter said.

"We must ensure that all remaining hostages come home. We cannot rest, and we know you will not rest, until every last hostage is returned," it added.

Brent Sadler, a naval warfare and advanced technology expert at the Heritage Foundation, shared what Americans can expect in the Trump administration's war on the cartels.

As the U.S. unleashes a series of lethal strikes on cartel drug boats and President Donald Trump declared an "armed conflict" with the cartels, experts gave insight on what Americans can expect to see next in the "quasi-war" taking place at the country's doorstep.

On Tuesday, Trump announced the U.S. military had carried out another kinetic strike on a suspected drug vessel off the coast of Venezuela, killing six suspected smugglers. This is the fifth of such strikes on a drug boat in the last several weeks and, according to experts, one of the first important steps to decimating the cartels.

The strikes come after the White House sent Congress a memo on Sept. 30 informing them that the U.S. is now participating in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug smugglers. Currently, the U.S. has amassed an impressive collection of naval and air assets stationed around Venezuela, a country whose socialist dictator, Nicolás Maduro, the Trump administration has accused of being in league with cartels.

Experts say these strikes could mark the start of a broader military campaign targeting cartel logistics and command networks.

WAR ON CARTELS? WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT HAS AN IRON-CLAD CASE TO STRIKE NARCO-TERRORIST GROUPS

Speaking with Fox News Digital, Derek Maltz, former acting director of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), called the Trump administration's moves "unprecedented action for an unprecedented threat."

He explained that, unlike in previous administrations, the second Trump administration has enabled a "whole of government" approach to targeting the cartels by designating them as "foreign terrorist organizations." This designation empowers not just agencies like the DEA to take action against the cartels but also the Departments of War, State, Treasury, Justice and others.

"This is not the same old drug crisis we've been talking about for 50 years. This is something totally different. This is a poisoning crisis and our kids are dying," Maltz said, adding, "The cartels are killing more Americans than any other terrorist organization in the history of this country."

In response, Maltz said the president is "building a powerful force of good, an army of good, to help defeat evil and to actually destroy these adversaries that are killing our citizens at record levels."

Maltz said the first step was shutting down the border to stop the flow of fentanyl, meth, cocaine and other drugs, as well as criminal elements into the U.S. overland. This, Maltz explained, pushed the cartels to carry drugs via sea and air routes, which has prompted the Trump administration to crack down on those as well.

He said that next the U.S. will need to hit the cartels' command nodes, either working through international partners like Mexico and El Salvador or, like the drug boat strikes, directly through U.S. military assets.

"Based on everything I've heard, the Mexican government is hitting labs very hard, making more arrests than they had… so they're aggressively going after the cartels. They're removing these really bad guys into America for prosecution."

Brent Sadler, a senior research fellow for naval warfare and advanced technology at the Heritage Foundation's Allison Center for National Security, described the conflict with cartels as a type of "quasi-war" in which the U.S. is fighting against not only non-state, paramilitary-style cartels but also indirectly against international enemies like Venezuela, Hezbollah and China that have been working with the cartels.

"The demonstration of willingness to go and kill these cartel members while they're moving their ships full of drugs sends a chilling effect through their support network," he explained. "And when they start losing that ability to pay off their support network, the business model falls apart and they actually start fighting each other; they turn in on each other."

Sadler said that while the U.S. forces currently appear to be concentrated around Venezuela in the Caribbean, he expects the focus will eventually shift to the cartels' drug routes in the Pacific as well as transatlantic routes to Africa and Europe.

"I would not be surprised if you start to see the military hammer of this or the balance of the military assets shift either to the Pacific. Or if they shift over more to the Central Atlantic to go after these other routes."

He predicted that the sea strikes will continue and that if cartels start to shift to rely more on airplanes, Americans may start to see some of those being "shot out of the sky" in international airspace.

Eventually, he said the strikes will likely be dialed down along with the scale of U.S. naval vessels in the Caribbean. As this happens, he said, the U.S. will likely both leverage its international partners and enable them to interdict drug vessels as well as sustain U.S. special operations capabilities, helicopters and aircraft operating out of Puerto Rico and other bases nearby, to provide overwatch and the ability to intercept ships.

Both Sadler and Maltz emphasized the importance of hitting the cartels from every angle, using every available partner and government agency, even education.

"We have to teach. We have to do a lot more work on the demand side," said Maltz.

He predicted that, once confirmed, Sara Carter, Trump's pick for the head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, would "initiate a lot of educational programs" designed to educate on the dangers of the new drugs being pushed by cartels and other foreign adversaries.

"We can hit boats, and we can go after command and control. But if we don't teach our kids and our parents in this country about this devastating crisis with these very, very dangerous, lethal substances that we've never seen in this country in history, then they're going to continue to find ways to get this stuff in here," said Maltz.

Why A House of Dynamite is so damn scary.

There's no shortage of things that could end the world. But between climate change, risks from AI, and biological threats like pandemics, we seem to be forgetting about one human-made existential risk that has been with us for 80 years: the ever-present possibility of nuclear warfare.

But nuclear war hasn't forgotten about us.

“Because of extraordinary luck over 80 years, despite many close calls and near-misses, there hasn't been a detonation of nuclear weapons,” Elise Rowan, the deputy vice president of communications at the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), told me over email. “Every concern that is top of mind for Americans right now…could be eclipsed by a snap decision under pressure or even an accident.”

Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

That makes the new film A House of Dynamite the perfect movie for the moment.

Directed by Kathryn Bigelow for Netflix — out in select theaters now, and streaming on the service beginning October 24 — the film is divided into three acts that follow government workers, military officials, and finally the president himself (played by Idris Elba) in the roughly 18 minutes that pass between the detection of a nuclear missile launch over the Pacific and its arrival in Chicago.

The day starts like any other. Coworkers flirt and bicker. They make small talk about sports, kids, and snacking habits. A senior officer (Rebecca Ferguson) in the White House Situation Room, which provides 24/7 intelligence updates and decision support to US national security officials, chides a colleague for waiting until that night to propose marriage to his longtime girlfriend. Everything is normal until it isn't.

Even then, it takes minutes for the tension to mount, for the unthinkable to become thinkable. Soldiers in a remote Alaska base initially think it's a North Korean missile test that will land harmlessly in the Pacific.

After all, a real nuclear attack would probably involve hundreds of missiles, including decoys. That's how the Soviet air force officer Stanislov Petrov realized that the five American nuclear missiles heading toward the Soviet Union in 1983 were actually a false alarm caused by malfunctioning early-warning satellites. Petrov's good judgment — he decided not to report the finding up the military chain, which would have led to retaliation per Soviet doctrine — is how we avoided all-out nuclear war by way of Soviet retaliation.

Someone in the film naturally mentions the Petrov case. The US launches its anti-missile defense system from that base in Alaska. It's like hitting a bullet with a bullet, one character explains. “This is going to be the second-most exciting thing that happens today,” the senior officer in the Situation Room reassures the colleague planning to propose to his girlfriend.

But the interceptor fails to destroy the missile, which remains inbound for Chicago and its metro population of 10 million people. It's only after the fact that top officials learn that the defense systems charged with keeping the homeland safe from just such a strike have just a 61 percent chance of success. In real life, it's around a 55 percent success rate — and that's under controlled conditions.

“So it's a fucking coin toss?” the defense secretary (Jared Harris) exclaims. “That's what $50 billion buys us?”

That's plan A. And when it fails, there's no plan B.

What this shows, Rowan told me, is that the nuclear defense system “demands perfection from people and machines 100 percent of the time. And that's just not realistic.”

(Disclosure: I worked at NTI for two years on the Global Biological Policy and Programs team. I learned a lot about nuclear risks through osmosis, but my focus was on pandemic prevention, bioweapons deterrence, and biotechnology governance. I did not work on “nuclear pandemics,” as my uncle once asked me.)

Back to the movie. With the minutes ticking down, the military chief of the US Strategic Command advocates for a preemptive counterstrike, even though the US doesn't know who fired the missile or why, and even though doing so would mean the 10 million Americans who will die in the Chicago strike will only be the first to perish.

But it almost certainly wouldn't end there. Further retaliations could lead to the death of billions, perhaps spark nuclear winter, and potentially spell humanity's end.

What comes across in A House of Dynamite is that no one, in this most important moment in history, seems to be in control.

While it's impossible not to watch the film without nauseously picturing Donald Trump, who has the sole power to order a nuclear attack as the president, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in charge, it may not make a difference.

The experts, the president, the “other side” as far as we can tell from a brief conversation with the Russian foreign minister — everyone seems basically at a loss. It's not a matter of skill or nerve; nearly everyone does their job as best they can.

In the end, we never even learn who fired the missile. North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran are floated as possibilities. The movie doesn't tell us if the launch was a purposeful attack or an accident, an isolated incident or part of a coordinated campaign. I don't see my childhood home in the Chicago suburbs get vaporized. It's even possible that the missile doesn't detonate at all — that can happen. But even if it doesn't destroy the Chicagoland area, causing millions of deaths, the US might still respond preemptively, leading to an all-out nuclear war all the same.

The ambiguity, while narratively frustrating, is the point. It's not possible for us to know all of this in just the 18 minutes the intercontinental ballistic missile allows, just as it's not possible for the president to make a meaningfully informed decision on how to respond in that time. When presented with a menu of escalating retaliation options — “rare, medium, and well-done,” someone quips darkly — the president says he's ready to give the order. We don't see the results.

The film highlights how our approach to nuclear risks has changed since the Cold War. Things were simpler in those “us versus them” Cold War days, if not any less dangerous. But the world has since gotten multipolar. There are (at least) nine nuclear powers to keep track of, and emerging technologies like AI enhance the risks.

“I hope this film gets a new generation interested and engaged in nuclear issues,” Heather Williams, the director of the Project on Nuclear Issues at the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), told me by email. “There are still thousands of nuclear weapons in the world and some countries are still engaging in nuclear saber-rattling — the threat hasn't gone away.”

It's not all doom and gloom, though: In 1986, there were 70,000 nuclear weapons. There are 12,000 today — an 80 percent reduction of the world's total nukes. But for the first time in 40 years, that number is expected to increase. More countries want to add nukes to their arsenals, and the last verifiable limits on nuclear weapons in Russia and the US are going to expire in February.

So things are heading in the wrong direction. “We need the same level of public outcry that led to reductions and [nuclear weapon] verification measures that have made the world safer,” Rowan said. “People have power on this issue — they just have to reclaim it.”

The argument for having nukes is that they may deter conventional warfare as devastating as World War II. But you can't have deterrence in a world wiped out by nuclear apocalypse.

Fox News' Madison Scarpino reports from Tennessee on the task force's progress and what residents are saying about the federal effort to reduce crime.

The Trump administration's deployment of federal law enforcement officers to one of Tennessee's bluest cities has been welcomed as a much-needed reprieve by local police struggling with increased staffing shortages and astronomical crime rates.

Last month, President Donald Trump signed a memorandum mobilizing federal law enforcement agents to Memphis in an effort to combat crime rates and restore safety to the community. The task force includes federal agencies such as the FBI, ATF and Homeland Security Investigations joining the Tennessee National Guard, and is modeled after the deployment of officers in Washington, D.C. 

"The city of Memphis, Tennessee, is suffering from tremendous levels of violent crime that have overwhelmed its local government's ability to respond effectively," the president wrote.

The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

The memorandum is supported by Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who maintains command of the Guard troops deployed to the city, and comes amid the FBI releasing new 2024 data revealing Memphis had the highest violent crime rate in the country. 

Trump pointed to data from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation that revealed Memphis saw an increase in violent crimes reported in 2024 – marking a startling shift from the national trend suggesting crime numbers are down throughout the country.

The city also saw about 1,250 violent crime incidents per 50,000 people last year, more than doubling Nashville's average and quadrupling the state average, according to WSMV. 

In 2025, Memphis has recorded 161 homicides, with Trump revealing the city's homicide rate is higher than Chicago, Detroit, Washington, D.C., and other high-crime cities throughout the country.

The administration also looked at data showing Memphis' murder rates are approximately four times higher than Mexico City and 27 times higher than Havana, suggesting the city is more dangerous than areas abroad with elevated crime rates.

However, the Memphis Police Department has disputed the narrative that the city is plagued by crime.

"Murder is at a six-year low, aggravated assault at a five-year low and sexual assault at a 20-year low," the MPD said in a press release. 

The MPD did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

While city data shows the murder rate is down 21% since 2024, the numbers appear to encompass statistics from each calendar year – with 2025's full breakdown hinging on the completion of the year. 

Scottie DeLashmit, president of the Tennessee State Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, insists the move protects officers throughout the city at a time when the local police department is dealing with staffing shortages and low morale due to what he believes is relaxed bail policies.

"Our president has decided that he's coming to Memphis to try to bring law and order to [the city]," DeLashmit told Fox News Digital. "This is what we're told, which I think is a great idea. However, if we don't get a better prosecutor in Memphis, all we're doing is putting extra officers in danger."

"If we don't prosecute the criminals once they are arrested, we just say, ‘OK, here's a signature bond,' and you're out and gone. What good is that officer's duties? That criminal is back on the street before the officer gets through doing the paperwork." 

The Trump administration also pointed to Shelby County's newly implemented bail policies in the presidential memorandum. 

"In 2022, Shelby County overhauled its bail system at the behest of its Soros-funded District Attorney, instituting secured cash bail ‘only as a last resort' and relying on a system that often results in no bail," the memo reads.  

The Shelby County District Attorney's Office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

DeLashmit also discussed the crisis surrounding officer staffing and the work environment for police, adding that the Shelby County District Attorney's policies surrounding releasing arrestees and the city's "no-pursuit" policy are "pretty disheartening" for those patrolling the streets. 

"In Memphis, people will run for this for any reason just because they know Memphis officers aren't going to chase them, because they have a no-pursuit policy," DeLashmit told Fox News Digital. "Not that you should pursue simple traffic [violations]. But if you do a heinous crime, such as kidnapping, rape or robbery, you should be able to chase for that." 

DeLashmit welcomes the Trump administration's pursuit of restoring safety in Memphis by deploying federal law enforcement officers, while highlighting the real-world obstacles local police are currently facing. 

"The officers are working a tremendous amount of overtime, which means they are tired [and] their skills are not going to be 100%," DeLashmit said, adding that the response time for backup officers is also lengthened and therefore "not a safe environment" for the city's citizens.

The first troops began arriving in Memphis on Sept. 29, and have since made hundreds of arrests and issued more than 2,800 traffic citations, federal officials told The Associated Press. 

As the city continues to collaborate with the Trump administration, DeLashmit hopes the move will not only bring more officers back to work, but will reinforce a sense of security throughout Memphis that he believes has long been lost. 

"When I was growing up, [Memphis] was a safer city," he said. "It was polite. You could walk anywhere, and hopefully we'll get back to that. I know times have changed and I'm not naïve. I know it won't be the way it was 30 years ago, but maybe we can go back to where it's at least safe to walk down the street without fear of being shot."

Democrats are using a $20 billion lifeline to Argentina to claim Republicans care more about bailing out foreign governments than helping Americans at home.

The messaging, a riff on President Donald Trump's “America First” policy agenda, intensified ahead of a White House visit by Argentinian President Javier Milei on Tuesday, where Trump said the United States would “be there” for Argentina, so long as Milei succeeds in midterm elections set to take place later this month.

Democrats have variously framed the bailout as an affront to American farmers, as Argentina sells its soybean crops at “manipulative prices” to China, as well as average voters who fear rising healthcare costs.

The latter argument marks a new wrinkle in a shutdown fight with Republicans as Democrats demand an extension of premium Obamacare subsidies to reopen the government, which shuttered over the demands on Oct. 1.

“If this administration has $20 billion to spare for a MAGA-friendly foreign government, how can they say we don't have the money to lower healthcare costs?” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said on the Senate floor.

TRUMP MAKES ARGENTINE CURRENCY SWAP CONTINGENT ON MILEI WIN

The Democratic talking point, made in the halls of Congress and a Democratic National Committee press call on Tuesday, reflects an attempt to turn Trump's signature policy doctrine against him.

Trump has used the “America First” mantra to encapsulate his agenda, from a crackdown on illegal immigration to his demands that NATO contribute more to its own self-defense. But the financial assistance for Argentina, structured in the form of a currency swap, has torn at the president's MAGA support and frustrated business groups that noted Argentina, an agricultural rival, sold shipments of soybeans to China as talk of a bailout became public.

Trump defended the economic package at the White House on Tuesday, arguing that the U.S. benefits from the Milei government staying in power. He represents a libertarian break from the socialist policies of other regional governments and has forged a closer relationship with the White House.

“It's just helping a great philosophy take over a great country,” Trump told reporters. “We don't have to do it. It's not going to make a big difference for our country, but it will in terms of South America.”

Democrats nonetheless see the issue as a liability for Trump, whose strikes on Iran and loose commitment to Ukraine have also rankled supporters.

On Tuesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) attempted to pass a bill, the “No Argentina Bailout Act,” to keep the Treasury Department from performing the currency swap, before her attempt was blocked by Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC).

“It is shameful that President Trump is propping up a foreign government, while he shuts down our own,” Warren said in a floor speech.

The message represents the latest attempt to move Republicans off their shutdown position – a clean funding extension with no policy changes attached. The House passed a bill last month that would keep the government operating through Nov. 21, but it has failed in the Senate eight times as Democrats use the funding cliff as leverage.

TRUMP BLUNTS GOP'S SHUTDOWN LEVERAGE WITH WELFARE AND MILITARY CARVEOUTS

Beyond the shutdown, Democrats have been using Trump's foreign policy to weaken his standing ahead of the midterm elections next year. His tariffs, in particular, have been wrapped into a broader critique that Republicans will send prices higher for consumers.

Trump and congressional Republicans made the same case successfully in November, when Democrats were swept out of power in the face of decades-high inflation.

President Donald Trump turned his attention on Tuesday to criminal behavior in Boston after multiple deployments of National Guard troops to cities throughout the country to help reduce crime. 

Trump suggested he might order the removal of the 2026 World Cup games from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, home of the NFL's New England Patriots. 

In a Tuesday meeting with Argentine President Javier Milei at the White House, Trump cited “unsafe conditions” in Boston. He mentioned recent violent car meets in Boston earlier this month, one of which left a police department cruiser destroyed by fire. 

The car meetups have been deemed “staged attacks” and organized through social media and group messaging platforms, local prosecutors said. 

“These street takeovers are not spontaneous events but are preplanned and coordinated through social media platforms and group messaging applications,” said Lisa Deacutis, assistant district attorney at the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office. “Participants share meeting points, times, and driving routes in advance to allow large numbers to join intersections before police arrive.”

The president claimed that “they're taking over parts of Boston” before stating, “But we could get them back in about two seconds.”

Trump was also critical of Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, calling her “radical left” and saying he was not pleased with her response to the violence.

​​”I think she is hurting Boston,” Trump said. “The answer is yes. If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, let's move it to another location, if I thought Boston was going to cause safety conditions for the World Cup. I could say the same thing for the Olympics.”

Wu's office issued a statement in response to Trump's comments. It did not mention the president's remarks but emphasized its excitement about Boston holding the event.

“Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions,” the statement read.

When the corroded pipeline burst in 2015, inky crude spread along the Southern California coast, becoming the state's worst oil spill in decades.

More than 140,000 gallons (3,300 barrels) of oil gushed out, blackening beaches for 150 miles (240 kilometers) from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles, polluting a biologically rich habitat for endangered whales and sea turtles, killing scores of pelicans, seals and dolphins, and decimating the fishing industry.

Plains All American Pipeline in 2022 agreed to a $230 million settlement with fishers and coastal property owners without admitting liability. Federal inspectors found that the Houston-based company failed to quickly detect the rupture and responded too slowly. It faced an uphill battle to build a new pipeline.

Three decades-old drilling platforms were subsequently shuttered, but another Texas-based fossil fuel company supported by the Trump administration purchased the operation and is intent on pumping oil through the pipeline again. 

Sable Offshore Corp., headquartered in Houston, is facing a slew of legal challenges but is determined to restart production, even if that means confining it to federal waters, where state regulators have virtually no say. California controls the 3 miles (5 kilometers) nearest to shore. The platforms are 5 to 9 miles (8 to 14 kilometers) offshore.

The Trump administration has hailed Sable's plans as the kind of project the president wants to increase U.S. energy production as the federal government removes regulatory barriers. President Donald Trump has directed Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to undo his predecessor's ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts. 

“This project risks another environmental disaster in California at a time when demand for oil is going down and the climate crisis is escalating,” said Alex Katz, executive director of Environmental Defense Center, the Santa Barbara group formed in response to a massive spill in 1969.

The environmental organization is among several suing Sable. 

“Our concern is that there is no way to make this pipeline safe and that this company has proven that it cannot be trusted to operate safely, responsibly or even legally,” he said.

Actor and activist Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who lives in the area, has implored officials to stop Sable, saying at a March protest: “I can smell a rat. And this project is a rat.”

The California Coastal Commission fined Sable a record $18 million for ignoring cease-and-desist orders over repair work it says was done without permits. Sable said it has permits from the previous owner, Exxon Mobil, and sued the commission while work continued on the pipeline. In June, a state judge ordered it to stop while the case proceeds through the court. The commission and Sable are due back in court Wednesday. 

“This fly-by-night oil company has repeatedly abused the public's trust, racking up millions of dollars in fines and causing environmental damage along the treasured Gaviota Coast,” a state park south of Santa Barbara, said Joshua Smith, the commission's spokesman.

So far, Sable is undeterred. 

The California Attorney General's office sued Sable this month, saying it illegally discharged waste into waterways, and disregarded state law requiring permits before work along the pipeline route that crosses sensitive wildlife habitat.

“Sable placed profits over environmental protection in its rush to get oil on the market,” the agency said in its lawsuit. 

Last month, the Santa Barbara District Attorney filed felony criminal charges against Sable, also accusing it of polluting waterways and harming wildlife.

Sable said it has fully cooperated with local and state agencies, including the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and called the district attorney's allegation “inflammatory and extremely misleading.” It said a biologist and state fire marshal officials oversaw the work, and no wildlife was harmed. 

The company is seeking $347 million for the delays, and says if the state blocks it from restarting the onshore pipeline system, it will use a floating facility that would keep its entire operation in federal waters and use tankers to transport the oil to markets outside California. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, the company updated its plan to include the option. 

The U.S. Interior Department's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said in July it was working with Sable to bring a second rig online. 

“President Trump made it clear that American energy should come from American resources,” the agency's deputy director Kenny Stevens said in a statement then, heralding the “comeback story for Pacific production.”

The agency said there are an estimated 190 million barrels (6 billion gallons) of recoverable oil reserves in the area, nearly 80% of residual Pacific reserves. It noted advancements in preventing and preparing for oil spills and said the failed pipeline has been rigorously tested. 

“Continuous monitoring and improved technology significantly reduce the risk of a similar incident occurring in the future,” the agency said. 

On May 19 — the 10th anniversary of the disaster — CEO Jim Flores announced that Sable “is proud to have safely and responsibly achieved first production at the Santa Ynez Unit” — which includes three rigs in federal waters, offshore and onshore pipelines, and the Las Flores Canyon Processing Facility.

State officials countered that the company had only conducted testing and not commercial production. Sable's stock price dropped and some investors sued, alleging they were misled.

Sable purchased the Santa Ynez Unit from Exxon Mobil in 2024 for nearly $650 million primarily with a loan from Exxon. Exxon sold the shuttered operation after losing a court battle in 2023 to truck the crude through central California while the pipeline system was rebuilt or repaired. 

Flores said well tests at the Platform Harmony rig indicate there is much oil to be extracted and that it will relieve California's gas prices — among the nation's highest — by stabilizing supplies.

“Sable is very concerned about the crumbling energy complex in California,” Flores said in a statement to The Associated Press. “With the exit of two refineries last year and more shuttering soon, California's economy cannot survive without the strong energy infrastructure it enjoyed for the last 150 years.”

California has been reducing the state's production of fossil fuels in favor of clean energy for years. The movement has been spearheaded partly by Santa Barbara County, where elected officials voted in May to begin taking steps to phase out onshore oil and gas operations.

WASHINGTON (AP) — After months of aggressive immigration enforcement measures from the Trump administration, Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander adults are more likely to hold a negative view of President Donald Trump's handling of immigration, a new AAPI Data/AP-NORC poll finds.

About 7 in 10 AAPI adults nationwide disapprove of Trump's approach on immigration, according to the survey from AAPI Data and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, an increase from 58% in March. The new poll also finds that a solid majority of AAPI adults say the Republican president has overstepped on deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, and most oppose several specific tactics used by the administration, such as using the military and National Guard to carry out arrests or deportations.

The findings come as federal immigration agents expand a crackdown in the Chicago area, where more than 1,000 immigrants have been arrested since last month. The escalation in Chicago is just part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to boost deportations, which has been a high priority for the president since he took office at the beginning of the year. 

This approach does not seem to be landing well among AAPI adults, a diverse and rapidly growing group where many were born outside the U.S. Even among foreign-born AAPI adults, who tend to be more conservative, most disapprove of the president's handling of immigration. 

Joie Meyer, 25, was born in China and adopted as an infant. The Miami resident, who identifies as a Democrat, supports secure borders but Trump's recent actions have made her wonder what would happen if she suddenly lost her citizenship. 

“If I was at risk of like being stripped away from my home, family, friends, everything I knew because of like a technicality, which is what some people are facing, that's just heartbreaking,” Meyer said, adding that she finds Trump's methods “punitive.”

AAPI adults are particularly likely to think Trump has crossed a line on immigration enforcement. About two-thirds say Trump has “gone too far” when it comes to deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, compared to about 6 in 10 Black and Hispanic adults in a separate AP-NORC poll conducted in September. In that survey, less than half of white adults thought Trump had overstepped on immigration. 




The finding, combined with AAPI adults' increased disapproval of Trump on immigration, signals that the president's handling of the issue over the past few months may have turned some people off. Some may be finding “a big difference in terms of what policy support looks like in theory and how it plays out,” said Karthick Ramakrishnan, AAPI Data executive director and researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.

Immigration is frequently in the local news for 38-year-old Peter Lee of Tacoma, Washington, where there is an active Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center. He sees Trump as hastily meeting deportation quotas without compassion.

“One, there doesn't seem to be a clear game plan for what he's doing in terms of immigration enforcement other than just pure numbers. Second it seems like his directives come from just gut, not fact-based,” said Lee, a Democrat, who is Korean American. “The fact that he's deporting people to third-party countries not of their origin, I think that it's ridiculous.”

American-born and foreign-born AAPI adults are equally likely to think Trump has overstepped on immigration overall. But they're more divided on issues related to illegal immigration.

Just over half of foreign-born AAPI adults, who tend to be older and more conservative than other AAPI adults, support deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who have been charged with misdemeanors, compared to 41% of American-born AAPI adults. AAPI adults who were born outside the U.S. are also more likely than American-born AAPI adults to support deporting all immigrants who are in the country illegally.

More than half of AAPI adults are foreign-born, Ramakrishnan said, adding that American-born AAPI adults may be less “attuned in terms of what it takes to maintain one's status.”

Tyrone Tai, 65, who has homes in Tampa and Lauderhill, Florida, was born in Jamaica. The half-Chinese and half-Jamaican immigrated with his parents to New York City when he was 12. He recalls how they struggled but eventually gained U.S. citizenship. He indicated Trump has “not gone far enough” when it comes to arresting those who “jump the line.” 

AAPI adults who were born outside the U.S. are more likely than American-born AAPI adults to approve of Trump's handling of immigration, although they still don't rate him especially highly on the issue. They're also more likely to approve of his handling of crime, suggesting that the president's efforts to link illegal immigration with crime may be resonating with some among this group.

Some of the Trump administration's tactics are particularly unpopular among AAPI adults, the poll found. For example, about 6 in 10 AAPI adults oppose conducting large-scale immigration enforcement operations in neighborhoods with high populations of immigrants, deploying the military or National Guard to carry out arrests and deportations, detaining immigrants at their workplaces, or allowing agents to cover their faces during arrests. 

Videos of ICE officers wearing masks and snatching people while they are at work or on a public street has rattled Michael Ida, a 56-year-old resident of Honolulu. An independent and Christian, Ida believes that some immigrants in the country illegally may deserve to stay.

“When it comes down to justice or mercy, we should err on the side of mercy. It's very disturbing to me,” Ida said. “As an Asian American especially, I feel like there's a little bit of anxiety to travel outside of Hawaii.”

Tai, however, says that ICE agents should be allowed to wear masks.

“Those poor ICE agents, they're doing their job there and people are basically threatening their families. That shouldn't be,” Tai said. 

Ida, who is half Korean and half Japanese, sees parallels with World War II, when in 1942 the U.S. government began forcing Japanese Americans from their homes and into incarceration camps. 

“History doesn't repeat but it rhymes. There's kind of echoes of what happened in the past.” 

___

The poll of 1,027 U.S. adults who are Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders was conducted from Sept 2-9, 2025, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based Amplify AAPI Panel, designed to be representative of the Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 5.0 percentage points.

Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) took aim at Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) on Tuesday for refusing to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva amid the prolonged government shutdown.

“Speaker Johnson is just a little creep, and he's acting like a creep when it comes to this,” Gallego said on MSNBC, adding that the Republican leader is constantly changing his reasoning for not swearing in the Democratic congresswoman-elect.

Johnson has attributed the delay to the shutdown, which prevents the House from participating in a full legislative session. The House is currently in recess while the Senate debates each party's short-term funding resolution.

The House speaker says it is typically customary to swear in members-elect when the full House is present for legislative business, although he did swear in two Florida Republicans during a brief pro forma session in April because their families were in town.

Gallego said Johnson is potentially motivated by the bipartisan discharge petition that would force a full vote on the release of the files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The petition needs at least 218 signatures before the matter can be taken to a vote.

Grijalva intends to sign the petition, which is one signature short of the threshold.

“He is doing this because he wants to cover up for the president and the pedophiles on Epstein's list,” Gallego said, “and the only way that he can do that is to make sure that Adelita Grijalva doesn't become the 218th person to sign this discharge petition. That's it. That's the only reason why.”

Earlier Tuesday, Gallego and Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) approached Johnson on Capitol Hill to discuss Grijalva's situation.

“You just keep coming up with excuses,” Gallego told Johnson while reporters recorded the encounter.

In response, the speaker said his decision not to swear in Grijalva had “nothing to do with Epstein,” and that the allegation was “totally absurd.” He also called the confrontation a “publicity stunt.”

Grijalva won the special election late last month to succeed her late father, Raul Grijalva. Arizona state officials certified her victory on Tuesday, and they threatened to pursue legal action against Johnson if he fails to swear in Adelita Grijalva or provide a “reasonable explanation” as to when the ceremony will occur.

“Ms. Grijalva was elected with nearly 70% of the vote, and unofficial results were provided to you by the Arizona Secretary of State,” Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes wrote in a letter. “Ms. Grijalva and the State expected that you would follow your usual practice and swear her into office at the earliest opportunity, just as you had done with five previous members elected in special elections.”

“You and your staff have provided ever-shifting, unsatisfactory, and sometimes absurd stories as to why Ms. Grijalva has not been sworn in,” she added. “Arizona's right to a full delegation, and the right of the residents of [Arizona's 7th congressional district] to representation from the person they recently voted for, are not up for debate and may not be delayed or used as leverage in negotiations about unrelated legislation.”

Other Democrats beyond those in Arizona are also calling on Johnson to act.

ARIZONA OFFICIALS THREATEN JOHNSON WITH LEGAL ACTION IF HE DOES NOT SWEAR IN GRIJALVA

“Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva should be sworn in now,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) previously told reporters. “It should have happened this week, should have happened last week. It needs to happen next week.”

Notably, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) took 25 days to swear in Rep. Julia Letlow (R-LA), who won a 2021 special election to replace her late husband. It's been 21 days since Adelita Grijalva won her special election.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Dallin H. Oaks, a former Utah Supreme Court justice, was named Tuesday as the new president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its more than 17 million members worldwide. 

Oaks' selection to lead what is widely known as the Mormon church follows the recent death of his 101-year-old predecessor, Russell M. Nelson. His ascension is not a surprise; a longstanding church policy says the longest-tenured member of a top leadership body called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles becomes the next president. The tradition is meant to ensure a seamless transition and prevent internal or public lobbying.

“I accept with humility the responsibility that God has placed upon me and commit my whole heart and soul to the service to which I've been called,” Oaks said.

As president, he is considered a prophet and seer who will guide the church through divine revelation from God alongside two top counselors and members of the Quorum of the Twelve. He'll set policy and oversee the church's many business interests.

The church's leadership transition comes as many of its members have been shaken by a deadly attack on a Michigan congregation, and are grappling with the high-profile assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah, where the denomination is based.

At 93, Oaks will be one of the church's oldest presidents. He will serve in the role until he dies. Tenures for past presidents have varied, with the longest reaching nearly 30 years and the shortest being just nine months.




Experts are doubtful Oaks will pivot sharply from Nelson's approach to leadership because he was one of Nelson's closest advisers. But they say he might shift from Nelson's focus on the faith's global footprint to domestic issues. 

In the first significant difference from Nelson's presidency, Oaks announced during the faith's recent general conference that the church will slow the announcement of new temples.

For his top counselors, Oaks selected Henry B. Eyring, 92, who also served in that role for Nelson, and former lawyer D. Todd Christofferson, 80, the church's seventh most senior apostle. 

Oaks' choices demonstrate his “deliberate and methodical leadership style,” said Paul Reeve, Simmons Chair of Mormon Studies at the University of Utah. While Christofferson was a somewhat unexpected choice, Reeve said it makes sense that the former Utah Supreme Court justice known for his jurist sensibilities would pick a former lawyer.

“I confess that this is not what I expected when I woke up this morning,” Christofferson said during Tuesday's announcement. “But I am deeply honored by this calling and the trust that it carries.”

While serving on a lower leadership panel in the 1990s, Christofferson was involved in negotiations with Jewish leaders regarding the church's posthumous baptisms of Holocaust victims. In 1994, following intense criticism from the Jewish community, the church agreed to end those ceremonial baptisms. After it was revealed that they continued, church leaders reiterated in 2012 that the practice was not allowed.

Jeffrey R. Holland, 84, the most senior apostle after Oaks — and thus next in line to be president — was not selected as a counselor but will lead the Quorum of the Twelve. “The concern there is declining health,” Reeve explained.

Oaks is also known for his traditionalist beliefs on marriage and religious freedom. He has been a driving force in the church against same-sex marriage and in upholding a teaching that homosexuality is a sin — a position that causes uneasiness among some LGBTQ+ members and their allies.

He said in 2022 that social and legal pressure would not influence the church to change its posture on same-sex marriage and matters of gender identity. 

In recent years, Oaks has been part of some key church moves that suggest he might not make the topic a centerpiece of his administration, experts say. Oaks was Nelson's closest adviser in 2019 when Nelson rescinded a policy that banned baptisms for children of gay parents and labeled same-sex couples as sinners eligible for expulsion.

Christofferson, who has a gay brother, was the apostle who church leaders put forward to explain and justify the ban back in 2015. At the time, his brother had recently rejoined the church after ending a lengthy relationship with his same-sex partner.

Oaks has also been a strong advocate for civil public discourse. Early on as an apostle, he was involved in a crackdown on far-right extremism that resulted in some excommunications. In 2020, he gave a speech about having faith in elections without resorting to radicalism or violence.

A Florida judge ruled on Tuesday to temporarily block the transfer of land in downtown Miami to be used for President Donald Trump's future presidential library.

The decision stems from a lawsuit filed last week by a Miami historian and racial activist who took issue with the Miami Dade College Board of Trustees' Sept. 23 vote to hand over 2.63 acres of land worth more than $67 million to Florida. Marvin Dunn, the plaintiff, alleges the board didn't provide sufficient notice for its meeting on the land transfer, arguing that the lack of public notice is in violation of state law.

Judicial Circuit Judge Mavel Ruiz agreed with Dunn's claim, determined he is likely to win the case, and ruled that the public college can't cede the land in the meantime.

“The court does not believe that the notice was reasonable,” she said after a Tuesday court hearing, adding that the case is not “rooted in politics.”

Dunn's attorney argued the case was rather about the board's alleged noncompliance with Florida's Government in the Sunshine Act, which requires meetings and records to be open to the public to ensure transparency.

“The people have a right to know what they're going to decide to do when the transaction is so significant, so unusual, and deprives the students and the college of this land,” the plaintiff's lawyer said.

The college board issued a public notice before the Sept. 23 meeting, stating that the purpose was to “discuss potential real estate transactions.” However, the notice did not specify which property would be discussed or disclose the purpose of the transaction.

The meeting also wasn't livestreamed, unlike previous meetings this year.

One week after the board meeting, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) and his Cabinet voted to transfer the land to the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Foundation. DeSantis announced plans for Trump's presidential library on the same day as the board voted to give up the land to the state.

An attorney for the college maintained the Board of Trustees complied with state law and questioned Dunn's political motivations in filing the case, considering it is related to Trump.

TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY PLANS IN MIAMI HIT WITH LAWSUIT OVER TRANSPARENCY CONCERNS

Tuesday's preliminary injunction comes one day after Ruiz declined to immediately bar Miami Dade College from deeding the land. She was concerned that Dunn had not yet established the right to sue by demonstrating his citizenship in Florida. On Monday, Dunn's legal team said their client's paperwork had not been fully processed due to office closures on Columbus Day.

There is no set time frame for the presidential library's construction or opening, but a more concrete plan is expected to be finalized in the next four years. The National Archives and Records Administration will launch a website dedicated to the presidential library on Jan. 20, 2029, when Trump's second term will end.

Young Republicans leaders across the nation have exchanged racist texts that have been leaked in a new report, landing the New York GOP in the crossfire.

The Telegram messages, first reported by Politico, highlighted messages written by Young Republicans in New York, Kansas, Arizona, and Vermont. Among the messages, people labeled black people monkeys and “the watermelon people” and also called for rape against their political opponents, among other examples.

The New York State Young Republicans group was the most vocal in the group chat. In one instance, one of the group's leaders said, “I love Hitler,” and mused about placing their enemies in gas chambers. Another leader in the New York GOP group wondered about the possibility of the chat getting leaked.

In the hours since the report was published, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) denounced the messages and Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) over her previous praise of the state's Young Republicans. Stefanik and other New York Republicans have condemned the messages.

When asked by a reporter whether the messages reflect “some bad apples,” Hochul excoriated Republicans and suggested they are condoning the behavior.

“Some bad apples? These are the future of the Republican Party,” the Democratic governor answered. “This is so vile it is hard to find the words to put into context that these are people who are part of a political party — one of two major parties — and they believe in gas chambers and rape and discrimination based on the color of people's skin. These are racist, sexist, disgusting remarks.”

Hochul then criticized Stefanik for labeling New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani a “jihadist” and “terrorist,” called on Republicans to do a “reexamination” of their rhetoric, and floated possible punishments for the Young Republican leaders who wrote the hateful messages.

“Kick them out of the party. Take away their official roles. Stop using them as campaign advisers,” she said. “There needs to be consequences. This bulls*** has to stop.”

Stefanik previously described the New York State Young Republicans as “the backbone of our party.” The congresswoman is also tied to the group through an award she was gifted in August.

“As the proud representative of NY's 21st District, and the House Republican Leadership Chair, I am honored to receive the distinguished designation of Congresswoman of the Year!” Stefanik said in a statement at the time. “I want to thank Bobby Walker, Peter Giunta, and all of the hardworking Young Republicans who are the backbone of our party, for all the work they do to ensure Republican victories up and down the ballot in New York.”

Bobby Walker and Peter Giunta were two of the leaders who exchanged some of the texts that are now under scrutiny.

Hochul's campaign called on Stefanik to return the award following the report.

“Elise Stefanik can't hide behind staff to denounce the antisemitic, racist, hateful individuals she endorsed, funded, and praised as the ‘backbone' of the Republican Party,” a spokesperson for Hochul's campaign said, per Politico. “These are her people who said ‘I love Hitler' and named her their congresswoman of the year — an award she still hasn't returned. Stefanik's silence tells New Yorkers where she stands and who she stands with.”

In response to her connections to the group, Stefanik's campaign committee noted she has never employed any member of the group chat.

NEW YORK CITY GOP BACKS MICHAEL HENRY'S CAMPAIGN FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL AGAINST LETITIA JAMES

Alex deGrasse, a senior adviser to Stefanik, told the Washington Examiner, “Kathy Hochul's endorsed candidate Zohran Mamdani is an Antisemite Defund the Police Communist who embraces and campaigns with terrorists who say 9/11 was justified, say Israel doesn't have the right to exist as a Jewish state, and say he will arrest Netanyahu. And Kathy Hochul not only supports him, she endorsed him.”

On the subject of the Young Republicans group chat, deGrasse continued, “Congresswoman Stefanik was absolutely appalled to learn about the alleged comments made by leaders of the New York State Young Republicans and other state YRs in a large national group chat. According to the description provided by Politico, the comments were heinous, antisemitic, racist and unacceptable. While none have ever been employed  by Congresswoman Stefanik, if the description by Politico is accurate, Congresswoman Stefanik calls for any NY Young Republicans responsible for these horrific comments in this chat to step down immediately. Unlike Kathy Hochul who bends the knee and refuses to condemn the vile antisemitism spewed by leading NY Democrat candidates like Mamdani every single day, Congresswoman Stefanik will call out vile hate and demand accountability.”

Stefanik hasn't yet entered next year's race for governor of New York, although she is expected to make an announcement after next month's elections. Until then, she is raising money for a possible gubernatorial bid. Meanwhile, Hochul is preparing to launch her reelection campaign.

A Florida judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked the planned transfer of prime downtown Miami land for President Donald Trump's future presidential library.

The move by Circuit Judge Mavel Ruiz came after a Miami activist alleged that officials at a local college violated Florida's open government law when they gifted the sizable plot of real estate to the state, which then voted to transfer it to the foundation for the planned library.

“This is not an easy decision,” Mavel said Tuesday when explaining her ruling from the bench, finding that the college didn't give the public reasonable notice ahead of the vote last month.

“This is not a case, at least for this court, rooted in politics,” she added. 

The nearly 3-acre (1.2-hectare) property is a developer's dream and is valued at more than $67 million, according to a 2025 assessment by the Miami-Dade County property appraiser. One real estate expert wagered that the parcel — one of the last undeveloped lots on an iconic stretch of palm tree-lined Biscayne Boulevard — could sell for hundreds of millions of dollars more.

Marvin Dunn, an activist and chronicler of local Black history, filed a lawsuit this month in a Miami-Dade County court against the Board of Trustees for Miami Dade College, a state-run school that owned the property. He alleged that the board violated Florida's Government in the Sunshine law by not providing sufficient notice for its special meeting on Sept. 23, when it voted to give up the land.

An agenda released ahead of the meeting simply stated the board would consider conveying property to a state fund overseen by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet, but provided no details on which piece of property was being considered or why. Unlike every other meeting the board has held this year, the 8 a.m. meeting on Sept. 23 was not livestreamed.

A week later, DeSantis and other top GOP officials voted to transfer the land again, effectively putting the property under the control of the Trump family when they deeded it to the foundation for Trump's library. That foundation is led by three trustees: Eric Trump, Tiffany Trump's husband, Michael Boulos, and the president's attorney James Kiley.




Jesus Suarez, an attorney for the college, argued that MDC did what was required under the law and questioned Dunn's political motivations for filing the case.

“There is no requirement under Florida law that there be specificity on notice, because those trustees can come into that room and talk to each other about whatever they wish,” Suarez said. 

Attorneys for Dunn maintain that no one who wasn't already in on the deal could have known what the board would do. 

“The people have a right to know what they're going to decide to do when the transaction is so significant, so unusual and deprives the students and the college of this land,” said plaintiff's attorney Richard Brodsky, speaking with The Associated Press prior to the judge's decision.

Javier Ley-Soto, general counsel for Miami Dade College, testified that it is still in the process of finalizing the land transfer. Delays caused by an injunction could cost the college up to $300,000, he estimated. 

Other Florida locations had previously been floated as library sites, including properties associated with Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton and Florida International University in suburban Miami. DeSantis signed a bill this year preempting local governments from blocking development of a presidential library, aiming to overrule potential opposition in liberal-leaning counties or municipalities.

A federal judge on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration, for now, from firing federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown.

The order came five days after the administration issued reduction-in-force notifications to more than 4,000 federal workers.

"The activities that are being undertaken here are contrary to the laws," San Francisco U.S. District Court Judge Susan Yvonne Illston told lawyers for the administration on Wednesday at a hearing where she issued the temporary restraining order.

"You can't do this in a nation of laws," Illston said, according to NBC News. "And we have laws here, and the things that are being articulated here are not within the law."

The judge cited comments by President Donald Trump and White House Budget Director Russell Vought that have indicated the workers were being laid off explicitly to target programs favored by Democrats.

Two unions representing tens of thousands of federal workers had asked Illston to block the RIFs. 

The Trump administration had warned that it would lay off workers during the shutdown, and President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that the cuts were aimed at "Democrat agencies" or initiatives.

Shortly before Illston issued her order blocking layoffs, White House Budget Director Russell Vought, during an interview on "The Charlie Kirk Show," said that he expected that "north of 10,000" federal jobs would be cut because of their shutdown.

Illston said that the Trump administration took "advantage of the lapse in government spending and government functioning to assume that all bets are off, the laws don't apply to them anymore, and they can impose the structures that they like on the government situation that they don't like," according to NBC.

The judge also said that she believed the unions would be able to prove that the Trump administration's actions were illegal and "arbitrary and capricious."

Illston's order came on the 15th day of the government shutdown, and shortly before a stopgap funding bill that would end the shutdown failed in the Senate for the ninth time.

Democracy Forward, an advocacy group representing the unions in court, praised the judge's order.

"The president seems to think his government shutdown is distracting people from the harmful and lawlessness actions of his administration, but the American people are holding him accountable, including in the courts," said Skye Perryman, CEO of  Democracy Forward.

"The statements today by the court make clear that the President's targeting of federal workers — a move straight out of Project 2025's playbook — is unlawful," Perryman said. 

"Our civil servants do the work of the people, and playing games with their livelihoods is cruel and unlawful and a threat to everyone in our nation."

The Trump administration could slash more than 10,000 federal jobs during the government shutdown, White House budget director Russell Vought said Wednesday.

"We want to be very aggressive where we can be in shuttering the bureaucracy, not just the funding," said Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget.

"We now have an opportunity to do that, and that's where we're going to be looking for our opportunities," he said during an appearance on "The Charlie Kirk Show," which was broadcasting from the White House.

The comments came shortly before a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from firing federal workers during the shutdown.

Vought listed a number of government entities that could be targeted for cuts, including so-called Green New Deal programs at the Department of Energy and environmental justice efforts at the Environmental Protection Agency. He also pointed to the Commerce Department's Minority Business Development Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA.

Vought also said he aims to close the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which he currently leads as acting director, within "the next two, three months."

He said that the agency has "the DNA of [Democratic Sen.] Elizabeth Warren," and that it has tried to "weaponize" the law against small financial institutions.

The Trump administration has warned that the shutdown, which has now stretched into its third week with no end in sight, will lead to mass firings of federal workers.

The White House said it sent layoff announcements, known as reduction-in-force notices or RIFs, to around 4,200 federal employees on Friday. That number was revised slightly downward on Tuesday.

But Vought, in Wednesday's talk show appearance, said he expects the number of RIFs to grow. 

"It could grow higher," he said. "I think we'll probably end up being north of 10,000."

The White House has shared its rolling RIF estimates in court documents as part of a federal lawsuit filed by unions representing government workers who are challenging the Trump administration's cuts.

In a hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Susan Illston issued a temporary restraining order blocking the firings for now.

"The activities that are being undertaken here are contrary to the laws," Illston told lawyers for the administration as she issued the order, according to NBC News.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Vought said the RIF numbers provided in the lawsuit are "just a snapshot."

"I think it'll get much higher, and we're going to keep those RIFs rolling throughout this shutdown, because we think it's important," he said.

Government employees who are furloughed during the shutdown, as well as those deemed "excepted" who are still required to work, are going without pay while the lapse in federal funds drags on.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday afternoon issued a presidential memorandum directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to use any remaining congressional funds to continue to pay active-duty military personnel.

Bunge Global jumped more than 11% on Wednesday on the back of the Trump administration's threat to cut off U.S. purchases of Chinese cooking oil.

Bunge is one of the largest soybean processors and cooking oil producers in the world. The stock's year to date gains are roughly 18%.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the U.S. is considering "terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil" as a retaliatory action against Beijing's refusal to buy U.S. soybeans. China was the top buyer of American soybeans for years but has not bought a single soybean from the U.S. since May amid its trade war with the Trump administration. The country has instead been buying the crop from Argentina and Brazil due to Trump's high tariff rates on China.

Trump's threat to China comes after China's used cooking oil exports surged to record highs last year, with the U.S. accounting for 43% of the total export number.

Trade tensions between China and the U.S. have escalated in recent days. Late last week, President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports. That came after China placed new export controls on rare earth minerals. China this week then moved to tighten its grip in the global shipping space by sanctioning five U.S. subsidiaries from South Korea's Hanwha Group. 

Bunge earlier Wednesday also gave a full-year forecast that reflects its merger with grain and oilseeds processor Viterra. The company said it expects to earn $7.30 to $7.60 per share, excluding items, while analysts polled by FactSet expected $7.39 per share. Still, that appeared to be better than many investors feared. 

Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland, another large American oilseed processor, also rose 1.5% after Trump's threat.

Walmart is deploying millions of ambient Internet of Things battery-free sensors throughout its massive supply chain in the U.S.

The retail giant is using technology from Wiliot in what the IoT vendor is calling the first large-scale deployment of ambient IoT in the retail sector and one of the largest such implementations to date.

Ambient IoT is a class of IoT devices mainly powered by harvesting ambient energy from radio waves, light, motion, heat, or other viable ambient energy sources. It's an evolution of legacy IoT and radio frequency identification technologies that promise lower costs and high scalability.

Walmart will be using the IoT sensors to track pallets nationwide by the end of 2026. "Expansion to other global markets is under consideration, but the immediate focus is the U.S. rollout," Cathey said.

The company will now have real-time insights into inventory management, knowing exactly where merchandise is located and whether it's owned by the retailer, at any moment, and covering an estimated 90 million pallets of inventory when at full scale.

The ambient IoT sensors Walmart uses capture signals about temperature, location, humidity, and dwell time. These signals are linked with the company's advanced artificial intelligence systems, enabling the company to dramatically improve supply chain efficiency, inventory accuracy, and cold chain compliance.

"We expect to be active in about 500 Walmart locations by the end of the year, with plans for national expansion in 2026," said Greg Cathey, senior vice president of transformation and innovation at Walmart. The rollout will cover 4,600 Walmart Supercenters, Neighborhood Markets, and more than 40 distribution centers, generating high-resolution supply chain data that feeds into Walmart's AI systems, he said.

"This data provides proof of delivery, improves replenishment decisions, and lets us know where our items are in real time," Cathey said. "By combining continuous sensing with AI, we're moving from probabilistic predictions to precision decision-making."

What makes the addition of ambient IoT sensors significant is it provides a new stream of data into AI systems, enabling them to be even more effective in giving Walmart greater visibility into supply chain operations.

The technology initiative is already making a significant impact by eliminating some manual tasks and providing automated alerts, Cathey said. "Associates no longer need to perform time-consuming checks to locate items," he said. "Automated alerts now flag this information in real time, allowing associates to act faster and dedicate more time to serving customers."

The enhanced visibility into the supply chain is also helping to resolve inventory discrepancies, allowing improved customer experiences.

While Cathey did not disclose specific figures such as cost savings, Walmart is anticipating gains from higher supply chain efficiency, improved inventory accuracy, reduced manual tasks for associates, and the ability to get items on shelves more quickly. "Customers [will] benefit from better product availability and consistency," he said.

"AI system performance is predicated on its training data. The better the data, the better the AI performance," said Julien Bellanger, president of Wiliot. "Supply chain AI has long been fueled by inherently out-of-date data — or forecasted data that represents projections rather than reality."

Ambient IoT is changing this model, Bellanger said, by fueling AI with data that reflects what's actually happening throughout the supply chain.

"We have been here before; Walmart was an early adopter of RFID back in 2004 when it was supposed to provide much the same functionality," said Bill Ray, distinguished vice president, analyst and chief of research at research firm Gartner. "However, this time the cost of the tags is much lower, and that will be a tipping point."

Ray says it's important to note that the value of such IoT systems is already known. "The business models have been well studied and evaluated, when RFID was first touted as the solution to supply chain problems," he said. "RFID has had an enormous impact, but the cost of the tags prevented the transformation it had promised. The industry has been able to integrate the new, lower-cost tags into the same value models, and come up with positive answers."

Gartner has been tracking Wiliot for a long time. "The question was never if the technology could deliver on its promise. The question was if Wiliot could reliably scale production without compromising tag performance or price, and if it could integrate with existing supply chain systems. This announcement tells us that Walmart is convinced it can, now Wiliot will have to prove it," Ray said.

"Ambient IoT just works," Cathey said. "It doesn't require wanding or scanning. It lets our associates do what they do, and they can focus on doing their jobs safely and efficiently while providing continuous, real-time visibility into our supply chain."

Ambient IoT got a boost earlier this year when a new business alliance was created to develop and promote an open, multi-standard ecosystem for ambient IoT manufacturers, suppliers, integrators, operators, users, and customers, based on next-generation, battery-free ambient IoT standards.

By focusing on advanced communication technologies, the alliance is seeking to overcome the limitations of traditional battery-powered IoT devices, promoting more sustainable and efficient products.

Drugmaker Novo Nordisk has begun a round of layoffs in its most important market, the United States, with affected staff set to be notified between this week and next, according to an email and two sources familiar with the matter.

The time-frame for the layoffs has not previously been reported. The move comes as the Danish company behind popular weight-loss drug Wegovy looks to cut jobs globally and reduce costs in a battle with U.S. rival Eli Lilly.

U.S. layoffs began on Tuesday and will continue until late next week, according to a schedule in the email. They come after an acceleration of job cuts in Novo's home market, Denmark, where it plans to eliminate 5,000 positions.

Departments expected to be informed of cuts include human resources, clinical development, rare diseases, medical and regulatory, legal, ethics and compliance, marketing and sales, finance, public affairs and others, the schedule showed.

Reuters was unable to confirm how many people would be affected. Novo is looking to shed 9,000 roles globally in a restructuring drive under new CEO Mike Doustdar, who took office in August.

Novo did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but has said previously that the global process would take time and its "highest priority is to support our employees".

The sources asked not to be named in order to share confidential company information.

The layoffs come as Doustdar tries to restore investor confidence with what he calls a tighter focus on commercial execution and on the obesity and diabetes therapeutic areas.

Doustdar took the helm after a sliding share price and slowing Wegovy sales growth led to the ouster of long-time CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen.

Novo's shares are up around 6% since the restructuring was announced on September 10.

Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock and Elon Musk's xAI are part of a consortium of investors that has agreed to purchase Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion, the companies announced Wednesday.

Aligned designs and operates data centers and data campuses across North and South America, and is owned by Macquarie Asset Management.

MGX of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners and members of Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership, or AIP, will acquire 100% of the company's equity, in what will be the largest global data center deal to date, according to a release.

AIP was created by BlackRock, MGX, Microsoft and Nvidia in September 2024 to accelerate investment in AI infrastructure. The Kuwait Investment Authority, xAI and Temasek have joined as additional participants.

The Aligned deal marks AIP's first investment and is a step toward the group's goal of deploying $30 billion of equity capital.

"With this investment in Aligned Data Centers, we further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI, while offering our clients attractive opportunities to participate in its growth," Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock and Chairman of AIP, said in a statement.

AI companies have been racing to build out the infrastructure they believe they will need to meet growing demand for the technology.

Companies including OpenAI, Nvidia, CoreWeave and Oracle are striking ambitious data center and computing deals that will require unprecedented amounts of funding and power.

Data centers are the large facilities that house the hardware and equipment needed to run big AI workloads and train models. Aligned currently operates 50 campuses and has more than 5 gigawatts of operational and planned capacity.

The Aligned transaction is expected to close late next year, and it is still subject to regulatory approvals and other standard closing conditions.

If you believe money causes tension in your relationship, you're not alone.

I've spent the past two years interviewing and studying more than 60 couples and the ways they come into these conflicts. I've learned that love has little to do with it. You can love each other deeply and still allow money to erode your relationship if you're talking about the wrong issues, or not talking about them at all.

People often focus on the problems right in front of them: missing a bill payment or spending over the monthly budget. But these smaller transgressions can be a symptom of a bigger issue you and your partner haven't identified yet.

The happiest couples don't let these money mistakes ruin their relationship:

Long ago, you and your partner may have decided to do something one way, and you've been doing it that way ever since. 

A good example is splitting your expenses down the middle and having separate bank accounts. At the time, you were earning similar incomes and were just starting your lives together. It made sense. But circumstances have changed, and maybe one of you earns more money, or you're having kids, and the logistics of this setup are more complicated than helpful.

My advice is don't approach your partner about making big changes during a heated conflict. Raise the subject when stress is low and attention is high. You don't need to make a dramatic change overnight. Instead, use incremental steps to work toward a positive shared goal.

We all have things we wish could've gone differently. But the story you tell yourself about a situation might be completely different from someone else's. You might see your student loan debt as a challenge to overcome, while I see mine as my biggest financial regret.

The stories we tell ourselves about money matter. 

Shame, whether from the past or present, can trap someone into a cycle of fear and guilt. It clouds judgment and stalls progress, especially in a partnership. It might even convince someone they don't deserve a good life. 

As a partner, you can't wipe their shame away. They may need professional support. But you do need to understand the weight they're carrying in order to have honest, vulnerable conversations. Only then can you tailor your support to help them heal. 

Not every poor financial outcome is the result of a mistake. Sometimes, you take a step in the wrong direction. When that happens, you both need to be able to move on.  

For example, holding credit card debt, even for a short time, is a frequent source of regret, even if it was necessary in the moment. Failing to let go of your partner's setbacks can damage their self-worth and confidence. The result can cause them to believe they aren't good with money, or even worse, that they don't deserve to have a say in financial decisions. 

Letting go of regrets can be as simple as writing them down, or as complex as working through them with a professional. But above all, never be the one to make your partner feel shame over money. Be their support and let them grow from it.

Having a "never enough" mindset goes beyond money or careers. It's fueled by constant comparison, especially on social media. When you fixate on what you don't have, you keep trying to fill a bigger glass without ever feeling full.

Those expectations aren't always realistic or aligned with your goals as a couple, which is a slippery slope that can turn your partner into a moving target. They could begin to feel like they aren't enough for you, either.

"Enough" doesn't mean "everything." Set aside time to talk about your real priorities and set those as your benchmarks of contentment, not the idealized version of success you see on social media. 

Financial infidelity can break trust in ways that are as harmful as adultery, because the betrayal directly impacts your livelihood as a family.

For example, hiding income from your partner, making a massive purchase your partner wouldn't agree with, or even taking on debt in one or both of your names. Healing from patterns of lies requires radical transparency from that partner, along with a willingness to listen, evolve, and improve.

And if you really don't feel free to spend money in your relationship, that's a conversation worth having. Rather than setting rigid spending rules (or even worse, "allowances") that fail to account for each person's household responsibilities, set a check-in number that you're both comfortable with. Anything below that amount is fair game.

Strong couples know that handling money together is about values, trust, and communication. If you commit to facing the real issues together, even tough times can become building blocks for a better relationship.

Heather Boneparth is the co-author of the upcoming book, "Money Together," and the director of business and legal affairs for Bone Fide Wealth in New York City. With her husband, she co-writes The Joint Account, a weekly newsletter helping couples talk about money.

The Trump administration will set price floors across a range of industries to combat market manipulation by China, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC in an exclusive interview Wednesday.

China has driven foreign competitors in the rare earth industry out of business over the past two decades by using its global dominance in refining and processing to slash prices, Bessent said.

"When you are facing a nonmarket economy like China, then you have to exercise industrial policy," Bessent told Sara Eisen at CNBC's Invest in America Forum in Washington, D.C.

"So we're going to set price floors and the forward buying to make sure that this doesn't happen again and we're going to do it across a range of industries," the Treasury secretary said, without naming specific industries the administration was looking at beyond rare earths. 

The U.S. also needs to set up a strategic mineral reserve, Bessent said. JPMorgan Chase is interested in working with the Trump administration to create such a reserve, he said.

Rare earths are used to produce magnets that are crucial inputs in U.S. weapons systems like the F-35 warplane and Tomahawk cruise missiles. Rare earth magnets are also essential for civilian commercial applications like electric vehicles.

The Trump administration has been working to stand up a domestic rare earth supply chain. The Department of Defense struck an unprecedented deal in July with MP Materials, the largest U.S. rare earth miner, that included an equity stake, a price floor and offtake agreement.

China last week announced sweeping new restrictions on rare earth exports ahead of an expected meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump in South Korea later this month. Trump has threatened to slap China with additional 100% tariffs in response.

The U.S. could take equity stakes in other companies in the wake of Beijing's rare earth restrictions, Bessent told CNBC.

"I wouldn't be surprised," the Treasury secretary said when asked about additional equity stakes. "When we get an announcement like this week with China on the rare earths, you realize we have to be self-sufficient, or we have to be sufficient with our allies."

The Trump administration will not take stakes in nonstrategic industries, Bessent said. "We do have to be very careful not to overreach," he said.

Shares of rare earth and critical mineral miners have rallied over the past several sessions as investors speculate on which companies might be future targets for Trump administration industrial policy.

Apple announced new MacBook Pro, iPad Pro and Vision Pro models on Wednesday with an updated M5 chip that allows them to run faster than their predecessors.

The new MacBook Pro models start at $1,599. The 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $999. The latest Apple Vision Pro, which includes a Dual Knit Band, starts at $3,499.

The new devices are available to preorder now in most markets and go on sale Oct. 22. They are Apple's latest additions to its fall catalog of products.

The company released the iPhone 17 and Apple Watch Series 11 models in September.

Apple's December quarter is its largest by sales, driven by holiday and Christmas shopping. That is why the company usually updates its bestselling products in the fall. This year, it's the first full quarter of iPhone 17 sales as well.

The new device lineup is powered by Apple's M5 chip, which the company said has four times the peak compute performance compared with the previous M4.

Johny Srouji, Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Technologies, said in a release that the "M5 delivers a huge boost to AI workloads."

Wednesday's announcement comes as Wall Street analysts are closely watching Apple's new releases to see if the company is raising prices or eating costs related to President Donald Trump's announced and threatened tariffs, especially on semiconductors and China.

Starting prices for the latest M5 models are the same as the previous versions.

While iPads and MacBooks aren't as critical for Apple as iPhone sales, they are still massive businesses.

Apple reported $6.58 billion in iPad sales in the June quarter, an 8% decrease on an annual basis that the company attributed to difficult comparisons to the year-ago quarter when new iPad Pros were released.

Mac sales in the June quarter came in at $8.05 billion, a 15% increase on a year-over-year basis. Apple released a new version of what it calls its bestselling laptop, the MacBook Air, earlier this year.

Apple has never broken out figures for the Vision Pro headset but they are included alongside Apple Watch and AirPods sales in the company's wearables, or other products, line item. Analysts believe the company's Vision Pro revenue is negligible.

MacBook, iPads and Vision Pro put together are significantly less than Apple's iPhone revenue, which accounted for more than 47% of revenue in the company's June quarter at just under $45 billion.

Wall Street analysts tend to focus on iPhone sales and growth over the company's secondary product lines.

BEIJING — Chinese smartphone company Honor on Wednesday announced it is developing a smartphone with a camera that folds out of the device using a robotic arm.

The company said it plans to share more details at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona early next year.

The new device would be the latest Chinese consumer electronics product to shake up a decades-old hardware design in an attempt to integrate AI. Earlier this year, Beijing-based Roborock started selling a robot vacuum cleaner with an arm that folds out from the top, and combines AI with sensors to detect obstructions for the arm to remove.

Honor is calling the product a "robot phone" and said it will incorporate artificial intelligence, but did not provide specific details.

The company said it is rolling out AI tools that help its smartphone users scan Chinese e-commerce sites for personalized shopping deals, quickly hail a taxi or get tips on how to better position the camera for a photo. The move is part of Honor's plan to spend $10 billion over the next five years for a transformation into an AI device company.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent insisted Wednesday that the U.S. won't change its trade negotiating stance on China due to stock market volatility.

"We won't negotiate because the stock market is going down" or shy away from taking strong measures against Beijing for that reason, Bessent said in an exclusive interview at CNBC's Invest in America Forum.

"We will negotiate because we are doing what is best economically for the U.S.," he said.

Bessent pushed back on a report in The Wall Street Journal overnight that China "expects that the prospect of another market meltdown ultimately will force [President Donald Trump] to negotiate."

Chinese President Xi Jinping is "betting that the U.S. economy can't absorb a prolonged trade conflict" with China, the Journal reported, citing people close to Beijing's decision-making. 

The Cabinet secretary called that report "terrible," accusing the newspaper of taking "CCP dictation."

A spokesperson for the Journal, asked for comment on Bessent's remarks, said the newspaper stands by its reporting.

"We hold ourselves to the highest journalistic standards and any insinuation otherwise is baseless and false," the spokesperson said in a statement.

Bessent's comments came as markets have whipsawed in recent days, as the status of ongoing trade talks between the world's largest economies appeared to teeter.

Stocks tanked on Friday after Trump threatened to hike tariffs on Chinese imports in retaliation for new export controls that China imposed on rare earth minerals.

Trump appeared to soften his tone over the weekend, spurring a market rebound on Monday. Major stock indexes bounced around in volatile trading Tuesday; the S&P 500 took a dive before the session close after Trump issued yet another trade threat against China, this one accusing Beijing of economic hostility for not buying U.S. soybeans.

Bessent added Wednesday that while Trump "likes a high stock market," he "believes that the high stock market is a result of good policies."

"It's the policies that we're talking about here today, in terms of this capex boom," Bessent said, highlighting increased investment in artificial intelligence.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

The volatile U.S.-China relationship hit another bump yesterday when President Donald Trump said he is considering placing a cooking oil embargo on Beijing in retaliation for it's refusal to buy U.S. soybeans. The ongoing feud has led to choppy stock market trading over recent days.

Here's the latest:

Bank investors got more upbeat news this morning.

Bank of America said its investment banking revenue soared in the third quarter as it beat earnings forecasts for the period, leading shares to rally more than 5% in premarket trading. Morgan Stanley also outperformed Wall Street's expectations, pushing its stock up more than 3% before the bell.

Following JPMorgan Chase's earnings beat yesterday, CEO Jamie Dimon said auto market bankruptcies are a sign that lending standards have gotten too loose. Elsewhere on the economic front, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank could soon stop reducing its bond holdings.

While Trump has repeatedly said that his administration's mass layoffs are targeting "Democrat Agencies" amid the shutdown, the cuts also appear to be affecting bipartisan efforts. At the Treasury Department — where nearly 1,450 federal employees have received reduction-in-force notices — the entire 83-person staff of the bipartisan-supported Community Development Financial Institutions Fund was cut.

As the shutdown enters its third week, air traffic controllers have handed out leaflets at some airports urging the public to pressure Congress to reopen the government. Some airports meanwhile are refusing to play a video from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats for the shutdown. 

With September's figures now in the books, Boeing is on track for its highest annual plane delivery count since 2018. The company said yesterday that it delivered 55 aircraft last month, bringing its total to 440 airplanes in the first nine months of 2025.

As CNBC's Leslie Josephs notes, Boeing has been able to stabilize its production following several safety and production crises. Executives are aiming to increase production of Boeing's pricey 737 Max planes.

Boeing on Tuesday also received approval from European Union antitrust regulators for its $4.7 billion acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems. The plane maker agreed to sell some of Spirit's businesses to remedy competition concerns.

CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning.

The Justice Department seized around $15 billion worth of bitcoin from the cryptocurrency wallets of Chen Zhi, who prosecutors allege ran a large-scale "pig butchering" fraud operation in Cambodia. Zhi, who remains at large, is charged with wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.

It is the largest-ever forfeiture action sought by the DOJ.

Survey results from JPMorgan highlight just how differently Americans in different income brackets view the economy.

— CNBC's Leslie Josephs, Dan Mangan, Lillian Rizzo, Kevin Breuninger, Spencer Kimball, Jeff Cox and Liz Napolitano contributed to this report. Josephine Rozzelle edited this edition.

Many predict that the artificial intelligence boom will dramatically change how people live and work, and the scale and pace of recent AI deals seems to reflect this. At the center are a handful of companies that are increasingly turning to each other to finance and build out the necessary infrastructure.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI alone has racked up around $1 trillion in deals this year, according to a report from the Financial Times. In September, OpenAI confirmed that it would pay Oracle $300 billion for computer infrastructure over the course of five years. This deal is part of a $500 billion data center buildout project called Stargate, to which Japan's SoftBank Group is also contributing. OpenAI has also inked a $22 billion deal with CoreWeave for use of its data centers, which are packed with Nvidia graphics processing units. Most recently, OpenAI announced a partnership with Broadcom to develop and deploy racks of chips designed by the AI startup. That deal amount is undisclosed. OpenAI has been able to go on this shopping spree because of a $100 billion investment from Nvidia, though a large portion of that money likely be used for leasing Nvidia's GPUs. Microsoft has also invested about $14 billion in OpenAI since 2019.

Nvidia has also spun a similar web of intertwining AI deals. Nvidia in September agreed to pay up to $6.3 billion for any of CoreWeave's unsold cloud-computing capacity through 2032. CoreWeave gets most of its GPUs that it then rents out to customers from Nvidia, which is also an investor in the AI cloud infrastructure company. Meanwhile, Oracle has purchased about $40 billion worth of Nvidia chips to build a data center for OpenAI, which is part of the Stargate project. Softbank has a $3 billion stake in Nvidia.

Some experts are worried that these inflated AI company valuations "are at a bubble." A recent report by Bain & Company found that AI companies will need $2 trillion of annual revenue to fund the infrastructure needed to meet projected demand for AI by 2030. That's an $800 billion shortfall.

But AI leaders are pushing back against concerns, saying that this is simply what it takes to make AI a reality.

"The largest tech companies in the world are purchasing this infrastructure because they have demand," CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator said on Mad Money on Oct. 8. "There's nothing circular about that. It's a fundamental infrastructure buildout that's taking place, and when you have such a massive-scale investment in infrastructure, it is not unusual to see partnerships as people try to serve infrastructure to the consumer. It happens in other markets, it's happening in this one."Watch the video for a visual representation of this entangled web of AI deals.

Marc Benioff doesn't think enough companies have figured out how to adopt AI.

"Customers are getting their head around how to deploy AI," Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, told CNBC host Jim Cramer on Tuesday.

Earlier on Tuesday, Benoiff kicked off the Dreamforce conference at San Francisco's Moscone Center with a keynote, where he touted how clients such as Williams-Sonoma and Dutch jewelry maker Pandora have adopted Salesforce's AI products.

"The speed of innovation is far exceeding the speed of customer adoption," said Benioff to Cramer. "These customers have to go back and modify massive architectures they have and systems they're running."

The comments on AI adoption come as Salesforce shares are down more than 28% compared to the same time last year and around 34% compared to their peak in December 2024. The company said in August that it cut its support staff from 9,000 to 5,000 employees, thanks to the adoption of AI agents.

When asked about the stock decline, Benioff said that the Agentforce platform has rapidly grown since the company first introduced it a little over a year ago, but there is little understanding of how the company is using autonomous bots to drive efficiency.

"People don't understand that Agentforce is part and parcel of Salesforce," said Benioff. "It is the core of every product we make now, it is the platform."

The Dreamforce conference is set to bring tens of thousands of guests to San Francisco this week as Benoiff attempts to sell software like Tableau and Slack, powered by AI. Tickets typically run from $999 to $2,299. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Dario Amodei, CEO of AI lab Anthropic, are both scheduled to have chat sessions with Benoiff throughout the week, topped off with music performances from Metallica and Benson Boone.

Automotive industry groups have raised the alarm over the ramifications of China's latest move to restrict critical rare earth exports, saying the measures could pave the way to a period of supply chain chaos.

China's Commerce Ministry last week announced expanded curbs on the export of rare earths and related technologies, seeking to prevent the "misuse" of minerals in the military and other sensitive sectors.

Beijing has since defended the policy, saying it was "not afraid" of a U.S. trade war after President Donald Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports.

Despite an agreement in July designed to fast-track shipments to the region, Europe's auto industry has been experiencing significant disruption after China imposed rare earth export curbs in early April.

The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), the country's main car industry lobby, said China's new regulations were expected to have "far-reaching consequences for deliveries of the affected products to Germany and Europe," as well as for their onward transport.

China's latest export restrictions will hit the battery and semiconductor industries "particularly hard, and thus also the automotive industry," the VDA spokesperson told CNBC by email on Tuesday.

The German car industry lobby called on policymakers in both Brussels and Berlin to tackle the issue "forcefully" with China to quickly find a viable solution.

"The fact is that the Chinese export restrictions on rare earths and permanent magnets implemented in April this year have already significantly exacerbated the supply situation for rare earths and strategic materials. The new measures now go even further," the VDA spokesperson said.

Rare earth metals are vital components to the production of electric vehicles, as well as various high-tech applications, including electronics and renewable energy applications.

Demand for rare earths and critical minerals is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years as the clean energy transition picks up pace.

China is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, accounting for roughly 60% of the world's production of rare earth minerals and materials. U.S. officials have previously warned that this poses a strategic challenge amid the pivot to more sustainable energy sources.

Roberto Vavassori, chairman of the Italian auto part maker lobby ANFIA, reportedly said Tuesday that while manufacturers had been able to maintain production when China restricted supplies over the summer, reserves of rare earth metals were now at risk of being depleted.

This buffer "is not there anymore," Vavassori said at a conference in Milan, according to Reuters. ANFIA did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.

Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, said China's new crackdown on exports is pressing from a supply chain perspective.

"China dominates 90% of global refinery capacity and therefore it's a real bottleneck," Luman told CNBC by email.

"Across the supply chain there are still inventories, such as at Tradium's major storage facility near Frankfurt, so I don't expect immediate large fallouts already," Luman said.

"But rare earths include a range of elements, some could run short in delivery. And going forward relaxation of supplies is highly dependent on upcoming talks between China," he added.

To build brand loyalty, get 'em while they're young.

Harvey, a startup building artificial intelligence tools for lawyers, is taking that creed to college campuses.

The company, last valued at $5 billion, says it now works with half of the country's 100 largest law firms and is extending its reach to the classroom.

In August, Harvey said it would give six law schools access to the platform as part of a new "alliance." The next month, it onboarded 11 more law schools. Now, Harvey has added Duke Law and Northwestern Pritzker Law to the roster, the company tells Business Insider. Participation in the program is available to the law schools free of charge.

"What we're trying to do is make it so they can start integrating that into their training as early as possible," Winston Weinberg, Harvey's cofounder and chief executive, said from a conference room in the company's Manhattan office.

He imagines a not-so-distant future where a private-equity class conducts a mock leveraged buyout inside Harvey; students draft and refine arguments with its tools before a moot court. The simulations he describes aren't live yet.

Harvey's program borrows from the "Wexis" playbook. For decades, LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters, which both supply case law to legal professionals, blanketed law schools with free or nearly free access. Students spend years getting fluent in one system and then carry that muscle memory into practice.

Harvey is betting that prompting and directing virtual agents will be the next habits that stick.

Inside firms, Weinberg says Harvey is stripping the drudgery from legal work, and clients are starting to notice. Faster is becoming the expectation. He compares it to the advent of email. "The biggest change it made," he said, is that "you've got to respond way faster."

That's the incentive problem at the heart of legal tech: many lawyers are paid by the hour, and saving time can result in a loss of revenue. Weinberg thinks that Harvey's efficiency gains will prompt firms to move more work off the billable hour and onto flat-fee menus to protect their profits. The price of services depends on the specific legal matter, and doesn't decrease even as labor costs fall.

Weinberg said law firms could also pass along the cost of using Harvey and other tools to their clients, a familiar move in the legal world. Many firms already include a line item on their invoices for research databases, such as LexisNexis or Westlaw, showing how many queries a matter requires. Asked if Harvey might one day appear the same way, Weinberg said the company is "exploring that right now."

The caveat is that uptake today skews towards the big corporates and law firms, and even there, Harvey is still seen as an efficiency booster, not a requirement for practice.

Law schools aren't entirely analog. They've long run on enterprise tools like Lexis and Westlaw. Where they diverge is on policies around generative artificial intelligence. Some prohibit it. Others allow it with disclosure. A few are weaving it into clinics and practice labs.

Notably, the list of Harvey's launch partners was missing a few giants, Yale and Harvard among them. Company lore says the name "Harvey" is partly a nod to Harvard.

Asked what he would change about legal education if he were rewriting the first-year curriculum today, Weinberg, a trained lawyer who graduated from the USC Gould School of Law, said his answer would have been the same, even before the arrival of ChatGPT. He argues law schools can do far more to prepare students for the realities of practice.

He has no quarrel with the traditional first-year curriculum. "I think where things actually break down," he said, "is that there is almost no hands-on stuff in the second and third year." Summer jobs help. But, in his view, a three-year legal education should more closely resemble the workplace.

Harvey aims to help fix that, though its law school partnership remains light on details. To land on campus, it has to navigate a live debate inside faculties, where purists who want to prohibit the tech to protect core skills are squaring off against pragmatists who want supervised use.

If Harvey can get a foothold in law schools now, the payoff could arrive when today's second-year lawyers become tomorrow's associates and in-house counsel.

Six AI startups are part of Jensen Huang's vision for human-digital workforces.

"Future workforces in enterprise will be a combination of humans and digital humans. Some of them will be OpenAI-based, and some of it would be Harvey-based or Open Evidence or Cursor or Replit or Lovable," the Nvidia CEO said in an interview with Citadel Securities published on Tuesday.

Huang's wide-ranging list included OpenAI, which makes large language models, legal tech darling Harvey, and AI healthcare tool OpenEvidence. Replit, Cursor, and Lovable offer AI-powered coding or "vibe coding" tools.

Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI to build data centers running the chipmaker's systems, the companies said last month.

In his Citadel talk, Huang specifically highlighted Anysphere-owned Cursor. He said that 100% of Nvidia's software engineers and chip designers use Cursor.

"We now have AIs for all of our engineers," he said. "Productivity gains, the work that we do is so much better."

Nvidia declined to comment further.

In June, Business Insider reported that Amazon was in talks with Cursor to adopt the AI coding tool internally after employees demanded it.

Huang has long said that AI and "biological" employees will work together in the future. AI agents break down a task into multiple smaller steps, each tackling a specific part to achieve a broader objective.

In Huang's January keynote at CES, one of the world's largest tech trade shows, he proclaimed, "The age of agentic AI is here."

In a podcast last October, Huang explained how the human and AI employees would work together. He described a future where the technology giant would mass-deploy AI assistants, also called agents, across every division to improve output.

"I'm hoping that Nvidia someday will be a 50,000-employee company with a 100 million, you know, AI assistants, in every single group," Huang said.

Human-AI integration is gaining venture capital attention, too.

Late last month, General Catalyst's CEO Hemant Taneja said that true AI integration has four non-negotiables, and one of them is planning for how humans and AI will work together.

"Some humans are going to manage AI agents. Some AI agents are going to manage humans," he said on a podcast appearance. "Imagine how the org charts have to change."

Cathie Wood says Wall Street is overlooking AI's biggest payoff.

The CEO of Ark Invest said at the All-In Summit 2025 in September that the real AI revolution is happening in hospitals and labs — and investors are barely paying attention.

"The most profound application of AI is in healthcare," Wood said in a discussion posted Tuesday.

She added that combining AI with advances in gene sequencing and CRISPR technology — a technology scientists use to selectively modify the DNA of living organisms — could spark a medical transformation.

"This is the sleeper. It's the most inefficiently priced part of the market," Wood said.

Wood said that five major technologies — AI, robotics, energy storage, blockchain, and genomics — are each entering their steep growth phase. When one advances, it accelerates the others.

That convergence is why healthcare could deliver massive gains for investors willing to bet early, Wood said. Smarter algorithms make gene sequencing faster; cheaper sequencing gives AI more data to learn from; and breakthroughs in gene editing can open the door to new treatments.

It's not the first time Wood has gone against the grain — her funds became famous for early bets on Tesla and Roku.

Wood also said some of the so-called "MAG 6" tech giants — Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet — could see slower growth in the next five years. These giants tripled in valuation in market cap from 2019 to 2024 "because investors were playing it safe, and they were investing only in the largest, most cash-rich stocks."

"That was a very difficult time for innovation for venture capital generally," Wood said, referring to the years when investors stuck with Big Tech. "Now we think it is truly disruptive innovation's time to shine in the market," she added.

Wood did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Her firm managed over $13 billion in May, according to its most recent filing.

AI is quickly reshaping the healthcare industry, and tech's biggest players are racing to stake their claims.

Microsoft has been integrating AI into its cloud solutions to automate hospital operations. Earlier this year, Microsoft said its medical AI system diagnosed cases more accurately than human doctors by a wide margin in a study.

Nvidia is also pushing deeper into the sector. Its VP of healthcare, Kimberly Powell, told Business Insider in April that medical imaging was one of Nvidia's entry points into healthcare. The company has notched a number of medical imaging partnerships powered by its AI platforms, most recently with GE Healthcare in March.

Healthcare startups are rushing in, too. Founders told Business Insider in July that AI could be the breakthrough that helps clinicians multiply their caseloads and earn extra cash without sacrificing care quality.

Kim Dhatt, a 34-year-old recruitment specialist, was in a relationship with her ex-partner for four years. When they first got together, he earned slightly more than she did, and the difference didn't bother either of them. After a series of promotions over 18 months, her salary tripled — and then he couldn't deal, Dhatt says.

Her partner's self-worth was tied directly to his income, and it eroded as her salary grew, Dhatt tells me. He insisted on splitting costs 50-50, leaving her with a disposable income that she wanted to spend on nice things but felt like she couldn't. When she proposed booking a luxury vacation for the two of them, for example, he insisted they go on a cheaper trip and divide the cost. She felt like she was compromising. They argued often, and resentment curdled.

Dhatt's financial success soon exposed a tension that many couples face today: What happens when she earns more than him?

"I'd worked hard to achieve my income level, and I was not reaping the benefits of it," Dhatt says. "When our relationship finally ended, he told me as he left that I have nothing to worry about because of my salary," she adds, which to her revealed how money was "a bigger factor" in their relationship than he'd previously admitted.

Divorce rates in heterosexual couples rise significantly when a woman is more professionally successful than the man, be that in terms of fame or, more commonly, money. Perhaps even more strikingly, studies also show that the marriages most likely to endure are those that most closely fit the traditional pattern of male breadwinner and female homemaker. A 2023 report from the Institute for Family Studies found that couples in which husbands earn more than their wives have the lowest chance of divorce, and that when a man earns upwards of $38,000-a-year more than his wife, the chances of divorce are lowest. The wider the traditional wage gap, it would seem, the stronger the marriage.

Despite recent leaps in progress toward gender equality both in the home and in the workplace, marital inequality might be the last vexing barrier to our ongoing quest for true gender parity.

No doubt one of today's highest profile wage-gap relationships with a female breadwinner is Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. The pop megastar's estimated net worth, about $1.6 billion, is about 30 times the NFL tight end's estimated $52 million.

When the pair announced their engagement in August, Lyz Lenz, a New York Times bestselling author of a memoir about her own divorce, cut through the internet's euphoria by offering some sobering stats and reflections on her own experience.

"The image they are projecting to us is that a successful woman has found a supportive partner, one who eagerly fawns over her new album cover while interviewing her for his own podcast," she wrote on her Substack. "This reality is far from reality for most American women."

Lenz noted that women who succeed as Swift has "are often punished for it" and that she herself has been forced to pay the price of being professionally and economically ambitious. "Every time I succeed, there's a downside. The hate mail gets worse. The man I am dating backs away. A tabloid publishes a scathing story about me," she writes. "I'm so, so tired."

The data corroborates the vibe. A 2013 University of Chicago study of 4,000 married couples in the US found that as soon as a woman out-earns her husband, both are 6% less likely to report a "very happy" marriage. They're also 8% more likely to report marital troubles and 6 percent more likely to discuss separating. A Swedish study from 2016 found that a married woman is twice as likely as a man to be divorced three years after being promoted to CEO. A similar pattern follows in the public sector: Women who are elected to positions like mayor or parliamentarian double the chances of their marriages falling apart.

There are darker findings too. A 2023 study from Australia, for example, found that women who earn more than their male partners are also significantly more likely to be physically and emotionally abused by that partner. "When women's income exceeds that of their partners," the authors write, "the violation of a gender norm creates a strong negative effect."

Scant research is available on the correlation between divorce rates and income inequality in same-sex marriages, but one paper from 2014 found that in those couples bigger earnings gaps also translate to a higher likelihood of a break-up.

More than a dozen women I spoke to for this story told me that money significantly shaped their relationship or marriage. Many men told me the same. And of the women who earned more than their male spouses, the majority said that this had a detrimental impact on their relationship. Several said that it was "the elephant in the room" — something that complicated their relationship but that their male partners didn't want to talk about explicitly.

Sukhy Desangh, a 41-year old management consultant, tells me she was earning more than five times what her ex-fiancé earned. "I realized I was just bank-rolling him," she says. He was humiliated by her being the primary earner in their household, she says. "When we were out for dinner with friends and family, he would message me to say, 'Give me your credit card and I'll pay with it.'"

Several other women said that their partners felt "emasculated" by being out-earned. Two women who asked not to be named said that they felt like their ex-husbands became depressed as a result of not being the primary financial provider. The depression, the women said, turned to bitterness and anger, and ultimately led to the breakdown of the marriages.

"Money wasn't the only reason me and my ex broke up," says Ali, a 34-year old who works in financial services, "but it was a topic of conversation and there were many times he said he wouldn't be able to be with someone long-term who earns more than him. And I was making significantly more than him."

Why have marriages not caught up to the reality of the labor market? Women now hold more managerial positions than ever, and they bring home the bulk of household income in more families than ever. The US gender pay gap, while still stuck at about 82 cents on the dollar, is close to the narrowest it's ever been. What is holding marriages back?

Dené Logan, a marriage and family therapist based in Los Angeles, says that for one, gender norms are set in childhood. "Men are handed a very specific template early in life: protect, provide, procreate — and their worth is tied to it," she says. With that mindset deeply ingrained, Logan adds, when a woman in a heterosexual marriage is financially and professionally successful, it can "trigger resentment" within the man — whether he knows it or not.

Because of these long-standing constructs, men's sense of mission and meaning is still frequently tied up in work and money. "And without a sense of mission or meaning, many men can feel diminished and even threatened," Logan says.

Muriel Wilkins, an executive coach and CEO of a leadership advisory firm, agrees. "What's really happening here is a clash between progress and old expectations," she says. "Beliefs don't change as fast as paychecks do."

"Cultural norms are very sticky," says Ramit Sethi, a bestselling author and podcast host. "We see stickiness," he says, in the "amount of time spent on household chores, emotional labor, and money in relationships." For example, he notes, even though women in urban cities out-earn men in their 20s, dating norms about who picks up the check have been glacially slow to change.

Many of the women I spoke to also said that fault lines in marriages and relationships that were initially caused by money were exacerbated by the fact that men who weren't getting paid as much were also not shouldering as much of the unpaid labor in the home. A Pew study from 2023 found that women in the US still consistently pick up more household chores and caregiving responsibilities. That's true in marriages in which the man outearns the woman, but also in those in which both spouses earn roughly the same amount, and even when the wife is the primary earner. The only marriages in which husbands devoted more time to caregiving than their wives were those in which the wife was the sole household earner. In those situations, wives and husbands spent roughly the same amount of time per week on household chores.

"It felt like a double whammy," one woman says of her husband, who was laid off shortly after they got married. "He wasn't working, which made him angry and resentful, but then he refused to do almost anything around the house while I was earning for the both of us. And that made me angry and resentful," she says. "If that's not a recipe for disaster, then I don't know what is."

There are, of course, exceptions to the female breadwinner trend.

Brian Tan and his wife, who live in New York, have been married for two years and in a relationship for eight. They started their careers earning the same salary at the same financial services firm. After that, he switched employers and took a job which paid about double her salary. But since then, he's started working for a children's hospital and she's moved into tech. She now earns between 70 and 80% more than him, Tan says, and it's not an issue in their marriage.

He says there are several reasons her outearning him doesn't bother him. "The first is that I view it as one big pool of money. The second is that this is a pendulum that swings both ways — there was a period where I made more, then we made the same amount, then she makes more now," says Tan. "A third reason is that I'm truly proud of her, and to be genuinely proud of someone, all feelings of jealousy disappear from one's mindset; I want her to feel fulfilled and intellectually stimulated, and the fact that she gets paid a lot while doing her job is a win-win for me."

One woman based in the UK who asked not to be named tells me that she has four sisters. "We all earn more than our husbands — all six figures," she says. "Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but we are all married." The key to success, she said, is being open and communicating, especially when conflicts arise.

Natasha, a 37-year old marketing executive, says that her family is very traditional in terms of gender norms. By earning double what her husband earns, she sometimes feels like she's simultaneously living both outside of traditional gender norms and inside of them — "a sort of double existence that can feel stressful," she says. But crucially, she's been happily married to her husband for seven years — they just had a baby. The pay differential doesn't bother him, she says. "I think that's evidence of his maturity and confidence."

Another woman told me that when she first met the man who became her husband, she was earning "a thousand times" more than him. They've now been together for a decade, and she's still earning about 40 percent more than him. "It's never ever been a problem," she said. And he agrees: "Unless it's a problem for my wife, I'm secure enough in myself and in our relationship for it to not even be a consideration."

William Conrad and his girlfriend Levi Coralynn, who are both in their 20s, have garnered an enormous social media following — he has about 1.3 million TikTok followers, she about 2.3 million— for publicly and performatively living out an atypical heterosexual relationship. Coralynn, a content creator, is the primary earner, while Conrad seemingly takes care of the bulk of the domestic work.

Muriel Wilkins said that she does think things will eventually change, especially as Gen Zers like Conrad and Coralynn are questioning and pushing back against outdated norms. But it will take time, she said, and progress will only materialize if individual couples are prepared to confront these outdated norms head-on.

"Couples have to talk openly about expectations — who does what, what success means, what partnership really looks like — rather than just falling back on the old scripts," she says. "They need to redefine what success looks like in their marriage. Together, they can stop asking, 'Who's the breadwinner?' and start asking, 'How do we win together?'"

Dené Logan put it more bluntly: "Your husband is not the patriarchy." In other words, frustration over inequality in marriage often has roots beyond the individual relationship. And recognizing that distinction is key to avoiding misplaced resentment.

Progress won't come from paychecks alone. It will come, says Wilkins, "when we stop treating money as the measure of power in a marriage, and start seeing partnership as a balance of respect, care, and shared responsibility." Equality doesn't necessarily mean sameness, says Logan, it means rewriting the story of marriage for a new era.

In a world glued to screens, Aziz Ansari is choosing the analog life.

During an appearance on Tuesday's episode of the "Good Hang with Amy Poehler" podcast, the comedian spoke about his Luddite ways and why he isn't a fan of ChatGPT.

"I don't have email. I haven't had email for, like, 10 years. But I have an assistant," Ansari told podcast host Amy Poehler.

And it's not just his inbox that he's abandoned.

"I have a flip phone. If I get really lost, I've got to either ask people or just call my wife and be like 'Hey.' I've had to do that before, like, call my wife, and to the point where she's kind of used to it," Ansari said.

Instead of using an app to call for an Uber, Ansari says he hails a taxi. If there isn't one, he'll call, he added.

Living a low-tech lifestyle has its benefits, Ansari said.

"It just gives me more space to think. I mean, I heard something about, like, Tarantino doesn't even have a phone. Chris Nolan doesn't have a phone. I was like, 'Whoa, those guys are able to get a lot of stuff done. Maybe there's something to it,'" he said.

The comedian says he is also wary of ChatGPT.

"It's outsourcing critical thinking. It's making everyone's opinions kind of the same," Ansari said.

Not only is AI prone to making mistakes, it reinforces what people already think, he added.

The comedian said he once saw a commercial in which someone asked ChatGPT how to make dinner for a date.

"I would rather call someone and ask someone, or maybe have some sort of conversation, a human thing. It just seems like it's like outsourcing thinking, and it's like killing some bit of humanity," Ansari said.

Speaking to People in September, Ansari said he knows that his ability to live offline comes with a certain level of privilege and isn't realistic for everyone.

"But for me, it helps me keep a clear head to help me write and do what's more important for my job," he said.

A representative for Ansari did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.

Ansari isn't the only celebrity who has spoken about preferring an analog lifestyle.

In July 2023, Christopher Nolan said he doesn't carry a smartphone or use email. The filmmaker said he writes scripts on a computer without the internet.

"If I'm generating my material and writing my own scripts, being on a smartphone all day wouldn't be very useful for me," Nolan told The Hollywood Reporter.

Dolly Parton said during an October 2023 appearance on "The View" that she still prefers communicating via fax because otherwise, she'd be overwhelmed by all the messages she gets.

"So I never did get into getting involved in all that because it'll take up too much of my time if I talked to everybody who is trying to get in touch with me," Parton said.

In January, Christopher Walken told The Wall Street Journal that his relationship with technology is nearly nonexistent.

"I only have a satellite dish on my house. So I've seen 'Severance' on DVDs that they're good enough to send me. I don't have a cellphone. I've never emailed or, what do you call it, Twittered," Walken said.

It's not just Hollywood: In a May story, regular people told Business Insider that they swapped smartphones for dumb phones to wean themselves off their screens and social media.

Some Gen Zs are even chaining their smartphones to a wall — creating a makeshift landline —and freeing themselves from the urge to scroll.

Former Ford CEO Mark Fields said on Tuesday that US automakers overestimated consumer demand when they started ramping up production of electric vehicles.

"Over the last couple of years, the automakers really went full bore in putting in capacity for EVs," Fields, 64, told CNBC's "Power Lunch."

"They really didn't have a good discussion on the consumer, in terms of what it was going to take to get the consumer to buy these EV products," Fields said.

Representatives for Fields did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Fields started his career at Ford in 1989 after graduating with an MBA from Harvard Business School. He held a variety of senior leadership positions at Ford, and was the company's chief operating officer from 2012 to 2014 and its CEO from 2014 to 2017.

Some of the big bets automakers made on EVs have come undone "over the last 18 months or so," Fields told CNBC.

General Motors said in an exchange filing on Tuesday that it was taking a $1.6 billion charge "based on a planned strategic realignment of our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint to consumer demand."

The company said it expected the "adoption rate of EVs to slow" after the Trump administration eliminated federal EV incentives.

Under the Biden administration, EV buyers were entitled to a $7,500 consumer tax credit if they bought a new EV and a $4,000 consumer tax credit for a used EV. Both schemes expired on September 30.

"This is clearly an issue where the market didn't develop the way automakers thought. A lot of them, particularly in GM's case, boasted that they had the full lineup of EVs," Fields said on Tuesday.

"And what was an advantage, at least they thought at the time, has now probably turned into a bit of an albatross as the market take-up of EVs is going to be lower, at least in the near to medium term, than they plan for," he continued.

Auto chiefs have expressed mixed views on whether the rollback of federal EV incentives would hurt the US EV market.

Ford's current CEO, Jim Farley, said last month that the expiry of federal EV incentives could halve US EV sales.

"I think it's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought," Farley said on September 30.

Former Tesla president Jon McNeill, however, thought otherwise. McNeill said in an interview with CNBC on October 2 that the market can continue to "grow without subsidies."

"In Europe, France and Germany in particular rolled subsidies off a couple of years ago, and what happened after that, surprisingly, was the market continued to grow," McNeill said.

"That's largely because the models continue to roll out from other OEMs, much like they have here," McNeill added, using the acronym for original equipment manufacturers.

A federal jury is set to hear opening statements in Manhattan on Tuesday in the fraud and conspiracy trial of two MIT-educated brothers accused in a lightning-fast, $25 million cryptocurrency heist.

The defendants — Anton Peraire-Bueno, 25, of Boston, and James Peraire-Bueno, 29, of New York City — will face a jury of their peers in the complicated case, at least in terms of education.

The daylong jury selection on Monday resulted in a four-woman, eight-man panel consisting entirely of individuals with college degrees.

Half of the jurors hold master's degrees, including in finance, the sciences, medicine, and education.

The jurors, almost all of whom are middle- or retirement-aged, will return to court on Tuesday morning, when they'll be sworn in, listen to opening statements, and hear the first government witnesses by the end of the day.

The openings promise to describe a complex, multi-step transaction on the Ethereum blockchain that left the brothers $25 million richer, while a trio of traders were left holding a pile of worthless, illiquid junk crypto.

Prosecutors say the "first-of-its-kind" fraud scheme took months of meticulous planning and was executed in just 12 seconds on a day in April 2023.

Before and after the alleged exploit, prosecutors say, the brothers typed in internet searches that included: "how to wash crypto," "top crypto lawyers," "fraudulent Ethereum addresses database," and "money laundering statue [sic] of limitations."

Prosecutors allege that the brothers studied the trading behaviors of the victim traders before the heist, then took steps afterward to hide their identities and the location of the pilfered cryptocurrency. They've promised to reveal a web of shell companies, private cryptocurrency addresses, and foreign cryptocurrency exchanges.

"Using the specialized skills developed during their education, as well as their expertise in cryptocurrency trading," the brothers "exploited the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain," prosecutors said in a 19-page indictment last year.

The brothers, who remain free on $250,000 bail each, have strongly contested the prosecution's accusations.

Their defense attorneys have argued that there was no fraud at all and that they merely outsmarted some "predatory" automated trading bots.

The alleged victims lost their cryptocurrency "through pre-programmed trades without ever interacting with the Peraire-Buenos, directly or indirectly," the defense lawyers argued earlier this year, in a failed motion to dismiss the indictment.

In a blow to the defense last week, US District Judge Jessica G. L. Clarke barred the Peraire-Bueno's lawyers from arguing, as she put it, "that the victims deserved this."

The judge also barred defense experts from testifying about the lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency market.

The trial is expected to last into early November.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nian Yang-yi, 34, a barista turned quality control specialist at a coffee trading firm in Taiwan. The following has been translated and edited for length and clarity.

I chose to study computer science and information engineering in college because I didn't like interacting with people.

Programming seemed perfect: I could spend all day on a computer, coding and debugging. At the time, I was happy with this choice and imagined my future would follow that path.

But life is unexpected. In my third year of college, I had a sports accident that caused a retinal detachment. I went through surgery, and afterward, the doctor told me to rest and not overuse my eyes.

If I became an engineer right away, the pressure on my eyes would be even greater. So my plan was simple: work somewhere else for two or three years, let my eyes recover, and then return to writing code.

That's how I ended up at a café. At first, I didn't drink coffee at all, and I didn't like it. But my boss and coworkers encouraged me to try it. They brewed me a cup every day.

At first, I refused, but eventually I tried a cup — and something clicked. It felt like coding: Could I make this more precise, more efficient? Could I describe what I tasted so others could understand?

So, I started studying sensory skills and how to communicate flavors. That was how I became absorbed in coffee.

I worked as a barista at that café for 10 years.

Outside of work, I was still involved in coffee — going to tastings, events, and classes.

At first, I thought coffee was straightforward — as long as I could brew drinks that customers enjoyed and my coworkers liked, it felt like I had already learned everything there was to learn.

But once I started going out and experiencing more, I realized coffee is something you can never fully master. People often say the more you study a subject, the more you realize how little you understand — and that was exactly how I felt about coffee.

It was partly why I left the café to join a coffee trading firm. I had met the boss in a coffee course, and he asked years later if I wanted to try working there.

I felt I had to do it because coffee is not just about making drinks. It is a whole supply chain — farmers, importers, roasters — and I wanted to learn more.

I'm now in my third year as a quality control specialist.

In the café, my skills were in brewing and serving customers. But upstream, the needs are different: evaluating beans, checking consistency, and thinking about market demand.

When I moved, my salary dropped from nearly 50,000 Taiwan dollars a month, about $1,600, to about 35,000 Taiwan dollars. Now, I earn about 42,000 Taiwan dollars.

This job has broadened my perspective on the coffee supply chain. In my fourth month, I earned the internationally recognized Arabica Q Grader certification.

Coffee changed me as a person. I used to avoid human interaction, but being a barista meant I had to understand customers, chat, and connect with them.

At first, it was a big challenge. Conversations often dropped awkwardly. But over time, I developed ways to interact more comfortably, learned to listen, and sense how people were feeling.

In 2022, I started volunteering at a community café for Believe in Next Generation, a nonprofit, where I regularly serve as a barista when the café offers coffee for a donation.

The nonprofit is located in a military village, and some elderly residents would come early, wait for me, and smile when I arrived. They didn't directly say they needed companionship, but I could feel it.

Sometimes, they stayed in the café and told me their life stories and memories, many from Taiwan's martial law years or the Japanese colonial era.

This is one of coffee's meanings: It gives people a chance to gather and share their stories.

Some of my engineering friends have told me they envy me for turning my interest into a job — until the topic of salary comes up, because their salaries can be two to three times mine.

I have wondered whether I should continue doing what I want to do or return to a more practical job.

At this stage of life — from your twenties into your early thirties — many people are buying cars and houses. But coffee is the industry that makes me feel the happiest and most at ease.

Now, I live with my parents in New Taipei City and share a mortgage with my sister for our family home. I pay about 15,000 Taiwan dollars a month toward it.

To manage, I spend less on recreation, like traveling once every three or four years. Since coffee is also my hobby, most of my discretionary spending goes to coffee courses or activities.

I can usually save 10,000 to 15,000 Taiwan dollars a month.

I also look for ways to increase my income through side hustles, such as judging coffee competitions and teaching courses. These can add about 5% to 10% to my monthly income.

Some people choose high-paying jobs and use their salaries to fund hobbies. Others, like me, turned their passion into work, even with less money.

The first step is to imagine the kind of life you want, and then decide if your passion is strong enough to carry you there.

If I could start over, my choice probably wouldn't change — it would still be coffee.

Eric Trump, son of U.S. President Donald Trump and a co-founder of decentralized finance protocol WLFI$0.1394, said he is actively working on a real estate tokenization project tied to a building currently under development.

Teasing the plan in an interview with CoinDesk TV coming next week, he said the effort may offer fractional ownership to the public, potentially using the crypto rails built by World Liberty Financial.

"We are working on it as it pertains to one specific building that I'm doing right now," Trump said in the interview. "I think it's going to be absolutely incredible."

His comments followed Zach Witkoff, another WLFI co-founder, who floated plans to bring the Trump real estate portfolio onchain during a panel discussion at the Token2049 event in Singapore in early October.

Tokenization refers to the process of turning traditional assets such as bonds, credit, equity – or, as in this case – real estate into digital tokens that can be bought, sold and transferred on blockchain rails. It's a model increasingly explored by global banks and asset managers as a way to unlock liquidity and broaden investor access to traditionally exclusive asset classes.

Trump suggested in the interview on Wednesday that applying the tokenization model could open investment opportunities to his family's global base of supporters. He said he envisions offering micro-shares in "high-profile properties" directly to retail investors, instead of getting financing through traditional lenders.

"If I decided to build a hotel in Washington, D.C. or in Dubai or in New York, why do I have to go out using Deutsche Bank?" he said. "Why can't I go out to the masses?"

He described a model where investors might contribute as little as $1,000 to gain partial ownership of a building, with added benefits like hotel perks or exclusive access.

While details remain scarce, he indicated the initiative would be integrated with World Liberty Financial and its U.S. dollar stablecoin USD1. World Liberty Financial launched last year with a focus on merging crypto infrastructure with traditional financial services.

The protocol announced plans last month to roll out a debit card and retail application soon, a move that would make the USD1 stablecoin available for everyday payments, CoinDesk reported.

The full interview will air on October 21 on CoinDesk's YouTube channel.

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) is battling to hold the $4,000 level while Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA) clings to $0.65, with both charts nearing breakout zones that could decide the next altcoin rally.

ADA Key Technical Levels (Source: TradingView)

Cardano's price structure that began in November 2024 is reaching its apex. 

The token trades around $0.67 as of Oct. 15, after sliding toward the lower boundary of a long-term symmetrical triangle.

The daily chart shows consolidation between descending resistance from the $1.50 peak and ascending support near $0.42. 

ADA recently retested this base after rejection at $0.95 earlier in October. 

Major EMAs now act as layered resistance between $0.77 and $0.84. 

The Parabolic SAR aligns near $0.84, reinforcing this ceiling.

A drop below $0.65 could expose stronger demand near $0.55 to $0.58. 

A rebound above $0.77 may open targets at $0.80 and $1.00 if momentum improves.

ADA Netflows (Source: Coinglass)

On-chain data shows consistent outflows in October, indicating that investors are moving ADA to private wallets. 

Netflows on Oct. 15 totaled negative $8.08 million. While this reduces selling pressure, it also narrows trading liquidity.

ADA Derivqtive Analysis (Source: Coinglass)

Derivatives activity has declined sharply. ADA futures volume is down 34.9% on the day, and open interest has slipped 3.7% to $682 million. 

Options volume is nearly inactive, down 92.9%. Long-short ratios still favor bulls, with Binance accounts showing 2.6 longs for every short.

In the last 24 hours, $2.04 million in ADA positions were liquidated, mostly from longs. The data shows leveraged traders remain exposed even as overall positioning turns cautious.

ETH Price Analysis (Source: TradingView)

Ethereum slipped to $3,996 on Oct. 15, down about 3% in the session, testing key support within its year-long ascending triangle. 

The move follows heavy exchange outflows and increased liquidations across derivatives markets.

The daily chart shows ETH compressed between an ascending trendline from April and descending resistance from the $4,800 peak. 

Price now trades near $3,950 to $4,000, where the 50-day EMA ($3,979) offers immediate support. 

A hold above this range could spark a rebound toward $4,230 and $4,639. A close below may expose the 200-day EMA at $3,546 and deeper support near $3,400.

The Parabolic SAR remains overhead at $4,639, signaling that buyers have yet to regain control.

ETH Netflows (Source: Coinglass)

Exchange data shows $65.28 million in ETH outflows on Oct. 15, consistent with the broader trend of coins moving off exchanges. 

This often signals accumulation but also reduces liquidity, which can amplify volatility during sharp moves.

ETH futures volume fell 25.8% to $107.6 billion, and open interest dropped 2% to $46.7 billion. 

Options trading also slowed. Despite lower volume, positioning remains bullish. Binance accounts show a 2.4-to-1 long-short ratio, with top traders holding similar exposure.

Liquidation data reveals ongoing stress. Over the past 24 hours, $125 million in ETH positions were liquidated, including $77 million in longs. 

The figures show that optimism persists, but leveraged positions remain vulnerable to another dip.

SEC filings show Bitmain gave firm partially owned by Eric Trump unusually generous terms on equipment

A private Chinese company is giving preferential access to its technology and providing unusually beneficial payment terms on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of specialized equipment to a firm partially owned by Eric Trump, according to industry sources and Securities and Exchange Commission records.

The company, Bitmain, has faced concerns over the potential national security risks of its technology, with one Republican congressman asking the treasury department to review some of its business dealings in the United States.

American Bitcoin Corporation was founded in March, just two months after Donald Trump's inauguration. Eric Trump currently has a 7.5% stake in the company, SEC filings show. Created through a daisy chain of mergers, and majority owned by a company called Hut 8, American Bitcoin went public with overwhelming publicity on 3 September on the Nasdaq exchange. Though the phenomenal stock profits of the Trump venture have been previously reported, the fact that Bitmain appears to be providing preferential access and payment terms to the operation has not been previously reported.

Filings by American Bitcoin with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that the company is purchasing more than 16,000 advanced mining machines – servers that process complex math problems to earn Bitcoin – from Bitmain.

The SEC filings indicate that American Bitcoin is paying Bitmain in “pledged” bitcoin – rather than cash – which could be redeemed up to two years from now, at a current price. An industry expert said he was briefed on the American Bitcoin deals and that Bitmain was offering the company unique and favorable terms, with little money down, and such a long period of time for redeeming their collateral.

In May, at a Las Vegas bitcoin conference sponsored by Bitmain, the president of American Bitcoin, Matt Prusak, underscored the political nature of the bitcoin industry. “If you think you're in the energy business or compute business or bitcoin business you're half right,” he told the audience. “Underneath it all you're in the business of politics, in the politics business.”

Favorable treatment by Bitmain is a main ingredient of the American Bitcoin venture. “Preferential access” to the technology it buys from Bitmain is “central to American Bitcoin's ability to maintain a structural cost advantage”, according to an American Bitcoin press release last month.

In a statement to the Guardian, Bitmain said “technical cooperation” with American Bitcoin's majority owner Hut 8 was specific to one type of mining machine, and was with Hut 8 rather than American Bitcoin. Hut 8 and American both list the same address in Miami on filings with the US government, and Hut 8 handles all of American Bitcoin's operations and infrastructure.

Bitmain, in its statement to the Guardian, said it offers “pledged bitcoin” to other customers. But in a May announcement the company said it would offer a six-month redemption period for these pledges, not a 24-month term, as it offers American Bitcoin.

Experts say American Bitcoin's special access to Bitmain's technology and financing terms raise concerns that the Chinese entity views business with the Trump sons as an opportunity to try to influence the Trump administration on a variety of issues: crypto regulation, energy, or China policy.

“The disclosed terms are pretty unusual,” said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. “It's one thing to extend credit. But the weird part is: ‘you have the option to buy back when you're mining at a discount,'” he said. “If the president's family was involved it brings up the obvious question of whether Bitmain is trying to get special treatment.”

Even the appearance of impropriety can be problematic, said Eric Chaffee, a professor of law at Case Western, who cautioned that at the same time all the facts are not known. “This does look a bit like a sweetheart deal where the reason they are doing this is to curry some influence with the Trump administration,” he said. “This looks bad but at the same time there could be underlying facts that make it a fair deal.”

A spokesperson for Hut 8, Gautier Lemyze-Young, did not dispute the financing terms involved bitcoin with a 24-month window but said the terms were agreed to “in September 2024 long before the launch of American Bitcoin”.

The transaction at issue, though, was done by American Bitcoin, and was revealed in August 2025.

On the day American Bitcoin went public a company executive posted a photo of the team, including Eric and Don Jr, on X, with the phrase “And we are off to the races.”

Lemyze-Young said in the statement that the close work with the Chinese company stemmed from a longstanding relationship and was due to “results, not politics or external affiliations”.

Eric Trump did not respond to detailed requests for comment emailed to American Bitcoin and the Trump Organization, where he is executive vice-president.

A former company executive who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Guardian that the Trump family involvement, announced publicly in March, was known months earlier to insiders as the mergers were organized to form American Bitcoin. “We knew well in advance that they were involved. That's why we wanted to do it,” he said, referring to a merger. “They have some access at the White House. Better than not having it. That's certainly a bonus.”

It is not the first crypto venture of the Trump family to raise questions about foreign influence. An entirely separate Trump cryptocurrency business, World Liberty Financial, which has no ties to American Bitcoin except the Eric Trump ownership, announced in May that the United Arab Emirates would use its stablecoin in a transaction in which it made a $2bn investment involving a separate cryptocurrency exchange.

But American Bitcoin stands out in part because so many threads intersect with US policy: Trump has announced a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve”, which may help drive up bitcoin's price; has loosened regulations on energy, which is key to cheap bitcoin mining; and has launched policies on China that often seem to pivot back and forth between aggressive economic confrontation and conciliation.

Eric Trump has been promoting American Bitcoin and the stock, appearing with company executives at investor forums and business news broadcasts, repeating that the Trump family had turned to cryptocurrency because it was “debanked” following the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol.

“We developed a company named American Bitcoin. We are one of the biggest bitcoin mining companies on Earth,” he told a conference last month, claiming the price of bitcoin would shoot to a million dollars, an eightfold increase from the present.

Bitmain is not regulated by US agencies but there have been concerns about the company's technology. Last month the Republican congressman Zachary Nunn, of Iowa, pressed the treasury department to review Bitmain and another Chinese bitcoin company. In a statement to the Guardian, Nunn wrote: “American families deserve to know that our power grid, digital infrastructure, and national security aren't being compromised by foreign entities with opaque ownership and ties to hostile regimes.”

In Bitmain's statement to the Guardian, the company said it responded to his office, and said it “strictly complies with US and applicable laws and regulations and has never engaged in activities that pose risks to US national security”.

A former U.S. citizen who earned the moniker “Bitcoin Jesus” for his evangelism of cryptocurrency has agreed to pay the IRS nearly $50 million in back taxes in exchange for dropping its criminal case against him.

Roger Ver once owned two computer companies in Santa Clara. But he said goodbye to the United States in 2014 and moved to the eastern Caribbean Sea, specifically the island country St. Kitts and Nevis. 

When he renounced his U.S. citizenship, Ver owned roughly 131,000 Bitcoins either personally or through companies that he owned, according to federal prosecutors. At the time, Bitcoins traded for around $871 each and Ver was required to pay an “exit tax” on his capital gains. 

He hired a law firm to help him with his expatriation process and prepare his tax returns, along with an appraiser to value his companies. But prosecutors say he provided false or misleading information to the law firm and appraiser by hiding the actual number of Bitcoins he owned.

The following year, an appraiser Ver hired to value his companies asked him in an email to provide the number of Bitcoins he owned when he expatriated. That appraiser copied Ver's attorney in the email, but Ver did not provide a clear answer, according to court documents.

Federal public defenders in Los Angeles have accused the Trump administration of circumventing rules with the way acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli was appointed.

Ver asked, “[c]ompletely hypothetically speaking, what would the ramifications be if I were to have had 200,000 [bitcoins] at the time of my renunciation?”

The lawyer advised Ver to get an appraisal of his personally held Bitcoins from a “third party who [had] no personal interest in the tax implications of the appraisal,” according to court documents.

Ver continued to provide unclear responses to the appraiser. In some emails, the appraiser asked point blank for a number, but instead Ver wrote back about the state of the cryptocurrency market. 

“I actually have all the information you need to make it super easy for you. I would just need to explain it all, and then you would affix your name to it,” Ver wrote in an October 2015 email.

He then filed false returns in May 2016, which omitted the true number of Bitcoins he owned. 

By November 2017, Ver had sold tens of thousands of Bitcoins on cryptocurrency exchanges for approximately $240 million in cash, according to federal prosecutors. Even though he was no longer a U.S. citizen, Ver was required to report his earnings to the IRS and pay taxes, because his companies were U.S. corporations. 

A federal grand jury indicted Ver in April 2024 for mail fraud, two counts of tax evasion and three counts of subscription to a false tax return. At the time, he was living in Tokyo but was arrested in Spain. 

Ver agreed to pay his back taxes under an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office and the charges against him are set to be dismissed. 

“Mr. Ver is accepting responsibility for his actions and has agreed to pay a substantial penalty,” acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli said in a statement. “Every person, whether you're a millionaire or not, is required by law to pay taxes and we will not hesitate to hold anyone accountable.”

Through his attorney, Ver said in a statement, “I am very grateful this case has been dismissed and appreciate the Trump Administration's leadership and professionalism in working towards this final resolution. I am also grateful to everyone who supported me and sought justice in my case.”

The whole crypto community just went through one of the biggest liquidation events in history.
Billions of dollars in leveraged positions were wiped out in just 24 hours.

Bitcoin plunged, Ethereum followed, and panic spread across almost every major altcoin. Some of them dipped by more than 50%. Yet, if there's one thing every experienced investor knows—these violent shakeouts often mark the beginning of the next big run.

When the weak hands are flushed out, the smart money starts hunting for the next 100x opportunity. And right now, three names are catching that attention. One of them is already live in the App Store and building real-world utility. Let's go through the top 3 altcoins to watch after this crash.

Digitap ($TAP) is quietly becoming a hot story in crypto. The reason is simple—Digitap has an entire live financial ecosystem, available today on both the App Store and Google Play.

It's the world's first omni-bank, combining crypto and traditional finance under one roof. Inside the app, users can open multi-currency IBAN accounts, order Visa-backed cards, and manage both fiat and crypto balances seamlessly.

It supports instant crypto-to-fiat conversion, Apple Pay and Google Pay integration, and offshore accounts for global accessibility.

This makes Digitap a safe haven during liquidation events. When exchanges freeze withdrawals or traders panic-sell, Digitap users can still convert assets instantly. It's practical, real, and already working.

But it's not just the app that's getting a lot of attention. The native token, $TAP, powers all transactions, card rewards, and in-app staking. A fixed portion of ecosystem revenue goes directly into buybacks and token burns, reducing supply and supporting long-term price stability.

The presale is moving fast:

That's a 22% increase coming in the next round—and with over 57 million tokens already sold, early investors are rushing in before the next stage closes.

Digitap is already a functioning fintech platform with real adoption, a working app, and revenue mechanics that protect holders even when the market collapses. That's why many see $TAP as one of the most resilient and fundamentally strong altcoins in 2025.

Next up is Giggle (GIGGLE), the crypto project backed by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ). Giggle powers Giggle Academy, a Web3 education initiative designed to provide free, global access to learning through blockchain transparency.

Here's how it works: Giggle runs on the BNB Smart Chain, keeping transaction fees low and speeds high. Every transaction comes with a 5% tax, and part of that tax automatically funds Giggle Academy's donation wallet.

That wallet supports the development of AI-assisted learning tools, gamified educational content, and programs targeting underserved regions around the world. All funds are on-chain and traceable, ensuring transparency—something rare even among traditional NGOs.

What makes Giggle special is its mix of meme-coin energy and real-world impact. Every trade helps fund free education while keeping the community engaged through trading volume.

With a market cap near $100 million, it's still early days for GIGGLE. Considering CZ's reputation, the transparency model, and the narrative of “doing good through crypto,” this project could easily become one of the standout tokens of this cycle.

The third altcoin on this list needs no introduction—Solana (SOL). Even during the recent market crash, Solana held up much better than most altcoins, recovering faster than Ethereum and maintaining strong ecosystem activity.

Why is that happening? Institutional interest.



Source: X/@solana

In the past year, Solana generated $2.85 billion in ecosystem revenue, spanning from DeFi platforms to trading and even AI-based applications. That's more than Ethereum produced in its early growth phase, and it shows how diverse and powerful the Solana economy has become.

Even more interesting—multiple Solana ETFs are now pending SEC approval. Once those get the green light, institutional investors will gain direct access to Solana exposure, which could bring billions in new liquidity.

From public companies adding SOL to their treasuries to massive growth in active wallets, Solana's fundamentals remain incredibly strong. Anything under $200 could be viewed as a strategic entry zone ahead of the ETF wave.

For investors who prefer established altcoins, SOL remains one of the safest high-growth plays for 2025.

Each of these three projects offers something unique. Solana brings institutional adoption and ETF potential. Giggle merges philanthropy and meme-driven community culture. But Digitap is the only one already live, already earning, and already changing how people use crypto daily.

When the next market cycle begins, investors will look for real utility, revenue-backed models, and live products. Digitap checks all those boxes. With the next presale stage price jumping from $0.0159 to $0.0194, this might be the last window to get in early before the broader market catches on.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin belongs in the debasement trade — despite dropping $10,000 in the same week gold topped a fresh price record.

That's according to analysts who say last week's brutal sell off, which wiped out around $19 billion in leveraged positions from the broader crypto market, was driven by technical factors rather than a fundamental breakdown in Bitcoin's store-of-value thesis.

“The crash on Friday was mostly due to technical reasons related to leverage in perps markets, so nothing has fundamentally changed in the thesis for Bitcoin as a store of value,” Carlos Guzmán, analyst at research firm GSR, told DL News. 

“Bitcoin still qualifies for the debasement trade.”

Last week's crash came as investors fled risk assets following US President Donald Trump's latest tariff threats.

Meanwhile, gold stormed past $4,200 per ounce, up over 50% year-to-date. The precious metal's performance has raised questions about whether Bitcoin truly belongs in the same conversation as gold when it comes to hedging against government dysfunction and macro uncertainty.

JPMorgan analysts coined the debasement trade as a bet against governments' ability to manage their finances.

Basically, investors pull away from sovereign debt and fiat currencies, fearful their value will erode as governments address massive debt burdens by simply printing more money.

But concerns have compounded in recent months.

In the US, Trump's assault on Federal Reserve independence have sown doubts about whether Treasuries will continue to enjoy their status as the world's main risk-free asset. And this marks the second week of a government shutdown that has stymied the release of key economic data.

In this environment, gold has been the clear winner.

Even Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase CEO and a historic gold bear, has said it is “semi-rational” to hold some of the yellow metal.

For Guzman, however, Bitcoin's latest crash may tarnish its reputation as a hedge against inflation.

“Bitcoin has been in this awkward position where its main value proposition is as a store of value and protection against debasement, but it tends to trade with tech stocks instead of gold,” he told DL News.

“Last Friday's crash may be viewed as lending support to the latter view.”

But Guzman sees this as temporary.

“As the market matures and a greater proportion of Bitcoin trades in large, regulated, onshore venues, crypto-native liquidation cascades will have less impact,” he said.

André Dragosch, European head of research at Bitwise, expects Bitcoin to catch up to gold's performance in the coming months.

“There is increasing performance asymmetry in favour of Bitcoin,” he said.

Dragosch reckons three factors should drive Bitcoin higher: Bitcoin's historical relationship with global money supply reasserting itself, improving global growth expectations due to accelerating liquidity, and the relative performance between Bitcoin and gold appearing oversold by more than two standard deviations.

Although Dragosch suggests investors shouldn't use global money supply to predict Bitcoin price, there has been a long-running relationship between the two.

“Bitcoin has been undershooting global money supply, but I think that the long-run relationship between Bitcoin and global money supply will reassert itself,” Dragosch told DL News.

“The moment you see a renewed risk on, Bitcoin should outperform gold again, which I am expecting into a seasonally strong Q4.”

For now, Bitcoin remains caught between two identities: the digital gold narrative that believers have been promoting, and the reality of a volatile asset still prone to violent selloffs.

Coinbase surprised crypto markets on Wednesday by unveiling a new issuer-facing listings program and, minutes later, adding BNB to its listing roadmap — an unexpected nod to the flagship token of its biggest rival.

At 4:12 p.m. UTC, the Coinbase Markets account on X introduced “The Blue Carpet,” a revamped asset-listing experience aimed at making the process more transparent for onchain builders. 

According to Coinbase's blog post, the bundle offers a direct line to the listings team for tailored guidance, the ability to request updates to an asset's page across Coinbase's centralized exchange and its retail DEX, referral discounts for services such as MiCA whitepaper support and market-maker matching, and limited Coinbase One subscriptions for select core team members. Coinbase reiterated that applications and listings are free and that issuers are not required to purchase ancillary services.

At 4:45 p.m. UTC, Coinbase Markets posted that BNB had been added to the roadmap. As with other roadmap items, the signal reflects intent rather than immediate availability. Roadmap inclusion does not ensure a listing; Coinbase can delay or decline assets if liquidity, technical, compliance, or other requirements are not satisfied. Coinbase said trading will be announced separately once sufficient market-making support and infrastructure are in place.

The timing is notable. 

Just nine days earlier, Arca CIO Jeff Dorman published a critique arguing Coinbase lists “some of the absolute worst assets” while ignoring “the best ones,” and he highlighted tokens issued by rival platforms — including BNB — as examples of high performers the exchange had historically not offered. He said an exchange should either list widely and be neutral, or curate the “best assets” like a broker, and faulted Coinbase for falling between those models. 

Dorman further contrasted BNB, LEO, TRX and HYPE — citing revenue-backed buybacks and strong tokenomics — with what he called inflationary tokens and opaque listing practices, framing Coinbase's approach as selectively exclusionary. Against that backdrop, adding BNB to the roadmap looks like a meaningful shift in posture, even if a listing is not guaranteed. 

Beyond its 2017 origins as a trading-fee token, BNB now serves as the primary gas asset for BNB Chain transactions and is used across that network for payments, staking, token launches and governance proposals — functioning as the chain's transaction fuel and utility token.

Pairing the Blue Carpet rollout with a high-profile roadmap addition signals Coinbase aims to court major nonnative assets when liquidity, compliance and technical standards are met — rival affiliations notwithstanding. 

At the time of writing, bnb was $1,164.33, down 4.7% in the past 24 hours.

MegaETH, an Ethereum-compatible ‘real-time' blockchain, appears to be planning an initial coin offering (ICO). 

This potential public token sale would take place on Sonar, a self-hosted token launch platform created by crypto investor Jordan “Cobie” Fish, who is also a co-founder of Lido. “The First Real-Time Blockchain. Built for you. Owned by you. Register now,” MegaETH's team shared on X earlier today. 

ICOs – which are a way for crypto projects to raise funds – are making a comeback in 2025, with MegaETH's move showing a shift toward community-focused, transparent sales to drive user engagement and ecosystem growth.

According to the project's website, the registration window is open from today to Oct. 27. While MegaETH says details of a “potential crypto-asset offering” will be announced soon, it emphasized that registration does not guarantee allocation or constitute a sale. No terms of the potential deal have been disclosed.

Registration is open to anyone who completes identity verification on the Sonar platform, excluding MegaETH employees and users from prohibited areas. Individuals from the U.S. must also meet accredited investor requirements and will be subject to a 12-month lockup, MegaETH's website notes. 

Earlier this year, MegaETH announced plans to distribute its tokens through a new ICO model built around a soulbound NFT mint for its pioneer collection, The Fluffle. MegaETH said the NFT model was chosen to reward genuine community participation rather than speculative farming, The Defiant previously reported. 

“A simple points program tied to an airdrop often creates perverse incentives—especially when deployed by a blockchain—driving inauthentic behavior and ‘farming,' which raises questions about real value creation and leaves everyone dissatisfied,” the announcement noted.

This latest announcement also follows MegaETH Labs' recent launch of MegaUSD (USDm), a native stablecoin developed in collaboration with Ethena Labs using its Stablecoin-as-a-Service stack.

“$USDM aligns incentives across stakeholders, letting users and apps enjoy the lowest fees possible while routing scalable value back to MegaETH,” MegaETH said in a post on X on Sept. 8.

MegaETH initially raised $10 million through Echo in December 2024.

TOPICS:

HUNT VALLEY, Md. (TNND) — The Department of Justice (DOJ) sued Tuesday to confiscate about $15 billion worth of bitcoin, the largest forfeiture action in the DOJ's history.

New York federal prosecutors and the DOJ's National Security Division filed a civil forfeiture complaint against the funds, which are the alleged proceeds and instruments of fraud and money laundering schemes directed by a Cambodian businessman.

The bitcoin, which total over 127,000, are now in the federal government's custody, the DOJ said. 

They were allegedly accessed through private crypto “wallets” with keys in the possession of the businessman, Chen Zhi. He is a Cambodian conglomerate chairman whom U.S. prosecutors accuse of laundering crypto to hide its source. Chen directed associates of the conglomerate, Prince Holding Group, to conceal the sources of its profits, which the DOJ claims are victims in New York City and other places across the world, according to prosecutors.

“As alleged, the defendant directed one of the largest investment fraud operations in history, fueling an illicit industry that is reaching epidemic proportions,” U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr. for the Eastern District of New York said in a statement. 



Chen allegedly orchestrated Prince Holding Group's profits through Cambodian compounds that carried out crypto investment schemes. The DOJ said that hundreds of workers, who were trafficked into the facilities against their will, executed the scams by convincing victims to transfer crypto to accounts controlled by the conglomerate. The workers promised the victims their funds would be invested and would generate profits, but the crypto was actually stolen and laundered, prosecutors claimed.

“This is an individual who allegedly operated a vast criminal network across multiple continents involving forced labor, money laundering, investment schemes, and stolen assets – targeting millions of innocent victims in the process,” FBI Director Kash Patel said, referring to Chen. “Justice will be done and I'm proud of the men and women of the FBI who executed this mission faithfully.”

The alleged scam workers in the compounds often developed relationships with victims through messaging or social media apps. 

The DOJ claimed they operated under violent threats while in the facilities, which were surrounded by high walls and barbed wire. Some of the scammers were subjected to torture and were beat, which Chen knew of, according to prosecutors. He allegedly kept records of each compound, including photos of violence committed against the workers.

“Today's action represents one of the most significant strikes ever against the global scourge of human trafficking and cyber-enabled financial fraud,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a joint statement. 



The DOJ noted that Chen and other Prince Holding Group executives used their political influence in multiple foreign countries to protect their scheme, bribing public officials to avoid law enforcement. 

Chen also used some profits for luxury travel and entertainment and to buy private jets, yachts, vacation homes, watches, collectables and a Pablo Picasso painting. The chairman, who is facing conspiracy charges for wire fraud and money laundering, would face at most 40 years in prison if he is convicted. He was at large as of Tuesday.



The Department of the Treasury has also sanctioned Chen and designated Prince Holding Group as a transnational criminal organization.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

The Ethereum Foundation is expanding its DeFi-focused treasury management strategy with a fresh deployment of 2,400 ETH, worth some $9.6 million, and about $6 million worth of stablecoins, in a yield-bearing Morpho vault, according to an announcement on Wednesday.

"Morpho is a pioneer in permissionless DeFi protocols and consistently demonstrates a commitment to Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) principles," the foundation wrote on X, explaining that both Morpho Vault v2 and Morpho Blue v1 were released under an open GPL2.0 license.

Facing criticism earlier this year over its routine sales of ETH to fund its operations, the non-profit Ethereum Foundation announced a plan to move a portion of its treasury into DeFi protocols, beginning with 50,000 ETH.

The foundation has since moved millions worth of funds onto platforms like Compound, an OG lending protocol, and Spark, part of the Sky (formerly MakerDAO) ecosystem. That said, it also continues to sell crypto assets for fiat on centralized exchanges to fund blockchain research and development.

According to Arkham Intelligence, the Ethereum Foundation holds over $820 million worth of crypto assets, including $735 million worth of ETH, at current prices, according to The Block's ETH price page.

Founded in 2022, Morpho is a decentralized lending protocol on Ethereum that has become a popular institutional option. For instance, Coinbase recently surpassed $1 billion worth of bitcoin-backed onchain loan originations using Morpho, just eight months after the service launched.

Some $4.6 billion has been locked on Morpho Blue v1, a small fraction of the total Ethereum lending market, but in line with rivals like Compound, Spark, and older versions of Aave, according to The Block's data.

If Ethereum ever reaches $100,000, the ecosystem could grow into a $12 trillion digital economy.

It sounds almost impossible, yet some investors are starting to wonder what would happen if Ethereum (ETH-USD) really did reach $100,000. At this level, Ethereum  would no longer be just another cryptocurrency. It would become one of the largest financial ecosystems in history.





At a $100,000 price, Ethereum's current circulating supply of around 121 million ETH would be worth nearly $12.1 trillion. This is more than three times Apple's (AAPL) market capitalization and close to half the total value of gold. These are world-shifting numbers that could redefine what digital assets mean for global finance.

If Ethereum reached six figures, about 36 million ETH or roughly 30% of supply would likely remain staked, which would represent around $3.6 trillion locked up in network security. At this scale, Ethereum would function as a global digital economy with its own financial infrastructure.

Every part of the network would expand in value. Transaction fees, validator rewards, and the amount of ETH permanently removed from circulation through burning would all rise in U.S. dollar terms. The entire system would start to resemble a digital nation with its own monetary policy and incentives.

Getting to $100,000 would require more than retail enthusiasm. It would take a steady flow of institutional money. Spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have already shown that traditional investors are willing to buy and hold ETH.

If pensions, wealth managers, and retirement funds begin to treat ETH as a long-term asset class, their constant inflows could keep buying pressure high. This type of structural demand would provide stability instead of relying on hype or short-term speculation.

Another major force could come from tokenized dollars. Stablecoins and digital U.S. Treasury funds now move billions across Ethereum each day. As these assets grow, Ethereum becomes the main payment and settlement layer of the digital economy, which continually drives demand for ETH.

ETH's design already supports long-term scarcity. The network burns a portion of transaction fees in every block, reducing supply over time. Meanwhile, staking continues to remove large amounts of ETH from circulation.

Overall, roughly a third of all ETH locked up, therefore the available supply in markets becomes increasingly limited. When this shrinking supply meets consistent institutional demand, the conditions for higher prices become stronger.

At $100,000 per ETH, the scale of Ethereum's “security budget” would be staggering. The network pays validators in new ETH and fees to keep it secure. Even small changes in issuance would mean huge shifts in dollar terms.

If 100,000 ETH were issued in a year, validators would earn $10 billion. At 300,000 ETH, this number jumps to $30 billion. If the issuance reached 1 million ETH, the total security payout would reach $100 billion a year. These figures show how Ethereum's economic size directly fuels its protection.

At such a high price, ordinary users would not tolerate expensive transactions. This is why Ethereum's Layer 2 networks are so important. These secondary systems handle most transactions for just a few cents while still using ETH to settle on the main chain.

The Dencun upgrade helped by introducing “blob” data storage, which reduced costs for these networks. This setup allows Ethereum to scale for millions of users while keeping fees manageable and still ensuring ETH remains central to the entire system.

If ETH did climb to $100,000, it would likely be driven by several forces working together. ETFs would create consistent buying pressure from long-term investors. DeFi (decentralized finance) would expand as higher prices increase the value of collateral and boost lending activity.

Stablecoins would keep the system running smoothly by providing liquidity for payments and trading. Together, these elements could sustain a healthy balance between buying, staking, and burning ETH, keeping the ecosystem active and valuable.

Rapid growth brings new dangers. A multitrillion-dollar Ethereum would attract much closer scrutiny from global regulators. Oversight of staking providers, liquid staking tokens, and ETFs would increase sharply.

Technical risks would also rise. Larger stakes mean higher rewards for attackers, making network decentralization and validator diversity even more important. Any sign of centralization or technical weakness could trigger sharp market reactions.

Reaching $100,000 per ETH would take years of consistent growth, stable regulation, and strong technical execution. It would not happen overnight or from a single upgrade. It would depend on a deep integration of Ethereum into global finance, where everything from digital dollars to investment funds depends on its infrastructure.

If that vision becomes real, Ethereum would evolve from a blockchain network into a core part of the world's economic system. It would represent a new era in how technology, money, and trust connect — and show just how far one decentralized idea can go.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is sitting at $4,018.90.

Nigel Farage, the leader of political party Reform UK – currently riding high in opinion polls – has told an event audience that he wants to “bring crypto in from the cold” and put an immediate halt to work on a potential UK central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Farage – a former Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1999 until the UK's withdrawal from the European Union (EU) in 2020, a move he campaigned for – is one of the best-known figures in British politics. Reform UK has just five members of Parliament but has recently consistently polled above the ruling Labour Party and opposition Conservatives, leading to growing talk of Farage as a potential prime minister.

Farage took part in a fireside chat on the opening day of the ‘Digital Asset Summit 2025', an event organised in London on 13-15 October by US-based financial media, research and events firm Blockworks. During a 30-minute conversation he highlighted some the promises made in a ‘Cryptoassets and Digital Finance Bill' (or, in its own words, ‘statement of intent') published by Reform in May that set out a ‘post-Brexit roadmap to make the United Kingdom the world's premier hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation.'

“I was in the European Parliament for over 20 years but I don't regard myself as a politician,” he told the audience, ahead of positively answering the opening question as to whether he believed he was the UK's next prime minister. Farage began his career as a commodities trader in the City. “I still regard myself much more as a businessman who's in politics because things need fixing,” he said.

Duirng the discussion he went on to slam “over-regulation” in the City and tell digital asset industry representatives in the audience that “I am your champion.”

Reform's seven-page ‘bill' included a plan for HM Treasury to create and manage a ‘Bitcoin Reserve Fund' as part of the UK's official reserves. This is following the example of the US, where president Donald Trump signed an executive order in March to create a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve' and ‘Digital Asset Stockpile'.

The document also specified ‘Rapid Policy-Making Timelines', stating that ‘any government taskforce or commission on crypto is limited to 90 days (extendable by 30 days only with parliamentary approval) to prevent bureaucratic drift and keep the UK well ahead of slow EU processes.'

“We're [the UK] losing reinsurance businesses off to Bermuda, etc, and this whole area of digital assets and crypto just isn't being talked about at all,” Farage said at the Blockworks event.  

“I was the first prominent person in British politics to adopt crypto, to talk about crypto, to try and legitimise crypto, which was in 2020,” he said. “One of the reasons I'm here today [at the conference] is my deep frustration that despite one speech by [former Conservative PM] Rishi Sunak in this space, the Conservatives [and] the Labour Party have done nothing in this area.”

Referring to Reform's stated plans, he said: “If we win the next general election, will put [it] into law very, very quickly, and we will effectively bring crypto in from the cold.”

The Labour government was elected in July 2024 in a landslide win that ended 14 years of Conservative rule. In March this year PM Sir Keir Starmer in spoke of planned ‘fundamental reform of the British state', saying that politicians had for years “hid[den] behind a vast array of quangos, arms-length bodies and regulators… a sort of cottage industry of checkers and blockers.”

Farage wants “appropriate” regulation.

“When I started [working in the City], you could put a brass plaque outside your front door and say ‘commodity broker' and there were a few cowboys around,” he said. “I think a degree of regulation that gives consumers confidence is what you need. By the time I left the City in 2004, I saw compliance departments getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger, and, effectively, their job was to stop you doing business, to stop you innovating. So over-regulation is a curse.”

“I saw it [regulation] go massively over the top,” he continued. “A lot of that was because we were in the globalist European Union, which is the most heavily regulated marketplace on Earth – which is why it's going down the tubes, frankly. “

“So, yes, I'm all for appropriate regulation,” he said. “But the next British government needs to deregulate: deregulate financial services, deregulate small business, deregulate entrepreneurship. And we have to get the tax burden right because, at the moment, the flight of capital, the flight of brains from this country is frankly disastrous.”

Farage was talking on stage to Blockworks co-founder Michael Ippolito in a session titled ‘The Future of Digital Assets in the UK'.

He criticised his fellow parliamentarians for a perceived lack of knowledge and interest in digital finance-related topics.

“If you had this conversation with 95 per cent of current regulators in the House of Commons or the House of Lords, you may as well be speaking Swahili to them. They don't know anything about the space – they don't want to know anything about the space,” he said.

He also aimed his fire at the Bank of England (BoE), criticising the central bank for a cautious stance over cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins.

“I remember when I came out publicly saying that, actually, people should hold crypto as part of their portfolio – and that was in 2020, when I said ‘look, this [crypto] is here to stay, it's a fascinating space',” he said. “I liked it because whilst I'd campaigned for national sovereignty [from the EU] for all those years, here is personal sovereignty… you've got your own money, you're in charge.”

The BoE is currently researching the possibilities for a potential British CBDC through a digital pound ‘design phase.'

Like Trump, who slammed a potential digital US dollar as a “dangerous threat to freedom”, Farage describing CBDCs as “the ultimate authoritarian nightmare.”

“If and when we win the next election, we will automatically shut down the CBDC project, make all those working on it say ‘very sorry, chaps – you're of work'. We will stop it overnight,” he said.

Last month the UK government announced plans to launch a digital ID scheme and make having digital ID mandatory for anyone for working in the UK.

Farage was similarly critical of this public sector initiative. “I'd rather go to prison that have digital ID and total state control over my life and over my money…. I'm going to fight this and we are going to win,” he said.

Cryptocurrencies are widely seen as having made it easier for criminals to launder money due to their high degree of anonymity.

The government is attempting to ramp up anti-money laundering (AML) through updated legislation such as the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023.

“We have excessive anti-money laundering rules,” Farage said. “The AML regs are a ‘sledgehammer to miss the nut'. For every 100 quid we're spending on regulation to seek money laundering, we're only getting a pound back the other way.”

Reform's cryptoassets and digital finance bill included an intention to allow taxes to be paid in cryptocurrencies. HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) ‘must build systems to accept Bitcoin (and other approved crypto) for tax liabilities, using HMRC-published GBP exchange rates at the time of payment,' the document stated, adding that ‘crypto collected can be converted into sterling or added to the Bitcoin Reserve Fund.'

The document also stated that the party had become the first UK political party ‘to be able to accept donations in Bitcoin, Ethereum, as well as other cryptocurrencies.'

Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ:BITF) is now causing ripples both in the blockchain and AI sectors. 

Following a 500% surge in five weeks, the firm refinanced a debt facility with Macquarie Group into $300 million project financing for its Panther Creek data center in Pennsylvania, marking a strategic shift from crypto mining to high-performance computing (HPC) and AI infrastructure. 

The initiative is an attention grabber among ETF investors as thematic funds following blockchain and AI experience a rare overlap in one firm.

For ETF investors, Bitfarms — previously best known as a Bitcoin miner cashing in on the cryptocurrency bubble — is now a compelling case study. Historically, the company fits into blockchain-themed ETFs which aim at crypto miners and digital ledger innovators. However, BITF's recent actions place these funds at crossroads, as the company is no longer simply mining Bitcoin.

On the contrary, AI-related ETFs such as the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ) and Roundhill Generative AI ETF (NYSE:CHAT) can now indirectly invest in Bitfarms' changing business. Investors in these ETFs can ride the upside of a company utilizing existing data center infrastructure to get into the red-hot AI business.

CEO Ben Gagnon said this $300 million worth of project finance provides the company with quicker access to capital as it transitioned to HPC and AI workloads.

Joshua Stevens, Macquarie's managing director, emphasized the state of Pennsylvania's strong energy and fiber base, describing it as an emerging AI hub, while a change of leadership in the finance department indicates the company's intent on this new direction.

Bitfarms' makeover spotlights an ETF manager's peculiar dilemma. Blockchain ETFs may need to reconsider their definition of inclusion, striking a balance between exposure to legacy crypto mining and hybrid approaches that combine mining and AI infrastructure. By contrast, AI ETFs could benefit from this indirect exposure, establishing a foothold in a company that combines compute-intensive workloads with blockchain expertise.

For investors, this would mean exposure to the growth of AI unintentionally through holding a blockchain ETF, while holders of AI ETFs would receive the reward of digital infrastructure initially developed for mining, a cross-over that is very unusual among thematic funds.

Bitfarms' turn is a trial run for thematic ETF agility. As companies balance multiple edges of innovation, ETFs with the capacity to modify screening and sector definitions could ride the next wave of cross-industry expansion.

 Capita, the United Kingdom's largest outsourcing company, was on Wednesday fined £14 million ($18.7 million) over security failings that saw attackers compromise the personal information of 6.6 million people in a ransomware attack in 2023. 

 The voluntary settlement is for less than a third of the £45 million ($60 million) Britain's data protection regulator had initially intended to impose, but remains the largest fine the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has ever issued in a ransomware case. 

 Despite Capita initially stating there was “no evidence of customer, supplier or colleague data having been compromised,” the company and its pensions subsidiary were found to have exposed data about the  pensions it handles, Capita's own staff and customers from other organizations Capita supports. 

 The compromised data included names, addresses and dates of birth, as well as financial information such as credit and debit card numbers and CVVs. The ICO said it received complaints from people who were concerned money had been stolen from their accounts as the result of the data breach. 

 “Capita failed in its duty to protect the data entrusted to it by millions of people. The scale of this breach and its impact could have been prevented had sufficient security measures been in place,” stated John Edwards, the Information Commissioner. 

 Following media reports that staff were locked out of their accounts, Capita confirmed a cyberattack had taken place on April 3, 2023. It issued a statement to the governmental Regulatory News Service stating that “immediate steps were taken to successfully isolate and contain the issue.”  

 This claim appears to contrast with the ICO's findings. According to the regulator's monetary penalty notice, after a malicious JavaScript file was downloaded onto an employee device on March 22, 2023 the compromised device was not quarantined for 58 hours, ultimately allowing the attackers to further access the company's network and deploy ransomware. 

 The ICO said Capita had provided contradictory information about how quickly it had responded to the initial access. It is a crime under British financial laws, in particular Section 89 of the Financial Services and Markets Act, to publish misleading statements to the market. No regulators have made such a finding in Capita's case. 

 A spokesperson for Capita told Recorded Future News: “We did take some immediate steps to contain the issue, as has been acknowledged by the ICO. We do not believe we are in breach of Section 89 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.” 

 After the initial compromise, the threat actor downloaded the Qakbot malware and the Cobalt Strike intrusion tool onto Capita's systems. Around 29 hours after the initial access, Capita's security platform McAfee/Trellix identified Qakbot recovering and decrypting usernames and passwords from compromised devices' browsers.  

 The malicious JavaScript file had generated a “Priority 2” alert in Capita's endpoint detection and response (EDR) software. The ICO found that a properly configured EDR tool should have upgraded the threat to “Priority 1” after detecting the Qakbot and Cobalt Strike infection. 

 Capita then manually took three separate devices offline on March 28 after noticing suspicious activity. The ICO listed a range of security failings, including an understaffed Security Operations Centre (SOC), which usually only had only one analyst on per shift; and the lack of automated response and decent escalation protocols. 

 Over the next two days, the attackers exfiltrated nearly a terabyte of data before deploying ransomware onto Capita's systems and resetting all user passwords in the early hours of March 31. 

 The ICO noted that Capita claimed both that the exfiltrated data was “an in an unstructured and unusable format,” meaning the attacker would not have been able to exploit it, and that the company had been “the target of a state sponsored attack” which the ICO noted would, if correct, have meant the perpetrator had “significant resources at their disposal to examine and extract usable data.” 

 The attack was ultimately claimed by the Black Basta ransomware group, which posted what it alleged were documents stolen from Capita's internal systems. The listing subsequently disappeared from Black Basta's extortion site, a move that often indicates an extortion fee has been paid or is being negotiated. Capita has not commented on whether it made such a payment. 

 “When a company of Capita's size falls short, the consequences can be significant,” said Edwards. “Not only for those whose data is compromised — many of whom have told us of the anxiety and stress they have suffered — but for wider trust amongst the public and for our future prosperity. As our fine shows, no organisation is too big to ignore its responsibilities.” 

 In a statement on Wednesday, Capita's chief executive said: “Following an extended period of dialogue with the ICO over the last two years, we are pleased to have concluded this matter and reach today's settlement.”

ByJeff Kauflin,

Forbes Staff.

Ascrypto receives a warm embrace in Washington and token prices rise to new levels, some once-hot digital asset sectors like NFTs continue to languish. Few firms have suffered the brunt of NFTs' collapse more than NFT specialist OpenSea.

Starting in mid-2022, the market for digital art represented by these unique, nonfungible tokens–from CryptoPunks to Bored Apes—experienced a spectacular fall, declining by more than 80%. By October 2023, OpenSea, the once-dominant venue for buying and selling NFTs, was bringing in just $3 million in monthly revenue, down from a peak of $125 million in January 2022, the same month the startup was valued at $13.3 billion, briefly turning its cofounders into billionaires.

It wasn't just that people had lost interest in NFTs. OpenSea had also been abruptly overtaken by an upstart competitor, Blur, which charged zero trading fees and didn't require buyers to pay royalties to NFT creators. When OpenSea responded by loosening its own royalty policy, it drew the ire of its customers on Twitter, who said everything from “you people are foul” to characterizing it as “evil” and “a joke of a company.”

As OpenSea was hemorrhaging cash and struggling for market share, cofounder and CEO Devin Finzer rented an Airbnb in Los Angeles and held a company meeting for 175 staffers on payroll. He told employees that the company needed a reset and that he would be firing more than half of them. His goal: to emerge again as a smaller, nimbler startup. Finzer then offered severance packages to anyone who hadn't been laid off but also wanted out.

“What was really tough was that a lot more people than I expected–some really good people–took that package,” he says today, looking downward, voice groggy, likely from his seven-day-a-week work schedule. CEO Finzer now operates often from a WeWork-like co-working space in downtown Manhattan. About six other New York area employees are office regulars, but nearly all of OpenSea's 60 employees and 10 contractors today work remotely.

After trudging through a three-year bear market for digital art NFTs that may never bounce back, OpenSea is pivoting hard. Taking advantage of its customer base, which had swelled to millions of monthly website visitors, the battle-worn startup has expanded from NFTs to become a one-stop shop for trading all cryptocurrencies across 22 different blockchains. This shift means OpenSea can cash in on the memecoin craze, too.

Finzer, 34, credits his wife Yu-Chi Lyra Kuo with having the idea to turn OpenSea into a trade-any-crypto application. Kuo is an early cryptocurrency investor who pursued a PhD in philosophy and politics at Princeton, earned a Harvard Law degree and in 2016 left academia to run a crypto trading fund. In 2021, Kuo met Finzer and gave up running the trading fund. “I really consider her a silent cofounder of OpenSea 2.0,” says Finzer. Kuo doesn't have an official role at the company, but like many CEOs' partners, she has had an outsize impact on its direction.

OpenSea's new focus is already showing real traction. In the first two weeks of October 2025, it facilitated $1.6 billion in cryptocurrency trades and $230 million in NFT transactions, up from $142 million in total volume in all of May. The surge will make October 2025 its biggest month in over three years. Under OpenSea's new gameplan, it aggregates buy and sell orders from decentralized crypto exchanges like Uniswap and Meteora. In terms of fees, OpenSea takes about 0.9% for every transaction, accounting for $16 million in revenue over the last two weeks.

Finzer's new focus for OpenSea employs an age-old trader axiom, “Don't fight the tape.” As the soaring price of bitcoin makes headlines, crypto goes mainstream and prediction markets gain in popularity, “risk on” is the new mantra for investors. One only needs to look at Robinhood's 400% one-year stock return and exploding volume at prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket as evidence. Even though slumping market values for NFTs like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, whose average floor price has fallen from around $400,000 at its peak to $32,000 today, have burned many investors, a new crop of speculators remains undeterred. For the past two years, memecoins have been the industry's biggest obsession. “You can't fight the macro trend,” Finzer says, so you might as well embrace it.

Finzer thinks letting people trade any and all cryptocurrencies is the “right one for crypto right now” due to high demand. In this respect, he has taken a lesson from his biggest rival Blur, a company that burst onto the NFT scene three years ago with a trader-centric approach that helped it gobble up most of the NFT trading market.

His run-in with Blur also taught him something about leadership. After Blur made trading fee-free and royalty-free, Finzer responded with a series of flip-flopping fee changes that wavered between minimizing and maximizing royalties for digital creators. He was trying to please too many people, and his reactive, consensus-driven approach wasn't working. Finzer learned to stop giving in to pressure from others and trust his own instincts. “For some of these things, the only way you get better is by having the thing happen and failing your way through it,” Finzer says.

Looking back on the past two years, Finzer and former OpenSea chief technology officer Nadav Hollander say the deep layoffs were essential. They flattened the startup's structure and removed all technical managers so that every engineer wrote code. Finzer has also come to reject the conventional Silicon Valley wisdom of hiring rapidly to keep pace with soaring customer demand. He now tries to keep the company as small as possible, an approach that has become in vogue in the AI era.

Meanwhile, Blur seems to be missing in action. Its trading volume has dwindled to $92 million over the past month, down from more than $1 billion in early 2023, according to DappRadar. Its corporate X account and that of cofounder and CEO Tieshun Roquerre have been mysteriously quiet since last spring. Roquerre didn't respond to Forbes' emails or Telegram messages requesting an interview. “In crypto, some people are there to get in and get out,” says Finzer.

Crypto trading applications are everywhere–thousands already exist. Yet even though today's most popular blockchains have been around for over a decade, no company has cracked the code on making it easy to trade the millions of tokens that reside on different blockchains and store the assets yourself (or in crypto parlance, self-custody).

While Coinbase makes 300 tokens available to trade through its centralized exchange primary service, that selection represents a tiny fraction of all the tokens in existence. And like a traditional bank, Coinbase stores customers' assets for them. Everyday Americans typically don't think twice about that since they're accustomed to using banks, but it's deeply troubling to cryptocurrency die-hards who believe in completely owning and controlling their crypto at all times. Just ask anyone who had money on crypto exchange FTX when it collapsed. (More recently, Coinbase has started making many more tokens available to trade through its Base service, which lets people self-custody their assets and trade on decentralized exchanges.)

Finzer says OpenSea's bridging feature of letting people trade across 22 blockchains is its most attractive, since there are still few places where that's easy to do. The challenges of achieving this are manifold–to do it well, a company needs to: index an ever-expanding list of tokens across an ever-expanding set of blockchain operating systems; get customers the best possible price for any given trade; make the application easy to use; create a user interface where people can discover new assets; prevent customers from getting scammed.

OpenSea built a booming business years ago by making NFTs simple for anyone to purchase, and it's trying to do the same with all token trading. Finzer's goal is to make the user's experience as intuitive as it is on an app like Coinbase or Robinhood, while under the hood, aggregating people's buy and sell orders from the places where more sophisticated, tech-savvy crypto traders congregate like Uniswap.

One way he tries to do this is by opting not to do know-your-customer (KYC) checks to verify a user's identity. These checks are an important step required for banks and financial institutions to prevent money laundering and transfers from people in sanctioned countries. Finzer says OpenSea, which has moved its corporate headquarters to Miami, isn't legally required to do KYC checks, since it's not considered a U.S. money transmitter and never takes custody of customers' assets. He adds that OpenSea uses blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs to check digital wallets against lists of sanctioned addresses and flag any suspicious transactions for money laundering.

But this compliance-light approach could easily present future risks, not only of money launderers and sanctioned-country senders slipping through the cracks, but also of future U.S. administrations bringing regulatory enforcement actions against OpenSea. Under President Biden, the Securities and Exchange Commission opened investigations into whether OpenSea and decentralized exchange Uniswap were running unlicensed securities exchanges. Both companies denied that they were violating the law, and the Trump Administration dropped those investigations this past February.

OpenSea's new trade-everything strategy also means Finzer is trying to straddle the distant worlds of art and pure financial speculation, a balance that seems impossible. He says he doesn't want to build a “soulless financial app,” but when you visit the “Tokens” section of the site, it feels like a gambling-centric financial app.

The CEO thinks the art-focused NFT market, memecoins and all other crypto tokens can “harmoniously live together” in one place on OpenSea. He says the company is only “a fraction of the way” to its vision of a venue for trading all tokens and notes that it hasn't even launched a new mobile app yet. OpenSea is expected to release its own cryptocurrency soon, following in the footsteps of rival crypto trading apps, though Finzer declined to give details.

Outside of potential regulatory issues, OpenSea may face significant competitive challenges since the barriers to entry in crypto trading are low. In fact, globally there are hundreds of crypto exchanges. “We've found there's a lot of moat in just consistently delivering on a quality product experience–building out a brand that's trusted and works as users want it to work,” says Finzer. The history of crypto, and the eight-year history of his own startup, tells a different story.

The best altcoins to buy now are drawing new capital as Bitcoin reclaims momentum and market optimism returns. BTC is holding above $108,000 with bullish technicals, and traders are watching closely for a breakout that could trigger widespread altcoin inflows. 

In this climate, two altcoins are standing out. Bitcoin Hyper is rapidly gaining traction as a Layer 2 solution on Bitcoin's base layer, leveraging Solana's speed to introduce smart contract capabilities. 

At the same time, Maxi Doge is dominating the meme coin conversation with a bold 1000x leverage narrative and aggressive presale strategy. Both projects are surging ahead of their next pricing milestones.

Bitcoin's technical indicators suggest growing support for a bullish breakout. The price has held firm above $108,000, while the 200-day moving average and on-chain support at $104,772 form a strong base. RSI sits at 40.6, indicating mild oversold conditions. 

At the same time, the MACD histogram has begun flattening, signaling a possible end to recent bearish momentum. If BTC can breach the $117,000 level, analysts expect a swift move toward the $124,000 to $126,000 zone – a range that marked June's high.



Still, macro conditions support upside. Inflation is below 3%, the labor market is weakening, and productivity reforms are expected in 2026. These factors are leading investors to anticipate a dovish pivot by the Fed, which has historically supported crypto rallies. 

On-chain metrics back this sentiment. Bitcoin's Trader's Realized Price is now near $116,000. Holding above this level would historically place BTC in the “bull phase” of its cycle, potentially pushing the asset toward the $160,000 to $200,000 band by year-end.

As the Bitcoin ecosystem looks to scale, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as one of the best altcoins to buy now. It introduces Layer 2 functionality using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) – bringing fast payments, smart contracts, and dApp capabilities to Bitcoin's base chain. 

With BTC lacking native programmability and scalability, Hyper offers a modular solution that bridges two dominant networks: Bitcoin and Solana.



So far, Bitcoin Hyper has raised over $23.6 million in its presale. The current token price is $0.013115, and nearly all of this phase's allocation is filled. Its roadmap includes audited security, a decentralized app layer, and long-term treasury funding. 

Analysts at Cryptonews have projected a launch value of $0.0583, marking a potential 345% increase post-launch. If the project achieves wider adoption as a Bitcoin Layer 2 hub, more aggressive models place its value closer to $0.1557 – over 12x from the current presale price.

As altcoin attention shifts toward real infrastructure plays, Hyper continues to rise on shortlists of the best altcoins to buy now.

 Buy Bitcoin Hyper Here

While Hyper focuses on speed and utility, Maxi Doge is approaching the market from a very different angle. 

The project is framed around a buffed-up doge mascot that lifts weights and trades with 1000x leverage, targeting high-risk meme investors who previously drove coins like Dogecoin and Pepe to billion-dollar valuations.



The presale currently sits at $0.000263, just above its launch price of $0.00025. More than $3.6 million has been raised so far. Maxi Doge's tokenomics are structured across 50 pricing stages, with the final presale stage reaching $0.0002745. 

It joins Bitcoin Hyper as one of the few presale coins currently listed among the best altcoins to buy now, especially as the meme sector gains renewed attention.

 Buy MaxiDoge Here

Beyond price action, broader market sentiment is turning. With inflation cooling and the Fed likely to ease, risk assets are again in favor. At the same time, the 21Shares DOGE ETF has appeared on the DTCC list, signaling growing institutional acceptance of meme coins and altcoin assets.

Dogecoin has bounced back from $0.14, returning to a $0.20+ range. The MACD histogram is turning positive, and RSI is still under 45, suggesting upside remains. 



In that context, Bitcoin Hyper and Maxi Doge represent two distinct but timely opportunities. One brings real scalability to the Bitcoin network. The other captures attention in the meme sector with a sharp brand and structured roadmap. 

With BTC's price pushing toward a breakout and capital flowing back into smaller caps, these are the projects now leading the conversation around the best altcoins to buy now.

Andrew Nusca is the editorial director of Brainstorm, Fortune's innovation-obsessed community and event series. He also authors Fortune Tech, Fortune's flagship tech newsletter.

Good morning. My old newsroom colleague Jack Clark, now a co-founder of high-flying AI startup Anthropic, recently shared some thoughts on artificial intelligence that I found enlightening.

“What we are dealing with is a real and mysterious creature, not a simple and predictable machine,” he wrote in an essay published Monday. “And like all the best fairytales, the creature is of our own creation.”





With AI showing ever more capability—and crucially, agency—Clark says he's both optimistic and “deeply afraid” of what that means for the future. But we humans have some work to do, too.





“We need to spend a bit less time talking about the specifics of the technology and trying to convince people of our particular views of how it might go wrong … and more time listening to people and understanding their concerns,” he wrote, adding: “The rest of the world, which will surely want—and deserves—a vote over this.” 





Hear, hear. Today's tech news below. —Andrew Nusca

The U.S. Department of Justice said Monday that it had made its largest forfeiture seizure in its history.

The take: About $15 billion worth of Bitcoin.

Prosecutors say the man who once held the crypto allegedly oversaw a massive fraud operation based in Cambodia.



(What kind of scam? “Pig butchering,” as it's known, wherein the perpetrators build trust with victims to convince them to “invest” and ultimately hand over their hard-earned crypto.)

The alleged pig butcher, Chen Zhi, is the founder and chairman of the Prince Group. He has been formally charged with wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.

Gather round, children, to remember a time when large language models were warm, upbeat…even funny.



It was a generation ago—18 whole months in the land of AI. But widespread concerns (read: lawsuits) about AI chatbots taking advantage of the mental health of some users led to a more defensive (read: boring) personality posture.

That will change in a few weeks, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says, when its ChatGPT will be updated to allow for more, well, spirited interactions.

“Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases,” he wrote in a social media post. “If you want your ChatGPT to respond in a very human-like way, or use a ton of emoji, or act like a friend, ChatGPT should do it.”

And what's more human than sex? Altman added that once OpenAI rolls out age-gating “more fully,” it will loosen its chatbot restrictions enough (in a rather Meta-like move) to allow for “erotica for verified adults.”

Oh, ChatGPT. You're making me blush. —AN



Use a Google Android device? Best listen up.

A new attack promises to quietly steal your sensitive data in under a minute.

Dubbed “Pixnapping,” the threat requires first downloading a malicious app. But that wayward app doesn't require system permissions to read the data that any other installed app displays on the screen, according to Ars Technica.

(Why the name? Because the attack involves capturing pixels on your display and mapping them to letters, numbers, or shapes.)

It's not hard to imagine what else can be stolen with such an attack: Text messages, emails, passwords, proprietary financial information. And because of Pixnapping's relative speed, even your two-factor authentication codes are at risk.



Though the vulnerability is certain, Google says it has yet to see it occur in the wild. The company partially fixed the issue with a September patch, but another, scheduled for December, is necessary to cover its full extent. —AN

BDC and Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC join forces to expand access to financing and advice, unlocking growth where it's often overlooked

PRINCE GEORGE, British Columbia and QUEBEC CITY and MONTREAL, Oct. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC and the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) today announced a $100M initiative to reach more business owners living in rural and remote areas. Leaders in their communities, rural entrepreneurs are an exceptionally active demographic, with an entrepreneurship rate standing at 17% in 2024, compared to 12% in urban areas. The financing envelope created by this new initiative is expected to generate up to $250 million in GDP over five years.

With their respective business centres and offices throughout the country, Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC and BDC have a complimentary footprint. A federal program administered by regional development agencies and Canada Economic Development, Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC operates 267 non-profit offices across Canada delivering small business loans, tools, training and events. BDC supports entrepreneurs with financing, advisory services and capital from 109 business centres across Canada and online at bdc.ca.

"This initiative aims to increase the support provided to the 520,000 entrepreneurs living in rural and remote areas who grow our economy”, said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions. "It leverages the complementary strengths of both organizations-BDC's financing and advisory expertise and Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC's deep local presence across the country.”

"At BDC, we believe that every entrepreneur, no matter where they live, deserves a fair chance to grow their business. Rural and remote communities are full of bold, resilient business owners who often face more barriers and fewer resources”, said Isabelle Hudon, President and Chief Executive Officer of BDC. "This initiative with Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC allows us to do what a development bank should: go where others don't, and build bridges where gaps exist. We're unlocking potential that's been overlooked for too long. We believe that's what our economy needs right now.”

"Joining forces with BDC to supercharge the opportunities and resources available to rural and remote entrepreneurs from coast-to-coast-to-coast is a powerful combination that will result in significant impact throughout the country for decades to come," said Troy Dungate, President of Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC. "BDC is committing to investing $100M to bolster businesses that often face strong headwinds simply due to geography and the vast nature of our country. This commitment, combined with our boots-on-the-ground, grassroots knowledge is an intelligent way to ensure that this capital infusion is dispersed through loans to new and existing entrepreneurs that are ready to bring their business to the next level. Additionally, we know that many entrepreneurs in rural Canada are attracted to the work because of the desirable lifestyle it creates for their families. Working together, we expect this to make positive, meaningful change in the lives of individual Canadians and our country as a whole.”

This initiative with Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC builds on BDC's broader commitment to develop entrepreneurial potential in all its forms and to help grow the Canadian economy. Since launching our Community Banking initiative in November 2024, BDC teamed up with financial institutions and community lending partners that support underserved groups. By joining this network of trusted partners, Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC should help us reach even more business owners in rural and remote areas. It's about meeting entrepreneurs where they are and helping them grow.

This announcement comes just before Small Business Week, a national celebration of Canadian entrepreneurship that BDC has organized for more than 45 years. This year's theme is The economic revolution is here - get your business ready.

BDC and Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC are stepping up to help entrepreneurs in rural and remote communities-who are vital contributors to Canada's economy-have the resources they need to thrive.

Oops, something went wrong

VANCOUVER, BC, Oct. 15, 2025 /CNW/ - Intellistake Technologies Corp. (CSE: ISTK) (OTC: ISTKF) (FSE: E41) ("ISTK" or the "Company"), a technology company focused on decentralized artificial intelligence and digital currencies, is pleased to announce the appointment of Tyler Whitaker to its Advisory Board. With nearly a decade of experience spanning blockchain infrastructure development and institutional automation systems, Mr. Whitaker brings technical expertise to support the Company's validator operations and digital asset infrastructure.

Mr. Whitaker has been active in digital asset markets since 2016, beginning his career as an analyst focused on identifying and analyzing promising early-stage blockchain projects and emerging ecosystems. Over time, his expertise evolved to encompass technical development, where he built sophisticated automation tools that enabled institutional funds to set on-chain triggers and extract real-time insights across networks. As a contributor to the Ethereum ecosystem—the world's second-largest blockchain network and leading smart contract platform—Tyler also played an early role in supporting the incubation of Fantom, now known as Sonic.

His technical contributions demonstrate a rare blend of analytical insight and hands-on development capabilities, positioning him uniquely to identify infrastructure opportunities in the rapidly evolving intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Mr. Whitaker's specialized knowledge in creating systems that institutional investors can utilize aligns directly with Intellistake's mission to provide sophisticated digital asset access through regulated investment mechanisms.

"We are excited to welcome Tyler to Intellistake's Advisory Board, where his proven technical expertise and deep understanding of blockchain infrastructure will enhance our operational capabilities," said Jason Dussault, CEO of Intellistake Technologies Corp. "Tyler's nearly decade-long experience in digital asset markets, combined with his hands-on development of automation tools that institutional funds actually deploy, provides guidance as we scale our validator operations and expand our AI-driven digital asset infrastructure. His early involvement with major blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum and Fantom demonstrates his ability to identify and support transformative technologies before they achieve mainstream adoption, which is exactly the strategic insight we need as we build the bridge between traditional finance and decentralized AI networks."

The appointment of Mr. Whitaker reinforces Intellistake's commitment to assembling technical expertise as the Company advances its operations in the growing decentralized AI sector. His experience developing institutional-grade automation systems will be great in guiding the Company's technology development and validator operations as traditional investors increasingly seek regulated exposure to blockchain-based artificial intelligence infrastructure.

 Crypto analysts say the weekend's market volatility is temporary and are predicting an upward trend to emerge in the coming weeks. 

Bitcoin could reclaim its all-time high of $125,100 in the coming week, but not without one more major correction, according to veteran trader Peter Brandt.

“Either a huge shakeout, which would be confirmed by an ATH quickly within the next week or so,” he said, though he acknowledged there could also be a much more bearish outcome. 

The crypto market crashed on Friday after US President Donald Trump's announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, resulting in over $19 billion in liquidations across the market.

After dropping from around $121,000 to as low as $102,000 on Friday, Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded to approximately $112,400 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap.

“If anything, this weekend was a reminder you have to be so careful with leverage, and even multiples above 1.5x are dangerous,” Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards told Cointelegraph.

“They do, and you need to always consider multi-year, long-term risk,” he said. He said the weekend's volatility is temporary, and described his outlook for the coming weeks as simply “up.” 

Other analysts remain optimistic, citing broader macroeconomic signals as indications that fresh capital could flow into the cryptocurrency market in the coming weeks.

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said in an X post on Tuesday that a buying opportunity may be presenting itself in the crypto market after US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that quantitative tightening “is over.” 

“Back up the … truck and buy everything,” Hayes said. 

Quantitative easing is bullish for crypto as it encourages banks to lend more and makes borrowing cheaper for consumers and businesses through lower interest rates.

Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph on Tuesday that “the fundamental economic data is the big story for Bitcoin right now.”

“Inflation is facing a double whammy at the moment from lower oil prices and demand, and at the same time, the US labor market is showing signs of distress,” Hundal said, as US inflation reached 2.90% in August, the highest level since January.

“The Fed has a mandate to target full employment, and it all just feels inevitable that we'll see further rate cuts this month. This is a goldilocks zone for Bitcoin,” he said.

Meanwhile, macroeconomist Lyn Alden recently said on a podcast that she is leaning “toward this next quarter being probably pretty favorable” for Bitcoin.

 Fantasy sports crypto platform Sorare is migrating from Ethereum to Solana, with its CEO saying it is a better fit for Sorare due to its scalability and focus on consumer applications. 

Nicolas Julia, CEO of fantasy sports crypto platform Sorare, said he remains confident in Ethereum even as the company prepares to migrate to Solana — a transition he has called an “upgrade.”

Last Thursday, Sorare announced that it would migrate from Ethereum after six years, capitalizing on Solana's scalability and consumer-focused user base. The company will move over 10 sports games and their trading cards to Solana. 

“It's not a replacement, it's an upgrade,” Sorare said at the time. Julia later explained to Cointelegraph that Solana is the most viable chain, as it leads the fantasy sports crypto vertical in revenue, daily active addresses, active developers and total value locked. While it is more centralized than Ethereum, the blockchain has prioritized scalability and security. 

“[Solana's] growing adoption shows that this bet was the right one,” Julia said, noting that it has covered a lot of ground on Ethereum, given it launched five years later.

The migration is expected to be complete by the end of this month.

Despite the migration, Julia said Sorare hasn't lost confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem.

“We remain very bullish on it,” Julia said, noting that it would continue supporting Ethereum users through an integration on the Base network and that it would still allow Ether (ETH) deposits.

Sorare, which has amassed 5 million users and was valued at $4.3 billion in October 2021, is one of several blue-chip crypto protocols that have made tough calls to migrate from the chain they launched on to keep growing.

Decentralized exchange aggregator 1inch and crypto indexing protocol The Graph are two other notable crypto applications that have transitioned from Ethereum to Solana in recent years.

Sorare is a fantasy sports platform primarily focused on football, but also features basketball and baseball, where users buy, sell, and trade officially licensed digital player cards as non-fungible tokens. They can create teams with these cards and compete in weekly tournaments, earning rewards based on real-world player performance.

Other competitors in the space include Flow, Chiliz and the Dapper Labs-backed NBA Top Shot. The DraftKings Marketplace was also prominent before it shut down in July 2024. 

The market cap for sports crypto tokens currently sits at $1.17 billion, a considerable fall from the 2021-2021 bull cycle, CoinGecko data shows.

Sorare NFTs have also struggled amid the broader NFT market downturn, with their floor price plunging from a peak of $91.25 in early April 2022 to $2.21 as of Oct. 12, DappRadar data shows.

Daily Sorare NFT sales have remained steady, with anywhere between 5,000 and 30,000 sales on most days — a similar level to that seen in 2022. 

Despite the migration, Julia said he is considering other high-speed chains that can help it scale Sorare's sports trading cards as far as possible.

It is also integrating Layer0 to operate marketplace payments seamlessly across Solana and Base as part of its plan to become chain-agnostic and leverage the strengths of multiple ecosystems.

Julia said he isn't overly concerned about Sorare falling victim to a Solana network outage, noting that over the years, his team has become “well accustomed to working through the inevitable imperfections that come with blockchain infrastructure.”

“We've been more than reassured by the quality of Solana's technology, the team behind it, and the network's recent track record of stability,” Julia said.

He noted the network outages have become less frequent over time and are addressed swiftly, showing the Solana ecosystem's ability to improve at “remarkable speed.”

A federal jury is set to hear opening statements in the case of two MIT-educated brothers accused of swiping $25 million in a 12-second cryptocurrency heist.

Anton Peraire-Bueno, 25, and James Peraire-Bueno, 29, will face a jury composed of college-educated individuals in Manhattan on Tuesday, Business Insider reported.

The opening statements on Tuesday are expected to describe how the Peraire-Bueno brothers carried out a complicated, multi-step transaction on the Ethereum blockchain to fraudulently obtain approximately $25 million worth of cryptocurrency from victim cryptocurrency traders.

The heist took months to plan and just 12 seconds to complete, the US Department of Justice said in a 2024 press release.

Prosecutors say that before the heist, the brothers Googled "how to wash crypto," "top crypto lawyers," "fraudulent Ethereum addresses database," and "money laundering statue [sic] of limitations."

“These brothers allegedly committed a first-of-its-kind manipulation of the Ethereum blockchain by fraudulently gaining access to pending transactions, altering the movement of the electronic currency, and ultimately stealing $25 million in cryptocurrency from their victims,” said Special Agent in Charge Thomas Fattorusso of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) New York Field Office.

Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno are brothers who studied mathematics and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) – one of the world's most prestigious universities.

"Using the specialized skills developed during their education, as well as their expertise in cryptocurrency trading," the brothers "exploited the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain," prosecutors said in a 19-page indictment last year, as reported by Business Insider.

They stand accused of wire fraud and money laundering, but have “strongly contested” the accusations.

Their attorney claims that they did not defraud crypto traders but merely outsmarted automated trading bots.

During the Late Triassic epoch (237–201 million years ago), the terrestrial ecosystems of Pangaea underwent drastic changes1,2 that led to the rise and diversification of mammaliaforms3, crocodylomorphs4 and dinosaurs5. Although the Carnian sedimentary rocks of South America provided much of the available evidence for understanding the early evolution of these clades, key discoveries have remained restricted to the Ischigualasto-Villa Unión6,7 and Paraná basins8 in Argentina and Brazil, respectively. Here we report a Carnian tetrapod assemblage from the previously unrecognized Northern Precordillera Basin in northwestern Argentina. Discoveries at this basin, in the Quebrada Santo Domingo site, include a nearly complete skeleton of the early sauropodomorph Huayracursor jaguensis gen. et sp. nov., and typical components of Late Carnian faunas, such as hyperodapedontine rhynchosaurs, gomphodontosuchine traversodontid cynodonts, and aetosaurs. Compared to its generally small and short-necked Carnian counterparts9,10, Huayracursor is larger and exhibits an incipient elongation of its cervical vertebrae, representing an intermediate condition for size and cervical elongation between known Carnian and Norian sauropodomorphs11. This discovery provides one of the oldest pieces of evidence of increased body mass and neck elongation in early Sauropodomorpha.

Recalled memories become transiently labile and require stabilization1,2,3. The mechanism for stabilizing memories of survival-critical experiences, which are often emotionally salient and repeated, remains unclear4. Here we identify an astrocytic ensemble that is transcriptionally primed by emotional experience and functionally triggered by repeated experience to stabilize labile memory. Using a novel brain-wide Fos tagging and imaging method, we found that astrocytic Fos ensembles were preferentially recruited in regions with neuronal engrams5 and were more widespread during fear recall than during conditioning. We established the induction mechanism of the astrocytic ensemble, which involves two steps: (1) an initial fear experience that induces day-long, slow astrocytic state changes with noradrenaline receptor upregulation; and (2) enhanced noradrenaline responses during recall, a repeated experience, enabling astrocytes to integrate coincident signals from local engrams and long-range noradrenergic projections, which induce secondary astrocytic state changes, including the upregulation of Fos and the neuromodulatory molecule IGFBP2. Pharmacological and genetic perturbation of the astrocytic ensemble signalling modulate engrams, and memory stability and precision. The astrocytic ensemble thus acts as a multiday trace in a subset of astrocytes after experience-dependent neural activity, which are eligible to capture future repeated experiences for stabilizing memories.

Recall transiently destabilizes memories, which require re-stabilization to become long-lasting1,2,3. Despite its importance in human cognition and neuropsychiatric disorders6,7, the mechanisms that specifically stabilize memories of critical experiences—those that are essential for survival and frequently marked by emotional salience and repetition—remain incompletely understood. Memory traces are linked to specialized neuronal ensembles (neuronal engrams), which include neuronal populations that become Fos+ during both initial and repeated experiences8. However, neuronal Fos alone, a plasticity marker that indicates circuit remodelling9, is insufficient for memory stabilization, implying the need for additional cellular substrates.

By tiling the entire mammalian central nervous system (CNS), astrocytes structurally and functionally interact with neurons and other glia. Their functions contribute to information processing and animal behaviour, and their dysfunctions are widely implicated in CNS disorders10,11. Astrocytes are known to be developmentally diverse12,13,14 and can adaptively change their molecular programmes in response to physiology11,15,16,17,18 and pathology19,20,21—hereafter referred to as state—in specific ways that suggest flexibly altered functions in a context-dependent manner. This adaptability is akin to experience-dependent neuronal responses (such as Fos upregulation)22 and the subsequent formation of inter-regional neuronal engram network8. However, the manifold nature of astrocyte responses through an extensive array of cell-surface receptors for neuroactive biomolecules19,23,24 have made it challenging to determine whether, when and how multiple inputs are integrated by a subset of astrocytes to generate specific states that form astrocyte ensembles that are responsible for particular cellular outputs15,18,24,25. This is because the field has lacked adequate tools to explore behaviourally relevant astrocyte ensembles (BAEs) in an unbiased manner at the single-cell level as well as in a brain-wide manner, which would enable ensemble-specific molecular dissection and functional perturbation.

To agnostically and holistically identify BAEs, we developed a brain-wide astrocyte Fos tagging tool that enables permanent genetic access to BAEs that express Fos due to a specific experience. Although behaviourally relevant stimuli-induced astrocyte Fos mRNA22 and c-Fos protein18,26 have been observed in selected brain regions, its brain-wide profiling remains largely unexplored. We systematically validated a novel genetic and imaging strategy for whole-brain BAE tagging, demonstrating astrocyte selectivity, Fos sensitivity and temporal regulation (Extended Data Figs. 1–3). First, using a CNS-wide-transducing adenovirus (AAV) vector (AAV-PHP.eB) with an astrocyte-specific GfaABC1D promoter27, we achieved widespread, astrocyte-selective (97.3–99.5%) expression (Extended Data Fig. 1). Second, we tested whether using AAV-PHP.eB to express Cre-dependent mNeonGreen (mNG) can serve as a marker of transient astrocytic Fos induction in Fos-iCreERT2 (TRAP2) mice28. This intersectional approach aimed to drive astrocytic mNG expression only when the Fos promoter was active during fast-acting 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) administration, enabling behaviour epoch-specific astrocyte Fos tagging across the CNS. As a positive control, we virally expressed the astrocytic Gαq-coupled designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) hM3Dq, a strong inducer of astrocyte c-Fos26,29,30, combined with 4-OHT and the hM3Dq agonist clozapine N-oxide (CNO) intraperitoneal injection. hM3Dq stimulation yielded approximately 282 mNG+ astrocytes per mm2, and significantly lower tagging in controls (Extended Data Fig. 2). Third, to probe the temporal dynamics of Fos-mNG tagging, dark-adapted mice were exposed to light at various intervals relative to 4-OHT administration28. Tagging peaked within a 6-h window around 4-OHT administration, with an approximately 22-fold increase in astrocytes in visual cortex compared with those in somatosensory cortex, indicating regional specificity and dependence on local neuronal activity (Extended Data Fig. 3). Collectively, these experiments validated our behaviour epoch-specific, brain-wide BAE tagging strategy.

To broadly explore BAEs in a learning paradigm, we used a contextual fear conditioning and recall task5,28 (Fig. 1a). TRAP2::AAV-PHP.eB-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG mice underwent three days of habituation to minimize contextual novelty and isolate associative components of fear learning and recall28,31. On day 4, one group received 3 foot shocks with immediate 4-OHT (FC), and another received 4-OHT immediately after recall 24 h post-FC (FR). Controls were non-shocked mice (NoFC) or fear-conditioned mice kept in the home cage for 24 h and given 4-OHT without recall (NoFR). Shocked groups exhibited robust freezing in the conditioned chamber, indicating learning and recall (Fig. 1b). One week later, whole-brain serial two-photon tomography (STPT)32 enabled the detection of individual mNG+ astrocytes (BAEs) (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). After excluding ventricular niches for bona fide astrocyte counts (Methods), BAE counts across 677 regions covered approximately 80.7% of the brain (Supplementary Table 2).

Whereas the number of Fos+ neurons increased during both FC and FR, forming networks causally linked to fear memory traces—commonly referred to as engram neurons5,8,28, the density of Fos+ astrocytes during FC (FC-BAE; Fig. 1c) was seldom distinguishable from the NoFC control (NoFC-BAE). However, we found that the number of BAEs during recall (FR-BAE) was augmented across multiple regions (Fig. 1c). This was not simply reflecting delayed Fos upregulation after FC, because Fos induction was significantly higher in FR than in NoFR. Normalized comparisons across engram regions5 (Fig. 1d) showed a significantly greater number of FR-BAEs compared with FC-BAEs, particularly in the amygdala (Fig. 1e), the region long implicated in fear memory across species3,4,33,34,35. Consistently, in the lateral and basolateral amygdala (LA/B), astrocytic c-Fos protein was unchanged after FC or in NoFR versus NoFC, but FR induced a marked increase at 1.5 h with partial decay by 6 h (Extended Data Fig. 4). Consistently, the number of of FR-BAEs in the LA/B (FR-BAELA/B) was robust whether 4-OHT was given immediately or 3 h post-FR (Extended Data Fig. 5). These data indicate that astrocyte Fos promoter activity, and the associated surge in Fos mRNA and c-Fos protein expression, peaks within a biologically plausible window of 0–3 h following FR, but not following FC.

A recent study18 reported an increase in hippocampal astrocytic Fos after FC without habituation, contrasting with our findings (Fig. 1c–f). We hypothesized that this reflects contextual novelty: without prior habituation, novelty strongly drives astrocytic Fos. Supporting this, our ‘FC + novelty' group (FC in novel context with no habituation) showed widespread astrocytic Fos, including in CA1 (Extended Data Fig. 6). Thus, the CA1 astrocytic Fos is likely to signal novelty, whereas our habituated FC protocol reveals astrocytic ensembles that are more selectively engaged in learning and recall.

To holistically compare the anatomical positioning of BAEs with previously reported brain-wide Fos+ neuron distribution during FC and FR5, we analysed subregions from previously defined regions in which Fos+ neuron counts of FC and FR were significantly higher than in non-shocked controls, referred to as neuronal ‘engram significant brain regions'5 (Fig. 1e–g and Methods). The number of Fos+ neurons increased during FC versus non-shocked controls, whereas there was no apparent change in astrocytic Fos counts (Fig. 1f). By contrast, FR elicited a strong correlation between neuronal and astrocytic Fos induction (r = 0.56; Fig. 1g,h), suggesting that local astrocyte–neuron interactions may underlie FR-BAE formation22. Notably, amygdala subregions that displayed selective astrocytic Fos increases during FR (Fig. 1e) also showed parallel neuronal Fos increases (Fig. 1h, yellow dots).

To test whether astrocytic and neuronal ensembles are co-engaged within the same regions, we performed dual-colour Fos tagging in the amygdala of TRAP2 mice (Fig. 1i–k). Neuron-specific DIO-mCherry and astrocyte-specific DIO-mNG AAVs were co-injected, and four groups were analysed: NoFC, FC, NoFR and FR. Neuronal Fos increased after FC or FR, consistent with past reports5,8,22. By contrast, astrocytic tagging was minimal following FC and NoFR but was robustly induced after FR (Fig. 1i–k), replicating our brain-wide observations (Fig. 1c–h). These results confirm that astrocyte Fos induction in the amygdala is recall-specific and distinct from neuronal ensemble dynamics.

To identify mechanisms underlying astrocyte Fos induction, we combined pharmacological screening, circuit genetics, in vivo imaging and transcriptomics (Figs. 2–4). Growth factors that activate c-Fos in neurons36 did not trigger c-Fos signals in primary astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 7), indicating that the induction mechanisms of c-Fos in neurons and astrocytes are distinct. Given the accumulating evidence that astrocyte G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation upregulates c-Fos expression26,29,30, we then stimulated primary astrocytes with a variety of neurotransmitters that bind to GPCRs expressed in astrocytes11,22,23, observing that noradrenaline (NA) increased c-Fos signals (Fig. 2b,c). The astrocyte c-Fos signals induced by NA at 0.1 µM and 1 µM were both abolished by propranolol (Fig. 2d), which antagonizes Gαs-coupled β-adrenergic receptors (β-receptors), but not by prazosin or atipamezole, which antagonize Gαq-coupled α1-adrenoreceptors (α1-receptors) or Gαi-coupled α2-adrenoreceptors, respectively (Fig. 2d). The astrocyte c-Fos induction was resistant to the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM)37. The membrane-permeable Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin did not increase astrocyte c-Fos signals (Fig. 2d). However, the inhibition of cAMP production by the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 attenuated astrocyte c-Fos signals induced by the adenylate cyclase–cAMP activator forskolin, the β-receptor agonist isoproterenol or NA (Fig. 2d). Together, these data show that NA induces c-Fos signals in primary astrocytes mainly through Gαs-coupled β-receptors and subsequent increases in cAMP.

Astrocytes in vivo respond to both local circuits and long-range neuromodulators15. Our data (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 3d) suggest that local activity also contributes to Fos induction in vivo. Given the transcriptional differences between in vitro and in vivo astrocytes, notably the reduced expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3, encoded by Grm3) in cultured astrocytes17,38, which is abundantly expressed in adult in vivo astrocytes39, we heterologously expressed mGluR3 in primary astrocytes via AAVs to mimic the in vivo context (Fig. 2e). In mGluR3-expressing astrocytes, glutamate alone was ineffective, but in combination with NA it strongly enhanced c-Fos intensity (Fig. 2f,g). No such synergy was seen in mGluR3-negative astrocytes. Because Gαi-coupled GPCRs such as mGluR3 can enhance Gβγ–Ca2+ signalling when Gαq–phospholipase Cβ is co-activated29,40, NA may recruit α1-receptors (Gαq) and mGluR3 (Gαi) to cooperate with β-receptor–cAMP pathways (Fig. 2h). Supporting this, ionomycin-induced Ca2+ signals enhanced c-Fos when combined with NA, isoproterenol or forskolin (Fig. 2i). Thus, astrocytic c-Fos is driven primarily by β-receptor–cAMP and is further potentiated by convergent glutamate and NA signalling.

To test this convergence in vivo, we expressed neuron-specific hM3Dq in LA/B and locus coeruleus (LC), which mainly consists of noradrenergic neurons to stimulate them with CNO (Fig. 2j–m). The number of Fos-mNG+ astrocytes remained low when only LA/B or LC neurons were activated, but increased markedly when both were stimulated (Fig. 2j–m). This provides in vivo evidence that coincident local and noradrenergic inputs induce astrocytic Fos.

We next tested the necessity of local and far-reaching NA neural signals during FR-BAE tagging. TRAP2::AAV-PHP.eB-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG mice received one of four perturbations at the time of tagging: β-receptor antagonism with propranolol (Fig. 2n) or hM4Di-mediated silencing of LC neurons (Fig. 2o), amygdalar neurons (Fig. 2p) or amygdalar engram neurons tagged with the robust activity marking (RAM) system41,42 whose hM4Di-based silencing (Extended Data Fig. 8) is known to reduce fear memory recall41 (Fig. 2q). In all conditions, FR-BAE density decreased significantly (Fig. 2r), demonstrating dependence on both LC-NA and local engram activity.

To further test whether FR-BAEs reside in anatomical contexts where they could receive convergent inputs from both noradrenergic projections and local engram neurons, we performed dual-colour Fos tagging with neuron-specific DIO-mCherry and astrocyte-specific DIO-mNG AAVs in TRAP2 mice, combined with noradrenaline transporter (NET) immunostaining to visualize noradrenergic projections (Extended Data Fig. 9). Territories of FR-BAEs showed greater overlap with noradrenergic projections and FR engram neurons than those of non-FR-BAEs, with no change in astrocyte territory size. These findings indicate that FR-BAEs are positioned to integrate convergent inputs from noradrenergic projections and local engram neurons, supporting the model that their coincidence drives FR-BAE induction in the amygdala.

Our data (Fig. 2) support a convergence model in which NA and engram activity induce astrocyte Fos. However, since both activities occur during FC and FR8,43, the stronger astrocyte Fos induction during FR than FC (Fig. 1) raises the question of how astrocytes generate this selective response. To address this, we examined NA release and astrocyte cAMP–Ca2+ signalling dynamics across fear learning and recall using in vivo fibre photometry (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 8). We deployed AAV2/9-hSyn1-GRABNE2h44 to monitor bulk NA signals in the LA/B of freely behaving mice (Fig. 3a,b). During habituation 24 h prior to FC, NA signals were observed when the mice were placed into context A (CtxA; foot shock chamber) (peak ΔF/F = 0.142 ± 0.017), probably reflecting mild stressors and/or locomotion44 (NoFC; Fig. 3b). On top of the contextual NA signals, single foot shocks evoked enhanced and relatively fast (peak ΔF/F = 0.206 ± 0.04; half-decay = 4.3 min) NA responses in LA/B (FC; Fig. 3b). In addition, further enhanced (peak ΔF/F = 0.211 ± 0.022) and prolonged (half-decay = 13.5 min) NA signals were observed during the contextual FR (FR; Fig. 3b). The prolonged NA signals were absent in context B (CtxB) (Extended Data Fig. 10c,d), a neutral, non-conditioned context where mice show no freezing (Extended Data Fig. 10b), indicating that recall of contextual fear drives sustained NA signals.

We next used dual-colour fibre photometry (AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-cAMPinG1 and AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-RCaMP345) to measure astrocyte cAMP and Ca2+ signals (Fig. 3c). Consistent with the NA signals (Fig. 3a,b), cAMPinG1 signals increased during habituation and foot shocks, which fully decayed within about 2 min (NoFC and FC; Fig. 3d). On the FR day, however, astrocytes displayed a progressive increase in cAMP (FR; Fig. 3d), which was absent in CtxB (Extended Data Fig. 10e,f). β-receptor antagonism (propranolol) in vivo abolished the astrocytic cAMP signalling during FR (Fig. 3d), which suppressed FR-BAE induction (Fig. 2n,r) and freezing (Extended Data Fig. 10b′). Foot shock elicited astrocyte Ca2+ signals as reported previously46, and Ca2+ event frequency increased during FR (Fig. 3e). These data collectively indicate that fear experiences induce the enhancement of NA signals within the amygdala, which strongly trigger astrocyte cAMP signals through β-receptors during FR.

The increased astrocyte cAMP–Ca2+ signalling during FR raised the question of how astrocytes mount stronger responses during recall than during conditioning, despite NA release and engram neural activity occurring in both fear experiences. To address this, we examined experience-dependent molecular changes in astrocytes under NoFC, FC, NoFR and FR conditions. We dissected amygdala tissue 90 min after behavioural testing and isolated astrocytes by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using the ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit β2 (ATP1B2)47 antibody ACSA2 (Extended Data Fig. 11a) and performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). After quality control, we obtained profiles of 1,903 astrocytes (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 11b,c) and identified 4 transcriptionally distinct astrocyte clusters (AST1–4; Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 11d,e and Supplementary Table 3). We did not observe any noticeable shifts in the subcluster composition across conditions, suggesting that FC and FR do not alter cluster identity. Fos-positive astrocytes comprised 2.9–4.2% of total astrocytes (Fig. 4b), consistent with earlier data (Extended Data Fig. 4). Of note, FR astrocytes showed the highest Fos levels (Fig. 4b), in line with BAE tagging (Fig. 1). Whereas scRNA-seq provides a snapshot at a single time point (approximately twofold increase in FR versus FC; Fig. 4b), the Fos-TRAP system integrates promoter activity over hours, which is likely to account for the greater fold differences observed with tagging (more than 30-fold in FR versus FC; Fig. 1d,e).

Subsequent analyses revealed that Adra1a (α1-receptor) and Adrb1 (β1-adrenoreceptor) as the two dominant adrenoreceptor genes expressed in amygdalar astrocytes. Notably, both receptors were upregulated in the FC group (1.5 h post-FC) and further elevated in the NoFR group (24 h post-FC without recall), suggesting continued priming of astrocytes over time (Fig. 4c). This data suggests a model in which FC induces a molecular state change in astrocytes, with a latency, increasing adrenoreceptor expression to potentiate NA signalling and enable future repeated fear-evoked Fos induction during FR. The enhancement in astrocytic adrenoreceptor expression is likely to underlie the NA–β-receptor-driven cAMP signals during FR (Fig. 3c,d) and Fos induction in response to recall of strong fear memory a day after conditioning (Fig. 1). To test this model, we explored temporal changes in adrenoreceptor expression, their link to FR-BAE induction, and causal roles in Fos induction.

We examined the time course of Adra1a and Adrb1 expression following FC, using single-cell RNAscope on amygdalar sections collected at 1.5 h, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days and 14 days post-conditioning (Fig. 4d–f). Adrb1 expression was significantly increased from 1.5 h to 3 days post-conditioning (approximately twofold versus NoFC; Fig. 4e), but returned to baseline by 14 days. By contrast, Adra1a expression was increased at 1 day post-conditioning (Fig. 4e), showed partial decay by 2 to 3 days, and peaked again at 14 days. We calculated a co-expression index for each cell (relative Adrb1 expression × relative Adra1a expression; Methods) and found a peak at 1 day post-FC (Fig. 4f), followed by gradual decline. To test whether this molecular profile predicts the degree of astrocyte Fos induction during recall, we performed FR-BAE tagging at multiple time points post-FC (1 day, 2 days, 3 days and 14 days; Fig. 4g,h). Consistent with the adrenoreceptor co-expression time course (Fig. 4f), FR-BAE density peaked at 1 day and declined thereafter (Fig. 4h), suggesting a defined window for FR-BAE induction. Moreover, RNAscope further revealed strong Fos–Adrb1 correlation in FR astrocytes (Fig. 4i–k).

To determine whether these adrenoreceptors are causally required for FR-BAE induction, we performed astrocyte-specific knockdown of Adra1a or Adrb1 in the amygdala (Fig. 4l) using floxed mouse lines48,49,50, AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre-4x6T51 and Flp-based Fos-tagging AAVs (AAV2/5-Fos-FlpoERT2 and AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-fDIO-mNG). Knockdown of either receptor (Fig. 4m,n) significantly reduced FR-BAE density (Fig. 4o,p), indicating that both Gαq-coupled α1-receptors and Gαs-coupled β1-receptors are necessary for FR-BAE induction in vivo. Our earlier finding that the α1-receptor antagonist prazosin did not block NA-induced c-Fos induction in cultured astrocytes (Fig. 2d) probably reflects the downregulation of Adra1a in vitro17, highlighting the importance of in vivo validation. Collectively, our data support a model in which initial fear experience primes astrocytes to upregulate adrenoreceptor expression over time, creating a multiday molecular trace that allows future NA release upon repeated experiences (that is, recall) to selectively recruit the astrocyte ensemble.

Transcriptomics enabled us to probe molecular changes of FR-BAEs linked to functional outputs. We mined differentially expressed genes between Adrb1-positive and Adrb1-negative astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 12a) and identified Igfbp2 as highly upregulated in Adrb1-positive astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 12a,b). Our single-cell RNAscope revealed highly correlated expression of Adrb1 and Igfbp2 (Extended Data Fig. 12c–e), suggesting that astrocytic Adrb1 upregulation could promote Igfbp2 induction. Igfbp2 encodes the secreted protein IGFBP2, which was recently reported to be enriched in ‘peri-neuronal engram' Fos+ astrocytes of the amygdala after fear recall22.

Given that IGFBP2 and its binding partners, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), are crucial for synaptic plasticity52,53 and that chronic deletion of IGFBP2 disrupts synaptic transmission, circuit maturation and memory22,52,54, we hypothesized that IGFBP2 expression in FR-BAELA/B contributes to circuit de-stabilization and re-stabilization upon recall2,3. We tested this hypothesis with a spatiotemporally specific in vivo pharmacological perturbation of IGFBP2 (Extended Data Fig. 12f–h). We bilaterally infused an IGFBP2-neutralizing antibody52 (IGFBP2-Ab; 1 mg ml−1) immediately after FR in CtxA—that is, within the reconsolidation window during which memories become labile to be weakened or strengthened2. Mice received repeated daily infusions and FR sessions for five days (Extended Data Fig. 12f). IGFBP2-Ab treatment reduced freezing compared with controls (Extended Data Fig. 12g,h), indicating impaired memory stabilization; controls infused with IgG showed no change. Combined, our transcriptomics, RNAscope and pharmacological perturbation data indicate that a subset of astrocytes increases adrenoreceptor expression upon fear experiences, enhancing NA responsiveness and recall-driven induction of Fos and Igfbp2 to stabilize fear memory.

To directly examine the causal role of FR-BAE signalling in memory stabilization, we performed a loss-of-function experiment selectively targeting FR-BAEs in LA/B. We used iβARK, a genetically encoded 122-amino acid peptide that binds Gαq–GTP to suppress GPCR signalling26 (Extended Data Fig. 13a). In ex vivo Ca2+ imaging in amygdalar astrocytes, iβARK reduced α1-receptor-evoked Ca2+ responses relative to its mutant control, although some residual oscillatory activity persisted (Extended Data Fig. 13c,f,g), consistent with our prior findings in the striatum26. To improve efficacy, we developed iβARK2 by fusing the original peptide to a membrane-anchoring Lck domain, enabling more effective proximity-based inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 13a,b). iβARK2 showed robust membrane localization across astrocytic compartments, including fine processes (Extended Data Fig. 13d). Astrocytes expressing iβARK2 displayed significantly attenuated Ca2+ responses relative to both iβARK and the control iβARK2mut (Extended Data Fig. 13e–g). We next generated Cre-dependent AAV versions of iβARK2 and iβARK2mut for use in Fos-iCreERT2 TRAP mice to selectively target FR-BAEs (Fig. 5a,b). Remarkably, silencing FR-BAEs with iβARK2 impaired memory stabilization upon repeated recall (Fig. 5c), consistent with the behavioural effects observed upon neutralization of astrocyte-derived IGFBP2 (Extended Data Fig. 12f–h). Moreover, astrocytic IGFBP2 levels were significantly reduced in iβARK2-expressing mice compared with iβARK2mut controls (Fig. 5d), suggesting that suppression of GPCR signalling in FR-BAEs disrupts the recall-dependent transcriptional induction of IGFBP2 and compromises memory stabilization.

To further explore the causal impact of BAE signalling on neuronal engram and memory formation, we performed a gain-of-function experiment targeting astrocytic β1-receptors in LA/B. Astrocytes transduced with AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Adrb1 for Adrb1 overexpression (Adrb1-OE) showed significantly increased Igfbp2 expression compared with controls (Fig. 5f). Adrb1 overexpression also increased the density of FR-BAEs (Fos-mNG+ astrocytes) by around threefold relative to controls (Fig. 5g,h), indicating that astrocyte β1-receptor overexpression amplifies the recall-induced astrocyte ensemble.

We next functionally assessed the behavioural effect of the augmented astrocyte ensembles (Fig. 5i–l and Extended Data Fig. 14). We detected no differences in ambulation in an open arena or time spent in the centre zone during habituation between control and Adrb1-OE mice (Extended Data Fig. 14a,b). We then tested whether Adrb1 overexpression affected memory stabilization. With three-shock conditioning, both groups showed equivalent freezing during initial recall and second recall after reconsolidation (Fig. 5j), potentially owing to a ceiling effect. To create parametric space to detect enhancements in memory, we trained mice to a weak (one-shock) conditioning paradigm (Fig. 5i,k). Adrb1-OE mice did not show altered freezing during FR one day after FC; however, Adrb1-OE mice exhibited significantly increased freezing during the second recall (Fig. 5k), indicating enhanced memory stabilization following the reconsolidation after initial recall. In another cohort with three-shock conditioning, initial recall showed no significant difference in freezing between the groups (Extended Data Fig. 14i,j). However, we observed significantly enhanced freezing in an altered context (CtxB) in mice with Adrb1 overexpression compared with controls (Fig. 5l). These data suggest that overstabilization of the initial fear memory leads to generalization or a loss of memory precision41,55,56,57.

Finally, we explored whether fear generalization is accompanied by activity of engram neurons. We bilaterally injected AAV2/8-hSyn1-DIO-mCherry with and without AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Adrb1, and tagged engram neurons during FR. Mice were euthanized 1.5 h after the CtxB freezing test and the reactivation of FR engram neurons was assessed by c-Fos immunoreactivity (Fig. 5m–o). The overall number of mCherry+ neurons (FR engram neurons) was not significantly different between groups, but the c-Fos levels in FR engram neurons in the Adrb1-OE mice, which showed fear generalization, were significantly higher than those in control mice (Fig. 5o). These findings suggest that the larger astrocyte ensembles contribute to enhance subsequent reactivation of engram neurons, consistent with the view that memory retrievability is not determined during memory formation, but may be regulated after memory retrieval8, and demonstrating that astrocytes are involved in that crucial process.

These data demonstrate that astrocytes can link discrete fear experiences across at least a day-long timescale. As postulated more than a century ago58 and recently implicated in brain computation11,25,59,60, astrocytes may integrate information on slower timescales than neurons. Whereas neurons and astrocytes have been traditionally compared over milliseconds versus seconds-to-minutes, our findings reveal a functionally significant mismatch on the scale of days. Unlike neurons that express the immediate early genes during both FC and FR5,8,28, astrocytes respond to fear conditioning (FC) with rapid Ca2+ and cAMP increases61, but undergo slower transcriptional state changes62. Our single-cell transcriptomics and RNAscope revealed that multiple days post-FC, without recall, astrocytes upregulated Adra1a and Adrb1, marking a learning-dependent state that facilitates heightened responses during repeated experiences (FR). This in turn drives expression of Fos and Igfbp2, supporting memory stabilization. The astrocyte ensembles identified in this study may partially meet the criteria for engram cells8 that undergo enduring biochemical changes upon experiences. However, our findings suggest that the astrocytic ensemble may not serve as a direct memory trace encoding experience-specific information like neurons because its perturbation did not alter initial fear recall. Instead, it may function as an eligibility trace for memory stabilization over days, creating a permissive microenvironment within circuits that supports the stabilization of memories related to repeated experiences. From a computational and bioenergetic perspective, astrocytes may underlie retrospective linking63,64, which benefits from spaced intervals over days between learning sessions65 by providing a slow modulatory trace that complements fast neuronal activity64, thereby offloading the energetically costly task of maintaining firing patterns in neurons across days and enabling more stable circuit transformations60.

Mounting evidence from animal3,4,57 and human imaging6 studies has highlighted the amygdala and NA in modulating long-term memory. Early pharmacological studies targeting protein synthesis66, β-receptors67, PKA35 or cAMP–CREB34 in the amygdala disrupted memory re-stabilization, which our findings indicate could partially be mediated by astrocytes. We show that astrocytes undergo learning-dependent increases in adrenoreceptor expressions, and manipulating these receptors alters memory stability, precision and neuronal engram representations. Notably, both NA input and reactivated neuronal engram activity are required to recruit astrocytic ensembles that stabilize labile memories. These findings imply that astrocyte ensembles may not simply be passive bulk substrates of NA signals, but instead exert behaviourally relevant, circuit-specific regulations through astrocyte-defined microcircuitry15,68. Disrupting the precise NA–astrocyte signalling through β1R overexpression led to fear generalization, suggesting physiological astrocytic roles in selective memory stability that constrain maladaptive updating. In this regard, targeting these astrocyte–neuron interaction mechanisms could be beneficial in treating cognitive and neuropsychiatric dysfunctions, including post-traumatic stress disorder, in which hyperactivity of the NA system is a prominent feature4,69.

Deciphering how diverse astrocyte responses link to multiple circuit outputs has long been a challenge15. Considerable effort has been devoted to probe24 or perturb11 astrocyte Ca2+ signals since they were first reported70, yet causal relationships are usually inferred from separate subjects, leaving input–output links unclear. Astrocyte perturbation in a bulk manner is also incongruent with the heterogeneity of astrocyte identity49,71, state62,72 and response59,73. Our approaches bridge this gap: by exploiting context-specific astrocyte state changes18,20,22, the brain-wide BAE tagging method enables broad exploration of ensembles causal for neural processing and behaviour. This framework facilitates research into astrocytic ensembles across diverse behaviours and disease conditions. Expanding such efforts will accelerate discoveries in computation and pathology that require understanding of multicellular interactions as a core attribute of brain biology.

Young adult (8- to 12-week-old) wild-type C57BL/6NCrSlc mice obtained from the Japan SLC, Fos2A-iCreERT2 (TRAP228, JAX 030323) mice obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, Adra1a flox mice49,74 obtained from RIKEN (RBRC11837) and Adrb1 flox mice50 (accession number CDB1068K, generated by RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research) were used for in vivo experiments. TRAP2 mice were bred and maintained in our animal facility, backcrossed with C57BL/6NCrSlc at least eight times before use for experiments. Wild-type C57BL/6NCrSlc female mice were obtained from the Japan SLC to obtain postnatal day 0–1 (P0–P1) pups. Experiments were done using both male and female mice. Number of mice used in each experiment is listed in the main text and/or figure legends accordingly. Mice were housed in groups of 2–5 in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room (23 ± 3 °C, 45 ± 5% humidity) under a 12-h light:dark cycle (lights on from 07:00 to 19:00) and given ad libitum access to water and laboratory mouse diet at all times. After fibre implantation, the mice were single housed under a 12-h light:dark cycle (lights on from 07:00 to 19:00) and given ad libitum access to water and laboratory mouse diet at all times. After fibre implantation, the mice were singly housed. All experiments were approved by the RIKEN Animal Care and Use Committee.

AAVpro 293T cells (Clontech, 632273) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco, 11995073) with fetal bovine serum (FBS; Cosmo Bio, CCP-FBS-BR-500) and 0.1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, 15240062). Cells were grown in a humidified cell culture incubation with 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

All plasmid constructs were generated using standard molecular biology techniques and the In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Clontech). The pZac2.1 GfaABC1D-Rpl22-HA plasmids (Addgene plasmid #111811) were digested with XhoI and NotI, which removed the Rpl22-HA sequence. Multiple cloning sequences (MCS) comprised of restriction enzyme sites that were absent from the backbone pZac2.1 plasmid were generated via gene synthesis (Eurofins Genomics) and incorporated to produce pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-MCS plasmids. The PCR-amplified DIO-GFP sequence from Addgene plasmid #28304 was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCAG-tdTomato (Addgene #83029) between EcoRI sites to generate pCAG-DIO-EGFP-tdTomato. The PCR-amplified DIO-EGFP-tdTomato was inserted into the XbaI and NotI sites of the pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-MCS plasmid to generate pZac2.1-GfaBC1D-DIO-EGFP-tdTomato plasmids. The PCR-amplified WPRE sequence from pFBAAV-CAG-XCaMP-R-WPRE (a gift from H. Bito12) was inserted into the NotI site of the resulting plasmid to generate pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-DIO-EGFP-tdTomato-WPRE plasmids. The plasmids were digested with NotI and AgeI, which removed the tdTomato sequence, and a PCR-amplified mScarlet-I sequence (Addgene #98816) was incorporated, and the resulting plasmids were digested with XhoI and KpnI, which removed the EGFP sequence, and the mNG sequence from Addgene #99135 was ligated using DNA ligation kit (Takara) to generate pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-mScarlet-I-WPRE plasmids. The mScarlet-I sequence was removed with restriction enzymatic digestion with PspOMI and NotI to generate pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-WPRE plasmids. The PCR-amplified hM4Di-mCherry sequence from Addgene #92286 was cloned into the PmeI site of pAAV-RAM-d2TTA::TRE-MCS-WPRE (Addgene #63931) to generate pAAV-RAM-d2TTA::TRE-hM4Di-mCherry-WPRE plasmids. pAAV-GfaABC1D-Flag-mAdrb1-WPRE, pAAV-GfaABC1D-mGrm3-mCherry-WPRE, pAAV-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A), pAAV-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK, pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A), pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK pAAV-Fos-FlpoERT2 and pAAV-GfaABC1D-FRT-mNG plasmids were designed by the authors and constructed by VectorBuilder. The PCR-amplified DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A) and DIO-Lck-mcherry-iβARK sequence from pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A) and pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK was clone into the EcoRI site of pAAV-GfaABC1D-MCS-4x6T-WPRE (Addgene #196417) to generate pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A)-4x6T and pAAV-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK-4x6T. pAAV-GfaABC1D-mGrm3-mCherry-WPRE was digested with EcoNI and AccI to remove mGrm3-mCherry, and PCR-amplified mGrm3 was cloned back to the backbone to generate AAV-GfaABC1D-mGrm3-WPRE plasmids. The PCR-amplified XCaMP-Gf-WPRE from the pFBAAV-CAG-XCaMP-Gf-WPRE plasmid (a gift from H. Bito75) was cloned into the NcoI and HindIII site of pAAV-hSyn1-cyto-mRuby3-iATPSnFR1.0 (Addgene #102557) to generate pAAV-hSyn1-XCaMP-Gf-WPRE plasmids. The mCherry-CAAX sequence digested with EcoRI of the pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-mCherry-CAAX plasmid (a gift from T. Takano76) was ligated into the EcoRI and EcoRV the resultant plasmids to generate pAAV-hSyn1-mCherry-CAAX-WPRE plasmids. All constructs were sequenced before use. All our constructs have been deposited to Addgene in the Nagai Lab repository for unrestricted distribution (http://www.addgene.org/Jun_Nagai, Supplementary Table 4).

Recombinant AAVs were generated by triple transfection of AAVpro 293T cells (Clontech, 632273) using polyethylenimine (PEI; Polysciences inc., 24765-100). Cells were cultured up to 50–70% confluency in DMEM (Gibco, 11995073) with FBS (Cosmo Bio, CCP-FBS-BR-500) and 0.1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, 15240062). The plasmids and PEI were mixed with Opti-MEM (31985-088) and kept for 5 min at room temperature. The mixture was combined with a DNA mix which contained pAAV Capsids, pHelper (Agilent Technologies, 240071-54) and pAAV transgenes. All these plasmids had a concentration of 4.2 μg per dish. The DNA mix was then applied with PEI/Opti-MEM, and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Then, this solution was added to the cells and incubated for 24 h. After incubation, the medium was changed to DMEM with 2% FBS and 0.1% antibiotic-antimycotic. Viral particles were collected from the medium at 120 h post-transfection. Cell pellets were centrifuged (3,500 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was filtered by Setricup (Merc, S2HVU02RE) and pellets were resuspended in FBS-free DMEM and freeze-thawed three times. In the case of PHP.eB capsid virus production, the supernatant was resuspended in DMEM and fractured by harshly pipetting. Thawed pellets were centrifuged (3,500 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) again and the supernatant was filtered by Setricup (Merc, S2HVU02RE). Media containing viral particles were centrifuged (22,000 rpm, 2 h, 4 °C) by Optima XE-100 (Beckman Coulter, A94516). The pellets were collected with 10–50 μl PBS and clarified by centrifugation (4,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant-containing viral particles were stored at 4 °C. AAV titre was analysed by quantitative PCR (QuantStudio 12 K; Applied Biosystems) using primers designed to selectively bind AAV2 inverted terminal repeats (forward: 5′-AACATGCTACGCAGAGAGGGAGTGG-3′, reverse: 5′-CATGAGACAAGGAACCCCTAGTGATGGAG-3′).

All surgical procedures were conducted under general anaesthesia using continuous isoflurane (induction at 5%, maintenance at 1.5% to 2% vol/vol). Depth of anaesthesia was monitored continuously and adjusted when necessary. Intravenous administration of AAV-PHP.eB (50 µl to deliver 2.5 × 1012 genome copies (GCs) per mouse) was performed by injection into the retro-orbital sinus of TRAP2 mice. Two weeks after AAV-PHP.eB GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-WPRE or AAV-PHP.eBGfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-mScaret-I-WPRE injections, mice were administered 4-OHT for inducing Cre recombination under the Fos promoter (Fos tagging) and then returned to their home cage until they were euthanized 7 days after tagging. In some cases, Fos tagging was performed using the FLP–FRT system (fDIO), and mice were euthanized one day after tagging. For stereotaxic microinjection of AAVs, mice were fitted into a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments) with their heads secured by blunt ear bars and their noses placed into a veterinary grade anaesthesia and ventilation system (VetEquip 911103). The surgical incision site was then cleaned with 70% ethanol (vol/vol). Craniotomies (1–2 mm in diameter) were made powered by a high-speed drill at specific coordinates based on the bregma position. Bilateral viral injections were conducted using a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments) to guide the placement of beveled glass pipettes (World Precision Instruments, 1B100-4) into the regions of interest: the basolateral amygdala (anterior–posterior (AP): −1.48 mm, medial–lateral (ML): 3.3 mm, dorsal–ventral (DV): 5.00 mm to bregma) and LC (AP: −5.4 mm, ML: 0.85 mm, DV: 3.7 mm to bregma). Total of 0.3 μl of AAV was delivered at 0.1 μl min−1 using a syringe pump (SmartTouch Pump, World Precision Instruments). The glass pipette was withdrawn 5–10 min after the infusion to prevent the backflow. Mice were then sutured, returned to their home cage, and allowed to rest for at least two to three weeks before any assessments were conducted. AAV titres (GCs per ml) were adjusted with sterile saline to deliver the indicated genome copies into the regions of interest: AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-DIO-mNG-WPRE (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-hM3Dq-mCherry (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/DJ8-RAM-d2TTA::TRE-hM4Di-WPRE (3.0 × 1013), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Flag-mAdrb1-WPRE (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/9-rTH-Cre (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/8-hSyn1-DIO-hM3Dq (1.0 × 1013), AAV2/8-hSyn1-DIO-hM4Di (1.0 × 1013), AAV2/8-hSyn1-DIO-mCherry (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/DJ8-Ef1a-hM3Dq (4.8 × 1011), AAV2/DJ8-Ef1a-hM4Di (4.0 × 1012), AAV2/5-hSyn1-mCherry-CAXX (3.0 × 1012) AAV2/9-hSyn1-GRABNE2h-WPRE (2.7 × 1012), AAV2/1 GfaABC1D-cAMPinG1-NE (1.3 × 1013), and AAV2/1 GfaABC1D-RCaMP3 (1.5 × 1013), GfaABC1D-GCaMP6f (1.1 × 1013), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-iβARK-mCherry (1.3 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-iβARK(D110A)-mCherry (1.3 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK (1.3 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A) (1.1 × 1013), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-DIO-Lck-mCherry-iβARK-4x6T (3.0 × 1013), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Lck-mCherry-iβARK(D110A) (3.0 × 1013), AAV2/5-Fos-FlpoERT2 (3.0 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-fDIO-mNG (1.0 × 1012), AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre-4x6T (1.2 × 1013).

4-OHT (Sigma, H6278) was dissolved at 25 mg ml−1 in 100% ethanol with agitation at 37 °C for 15 min and was then aliquoted and stored at −20 °C for up to several weeks until use. Before use, 4-OHT was redissolved in ethanol by shaking at 37 °C for 15 min and corn oil (Sigma, 259853 and S5007) was added to give a final concentration of 3 mg ml−1 4-OHT. The ethanol was evaporated by incubation at 50 °C. The final 3 mg ml−1 4-OHT solutions were always used on the day they were prepared. All 4-OHT injections were delivered intraperitoneally at 50 mg kg−1 2–4 weeks after AAV injection into TRAP2 mice for inducing Cre recombination under the Fos promoter.

CNO (Tocris, 4936) was administered intraperitoneally 0.5 h before the initiation of behavioural assessments. CNO was administered intraperitoneally 20 min before 4-OHT intraperitoneal injection. Propranolol (MedChemExpress, HY-B0573) was dissolved in dH2O at 100 mM and stored at −20 °C. The final solutions were always used on the day they were prepared.

Mice were placed on doxycycline (40 mg kg−1, Bio-Serv, F4159) chow 24 h prior to and for at least 1 week after viral injection, switched to doxycycline-free chow 48 h before recall, and euthanized 24 h later. IGFBP2 antibody was infused bilaterally through implanted guide cannulas targeting basolateral amygdala. Infusions were performed using an internal cannula connected to a 10-µl Hamiltion syringe. One microgram of IGFBP2 antibody (1 mg ml−1, 1 µl per site) was infused into mice immediately after a fear recall paradigm at 400 nl min−1 using a syringe pump (SmartTouch Pump, World Precision Instruments).

Mice were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for fixation. The dissected brains were post-fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% PFA in PBS, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS. The brains were embedded with OCT compound (Sakura Finetek Japan, 4583) and sliced into coronal sections with a thickness of 50 μm at −20 °C using cryostat (CryoStar NX70, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 956960). The sections were washed with PBS 3 times for 5 min each and stored in 50% glycerol (Fujifilm, 075-00616) in PBS at −20 °C. For staining with c-Fos antibody, the sections were permeabilized with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 (Nacalai tesque, 35501), incubated at room temperature for 3 h, and then incubated with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1% normal donkey serum (NDS, Sigma-Aldrich, D9663) at room temperature for 1 h for blocking, and then incubated at 4 °C overnight in blocking buffer. With the following primary antibodies, Triton X-100 was used at 0.1% for permeabilization and PBS containing 1% NDS was used for blocking and antibody reactions: rat anti-GFAP (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 13-0300), mouse anti-S100β (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich, S2532), goat-Sox9 (1:100, R&D systems, AF3075) mouse anti-RFP (1:500, MBL, M155-3), rabbit anti-RFP (1:500, Rockland, 600-401-379), mouse anti-NET (1:2,000, MAb technologies, NET05-2) and rabbit anti-c-Fos (1:5,000, Synaptic Systems, 226003). After washing with PBS 3 times for 10 min each, the sections were incubated at room temperature for 2 h in blocking buffer with the following secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rat, Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-chicken, Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-goat, Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-chicken (1:1,000, Abcam, ThermoFisher and Jackson ImmunoResearch). The sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight in blocking buffer with secondary antibodies when staining with anti-c-Fos antibody. After washing with PBS 3 times for 10 min each, the sections were mounted on slides (Fluoromount-G, Southern bio, 0100-35) and visualized under a confocal laser microscope (Olympus, FV3000) and a fluorescent microscope (Olympus, VS200). Immunoreactivities were analysed using ImageJ software (NIH). The numbers of c-Fos+ neurons (Fig. 5o and Extended Data Fig. 8b) and astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 4b) were quantified based on a consistent c-Fos intensity threshold for each experiment. This threshold was defined such that the number of c-Fos+ neurons or astrocytes corresponded to the values previously reported18,42,77. Number of cells, field of views, sections and mice used in each analysis is listed in the main text and/or figure legends accordingly.

Mice were singly housed in a light-proof chamber for 48 h. On the day of tagging, mice were exposed to 1 h of light inside the chamber and injected intraperitoneally with 50 mg kg−1 4-OHT either 24 h, 12 h, 6 h or 3 h before or 0 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h or 24 h after the termination of light exposure. Mice were returned to the dark chamber for an additional two days and then returned to a regular light-dark cycle until the time of euthanasia seven days after tagging.

Behavioural tests were performed during the light cycle between 07:00 and 19:00. Temperature and humidity of the experimental rooms were maintained at 23 ± 2 °C and 55 ± 5%, respectively. Background noise (55 dB) was generated by a white noise generator (Ohara). All the experimental mice were transferred to the behaviour testing room at least 1 h before the tests to acclimatize to the environment and to reduce stress. Mice were habituated by freely exploring the conditioning chamber (CtxA) that consisted of a square partition (30 × 30 × 15 cm; 100 lux and no odour) with a grid floor wired to a shock generator (Ohara) for 15 min per day for 3 days. On the fourth day, they were either fear conditioned (1 time or 3 times shock; 2 s, 0.3 mA) (FC group) or presented with no shocks (NoFC group) in the conditioning chamber. One day after the conditioning, mice were either returned to CtxA for 3 min for fear memory recall (FR group) or kept in their home cages (NoFR group). Freezing durations exceeding 70% in the conditioned chamber 1 day post-conditioning with 3 foot shocks or exceeding 50% 1 day post-conditioning with a single foot shock, are considered indicative of sufficient conditioning. All the experimental mice received intraperitoneal injections of 4-OHT (50 mg kg−1) immediately after the task for Fos tagging. Freezing was automatically measured throughout the testing trial by the TimeFZ4 software (version 2021_7_29, Ohara) and subsequently processed by a blinded investigator. The chambers were cleaned with 70% ethanol between tests. In some cases, 10 mg kg−1 Propranolol (MedChemExpress, HY-B0573) was administered by intraperitoneal injection to mice 0.5 h before, and 2.5 h and 5.5 h after 4-OHT-based Fos tagging in order to block β-adrenergic signalling throughout the tagging timeframe. In some experiments using DREADDs, mice were injected with CNO (1 mg kg−1) 10 min before the task in CtxA. For experiments in Fig. 2n in which CNO was used for silencing neuronal activity or propranolol was used for antagonizing β-adrenoreceptor signalling to test their roles in astrocyte Fos induction during fear memory recall, both were administered with consideration of their pharmacokinetics. Propranolol was given both before and after the behavioural session to ensure effective β-receptor blockade throughout the several-hour Fos-tagging window (Extended Data Fig. 3), given its short half-life78 (~1.5–2 h), whereas CNO was given once before the session owing to its prolonged effect79 (>6 h). Freezing was measured for 3 min in the CtxB chamber, which consisted of a rhombic partition (30 cm × 60 cm × 15 cm, 10 lux and 1% acetic acid odour) with a flat floor (Ohara).

Mice were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with PBS, followed by 4% PFA in PBS for fixation of brain tissues. The dissected brains were post-fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% PFA in PBS and stored in PBS at 4 °C until embedding. To oxidize agarose, 2.25 g agarose (A6013, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 100 ml of 10 mM sodium periodate (S1878, Sigma-Aldrich)/50 mM phosphate buffer and stirred gently for 2.5 h at room temperature in the dark. The oxidized agarose was filtered on a bottle-top vacuum filter (0.2 μm, 569-0020, Thermo Scientific) washed 3 times with phosphate buffer and resuspended in 50 ml of phosphate buffer to make 4.5% oxidized agarose solution. The oxidized agarose solution was boiled with a microwave oven to melt the agarose and kept at 60–65 °C. The brains were pat-dried and embedded in oxidized agarose solution with a plastic mould (18646A, Polysciences). For covalent crosslinking between oxidized agarose and the surface of the brain, borate/borohydride solution was prepared the day before use by adding 0.2 g sodium borohydride (452882, Sigma-Aldrich) in 100 ml of prewarmed (40 °C) borate buffer (50 mM borax, 221732, Sigma-Aldrich; 50 mM boric acid, B6768, Sigma-Aldrich; pH 9.0–9.5) in the chemical fume hood. The agarose block was removed from the mould, soaked in borate/borohydride solution to initiate crosslinking and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The block was washed and kept in phosphate buffer at 4 °C until imaging.

The agarose block was mounted on a glass slide using Loctite 401 glue immediately before imaging. STPT was performed with the TissueCyte 1400FC system (TissueVision) equipped with Coherent Chameleon Ultra II laser (Coherent) or Spectra-Physics Insight X3+ laser (MKS Spectra-Physics) and a Nikon 16× water-immersion objective (MRP07220, NA: 0.8). The laser wavelength was tuned at 1,000 nm. Brains were coronally sectioned with a built-in vibrating microtome at 50-μm thickness with a frequency of 60 Hz and a speed of 0.5 mm s−1. Four optical z-planes were taken at 50 μm, 62.5 μm, 75 μm and 87.5 μm below the cut surface of the tissue block. To scan an entire coronal plane, individual tile images were acquired (832 × 832 pixels per frame, resolution at 1.382 μm per pixel) by moving the stage between each tile. Following the full scanning of a coronal plane, a 50-μm section was cut away by vibrating microtome and imaging of a new cut surface repeated to acquire optical sections covering the entire brain from the caudal to the rostral side (~320 coronal sections). The raw image tiles were first trimmed and subjected to flat field correction, then stitched into 2D mosaic coronal section images using the Autostitcher software (TissueVision). The signals from the green channel (500–550 nm, mNG signal) and from the far-red channel (>600 nm, background) were simultaneously acquired, and the latter was used to subtract background from the green channel to enhance the signal to noise ratio. Each region of the whole brain was aligned and segmented according to the Mouse Brain Atlas (NeuroInfo, MBL Bioscience, BN-200). Owing to the high quality preservation of tissue architecture during imaging, we semi-automatically performed alignment to a standard mouse brain atlas, segmentation of 839 brain regions, and detection of single Fos-tagged mNG astrocytes (BAEs), defined by their territories that typically displayed diameters of approximately 40 to 60 μm with ~10-µm-wide cell bodies68 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). Consistent with our intersectional genetic approach, we rarely observed neuron-like mNG-positive cells, with larger cell bodies (>~20-μm diameter) and elongated processes (>~50-μm). We only found these cells in regions nearby ventricles and the midline where well-characterized GFAP-positive neural progenitor cells reside48,80, and they were excluded in subsequent analyses. As a result, using this brain-wide analysis approach we successfully quantified the density of BAEs in 677 brain regions that accounted for 80.7% of the whole brain.

To observe correlation between Fos+ astrocytes and neurons, we used the same TRAP2 (Fos-iCreERT2) system28 used by Roy et al.5, but instead with a Cre-dependent mNG reporter expressed in Fos+ astrocytes, allowing comparison of Fos+ cell counts from anatomically matched regions between studies. The regions of interest were first narrowed to the 117 engram-signifiant regions defined by Roy et al. Then, to ensure analysis of bona fide astrocyte-tagged regions, areas with possible neuronal leakage (mNG+ neuron-like cells), particularly near ventricles were excluded (see above). In addition, high-level hierarchical structure areas (such as midbrain or thalamus) with extremely high total counts that skew correlation analysis were also excluded. In the end, this selection yielded 75 regions for subsequent correlational analyses. Changes in Fos+ astrocyte numbers (FC–NoFC and FR–NoFC) were calculated using the non-foot shocked control group as the baseline, consistent with Roy et al. Supplementary table 1 from Roy et al. provided region-by-region counts of Fos+ neurons in non-foot shocked controls, FC and FR groups, enabling us to extract the corresponding changes in Fos+ neuron numbers for each of the 75 regions. Pearson correlation analyses between these neuronal and astrocytic Fos+ cell count changes were performed.

For image visualization in 3D, low-resolution image stacks were created across all four channels. These stacks were downsampled to 25 μm per pixel resolution in the x and y axes, while the inter-slice distance was maintained at 50 μm, resulting in a voxel resolution of 25 × 25 × 50 μm3. To minimize high-frequency artifacts, median filtering and Gaussian smoothing were applied to the coronal images prior to downscaling. The processed 3D image stacks were stored in the NIfTI format, and the world coordinates were adjusted to align roughly with the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework v.3 (CCFv3)81. For registration to the CCFv3, the Allen STP-1675 template (filename: P56_Atlas.nii.gz; available at https://scalablebrainatlas.incf.org/mouse/ABA_v3#downloads) was used as the reference image. This template, generated from STPT averaged over 1,675 specimens, was combined with corresponding atlas annotations (filename: P56_Annotation.nii.gz). Image alignment was performed using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs)82. An affine registration was first applied at 3 scales (downscaling factors of 4, 2 and 1) with Gaussian smoothing of 2, 1 and 1 voxels and 250, 200 and 50 iterations, respectively. This was followed by deformable (SyN) registration at four scales (downscaling factors of 8, 4, 2 and 1) with Gaussian smoothing of 4, 2, 1 and 1 voxels and 1,000, 500, 100 and 50 iterations, respectively, using mutual information as the metric. After computing the transformation, individual image stacks and atlas labels were mapped to and from the CCFv3 image space. After aligning with the NIfTI world coordinates, cell positions were mapped to the Allen template using the antsApplyTransformsToPoints function from ANTs. Brain regions from the Allen atlas annotations were then assigned to individual cells based on their locations in the CCFv3 image space.

Astrocyte primary cultures were obtained as previously described with some modifications83. In brief, cerebral cortical tissues were isolated from P0–P1 neonatal mice and dissociated with a scalpel, gently agitated in 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, 25300-054), and rapidly strained with a Falcon 100 µm cell strainer (352360). Dissociated cells were seeded at a rate of four brains per bottle on poly-d-lysine-coated bottles. The cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, 11995073) supplemented with FBS (Cosmo Bio, CCP-FBS-BR-500) and penicillin-streptomycin. When the cells reached confluence after several weeks, the culture bottles were gently shaken at 120 rpm overnight at 37 °C to remove non-astrocytic cells. Astrocytes were then detached using Trypsin-EDTA, replated onto poly-d-lysine-coated bottles, and after 1–2 weeks, cultures were shaken again at 120 rpm for 4 h. Astrocytes were then re-seeded on coverslips in 12-well plates at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells per well, which were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, with the medium being changed every 2 to 3 days.

Five days after re-seeding, primary astrocytes were incubated with tetrodotoxin (TTX at 1 µM, Fujifilm, 207-15901) to eliminate the potential effect of neuronal firing, for at least 5 min to allow adequate equilibration, together with the following inhibitors, blockers or chelators indicated for each experiment unless otherwise described: prazosin hydrochloride (MedChemExpress, HY-B0193A), atipamezole hydrochloride (Tokyo Chemical Industry, A2956), propranolol hydrochloride (MedChemExpress, HY-B0573), BAPTA-AM (SIGMA, A1076), and SQ 22536 (Tokyo chemical industry, Q0105). The cultures were then incubated with the following growth factors, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators or neuropeptides in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 1.5 h: l-glutamic acid monosodium salt hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, G5889), GABA (Sigma-Aldrich, A2129), ATP disodium salt hydrate from yeast (Nacalai tesque, 01072-24), l-noradrenaline hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, 74480), dopamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, H8502), acetylcholine chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, A6625), serotonin hydrochloride (Alfa Aesar, B21263.03), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, Fujifilm, 028-16451), neurotrophin-3 (Fujifilm, 146-09231, 50 ng ml−1), neurotrophin-4 (Fujifilm, 142-06634, 100 ng ml−1), forskolin (Fujifilm, 067-02191, 10 μM), nerve growth factor-β (NGFβ, Fujifilm, 141-07601, 100 ng ml−1), epidermal growth factor (EGF, Fujifilm, 059-07873, 100 ng ml−1), PDGF-AA (Fujifilm, 163–19731, 100 ng ml−1), PDGF-BB (Fujifilm, 164–24031, 100 ng ml−1), Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF, Fujifilm, 032-23501, 100 ng ml−1), IGF1 (Fujifilm, 099-04511, 100 ng ml−1). The following agonist and ionophore were used: isoproterenol (MedChemExpress, HY-B0468) and ionomycin (LKT laboratories, I5752). Ninety minutes after incubation, primary astrocytes were fixed in 4% PFA (Nacalai Tesque) for 10 min, washed with PBS 3 times, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Nacalai Tesque) for 10 min and blocked with 1% NDS (Sigma-Aldrich, D9663) for 30 min. Primary astrocytes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-c-Fos (1:1,000, Synaptic Systems, 226003), rat anti-GFAP (1:1,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 13-0300), rabbit anti-IBA1 (1:1,000, Fujifilm, 019-19741), chicken anti-TUJ1 (1:1,000 Novus Biologicals, NB100-1612), mouse anti-OLIG2 (1:100, Millipore, MABN50). The cultures were washed 3 times in PBS for 10 min each, then incubated with DAPI (1:10,000, Sigma-Aldrich, D9542) and the following secondary antibodies (1:1,000) in PBS containing 1% NDS for 1 h at room temperature: Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rat (abcam, ab150153), Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-mouse (abcam, ab175700), Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit (Abcam, ab175692), Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit (abcam, ab150067), Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-chicken (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 703-605-155). Fluorescent images were taken using a 20× objective lens (UPlanXApo 20×, Olympus) with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus, FV3000 with Fluoview). Immunoreactivity quantification of c-Fos was performed using ImageJ. The c-Fos brightness of GFAP-positive astrocytes were measured by the intensity of ROIs that encompassed the cell nuclei. In some experiments involving a heterologous expression of mGluR3, we applied AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Grm3 (800,000 multiplicity of infection) 5 h after re-seeding for expressing mGluR3 in primary astrocytes and incubated for 5 days before pharmacological experiments. Ninety minutes after stimulation with 0.1 µM NA and/or 100 µM glutamate in the presence of 1 µM TTX, primary astrocytes were fixed and stained as described above using primary antibodies: rabbit anti-mGluR3 (1:500, abcam, ab166608) and mouse anti-c-Fos (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc166940). It is noteworthy that the mouse anti-c-Fos antibody, different from the rabbit anti-c-Fos antibody used in other experiments, exhibited overall low immunoreactivity. However, this did not affect the quantification of c-Fos mobilization. Fluorescent imaging and quantification of c-Fos intensity were performed as described above.

AAVs for expressing the noradrenaline biosensor GRABNE2h on the neuronal cell surface, or calcium indicator RCaMP3 in astrocytes with cAMP sensor cAMPinG1 in astrocytes were unilaterally injected into the basolateral amygdala. Optical fibres were implanted above the injection site two weeks post-injection to capture emission of fluorescence signals, with recordings conducted one week after fibre implantation. For fluorescence signal collection, mice were tethered to a patch cable, and a 465 nm LED light (Doric, 40–50 µW at the tip of patch cable) or a 560 nm LED light (Doric, 40–50 µW at the tip of patch cable) was used to excite the signal, with an isosbestic 405 nm LED light used to correct for movement artifacts. Mice tethered to the patch cable were habituated in a testing chamber for 5 min on the day of recording. A time-division multiplexing scheme was used, where the 465 nm, 560 nm and 405 nm LED lights were emitted alternately at 20 Hz (turned on for 24 ms and off for 26 ms), with the timing precisely controlled by a programmable pulse generator (Master-9, AMPI). Each excitation light was reflected by a dichroic mirror and coupled into an optical fibre cable (Doric, 200 μm in diameter, 2 m in length, NA 0.57) through a pinhole (200 μm in diameter). The fluorescence signals were detected by a photomultiplier tube with a GaAsP photocathode (H16722-40; Hamamatsu Photonics) and digitized by a data acquisition module (USB-6341, National Instruments). A custom-written LabVIEW program extracted signals at a sampling frequency of 1 kHz in real time. Fluorescence signals collected during each light pulse were averaged, after dropping the first and last 2 samples (1 ms each) to eliminate potential noise caused during the alternation of LED lights. The data were smoothed using moving average and corrected for bleaching correction by fitting to least-squares linear. The fluorescence response was calculated (fitted 465 + 1)/(fitted 405 + 1) − baseline. The baselines of GRABNE2h and astrocyte cAMPinG1 signals were identified during periods of no spontaneous signals in home cages for 1–2 min before the context exposure. Signal analyses were performed in Python (v.3.0.0) using JupyterLab (v.3.6.7, Project Jupyter). Numerical computations and data handling were conducted using NumPy84 (v.1.26.4) and Pandas (v.2.1.4, NumFOCUS). The area under the curve of fluorescence traces was calculated with scikit-learn (sklearn, v.1.2.2, RRID:SCR_002577), and half-decay times of signal responses were extracted. Astrocytic RCaMP3 signals were bandpass filtered between 0.0003 and 1 Hz with SciPy85 (v.1.11.4). Peaks of Ca2+ signals were defined as data points exceeding 4× s.d. above the baseline mean, with baseline noise estimated from ≥20 s intervals lacking spontaneous activity in home cage recordings before context exposure. Signal traces were visualized with Matplotlib86 (v.3.8.0).

Coronal amygdalar slices were prepared from adult mice with AAV injection26,87. In brief, animals were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated with sharp shears. The brains were placed and sliced in ice-cold modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing the following (in mM): 194 sucrose, 30 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4 and 10 d-glucose, saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. A vibratome (DSK NLS-MT) was used to cut 300-µm brain sections. The slices were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at 32–34 °C in normal ACSF containing (in mM); 124 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4 and 10 d-glucose continuously bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Slices were then stored at 21–23 °C in the same buffer until use. All slices were used within 2–6 h of slicing. Cells for all the experiments were imaged with a 16× water-immersion objective lens (Nikon, N16XLWD-PF, MRP07220, NA: 0.8) with Nikon two-photon laser-scanning microscope (A1R MP) equipped with a 920 nm wavelength laser (Alcor, Spark Lasers). To image GCaMP6f signals, astrocytes located in the LA/B and typically ∼20 to ∼30 µm below the slice surface were selected for imaging. Images were acquired at 1 frame per second. Slices were maintained in ACSF (124 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM d-glucose and 2.0 mM CaCl2) through a perfusion system. Phenylephrine (PE, Tocris Bioscience 2838) was applied in the bath in the presence of 300 nM tetrodotoxin (Cayman Chemical 14964) were applied in the bath at least 5 min prior to recording to allow adequate equilibration. A constant flow of fresh buffer perfused the imaging chamber at all times. Spontaneous Ca2+ activity was recorded for 3 min (0 µM PE), followed by a 2-minute bath application of 1 µM PE, a 5-min washout, a 2-min application of 3 µM PE, and a 5-min washout. Ca2+ signals were processed in ImageJ (NIH) and presented as the relative change in fluorescence (ΔF/F).

Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane 90 min after the initiation of behavioural paradigms and transcardially perfused with PBS (30 ml for 2 min). The amygdala was freshly dissected out using a Brain Matrix (Ted Pella, 15067) and was placed into cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (14025092, Gibco) containing 10 mM HEPES (17514-15, Naclai Tesque), 0.54% glucose (16806-25, Naclai Tesque), 5.0 µg ml−1 actinomycin D (A1410, Sigma-Aldrich), 10 µM triptolide (T3652, Sigma-Aldrich) and 27.1 µg ml−1 anisomycin (A9789, Sigma-Aldrich), as previously described88,89. Then, the tissue block was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 3 ml enzyme solution (HBSS, 10 mM HEPES, 0.54% glucose, 0.5 mM EDTA (15575020, Invitrogen), 1.0 mM l-cysteine (10309-41, Naclai Tesque), 5.0 µg ml−1 actinomycin D, 10 µM triptolide and 27.1 µg ml−1 anisomycin) containing 20 U papain per mouse (LS003127, Worthington Biochemical). The tissue was then homogenized by passing through a 18 G needle and was further incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Following homogenization using a 20 G needle, the resulting cell suspension was centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. The homogenate was separated by gradient centrifugation with 30% Percoll (P1644, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS at 500g for 25 min at 4 °C (no brake). The pellet containing astrocytes at the bottom of the tube was then collected and washed once with PBS containing 2% FBS and 10 mM EDTA before staining. Fc receptors were blocked with Fc block (2.4G2, BD Bioscience) for 10 min at 4 °C before incubation with primary antibodies. Cells were stained with antibodies directed against CD11b-BV786 (1:200, M1/70, BD Bioscience), CD45-APC-Cy7 (1:200, 30-F11, BioLegend), O1-eFluor660 (1:200, 50-6506-82, eBioscience) and ASCA2-PE-Cy7 (1:200, 130-116-246, Miltenyi Biotec) for 40 min at 4 °C. Additionally, cells were treated with hashtag antibodies to label source samples (TotalSeqB0301-B0310, B0312 and B0314, BioLegend). After washing, cells were sorted using a CytoFLEX SRT (Beckman Coulter). Data were acquired with CytExpert software (Beckman Coulter). Post-acquisition analysis was performed using FlowJo software, version 10.9.0. Single-cell libraries were generated and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer. Sequence reads were processed and aligned to the mouse genome (mm10, GENCODE vM23/Ensembl98; https://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A.tar.gz) using CellRanger 3.0. Initially, genes expressed in <3 cells and cells with <100 genes and mitochondrial reads <6% were excluded from the analysis. Pericytes were removed from amygdalar cells based on Pdgfrb. Hashtag oligos (HTOs) were demultiplexed using HTODemux and singlet cells were used for subsequent analysis. Principal component analysis was performed on the expression data matrix using the Seurat. Thirty principal components were used for generating tSNE plots. Transcriptomic clusters were identified from a total 1,903 amygdalar astrocytes with resolution set to 0.4. Differentially expressed gene candidates from a comparison of Adrb1-positive and Adrb1-negative astrocytes were estimated using Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test.

Cryosections were prepared as described above and stored at −80 °C. RNAscope in situ hybridization was performed using RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v.2 with TSA Vivid Dyes (ACDBio, 323270), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sections were washed for 5 min with PBS, and then heated at 60 °C for 30 min before post-fix. After dehydration in an ethanol series, hydrogen peroxide was applied for 10 min at room temperature. The sections were washed with ddH2O twice, and then incubated in Target Retrieval Reagents for 5 min at 90–100 °C. A wash with ddH2O for 15 s was followed by a dehydration with 100% ethanol for 3 min and dried at room temperature. Then, the sections were incubated with Protease III for 30 min at 40 °C. The sections were washed with ddH2O twice and then incubated with probes Mm-Fos (ACDBio, 316921), Mm-Adra1a (ACDBio, 408611), Mm-Adrb1-C2 (ACDBio, 449761-C2), Mm-Igfbp2 (ACDBio, 405951) and Mm-Slc1a3-C3 (ACDBio, 430781-C3) for 2 h at 40 °C. Thereafter, the sections were washed twice with wash buffer for 2 min between incubations at 40 °C. The sections were incubated in AMP1 for 30 min, AMP2 for 30 min and AMP3 for 15 min at 40 °C, then incubated in horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 15 min, fluorophore for 30 min and HRP-blocker for 15 min at 40 °C for each channel. In the staining of mCherry, slices were washed in 0.1 M PBS 3 times for 10 min each, followed by immunohistochemistry that was performed as described above. Following primary and secondary antibodies used: rabbit anti-RFP (1:250, Rockland, 600-401-379), Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit (1:1,000, Abcam, ab175692). Finally, the sections were incubated with DAPI at room temperature, removed DAPI, and mounted in Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen, P36934). Images were obtained in the same way as immunohistochemistry described above except with a step size of 0.5 µm. Images were processed with ImageJ. Astrocyte somata were delineated using Slc1a3 signals. The intensity of Fos, Adra1a, Adrb1 and Igfbp2 signals within the somata were measured. To account for differences in somata sizes, the signals were normalized using Slc1a3. Subsequently, the normalized signals were z-scored within each sample to evaluate gene expression across a heterogeneous cell population. This approach facilitated the robust identification of cells exhibiting high gene expression relative to the population mean. In Fig. 4e,f, adrenoreceptor-positive cells were identified based on scRNA-seq data, selecting the top 50% of cells ranked by Adra1a expression and the top 20% of cells ranked by Adrb1 expression. Co-expression index of Adra1a and Adrb1, calculated by relative expression level of Adra1a to NoFC median multiplied by relative expression level of Adrb1 for each cell. In Fig. 4j, the correlation analysis of Fos and Adrb1, expression levels were evaluated using z-scores of RNAscope signal intensity to assess gene expression across a heterogeneous population of cells, enabling robust identification of cells with high gene expression relative to the population mean. Specifically, we identified astrocytes with z-scores greater than 2 in RNAscope Fos signal intensity as Fos-high astrocytes, capturing 3% of the astrocyte population with significantly elevated Fos expression, consistent with scRNA-seq data in Fig. 4c where Fos-positive astrocytes occupied 4% of the total astrocytes analysed. Similarly, Adrb1-high astrocytes were identified using z-scores greater than 0.5, capturing 26% of astrocytes, also in line with scRNA-seq data in Fig. 4c where Adrb1-positive astrocytes occupied 20% of the total astrocytes analysed. In addition, Igfbp2-high astrocytes were identified using z-scores greater than 0.5, capturing 24% of all astrocytes in Extended Data Fig. 12d,e, which is consistent with scRNA-seq data indicating that Igfbp2-positive astrocytes occupy 24% of the total astrocytes analysed.

Most statistical tests were run in Prism 10.1.2 (GraphPad). The specific tests used are indicated in the figure legends and Supplementary Table 1. All tests were two-sided unless otherwise noted. Astrocyte Fos count analyses across groups for each brain region were run with R v.4.3.2 on RStudio v.2023.12.1.402 and relied on the tidyverse, car, dunn.test and dplyr packages and base R functions aov(), TukeyHSD() and p.adjust(). The data were first analysed with Levene's test for homogeneity of variance. Brain regions that passed Levene's test (P > 0.05) were followed by a one-way ANOVA test with Tukey's honest significant difference test and regions that failed Levene's test (P < 0.05; no homogeneity of variances) were followed by the Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's post hoc test and Bonferroni adjustment. False discovery rates were calculated across groups and brain regions from post hoc P values using the Benjamini–Hochberg method.

Mice were randomly assigned to experimental groups, and mice assigned to different experimental conditions were run in parallel. Mouse experiments and analyses were done blinded to group allocation. Tissue samples that yielded insufficient cell counts (less than 30 cells) during scRNA-seq quality control were excluded from the study. The results of statistical comparisons, n numbers and P values are shown in the figure panels or figure legends along with averages. n is defined as the numbers of cells, sections or mice throughout on a case-by-case basis; the unit of analysis is stated in the text or in each figure legend. In the figures, summarized data are shown as mean ± s.e.m. with a scatter plot and P values are indicated by asterisks: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.

Men's Brains Shrink Faster than Women's. What That Means for Alzheimer's

Women's brains age more slowly than men's, but they still have higher rates of Alzheimer's disease

During ageing, men experience a greater reduction in volume across more regions of the brain than women do, according to a longitudinal study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The authors suggest this means that age-related brain changes do not explain why women are more frequently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease than men are.

“It's really important that we understand what happens in the healthy brain so that we can better understand what happens when people get these neurodegenerative conditions,” says Fiona Kumfor, a clinical neuropsychologist at the University of Sydney, Australia. This study adds to scientists' understanding of typical brain ageing, she adds.

Nearly twice as many women are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease as men, and ageing is the biggest risk factor for the disease. This has prompted research into age-related sex differences in the brain. “If women's brains declined more, that could have helped explain their higher Alzheimer's prevalence,” says co-author Anne Ravndal, a PhD student at the University of Oslo.

Previous research investigating sex differences in brain ageing has shown mixed results, Ravndal adds. Several studies have found that men experience greater loss of total grey matter and hippocampus size compared with women, whereas other work has reported a sharper decline of grey matter in women.

The latest study included more than 12,500 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans from 4,726 people — at least two scans per person, taken an average of three years apart — who did not have Alzheimer's disease or any cognitive impairments and were control participants in 14 larger data sets. The researchers compared how the individuals' brain structures changed over time, looking at factors including the thickness of grey matter and the size of areas that are associated with Alzheimer's disease, such as the hippocampus, which is essential to memory.

Overall, men experienced a greater reduction in volume across more regions of the brain than women did. For example, the postcentral cortex, which is responsible for processing sensations of touch, pain and temperature, as well as the body's own position and movements, declined by 2.0% per year in men and by 1.2% annually in women.

Kumfor says the results suggest that men age faster than women do. Men also have a shorter life expectancy.

If these changes did have a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, the study would have shown that women experience a greater decline in areas associated with the disease, such as the hippocampus and precuneus, which are involved in memory, says Amy Brodtmann, a clinician researcher in cognitive health at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.

Ravndal says the results point to other possible explanations for the sex differences in prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, such as differences in survival or susceptibility to the disease.

That sex differences in brain volume don't seem to play a part in the condition is not entirely surprising, says Kumfor, because neurodegenerative conditions are complex. Understanding the disorders will require longitudinal studies involving people with Alzheimer's disease, to compare how their brains change over time. “Just looking at age-related changes in brain atrophy is unlikely to explain the complexities behind it,” she adds.

Although the study is robust, further investigations with more diverse data sets are needed, says Brodtmann. For example, people included in the study had high levels of education — a protective factor against Alzheimer's disease — meaning that they were not fully representative of the general population. The data sets also lacked information about other factors that influence a person's risk of Alzheimer's disease, such as ethnicity and the age at which women experience menopause.

The authors say that when they adjusted their analysis for education level, some parts of men's brains no longer showed a steeper decline than occurred in women. When they compared men and women who were predicted to live for the same number of years, rather than those of the same age, the two groups' brains declined at similar rates.

A new randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial suggests that a single round of low-dose radiation therapy could offer a safe and effective alternative for people suffering from painful knee osteoarthritis.

Participants with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis experienced notable pain reduction and improved mobility within four months of receiving the treatment. The radiation exposure was only a tiny fraction of what is used in cancer therapy. Because the study included a control group that underwent a simulated treatment, researchers were able to clearly separate genuine treatment effects from placebo responses, which are common in osteoarthritis trials. Early results from this Korean study were presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Annual Meeting.

"People with painful knee osteoarthritis often face a difficult choice between the risks of side effects from pain medications and the risks of joint replacement surgery," said Byoung Hyuck Kim, MD, PhD, principal investigator on the trial and an assistant professor of radiation oncology at Seoul National University College of Medicine, Boramae Medical Center. "There's a clinical need for moderate interventions between weak pain medications and aggressive surgery, and we think radiation may be a suitable option for those patients especially when drugs and injections are poorly tolerated."

Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting an estimated 32.5 million adults in the United States. It develops as the cartilage that cushions bone ends wears away over time. The condition often targets the knees and hips, limiting mobility and diminishing quality of life. Typical treatment begins with lifestyle adjustments and pain-relief medications, with surgery considered when symptoms become severe.

Low-dose radiation therapy has long been used in European countries such as Germany and Spain to treat joint pain, where it is widely accepted. However, Dr. Kim noted that before this study, rigorous placebo-controlled evidence was scarce, and awareness of the treatment remained low among clinicians in other parts of the world.

"There is a misconception that medicinal, or therapeutic, radiation is always delivered in high doses," he said. "But for osteoarthritis, the doses are only a small fraction of what we use for cancer, and the treatment targets joints that are positioned away from vital organs, which lowers the likelihood of side effects." In this study, he explained, the radiation dose was less than 5% of what is typically used in cancer therapy, and no radiation-related side effects were observed.

The multicenter study included 114 participants with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis, recruited from three academic hospitals in Korea. They were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a very low dose (0.3 Gy), a low dose (3 Gy), or a control group that received simulated (sham) radiation. In the placebo group, patients went through the same setup as those receiving treatment, but no radiation was actually delivered. Each participant underwent six treatment sessions without knowing which group they were assigned to.

To ensure the results reflected the true effects of radiation, the researchers restricted the use of additional pain relievers, allowing only acetaminophen as needed during the four-month follow-up period. The effectiveness of treatment was evaluated using internationally recognized standards, identifying a participant as a "responder" if they achieved meaningful improvement in at least two of three measures: pain, physical function, and overall assessment of their condition. Participants also completed separate questionnaires addressing pain, stiffness, and mobility. No treatment-related side effects were reported.

After four months, 70% of patients in the 3 Gy group met responder criteria, compared to 42% in the placebo group (p=0.014). Outcomes in the 0.3 Gy group were not significantly different from the control group (58.3% improved, p=0.157), indicating the 3 Gy regimen drove relief beyond placebo effects.

Meaningful improvements in the composite score of pain, stiffness and physical function were reported more often in the 3 Gy group (56.8%) than in the placebo group (30.6%, p=0.024). For other secondary outcomes, including the amount of pain medication needed, there were no significant differences.

Dr. Kim said this trial differed from previous research in two critical ways. "The sham-controlled design helped rule out placebo effects, and we limited stronger analgesics, which made differences between groups more clearly attributable to the radiation itself," he said.

"In previous studies, drugs such as NSAIDs or opioids were also used during the intervention or follow-up period. But using these pain relievers could mask the effects of radiation therapy," he said. Because analgesic use was limited to acetaminophen only during the four months of follow-up in this trial, "that means the differences between treatment groups are more clearly attributable to the low-dose radiation therapy itself."

Responses in the placebo arms were substantial -- about 40% met the criteria for treatment response without true radiation -- but are consistent with rates reported in prior osteoarthritis trials of injections or medications and in at least one similar European study, Dr. Kim said. "It was surprising, and it underscores how important placebo-controlled designs are in osteoarthritis research. We need to examine this more closely in future studies."

Radiation therapy may be best suited for patients with underlying inflammation and preserved joint structure, he explained. "For severe osteoarthritis, where the joint is physically destroyed and cartilage is already gone, radiation will not regenerate tissue," Dr. Kim said. "But for people with mild to moderate disease, this approach could delay the need for joint replacement."

He emphasized that low-dose radiation should be considered as part of shared decision-making alongside standard measures such as weight loss, physiotherapy, and medications. "In clinical practice, responses could be even stronger when radiation is properly combined with other treatments, and patient satisfaction may be higher than with current options alone."

The research team is completing 12-month follow-up to assess durability of benefits and to correlate symptom relief with imaging-based measures of joint structure. Planned studies also include larger, pragmatic trials to evaluate outcomes in specific subgroups and health-economic analyses comparing low-dose radiation with injections and medication regimens.

The relationship between the sites means an earthquake in one zone can trigger an earthquake in the other in a phenomenon called “stress triggering.”

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Researchers hoping to unravel the dance of earthquake movement in North America's West Coast discovered a disturbing fact: Two of the world's largest fault lines sometimes work in conjunction. History, as it turns out, shows that an earthquake in either the Cascadia Subduction Zone or the San Andreas Fault can trigger an earthquake in the other. 

In a new study published in the journal Geosphere, researchers from Oregon State University—led by Chris Goldfinger, a marine geologist and geophysicist—show evidence of what's called “partial synchronization” of the northern San Andreas Fault and Cascadia Subduction Zone. Partial synchronization basically means that an earthquake event in one zone has a history of triggering events in the other, and the historical evidence of “significant interaction” between the two (and the potential for more in the future) should be taken as a warning. 

The core piece of evidence of this relationship comes from the seabed. The team mined 130 sediment cores (dating back 3,100 years) from the Mendocino Triple Junction—where the Cascadia Subduction Zone's Juan de Fuca plate and Gorda plate (under the North American Plate) rendezvous with the San Andreas Fault off the coast of northern California. There, the sediment layers showed unusual turbidite (the layers formed by marine landslides moving the ocean floor) action, which is often a telltale sign of an earthquake. 

A typical turbidite features coarse sediment at the bottom with the finer silt settling at the top. At the Mendocino Triple Junction, however, that structure was flipped and “seem[ed] to be upside down with all the sand at the top,” Goldfinger told Scientific American. “And as far as we know, gravity hasn't changed.”

That likely implies those unique turbidite formations were stacked by two earthquakes, one from each zone, in quick succession—a matter of years or even minutes apart. The study shows that eight of the turbidite bends have “substantial temporal overlap” between the Cascadia Subduction Zone and the San Andreas Fault, and that the last major synchronization earthquake event occurred around 1700.

Goldfinger compared the situation to tuning a radio to convert incoming signals. “When you tune an old radio, you're essentially causing one oscillator to vibrate at the same frequency as the other one,” he said. “When these faults synchronize, one fault could tune up the other and cause earthquakes in pairs.” 

Just because it's been over 300 years since the last paired quake, however, it doesn't eliminate future possibilities. “We could expect that an earthquake on one of the faults alone would draw down the resources of the whole country to respond to it,” Goldfinger told The Guardian. “If they both went off together, then you've got potentially San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver [B.C.] all in an emergency situation in a compressed timeframe.”

While there were only eight major events, the evidence showed the two areas were so closely linked that near-simultaneous quakes weren't so much a rarity as a rule. 

“In the paper we stuck to the geology instead of dwelling on the potential doom and gloom,” Goldfinger said. “But it's pretty clear that if something like this happened—and we think the evidence for it is strong—we need to be prepared.”

A natural sweetener derived from the Stevia plant could have a previously unknown superpower.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Few people like going bald—there's a reason why hair growth is a multi-billion industry. One of the leading causes of hair loss is androgenetic alopecia, otherwise known as pattern hair loss, which impacts up to 50 percent of both men and women. One of the most widespread medications for baldness, which is the active ingredient in products like Rogaine, is minoxidil (originally developed to treat high blood pressure).

While this treatment has helped many people grow hair, it does come with a few downsides. Standard treatments typically have poor water solubility and skin permeability, so some hair growth experts resort to applying minoxidil with microneedling, a technique that punctures small holes in the top layer of the skin to stimulate growth factors and increase the medication's absorption. 

As described in a new study, scientists from China and Australia have developed a dissolving patch that can perform this microneedling work while also delivering a dose of minoxidil to the scalp, and it's derived from a somewhat unlikely ingredient: Stevioside (STV), the natural sweetener derived from the Stevia plant. The results of the study were published in the journal Advanced Healthcare Materials.

“Using STV as a novel solubilizing agent, we incorporated minoxidil into a dissolving microneedle patch, which was used to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of minoxidil and overcome the limitations of traditional carrier single-function approaches,” the authors wrote in the study. “This method not only enhances drug penetration into skin but also eliminates other issues associated with traditional topical formulations, such as slow onset of action and/or inaccurate dosing.”

As the authors note, while testosterone doesn't directly cause baldness, the enzyme 5α-reductase converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone, which triggers the apoptosis (or death) of keratin-producing cells in the epidermis. Minoxidil, however, suppresses certain enzymes and inhibits androgen receptors, which has the net effect of decreasing the formation and binding of dihydrotestosterone. It also boosts aromatase, which converts testosterone into estradiol—a kind of estrogen that further stimulates hair growth.

To test their new idea, researchers used mouse models with androgenetic alopecia and tested their new patch against standard treatments. In 35 days, scientists saw hair regrowth in 67 percent of the target area, compared to only 25 percent from the control group—a promising start for this Stevia-based hair loss treatment. Of course, mice are one thing, and humans are another.

“While the mouse model results are promising, human hair growth cycles differ, and androgenetic alopecia is influenced by multiple factors,” Lifeng Kang, a co-author of the study from the University of Sydney, told Gizmodo. “Therefore, clinical trials are essential to confirm efficacy and safety in humans.”

Unwanted hair loss isn't a thing of the past (at least, not yet), but science has it in its crosshairs—no pun intended.

Spatial biology pursues the analysis of cells in their native microenvironment, often with regard to morphology and gene- or protein expression. The spatial analysis of lipid and metabolic profiles by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) can add another layer of molecular information. A seamless integration of MSI data with other (multimodal) methods at a single-cell level is often hampered by insufficient co-registration and resolution. Here, we introduce a MALDI-MSI based method that integrates in-source bright-field and fluorescence microscopy, allowing for a coupled (sub-)cellular investigation of the same sample in both modalities. Presented examples from cell culture and tissue analysis include the visualization of intracellular lipid distributions in macrophages during phagocytosis, and the heterogeneity of lipid profiles of tumor infiltrating neutrophils correlated to their individual microenvironments. The achieved combination of lipid profiling with morphological features and protein expression on the single-cell level constitutes a powerful method for cell biology.

Two cells in a tissue or a cell culture are never exactly identical, even if they share the same genetic heritage and microenvironment. This heterogeneity can be a consequence of differences in age, ontogeny, or tissue imprinting, resulting in alterations of morphology, gene expression, molecular composition, and ultimately function. In living systems, individual cells are part of interdependent multicellular structures, i.e., tissues, and undergo a constant exchange within local regulatory networks as part of the almost inestimable complexity that is life. Thus, to characterize the identity and state of a cell, the description should follow a holistic approach and include information from a wide range of analytical techniques1.

In recent years, single-cell RNAseq and spectral flow cytometry have emerged as valuable tools to profile cellular heterogeneity. Similarly, advances in single-cell proteomics provide information on the heterogeneity on the protein level, albeit with much lower throughput2,3. Under the umbrella of spatial biology, the emergence of spatial-omics technologies including deep visual proteomics, multiplexed immunohistochemistry and spatial RNAseq have added information on morphology and the spatial relationship of cells4,5,6,7.

A complementary addition to these techniques is the analysis by high spatial resolution mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). Importantly, this method can augment information on active transcripts and protein expression with the resulting downstream production of lipids and further metabolites, as well as glycans and peptides8. The most widely used MSI approach is based on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI). Herein, finely focused laser pulses are applied to pre-defined pixel positions on the sample surface, resulting in spatially defined mass spectra that can be processed to reveal signal intensity maps for up to hundreds of analytes differentiated based on their molecular weight. To increase signal intensity for a wide range of analyte classes, the technique can be amended with laser postionization (MALDI-2)9.

Typically, eukaryotic cells stretch over distances between 10 and 100 µm and display a wide variety in shape and form. Prominent sub-cellular structures like the nucleus or other large organelles, but also morphological features, show sizes between 3 and 10 µm. Their spatially resolved analysis, therefore, requires pixel sizes of no more than 1 × 1 µm². The current bench-mark figure on the pixel size of MALDI-MSI, however, is at about 5 × 5 µm². Less established experimental techniques dedicated to high resolving power, such as transmission-mode or inverse geometry (t-)MALDI-2-MSI and others, enables pixel sizes ≤ 1 × 1 µm² and can thus fulfill this criterion10,11,12,13,14,15,16.

Recent applications of MALDI-2 and t-MALDI-2-MSI for single-cell mass spectrometry have revealed a strong molecular heterogeneity for lipids and metabolites within clonal populations of cells and seemingly homogeneous tissue regions, demonstrating its high potential for cell biology research17,18,19,20. To contextualize these metabolic phenotypes with existing knowledge on the single-cell level, however, MALDI-MSI has to be connected to prevalent microscopy techniques conducted on the same slide. To date, the general application of this contextualization on the same slide is strongly limited by three main factors: The spatial resolving power of MALDI-MSI, precise co-registration with optical modalities, and automation of data analysis. Especially in the context of tightly packed cellular systems, such as tissue, shortcomings of the first two factors lead to erroneous or ambiguous assignment of mass spectrometric information to individual cells. To date, this restricts the analysis on the single cell level directly from tissue to laborious manual annotation of comparably low numbers of cells, while automated analysis is limited to cellular neighborhoods rather than single cells17,18,21.

To address these challenges, we here present the development of hard and software solutions on a prototype ion source coupled to an orthogonal time-of-flight (oTOF) mass analyzer. Our approach enables the generation of unambiguous cell-specific molecular and morphometric information of statistically relevant numbers of cells directly from tissue. It utilizes transmission mode for ultra-high spatial resolution and is equipped with laser postionization (MALDI-2) to increase sensitivity for the analysis of lipids and metabolites9,15,22,23. While previous implementations of t-MALDI ion sources have only hinted at the potential to utilize the employed optical components for microscopy of the sample inside the ion source15,24, we here make full use of this option by including in-source bright field (BF) as well as fluorescence microscopy (FM).

A full technical description of the optical setup and preparation protocols is presented in the methods. In short, the ion source of a Bruker timsTOF-fleX MALDI-2 was amended for t-MALDI analysis. Dedicated lighting strategies enable the use of BF as well as FM inside the ion source (Fig. 1a,b). Importantly, laser delivery and in-source microscopy share essential components of the optical beam path and for stage movement. In the xy-plane (sample surface), the site of laser ablation is therefore directly linked to a specific position on the optical microscope image. Different from other instrumentation that combines MALDI-MSI with microscopy in one instrument25,26, this design feature inherently co-registers both modalities by utilizing the same coordinate system for in-source microscopy and MALDI-MSI (Fig. 1a). Next to providing highly resolved orientation to set up imaging runs, FM-images acquired inside the ion source constitute a unique and essential link for precise co-registration to other optical modalities. In the z-direction, the inherent coupling of the focal plane of optical microscopy and laser delivery enables a fast and easy setup of experiments based on autofocusing routines.

a A schematic drawing of the t-MALDI-2 setup illustrates the general layout. The sample is illuminated homogeneously by an LED ring. Light is collected by the microscope objective and focused onto the sensor of a digital camera. The MALDI laser-beam is co-aligned using a dichroic mirror and focused onto the sample by the same objective. Ions generated by the MALDI process with optional MALDI-2 are extracted to a mass analyzer. b A horizontal cut through the schematic displays the fluorescence microscope components. Fluorescence is excited by a fiber-coupled LED and filtered by an excitation filter, a dichroic mirror and an emission filter. ((a) and (b) are renderings created by the authors in Autodesk Fusion 360.) c To enable fluorescence microscopy and t-MALDI-2-MSI on the same sample, different staining steps are performed following a brief fixation. Samples are imaged with an external slide scanning fluorescence microscope, and are then prepared for MALDI-MSI by homogeneous coating with MALDI matrix (Supplementary Fig. 5 A, B, D). To enable high fidelity co-registration of the fluorescence microscopy image, a second fluorescence image is recorded inside the ion source prior to t-MALDI-2-MSI (Supplementary Fig. 1a, d-e).

To enable FM analysis prior to MSI analysis, we have developed dedicated staining protocols optimized to omit or strongly reduce chemical alterations and spatial delocalization of the analyte content of interest. In parts these are based on protocols developed for the analysis of cell culture17,20. To control for the adverse effect of immunofluorescence (IF) staining on overall performance reported in the literature27, the speficially developed methods and pipelines were benchmarked with regard to microscopic image quality, conservation of chemical and morphological integrity, as well as mass spectrometric depth of information.

For this, we conducted combined FM and t-MALDI-2-MSI on coronal cryo-sections of fresh-frozen mouse cerebellum. This tissue exhibits histological features across different lateral scales, each presenting distinct lipid profiles. It has been intensely used as a model system across a wide range of microscopic and MSI methods28,29,30,31 and is well characterized with regard to its lipidome based on the analysis of lipid extracts32. Details on sample preparation and data acquisition are described in the methods.

To inspect and demonstrate the quality of our dedicated staining-based FM analysis on the same tissue section prior to t-MALDI-MSI analysis, we employed small molecule stains, targeting the nuclei and F-actin, as well as IF to target calbindin expressed in Purkinje cell bodies (Fig. 1c). Slide scanning FM recorded prior to matrix application in an external microscope (VS200, Evident) at 50X displays the expected structures and morphology for all three staining methods in high quality and corroborates the feasibility of the employed protocols (Fig. 2a–c).

a An external fluorescence image of an 8 µm thick section of a mouse cerebellum recorded prior to matrix application using Hoechst 33342 (nuclei, DAPI channel, blue), CellMask Green Actin Tracking Stain (actin, FITC channel, green) and Alexa Fluor 594 Anti-calbindin antibody (calbindin, TxRed channel, red). The different layers of the brain (molecular layer, granular layer, and arbor vitae), as well as the Purkinje cells are well distinguishable. b The external FM image is overlayed with the ion signal intensity distribution of [PC(40:6) + H]+ at m/z 834.60 (gray) revealing a successful co-registration of both modalities. c The overlay of three ion signal intensities of the molecular ion of Hoechst 33342 at m/z 452.23 (cyan), [PC(38:6) + H]+ at m/z 806.57 (magenta) and [PC(40:6) + H]+ at m/z 834.60 (yellow), affirms the ability to produce images of high contrast while preserving and reproducing the biological structure of the sample.

After matrix application by resublimation, the sample was transferred into the MALDI ion source, followed by in-source slide scanning FM (50X, DAPI channel). Utilizing the FM image of the DAPI channel generated inside the ion source as an intermediate enables a straightforward co-registration of external FM images with MALDI-MSI (Supplementary Fig. 1a). In this, our approach omits the use of fiducial markers across modalities, relieving an inherent limitation of conventional methods. Difficulties in the identification of these “cross-modality” markers that need to represent the exact same spatial location in conventional methods have been described to limit the precision and spatial fidelity of co-registration of FM and MSI on a cellular or sub-cellular level, especially for large areas of interest21,33,34.

Subsequently, t-MALDI-2-MSI data at a pixel size of 1 × 1 µm² were acquired in positive ion mode. Equivalent data in the negative ion mode was recorded on a neighboring section. Facilitated by the choice of matrix and the use of MALDI-2, mass spectra in the positive mode produce more depth of information, and this ion mode was used for all further experiments (Supplementary Table 1). Overview and zoomed in regions of the resulting MS images display distinct intensity distributions demonstrated on the example of ion signals of two different phosphatidylcholines (PC) ([PC(38:6) + H]+ at m/z 806.57 and [PC(40:6) + H]+ at m/z 834.60) and the molecular ion signal of the Hoechst stain of the nuclei at m/z 452.23 (Fig. 2c).

Direct comparison of t-MALDI-2-MSI with microscopy confirms that morphological features at the different lateral scales are largely retained during the matrix application step and subsequent MSI analysis (Fig. 2b). The overlay of both modalities reveals a strong correlation with histological features of the white matter and granular layer, discernible based on the F-actin staining and the nuclei. Similarly, signal intensity distribution of PC(40:6), associated with the Purkinje cell layer35 shows good correlation with the IF-based specific staining of these structures (Fig. 2b). Overall, deviations for co-registration were found to be less than 1 µm (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c and Supplementary Note 1), corroborating the precision and fidelity of our approach.

To explore the depth of information for lipid analysis available from pre-stained t-MALDI-2-MSI, mass spectral information was matched against data from an unstained tissue section of the same brain. Overall, the staining protocol does not introduce a decrease in depth of lipid information with regard to the tentatively assigned lipids species (Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 2). While alkali metal cations of lipids dominate the spectra of the naïve tissue sections staining, washing steps that are part of the staining protocols shift the ionization towards protonation (Supplementary Fig. 2). Interestingly, only the naïve tissue produces sizeable signal intensities of phosphatidic acids. Their appearance has been associated with in-source fragmentation of alkali metal cations of other phospholipids36.

In addition, lipid information from t-MALDI-2-MSI was compared to a previously published full lipidomics profile for murine cerebellum derived from bulk32. This analysis reveals that ~82% of the reported molecular lipid content of cerebellum is detected in the t-MALDI-2 measurement (Supplementary Note 2). This amounts to 66 annotated ion species that produce contrast-rich intensity distributions in t-MALDI-2-MSI in positive and/or negative ion mode measurements (Supplementary Table 1). Comparison of the detected signal intensities with the molar content of the different lipoforms of each of the detected lipid classes shows a good agreement with the literature32 (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Note 2). Notably, this includes lipid classes, such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS) that have been described to be affected if more extensive chemical fixation is used during sample preparation37, corroborating the aptitude of our speficially developed protocols.

To demonstrate the potential of histology guided t-MALDI-2-MSI for the analysis of sub-cellular structures, we investigated THP-1-derived macrophages. Cells were cultured and differentiated directly in chamber slides. Freshly differentiated cells were incubated with pHrodo red E. coli bioparticles for 2 h. Upon phagocytosis, these particles become fluorescent and pinpoint acidified phagolysosomes inside the cells. For analysis, cells were briefly fixed and their actin filament and nuclei stained following MALDI compatible protocols previously reported17.

Slide scanning FM on an external slide scanner prior to coating with MALDI matrix reveals heterogeneously pronounced phagocytosis with some cells showing a large number of internalized bioparticles (Fig. 3a).

a Fluorescence image of THP-1 derived macrophages recorded before MALDI matrix application with a slide scanning microscope using Hoechst 33342 (nuclei, DAPI channel, blue), CellMask Green Actin Tracking Stain (actin, FITC channel, green) and pHrodo (phagolysosomes, Cy3 channel, red). b An overlay of three different ion signal intensity distributions measured using t-MALDI-2-MSI with 1.5 × 1.5 µm² pixel size in positive ion mode of the molecular ion of Hoechst 33342 (m/z 452.23, blue), [PE(33:1) + H]+ (m/z 704.52, red) and [PC(34:1) + H]+ (m/z 760.58, green) reveals a strong cell-to-cell heterogeneity. c and d Zoom in from (a) and (b), marked in each as a blue and red square, respectively, demonstrates intracellular differences in lipid distribution. To investigate the intracellular molecular distributions related to phagocytosis, masks for the regions with pHrodo+ (red) and remaining cell (green) are created based on the FM image. The outlines of the masks identified by the pHrodo stain are overlayed with the MSI results to demonstrate the quality of co-registration.

After coating with MALDI matrix using resublimation, in-source FM (50X) and t-MALDI-2-MSI data at 1.5 × 1.5 µm² pixel size in positive ion mode were collected for a few hundred cells (Fig. 3b). Image co-registration between the externally generated FM image and MSI data was performed by using the in-source FM data as an intermediate (Supplementary Fig. 1d). The overlay of both modalities corroborates a high-fidelity co-registration on the level of the employed MALDI pixel size. Areas visualized by the pHrodo red stain in FM accurately co-align with the distribution of specific lipid signal intensities in MSI, revealing little to no leakage or diffusion of lipid content or other preparation artifacts that may compromise (sub-)cellular integrity (Fig. 3c,d)22.

To investigate the molecular distributions specifically related to phagolysosomes, we used subcellular spatial information provided by the fluorescence signal produced by the uptake of pHrodo bioparticles. Utilizing the high-fidelity co-registration, we overlayed this histological information to t-MALDI-2-MSI data and identified those pixels that correlate with phagolysosomes to generate phagolysosome-specific mass spectra. (Fig. 3c,d). Lipid annotation was based on previously published results for THP-1 derived macrophages and E. coli, respectively20,38.

Comparative analysis of the resulting phagolysosome-specific molecular information revealed an increase of signal intensity for numerous lipid species (Fig. 4). Confirmed by the respective MS images, lipids, such as PE(33:1) and PE(34:2) spatially correlate with the phagolysosomes identified by fluorescence (Fig. 3c,d). Both PE species are abundantly expressed in the membrane of E. coli cells38. Notably, PE(33:1) is not detected in non-phagocytosing THP-1 cells at all (Fig. 3b–d, red trace). Its presence, confirmed by additional on-cell MS/MS experiments (described in Methods), provides a direct link to the phagocytized pathogen material and corroborates the highly accurate co-registration of both modalities.

Comparative analysis of the resulting region-specific mass spectral data from masks as shown in Fig. 3c,d reveal an increase of signal intensity for a number of lipid species inside the pHrodo+ regions. Signals with a log2 fold change above 2.8 are marked in red. Identified m/z-values are denoted in a table with tentative assignments, where applicable.

Other tentatively assigned lipid species linked to the phagolysosomes can be attributed to degradation of E. coli-derived phospholipids during phagocytosis39,40. These degradation products are most likely the result of enzymatic activity and reactions with reactive oxygen species inside the phagolysosomes. They include lipid metabolites, such as the diacylglycerol DG(33:1), which can be directly linked to the enzymatic cleavage of PE(33:1) and lipid species tentatively identified as lysophosphatidylglycerols (LPG). The latter can be linked to the enzymatic breakdown of phosphatidylglycerols (PG) and cardiolipins (CL) both highly expressed in the membrane of E.coli 38,40 (Fig. 4).

In a second exemplary study, we applied our methods to the single-cell molecular analysis of tumor tissue. This tissue type typically contains a large number of different cell types in a wide range of states, translating to a wide variety of metabolic microenvironments (tumor microenvironment (TME)) of different size and shape and a highly heterogeneous lipid profile across the tissue41.

The employed 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma model is highly malignant with locally aggressive growth and exhibits metastasis to regional lymph nodes and distant organs, particularly lung, liver, and bone42,43. It has diverse inflammatory TMEs with a large number of infiltrating immune cells, such as T-cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells present44,45. The site and cell-specific molecular profile of these immune cells is of great importance for their fate and function and is believed to be in constant interdependence with their microenvironment46. Consequently, the investigation of this crosstalk not only requires a molecular analysis at the cellular level but also an assessment of the immediate vicinity.

For analysis, a heterogeneous area of interest that includes a broad range of TMEs was selected based on H&E staining and histological annotation (Fig. 5a). A consecutive section was prepared using MALDI-compatible staining that targets cell nuclei, F-actin, and three IF stains that selectively target immune cells, (CD45), neutrophils (Ly6G), and T3 neutrophils (DcTRAIL-R1)46,47. All channels were recorded on the complete section using external slide scanning FM at 50X before matrix application (Fig. 5b). Co-registration with t-MALDI-2-MSI was based on the DAPI channel recorded inside the ion source after matrix application as an intermediate (Supplementary Fig. 1e). After microscopy, t-MALDI-2-MSI data was recorded in positive ion mode in seven separate measurements across the region of interest at a pixel size of 1 × 1 µm² resulting in a total of approx. 7 Mpixels. For data analysis, we selected 63 molecular ion species annotated to individual lipid species based on exact mass ( < 3 ppm) (see Supplementary Fig. 4 for selected images and Supplementary Table 3).

Zooms show cell masks overlaid with FM and MSI. For MSI ion signal intensity of [PC(O 32:0) + H]+ at m/z 720.59 selected exemplarily.

Spatial distribution for a number of glycero- and glycerophospholipids such as [PC(34:1) + H]+ at m/z 760.58 reveal a sizeable heterogeneity across the tumor sample (Fig. 5c, Supplementary Fig. 4). Signal intensity of the ether lipid [PC(O-32:0) + H]+, detected at m/z 720.59, correlates with the neutrophil-specific Ly6G-stain (Fig. 5d–f). This is consistent with a significant overexpression of this lipid species in mouse neutrophils reported previously48,49.

Other specific signal intensity distributions also directly correlate with structures visible in the microscopy data. As expected50, signal intensity for triacylglycerides (TG) such as [TG(52:5) + H]+ correlates with the adipose tissue (Fig. 5c). Acylcarnitine, detected at m/z 428.38 as [ACAR(18:0) + H]+ is an important intermediate in lipid metabolism and a reported marker for hypoxia51. Its signal intensity distribution correlates with the detection of tumor-associated T3 neutrophils identified by the DcTRAIL-R1 staining that have been described to be found in hypoxic areas46,47 (Fig. 5e). Heme B, detected at m/z 616.18, is directly associated with erythrocytes and, hence, serves as marker for hemorrhage or blood vessels52 (Fig. 5f).

While general assignment of lipid profiles to TMEs has been reported previously, the approach described here allows for the analysis of single cells within their tissue environment in statistically relevant numbers. For this we adapted our previously reported workflow for the analysis of single cells in culture to the analysis of tissue sections17,20. Robust and reliable cell segmentation, necessary for automated analysis21, was provided based on the external FM images using Mesmer by DeepCell (Fig. 5g)53. This resulted in segmentation masks for each cell and enabled the calculation of a variety of morphometric parameters using CellProfiler54.

To produce single-cell mass spectra, cell segmentation masks were projected on the t-MALDI-2-MSI data, again taking advantage of the inherent link between in-source FM and the acquired MSI data (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Of note, already small inaccuracies of the co-registration on the order of a few micrometer as well as increased pixel size can lead to larger ambiguities in the assignment of MS data to specific single cells17,21. An overlay of the projected masks with the lipid neutrophil marker [PC(O-32:0) + H]+ and comparison to the specific Ly6G staining demonstrates the high-fidelity co-registration and corroborates the ability of our combined method to deduce single-cell mass spectra (Fig. 5g).

Single-cell molecular data is generated for all 63 annotated lipid species by summing the respective signal intensities over all pixels allocated to a specific cell using the respective mask. Subsequently, all values are normalized to the sum of all signal intensities for the respective cell.

Cell segmentation and subsequent data analysis resulted in combined morphometric and molecular data for 63,408 individual cells. Notably, this analysis retains the histological context of all cells and includes parameters describing location within the tissue and fluorescence intensity for all employed channels. This enables the identification of CD45+, Ly6G+, and DcTRAIL-R1+ cells based on intensity thresholding for each specific channel. For visualization, this information can be projected onto the segmentation canvas, thereby identifying the location and local density of different sub-groups of immune cells in the tissue section (Fig. 6a).

a Cell masks colored corresponding to their FM-based classification are projected onto their original position of the t-MALDI-2-MSI measurement region. Ly6G+ cells are depicted in red, CD45+ cells in yellow, and DcTRAIL-R1+ cells in cyan. All other cells are marked in dark gray. b The 59,998 Ly6G- cells were separated into eight different clusters (tissue microenvironments) using k-means clustering on the standardized single-cell MS data. Cell masks for Ly6G- cells are colored according to their cluster and projected onto their original position of the t-MALDI-2-MSI measurement region. All other cells are marked in dark gray. c 3410 Ly6G+ cells were identified based on FM and selected for analysis. They are plotted in a UMAP based on a list of 63 annotated ion signals. Each dot represents an individual cell, while the distance between dots visualizes the similarity of the standardized lipid profiles of the cells. Using DBSCAN, the UMAP reveals eight clearly discernable clusters (neutrophil subtypes) which are color coded. d Cell masks for Ly6G+ cells are projected onto their original position of the t-MALDI-2-MSI measurement region. All other cells are marked dark gray. The colors of cell masks correlates with the clusters found in (c). e Zoom-in of the region annotated with lymphocyte accumulation (red squares in a, b, and d). f Zoom-in of the region annotated with intratumoral hemorrhage (blue squares in a, b, and d).

Processing of the combined IF and MSI single-cell data enabled spatial biology analysis on the level of lipids and metabolites, by classifying cells based on molecular similarity. In this context, analysis on the single-cell basis is especially important for scarce or isolated cells like specific immune cells because their molecular profile may substantially differ from the surrounding TME. This type of analysis is demonstrated on the example of infiltrating neutrophils inside the 4T1 tumor section.

To classify neutrophils based on their molecular profile independent of their microenvironment and vice versa, single-cell data were split into two groups based on Ly6G staining. The resulting subgroups contained 3410 Ly6G+ neutrophils and 59,998 Ly6G- cells, respectively. Both groups were independently analyzed using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and appropriate clustering algorithms.

To identify molecularly similar cell types within the tissue, all Ly6G- cells were subjected to k-means clustering, resulting in eight discernible clusters. By assigning a specific color to each cluster, the outlines of each cell can be filled in with the respective color and projected back onto their original location (Fig. 6b).

The resulting map of classified cells displays clearly discernible tissue micro-environments where molecularly similar cells cluster in specific areas of the tissue. Clusters IV, V, and VIII contain cells of the skin, the adipose tissue, and the wider tumor periphery, respectively. Inside the viable tumor tissue, a clear separation into TMEs reveals a layer-like structure with frayed edges (clusters II, III, and VI). Cluster VII contains cells directly adjacent to the tumor edges and away from the adipose tissue, but also cells inside the tumor close to its necrotic core. Cluster I contains cells allocated to hypoxic regions of the tumor.

The direct connection to the morphometric data allows to characterize each cluster with regard to immune infiltration. Figure 7, summarizes the total amount of cells as well as the numbers of CD45+, Ly6G+, and DcTRAIL-R1+ cells that are found within the boundaries of the respective cluster.

Data matrix tabulating the number of neutrophil subtypes found in each tissue region. For each subtype, the percentage of DcTRAIL-R1+ cells is calculated. In a neighborhood analysis for all neutrophils, the mean number of cells categorized as CD45+ cells, Ly6G+ cells and DcTRAIL-R1+ cells found in a 15 µm radius are presented. Additionally, for each microenvironment, the total number of contained cells, CD45+, Ly6G+ and DcTRAIL-R1+ is noted.

Next to TMEs, we investigated the molecular heterogeneity of neutrophils. For this, the Ly6G+ cells were analyzed using a UMAP and classified using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) (Fig. 6c). This results in a clear separation of eight clusters. To provide linguistic distinction from clusters described for the tissue microenvironments, results for neutrophils will be referred to as subtypes. Colored respectively and projected onto the cell map, these different subtypes can be found in distinct areas of the tumor (Fig. 6d).

Apparent from the comparison of the images depicted in Fig. 6, some subtypes show a clear spatial correlation with a specific microenvironment and histological features (Fig. 7, Supplementary Fig. 5a). Subtype 6 is almost exclusively located in the skin. Neutrophils are found in skin in comparably high number and have important and specific barrier functions55. Our data suggests a significantly altered lipid profile for these neutrophils. For example, in contrast to all other subtypes, subtype 6 shows a low expression of PC(O-32:0) (Supplementary Fig. 5b,c).

Neutrophils of subtypes 5 and 7 are located in specific tissue microenvironments that correlate with the adipose tissue (clusters IV and V) in the periphery of the tumor. Their lipid profiles show an increase of TG and DG lipid species (Fig. 8). Subtype 4 is predominantly found in non-adipose tissue close to the tumor (cluster VII). Similarly, subtype 2 also populates this peripheral region but is additionally found inside the tumor close to its necrotic core. Lipid profiles for both subtypes are low in DG and TG. While their overall cell density in this area is relatively high, they do not form agglomerates.

A heat map of standardized intensities of 63 ion species for the eight neutrophil subtypes visualizes differences in lipid profiles.

Interestingly, neutrophils in this periphery of the tumor show strong molecular similarities to their respective microenvironment (Supplementary Fig. 5c). This may be explained by an uptake of extracellular vesicles or cell debris produced by the surrounding tissue and “recycling” of the lipid content by the neutrophils. Notably, the expression of lipid species that require specific enzymatic machinery for their synthesis such as PC ether lipids (PC-O) do not show similarities to the surrounding tissue but are upregulated only in the respective neutrophil populations (Supplementary Fig. 5c). The exclusive co-localization of these ion species to Ly6G+-cells also precludes the involvement of measurement artefacts, such as analyte diffusion into this convergence of lipid profiles between neutrophils and their respective TME (Fig. 5).

With the exception of subtype 4, all neutrophils found in the tumor periphery and the adipose tissue show a relatively high density of immune cells in their direct vicinity (Fig. 6a). This observation is corroborated by a neighborhood analysis that counts the average number of immune cells within a distance of 15 µm to the cell edge of each individual neutrophil (Fig. 7).

Inside the tumor, neutrophils of the subtype 1 are found mostly in the viable tumor tissue (clusters II, III, and V) (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 5a). Notably, their lipid profile shows little similarity to their respective surrounding TMEs (Supplementary Fig. 5c). This may indicate a decreased up-take and turnover of lipids or a reduced residence time within the tumor tissue. While the overall density of subtype 1 neutrophils in the tumor increases towards the adjacent adipose tissue, they are mostly isolated with relatively few other immune cells around them (Fig. 7).

In contrast, neutrophils of subtypes 3 and 8 form strong agglomerations (Fig. 6e). These subtypes are located within TME I with subtype 8 being confined to the center of the region. Their neighborhood analysis results in high numbers of overall immune cells in their direct vicinity (Fig. 7). About 90% of subtype 8 neutrophils are identified as DcTRAIL+. The lipid profile of this subtype strongly differs from that of the surrounding hypoxic TME I (Supplementary Fig. 5c). It presents an increased signal for ACAR 18:0 and an increase in signal intensities for lipid metabolites, such as LPCs (Fig. 8) and DGs, while TGs are mostly absent. This may indicate an upregulation of specific lipid metabolism in this subtype.

Similar to subtype 8, neutrophils of the subtype 3 are almost exclusively found in agglomerates inside TME I but are located further away from its center. In contrast to subtype 8, however, only 17% are DcTRAIL-R1+. The lipid profile of subtype 3 also contains high signal intensities for ACAR 18:0 but reduced levels of LPC and DG. Again, in contrast to subtype 8, the lipid profile of subtype 3 neutrophils shows great similarities to its surrounding TME I. This increased molecular crosstalk may indicate a longer residence time of neutrophils within this hypoxic TME as opposed to the viable TMEs II, III, and VI.

In its own right, MSI analysis can provide specific molecular information of single cells, thereby delivering an important puzzle piece towards the understanding of individual cellular behavior. For a more holistic approach, however, the resulting lipidomic or metabolomic information has to be put into the context of the cell type, differentiation status, and state, but also has to regard its current tissue macro- and microenvironment¹. Here, a tight connection to optical microscopy analysis has long since been identified as a key feature in the integration of MALDI-MSI into the “biomedical toolbox”56,57. In this context, high-quality microscopy analysis, including IF, is typically carried out on adjacent tissue sections, introducing well-known challenges in the accuracy of co-registration. Because of their small size in the range of section thickness, this particularly limits the analysis of specifically targeted single cells33,56,58,59. For the microscopic analysis of the same section, staining-based microscopy is conventionally carried out after MALDI-MSI. While impressive progress has been reported very recently in this field, damage or distortion of the tissue introduced during the measurement and the removal of the matrix can impede accurate co-registration on the cellular level, especially for large areas of interest. In addition, cross-reactions with the matrix and laser irradiation that precedes microscopy, can impede binding properties for antibody based analysis12,60,61,62,63. Successful microscopy of the same sample prior to MALDI-MSI has largely been restricted to the limited analytical capabilities offered by unstained tissue, e.g. by autofluorescence or phase-contrast microscopy27,33,64,65. Alternatively, other non-destructive optical methods, such as IR-imaging and micro-Raman imaging, have been employed prior to MSI analysis but have not been utilized for automated cell segmentation66,67.

Exceeding these current limitations, the technique presented here includes slide scanning microscopy outside and inside the ion source of the same sample recorded prior to ultra-high resolving power t-MALDI-2-MSI without compromising performance in either modality. Of note this includes the successful implementation of pre-MALDI IF analysis.

Dedicated staining techniques allow for a robust and automated cell segmentation and retain the full spectral information in MSI. Uniquely, the high fidelity co-registration of both modalities for a large field of view facilitated by in-source FM that omits the need of “cross-modality” fiducial markers, allows for the automated generation of single-cell mass spectra from tissue in large numbers. While previous efforts that relied on manual steps in co-registration and definition of cellular ROIs21,68, this automation lays the groundwork for the reliable and large-scale, generation of information-rich highly resolved data for both modalities on the same tissue sample.

Two exploratory studies highlight the advantages of the described method for the molecular analysis with cellular and even sub-cellular resolution. Using the phagocytosis of E. coli bioparticles by macrophages as an example, we demonstrate how the technique can be used to investigate metabolic processes inside sub-cellular compartments like the phagolysosomes. Assignment of bacterial PE 33:1 and PE 34:2 confirmed the uptake of E.coli bioparticles. The additional identification of increased amounts of the respective DG species suggests their partial degradation. In addition, the tentative identification of several LPG species provides further useful leads to the metabolic breakdown of E. coli derived CL and PG by enzymatic degradation and/or oxidation of lipids inside the phagolysosome69.

Overall, this study illustrates a dedicated approach to analyzing molecular profiles of subcellular compartments. In future applications, this largely untargeted technique may be used to investigate and monitor metabolic turnover on the organelle level of specific single cells.

In our study of the 4T1 tumor model, we demonstrate spatial biology analysis on the lipid level for highly heterogeneous tissue. While previous work on single-cell MSI from tissue sections has been limited by comparatively large pixel size and by the manual annotation of small numbers of cells17,18,19,70, automated segmentation based on slide scanning (immuno-)FM resulted in the identification of more than 63 K cells and allowed for the identification and classification of common immune cells (CD45+, ~ 23.7 K cells; 38% of all cells), relatively rare neutrophils (Ly6G+, ~ 3.4 K cells; 5.4%), and very rare tumor associated T3-neutrophils (DcTRAIL-R1+, 276 cells; 0.4%) within the tissue. Importantly, the segmentation, in combination with highly accurate co-registration of the microscopy with t-MALDI-2-MSI results, allowed for the generation of single-cell mass spectra for each cell.

Using statistical analysis, cells were clustered based on their lipid profile, revealing eight distinct tissue microenvironments inside the tumor and around its periphery. Likewise, an independent clustering of just the Ly6G+ cells revealed eight subtypes of neutrophils inside the investigated tissue region. Comparison of lipid profiles between neutrophils and their direct tissue environment revealed striking similarities in some cases. These results allow for a new perspective on the uptake and recycling of lipids by specific neutrophil subtypes. They also reveal distinctive differences between neutrophils and their direct environment, such as the increased levels of ether lipid species, also described in the literature49. In addition to a general upregulation of these lipid species, we are able to identify subtype and TME-specific differences in their expression. Neighborhood analysis of all investigated immune cells in the direct vicinity of the neutrophils provides a first hint at their swarming behavior. While some of the subtypes represent relatively isolated cells, others are found in agglomeration with neutrophils and other immune cells.

The strength of the molecular investigation at the cellular level becomes especially apparent in the examination of the hypoxic regions of the tumor. This TME shows a signal intensity increase for ACAR 18:0, as well as a high density of immune cells, both described as markers for hypoxia51. The inner core of this TME is populated by densely packed T3-neutrophils (most of them of subtype 8), concurring with the literature46,47. A second group of agglomerated mostly DcTRAIL-R1- neutrophils (subtype 3) is also located inside the same hypoxic area but further away from its center. The subtyping now enables an in-depth analysis of underlying lipid profiles and integration with the state of research. While both subtypes, for example, express increased levels of ACAR 18:0, only subtype 8 (mainly DcTRAIL-R1+ cells) shows increased levels of fully saturated LPCs. These mediator are known to be important in metastasis formation and in the recruitment of phagocytes during apoptosis71,72 and our data points to a previously unknown tentative connection with T3-neutrophils.

While a full investigation of the underlying biological mechanisms is not within the focus of this publication, the presented proof-of-concept studies showcase the great potential of the technique. The seamless integration of morphometric data with (sub-)cellular lipid and possibly metabolite analysis significantly expands the informational space available for each individual cell inside the tissue. Exceeding the current state-of-the art that is largely limited to the analysis of cellular neighborhoods, our approach enables a direct in situ contextualization of single individual cells with their direct tissue microenvironment on the combined molecular and morphometric level.

The presented techniques introduces a versatile set of tools for an improved integration of single-cell MSI into existing workflows. Embedded within a full suite of spatial biology methods, in future applications, it will allow for the combination of IF-based information that may describe the regulation of specific genes and the expression of individual proteins with the expression of lipids and possibly also metabolites in the same cell and its direct surrounding73. This addition of “spatial biology of lipids and metabolites” on the single-cell level provides an important additional layer of information to complete pathway analysis from the transcript and proteome level down to the regulation of the molecular products. It can be a valuable asset to review and validate downstream effects of genetic or transcriptomic variation, as well as protein inhibition, but also help to investigate regulatory functions of small molecules on gene and protein expression. Future developments in t-MALDI-MSI will need to focus on further increasing the sensitivity and analytical depth of the method. E.g., innovative approaches to sample preparation combined with plasma-based ionization approaches, as described by Young et al. in the same issue of this journal, can help to increase sensitivity and assist in the analysis of additional classes of metabolites74.

Overall, the methods described here have great potential to help untangle the influence of endogenous and exogenous factors such as immune cell infiltration, infection, or drug delivery on cellular behavior in a specially resolved manner. They are, however, by no means limited to these applications but can be applied to decipher open biological questions in a wide range of tissues and cell types.

THP-1 ACC-16 cells (DSMZ) were cultured in T25 cell culture flasks at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 Medium (Lonza), which was supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. About 10,000 cells per chamber were sown in Millicell EZ Slide 8-well chamber slides (Sigma-Aldrich). Differentiation to M0 macrophages was induced by exposure to 20 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h followed by a 3-day rest phase in PMA-free medium. Two hours before harvest, pHrodo™ Red E. coli BioParticles (Thermo Fisher) were added to the culture medium resulting in a concentration of 95 µg/mL. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed for 5 min using 4% formaldehyde (low-methanol, Roth). F-Actin and nuclei were stained according to a protocol described by Bien et al. using 1X CellMask Green Actin Tracking Stain (Thermo Fisher) diluted in PBS for 30 min and 1 µg/mL Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in PBS for 5 min17. Cells were washed with PBS after every staining step. After staining, cells were washed using 150 mM ammonium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) and dried at room temperature for 2 h.

All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with local animal welfare guidelines approved by the responsible authorities (North Rhine-Westphalia State Agency for Nature, Environment and Consumer Protection, LANUV, Protocol No. 81-02.04.2018.A010). Female BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories) were used at the age of 8–12 weeks. Mice were housed under a 12 h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. For tumor implantation, 106 4T1 cells were resuspended in 25 µl of DMEM cell culture medium (Thermo Fisher) and then injected orthotopically into the lower left mammary fat pad of the mice. Tumors were allowed to grow for 9 days and tumor size was monitored daily with a digital caliper. The local ethics committee approved a maximum tumor diameter of 8 mm. This limit was strictly adhered to and not exceeded in all experiments conducted within this study. On day 9 after tumor implantation, the animals were sacrificed. Brain tissue was harvested from untreated mice used as the control group for the mentioned study.

Mouse brain and tumor tissue were embedded in Epredia M-1 Embedding Matrix (Thermo Fisher) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. 10 µm (cerebellum) or 8 µm (tumor) thick tissue sections were produced with a cryostat (CM 3050 S, Leica Biosystems) at −20 °C. Sections were thaw-mounted onto SuperFrost glass slides (Thermo Fisher) for H&E-staining or IntelliSlides (Bruker) for t-MALDI-2 MSI measurements. Samples for t-MALDI-2 MSI were vacuum-sealed and stored at −80 °C before further use.

Frozen tissue sections were slowly brought to room temperature in the vacuum-sealed package. After opening the seal, sections were further dried under a gentle nitrogen stream for 10 min. For unstained control tissue the section was directly transferred to the sublimation chamber. For staining, a contour was drawn around each section using a Super PAP Pen (Science Services), followed by another 10 min drying under a gentle nitrogen stream, to create a hydrophobic barrier and thus enabling pipetting aqueous solutions on and off the sample. The following washing, fixation, and staining steps were all performed by pipetting ~100 µl of the accordant solution onto the sample and removing it after the specified time. Slides with tissue sections were placed on a metal plate standing in ice water. Samples were quickly fixed in 4 % formaldehyde (low-methanol, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 5 min and subsequently washed with PBS for 30 s. After tissue fixation, the primary antibody, Ly6G (ab307167, Abcam), DcTRAIL-R1 (130-110-873, Miltenyi Biotec), CD45 (130-110-798, Miltenyi Biotec) or Anti-Calbindin (ab229915, Abcam), diluted 1:500 (v/v) in 1% BSA (Serva) in PBS was applied to the sample and incubated for 60 min. The sample was then washed three times for 30 s in PBS. In case of a dual antibody staining, the secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 594 (ab307167, Abcam), diluted 1:1000 (v/v) in 1% BSA in PBS was applied and incubated for 60 min, followed by three times 30 s washing steps in PBS. 5 µg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1X CellMask Green Actin Tracking Stain (Thermo Fisher) diluted in PBS were applied and incubated for 5 min. After staining, the slide was lifted from the metal plate and parts of the hydrophobic barrier were removed at the bottom of the slide with a pipette tip. Samples were then washed with 2 ml of ammonium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) each, by letting it flow carefully over the section. For final drying, samples were placed under a gentle N2 stream for 20 min.

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains of tissue sections were performed on untreated consecutive sections directly after sectioning. Sections were stained for 30 s with hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich) with subsequent bluing in tap water for 2 min. Afterwards, the tissue was stained for 30 s with eosin (Sigma-Aldrich) and then rinsed with water.

Fluorescence images of cell cultures and tissue sections were recorded at 50X using the DAPI, FITC, TxRed, Cy3, and Cy5 channels of a slide scanning microscope (VS200, Evident) equipped with a SpectraSplit 7 filterset (Kromnigon). For each channel individually, the exposure time was set by performing the auto exposure procedure of the microscope on a region with high signal intensity for the respective fluorophore. This procedure was conducted prior to the imaging run, and the entire slide was subsequently imaged with a constant exposure time, with a maximum exposure of 500 ms. H&E-stained tissues were recorded at 20X in BF mode. Image processing was performed with OlyVIA (Evident). Channel histograms were linearly adjusted for display. Channels are shown with linear LUTs (red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow). For further information please refer to the light microscopy reporting table (Supplementary Table 5).

A schematic of the optical set-up used for material ejection for the t-MALDI-2-MSI analysis and in-source brightfield and FM image generation is depicted in Fig. 1a-c of the main article. The sample is mounted on a three-axis piezo stage (SmarAct) and is illuminated homogeneously by 15 green LEDs (LED528EHP, Thorlabs) mounted on top of a 50X objective (M Plan Apo NUV HR 50X, Mitutoyo) with a custom-designed 3D printed LED ring. Light from the sample is collected by the objective and focused by a tube lens (TTL100-A, Thorlabs) onto the sensor of a digital camera (XCG-CG160, Sony). A simple top-view observation of the sample is in addition possible by the pre-installed camera of the prototype timsTOF fleX MALDI-2 mass spectrometer.

The beam path of the MALDI laser (smartbeam, wavelength 355 nm, pulse duration 7 ns) of the timsTOF fleX MALDI-2 mass spectrometer is re-routed and condensed through a 6:1 telescope optic and co-aligned to the microscopy path with a dichroic mirror (L-07246, Laseroptik Garbsen). For recording FM images, a filter cube (DFM2/M, Thorlabs) with a filter set (DFM2T1, Thorlabs) for the suitable fluorescence channel (MDF-BFP, DAPI; MDF-FITC, FITC; MDF-MCHC, mCherry; all Thorlabs) consisting of excitation and emission filters and a dichroic mirror is mounted in front of the tube lens. In fluorescence mode, the LED ring is turned off and fluorescence is excited by the respective fiber-coupled LED (M385FP1, DAPI; M455F3, FITC; MINTF4, mCherry; all Thorlabs) mounted with a collimating optic directly to the filter cube. The camera is integrated into the software by using the XC-SDK 2018 (Sony). The trigger signal for image acquisition of the camera and fluorescence excitation is provided as a “position reached” event by the controller of the piezo stage and is handled by a digital delay pulse generator (9200 Sapphire Series, Quantum Composers). With this pulse generator, the fluorescence excitation time was set from 10 ms to 2 s per image depending on the sample and fluorescence channel.

To achieve a reproducible and homogeneous coating of the sample slides with MALDI-matrix, a custom-designed resublimation chamber was developed. A schematic of this setup is shown in Supplementary Fig. 6a, b. Under atmospheric pressure conditions, the hot-side is preheated to 80 °C and 0.5 ml of 10 mg/ml CHCA MALDI-matrix (Sigma-Aldrich) in acetone solution is pipetted into the matrix-reservoir. With the acetone evaporating rapidly, the MALDI-matrix is left forming a uniform layer on the bottom of the matrix reservoir. The sample is then clamped onto the cold-side at room temperature and the whole device is sealed and evacuated. After reaching a final pressure of 10-2 mbar, the cold-side is first cooled to -18 °C, then the hot side is heated to 150 °C to start the sublimation and resublimation. After 60 min, the heating of the hot-side is turned off and the cold-side is heated to room temperature before venting the system to prevent condensation of ambient humidity on the sample. The sample is then put onto a room temperature metal block in a saturated atmosphere of 0.5% ethanol in water at 70 °C for 1.5 min for recrystallization. To demonstrate differences in contrast for in-source BF microscopy induced by the choice of matrix, cerebellum samples were coated with DHB and HABA MALDI-matrix (both Sigma-Aldrich) using the same settings as described above for CHCA (Supplementary Fig. 6c).

The MALDI laser and microscope camera utilize the same objective for focusing and observation in the transmission-MALDI setup employed in this work. A schematic of the setup is depicted in Fig. 1a in the main article. The focal plane of the MALDI-laser is adjusted to match that of the camera by fine adjusting the second telescope lens of the laser beam path. After aligning the focal planes, all optics are kept at a constant position. The objective (M Plan Apo NUV HR 50X, Mitutoyo) has a small focal depth of 1.4 µm and samples have to be in focus during optical microscopy and MALDI-MSI. This can be achieved by methodically adjusting the z-position of the sample with regard to the objective while recording sequential optical microscope images at z-increments of 1 µm. For each of these images a Laplacian filter is applied and the variance of the result is calculated, which serves as a measure of image sharpness. The stage is then moved to the z-position corresponding the maximum sharpness image and a fine-scan with 0.1 µm z-distance is performed in the range of +/- 1 µm in the same way as before to find the z-position of highest sharpness at a submicron precision. Since the focal planes of the optical microscope and the MALDI laser are aligned, this optical focusing ensures an optimal focus of the MALDI-laser on the sample. This autofocus routine can be executed both BF and FM mode. The Python code of this program AutoFocusClass.py is provided in Data S1 in the supplementary information.

The scale factor to convert pixel on the camera sensor to position of the stage was calculated by using a 1951 USAF Resolution Test Target (Thorlabs). For selection of a region of interest (ROI) for an optical microscope scan in the ion source, autofocusing points are placed manually on the sample. The ROI is defined as the smallest enveloping rectangle that contains all points. The stage is then moved to each of the autofocusing points and an autofocus routine as described in “Autofocus of optics” is performed, which yields the focal z-offset of that xy-coordinate. Using a radial basis function interpolation, the z-offset is calculated for every coordinate in a 10 x 10 µm mesh inside the ROI and saved to a z-interpolation file. After creating the z-interpolation, the optical microscope image of the ROI is taken. For this an up to 100 µm x 100 µm wide x/y-position mesh is created in the ROI. An optical microscope image is then taken at each mesh point at the z-offset of the closest point to the xy-position from the z-interpolation file. To create a complete image of the ROI, an empty canvas of the correspondent size is created. Using the scale factor of the setup, images are cropped from the edges to a size of 100 x 100 µm and are placed onto the empty canvas using the center coordinates from the xy-position mesh. After creating a z-interpolation file for a ROI once, multiple modalities, such as brightfield or different fluorescence channels can be recorded without creating a new interpolation. ImageJ was used to create overlay images of different modalities. The Python code of this workflow can be found in the files RecordPositions.py, ZforRecordPositions.py, Scanning.py and stitching.py in Data S1 in the supplementary information.

All experiments were carried out in positive ion mode with the exception of one measurement from a brain tissue section. The MALDI-MSI run is set up partly using the proprietary flexImaging software (Bruker). Instead of using an external scan of the sample and teaching that to the stage coordinate system, the (multimodal) image of the ROI (see “In-source microscopy workflow”) is used. In the classic flexImaging workflow, three teaching points would be manually selected on the optical image. The corresponding stage coordinates would then be recorded by driving the sample-stage manually to the respective positions. Since center coordinates and pixel positions on the ROI image are already established from recording the ROI image, three x/y-positions from the 100 x 100 µm mesh (top left, bottom left, bottom right) and their corresponding stage coordinates are automatically deployed as teaching points. With these points, the setup file for the t-MALDI-2 MSI run can be automatically created, defeating any positioning errors introduced by manually selecting teaching points in the classic workflow. When the MALDI-laser is not directed at the exact middle pixel of the in-source optical microscope, fine adjustments of a few pixels offset can be applied at this stage. The automatically created setup file for the t-MALDI-2 MSI run can be opened directly in flexImaging to create measurement regions, select settings like pixel size, and laser shots per pixel. The previously acquired z-interpolation is recognized by timsControl software during t-MALDI-2 MSI measurements by providing the interpolation mesh as a geometry file. The Python code for creating the flexImaging setup files can be found in Createmis.py Data S1 in the supplementary information. All t-MALDI-2 MSI experiments were performed with 25 laser shots per pixel and a pixel size of 1 × 1 µm2 for the cerebellum and tumor sample and 1.5 × 1.5 µm2 for cell culture samples. Signal intensity distributions are visualized using SCiLS Lab software (Bruker) using weak de-noising.

For the THP-1 cells lipid signals were identified as described by Schwenzfeier et al. using shotgun lipidomics by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry on a Q-Exactive Plus orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a dual ion funnel20,75. Lipid extracts of 72 h PMA stimulated THP-1 macrophages were produced by an adapted protocol of Folch et al. 76. Approximately 106 cells were centrifuged at 1000 g to separate them from the medium. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml CHCl3/MeOH (2:1, v/v) and lyzed for 10 min in an ultrasonic bath at room temperature followed by an incubation of 50 min at 4 °C in a cryoshaker at 500 RPM. Phase separation was induced by addition of 240 μl H2O and centrifugation at 9880 g for 10 min. The organic phase was transferred to a glass vial and the solvent was removed using a nitrogen evaporator. Lipid extracts were vacuum sealed and stored at -80 °C. For ESI-MS analysis, extracts were re-dissolved in 500 μl MeOH and measured both in positive and negative ion modes using a flow rate of 5 µl/min. A data dependent analysis workflow (DDA) was applied using tandem MS based on collision-induced dissociation (CID) with stepped normalization collision energies (NCE) of 20, 25, 30 and an exclusion time of 300 s. The mass resolving power was set to 280,000 (at m/z 200) with an AGC target of 1E6 and a maximum injection time of 250 ms. The resulting data was merged with a t-MALDI-2-MSI dataset and imported into LipostarMSI (Molecular Horizons) for annotation. The resulting feature list was hand-curated, which involved removing of isotope peaks and addition of known species from E. coli.

For mouse cerebellum and the 4T1 murine tumor section, annotations were based on accurate mass (< 3 ppm). For this, signals with S/N > 3 were extracted from the mean spectrum and annotated using the LipidMaps “Bulk Structure Search”77. In positive ion-mode sphingolipids, glycerolipids, sterol lipids and glycerophospholipids were selected as possible lipid classes either as [M + H]+- or [M-H2O + H]+-ions. The comparative analysis of untreated tissue also included [M+Na]+ and [M + K]+ ion species. In negative ion-mode only [M-H]--ions were searched for. The resulting annotation lists were manually curated to remove biologically unlikely annotation (e.g., lipids with odd side chains) or lipid classes that are usually not detected in the respective ion-mode (e.g., glycerophosphoinositols in positive ion-mode). Using this method, a total of 66 ion signals for the mouse cerebellum and 63 ion signals for the 4T1 tumor sample were annotated, respectively.

The lipid annotation of mouse cerebellum was subsequently matched with data from a full lipidomics analysis reported in the literature32. Because t-MALDI-2-MSI without the use of additional techniques like OzID or Paternò-Büchi-reactions78,79 is not able to differentiate isomers within a lipid class (e.g., PC(16:0/18:1) and PC(16:1/18:0)) or between lipid classes (e.g., PE(16:0/18:0) and PC(15:0/16:0)) the literature data was reduced to 255 unique lipid species according to the here employed level of specificity. Of the 66 annotated m/z-values, 63 were also detected by Fitzner et al. 32. The remaining unmatched values primarily corresponded to sulfoglycosphingolipids and fatty acids, lipid classes that were not analyzed in the original publication. Overall, the annotation accounted for approximately 82% of the total lipid mass identified by Fitzner et al., calculated by summing all lipids found in both datasets and using the quantitative amounts reported.

Lipid nomenclature and shorthand notation is reported according to Liebisch et al. 80.

The external and in-source fluorescence images were co-registered using SimpleITK 2.3.1 (NumFOCUS)81,82. For initialization a landmark registration was used. Based on the resulting translation matrix an affine image registration was performed using Mattes mutual information as metric and the gradient descent algorithm as optimizer83. The number of bins for the mutual information was set to 50, the parameters for the optimizer were set as follows: learning rate (1), number of iterations (50), convergence minimum value (1E-6) and convergence window (20). The sampling strategy was set to random and 1% of the pixels were sampled. The resulting transformation matrix was combined with the initial translation matrix to result in a global transformation matrix. Due to the inherent link between the t-MALDI-2-MSI measurement and the in-source fluorescence images, the global transformation matrix could be used to resample the external fluorescence images to fit the exact region of the t-MALDI-2-MSI measurement. The precision of the registration was determined by placing pairs of landmarks at distinct features, which are visible in the external fluorescence image as well as the MALDI image of the cerebellum dataset (Supplementary Fig. 1b). While the precision of the placement of each individual landmark is limited by the manual selection process and differences between modalities, overall accuracy is ensured by determining the average over a total of eleven pairs of landmarks. The target registration error (TRE) was then determined by projecting the landmarks of the MALDI image into the coordinate system of the external fluorescence image using the global transformation matrix and calculating the distance to the corresponding landmarks of the external fluorescence image (Supplementary Fig. 1c and Supplementary Note 1). Cell masks for tumor tissue were created by using DeepCell Mesmer 0.12.9 (Van Valen Lab)53 based on the DAPI channel (Hoechst 33342, nuclei) and the FITC channel (CellMask Green Actin Tracking Stain, actin). Outlines for subcellular features were determined by thresholding fluorescence signal intensity. Using FISCAS20, mass spectra were calculated for each cell or subcellular compartment by compiling MSI pixels based on their co-localized masks. MSI pixels assigned to multiple cell masks were scaled according to the hit coverage of the segmentation masks. Morphometric parameters were acquired using CellProfilers 4.2.1 (Cimini Lab)54 measurement modules.

For cell classification, immune cells were identified and divided into three groups (CD45+, LyG6+, DcTRAIL-R1+) based on thresholding the mean intensities of the corresponding antibody stains in their respective fluorescence channels (Cy5, TxRed, Cy7). Ly6G+ cells showed high intensities on the TxRed and Cy5 channel, while DcTRAIL-R1+ cells showed high intensities on all three channels. The clustering of the tumor microenvironment (TME) was done using k-means clustering on the standardized MS data of all Ly6G- cells. The number of clusters was determined by visual inspection of the clustering results for values of k between 6 and 10. The Ly6G+ cells were also clustered using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) with an epsilon of 0.7 and a minimum number of seven neighbors, based on a uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) of their standardized mass spectra. The clusters are visualized both directly on the cell masks as well as in a UMAP of the standardized mass spectra using default parameters. Ly6G+ cells were assigned to a specific tumor region, by identifying the most frequent TME label of all neighbors within 40 µm.

The presented work describes method development and can be considered proof-of-concept. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. For cerebellum and tumor tissues, multiple technical replicates with varying staining and sample preparation conditions were performed, and representative datasets were selected for display. For both tissue types, two additional MSI experiments with optimized sample preparation but varying fluorescence stains yielded comparable results. For the tumor sample, the full staining panel was applied once. For cell experiments, two independent replicates with consistent outcomes were performed, and representative data are shown. No data were excluded from the analyses. The experiments were not randomized, and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

The research presented here complies with all ethical regulations and was approved by the local ethics committee of the University of Münster and the North Rhine-Westphalia State Agency for Nature, Environment and Consumer Protection, LANUV, where applicable.

The closure of the US government has shuttered the Smithsonian Institution's museums and zoo and some of its research facilities. Credit: Anna Moneymaker/Getty

The shutdown of the US government, about to enter its third week, is starting to take a toll on US science. Since the shutdown began, the administration of US President Donald Trump has cancelled funding for clean-energy research projects and laid off public-health workers. The activities of some federally funded museums and laboratories have been suspended, along with the processing of grant applications by agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Funding to run the US government expired on 1 October after members of the US Congress failed to pass a spending bill. Negotiations to end the impasse have made little progress. Lawmakers from the opposition Democratic party say that they will only pass the spending bill if it extends popular health-care subsidies, a condition that Republicans do not want to negotiate. “The longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be,” Vice President JD Vance said Sunday.

The Trump administration said in a court filing Friday that it will lay off 4,100- 4,200 federal employees, an action officially termed a reduction in force (RIF). The Trump administration invoked the absence of a spending bill as justification for the layoffs, which are an unprecedented measure during a shutdown. Unions representing federal workers have filed suit over the layoffs.

Starting Friday night, some 1,300 staff members of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) received RIF notices, although the notices for 700 were quickly rescinded, according to Local 2883 of the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing CDC employees. The layoffs would “undermine the nation's ability to respond to public health emergencies,” a CDC staff member affected by the layoff said Tuesday at a news conference organized by Local 2883.

Word of layoffs at the CDC's influential National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) sparked particular concern among epidemiologists. The programme has been collecting US health data since the early 1960s, and has helped researchers to understand critical public-health issues such as the health effects of lead in petrol.

Former CDC staff member Asher Rosinger, an epidemiologist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, says CDC staffers told him that the layoffs have decimated the NHANES planning branch, a team he says is critical to the operation of the programme. “This gold standard survey may no longer be able to operate in the future,” he says.

Some CDC employees have now been laid off twice in the span of half a year, says mathematical statistician Isaac Michael. At the CDC, Michael and his colleagues ran a survey and database that track the experience of new mothers in the United States — until the entire team was laid off in April. Several court orders have preserved their employment status for now, though they are still not allowed to work even when the government reopens. But some of his colleagues received a second layoff notice within the last few days, making it unlikely they will ever be reinstated.

If a state experiences a future uptick in maternal or infant deaths, “we won't even know there's a problem, because we're not collecting any reliable data, and we won't be able to do anything to help”, Michael says.

Andrew Nixon, communications director at the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the CDC, said that all HHS employees receiving reduction-in-force notices were designated as non-essential by their respective divisions, and that the department will continue to close “wasteful and duplicative entities”.

The administration's court filing said that the US Environmental Protection Agency would lose 20-30 people. Staff members at US Department of Energy (DoE) offices overseeing renewable energy, energy efficiency and other areas have also received RIF notcies, a DoE spokesperson said. “These offices are being realigned to reflect the Trump administration's commitment to advancing affordable, reliable, and secure energy for the American people,” the spokesperson said.

Coinciding with the shutdown, the administration has also announced a fresh round of cuts to research projects, adding to billions of dollars in federal research grants revoked since Trump took office in January.

On the second day of the shutdown, the DoE announced that it was cutting almost US$7.6 billion in funding from 223 energy projects, many of them supporting renewable energy. An analysis by Nature found that the list includes grants to 33 academic institutions, which have a combined value of $620 million.

Seattle University President Eduardo Peñalver — credited with “a legacy of growth and innovation” — is leaving to become president of Georgetown University, the two Catholic Jesuit institutions announced Wednesday.

Peñalver, who has led Seattle U. since 2021, will step down March 31, 2026, and start in his new role at Georgetown in Washington, D.C., on July 1.

During his tenure, Seattle U. launched a “Technology Ethics Initiative,” designed to “convene and inspire productive discussions about the role of transformative technologies for a just society.” The initiative is led by political science professor Onur Bakiner, whose current research examines AI governance models.

Last year, the university welcomed Father Paolo Benanti, an advisor to Pope Francis on artificial intelligence and technology ethics, as a distinguished visiting professor. Peñalver moderated a conversation between Benanti and Microsoft President Brad Smith for employees on the company's campus in Redmond, Wash.

Like many institutions, Seattle U. has experienced increased enrollment demand in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines. It has also partnered with local tech corporations, including Amazon and Microsoft, which helped fund the $100 million Center for Science and Innovation.

At Seattle U., Peñalver helped launch new academic programs and integrated Cornish College of the Arts into the Seattle U. community.

“This was not an easy decision,” Peñalver said in a message to the university community, “but one I make with gratitude for all that we have accomplished together and confidence in the university's continued momentum. While I am excited about the opportunity to continue my work in Jesuit higher education at such a pivotal moment, I am also sad to be leaving Seattle University and the Pacific Northwest, which will always be my home.”

Peñalver was raised in Puyallup, Wash., and attended Henry Foss High School in Tacoma before he went on to graduate magna cum laude from Cornell University in 1994.

He studied philosophy and theology at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar and earned his bachelor's degree from Cornell University and law degree from Yale Law School. He also clerked for former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, and prior to Seattle U., was dean of Cornell Law School.

“President Peñalver is an exceptional leader steeped in the Catholic and Jesuit tradition who brings a wealth of experience in higher education, a global mindset, a commitment to social justice and academic excellence, and a bold vision for Georgetown's future,” said Thomas Reynolds, chair of Georgetown's board of directors, in a news release.

Peñalver will succeed Interim President Robert Groves, who has led Georgetown for the past year after former President John DeGioia stepped down from his role in 2024 to recover from a stroke.

Seattle-area used goods marketplace OfferUp is conducting another round of layoffs as it seeks to simplify its business and get back to focusing on the local user-to-user experience.

In a memo to staff on Wednesday (in full below), CEO Todd Dunlap outlined planned changes that included downplaying shipping as an offering; modernizing the OfferUp app; increasing marketing spend; and consolidating local business offerings.

“As we implement a simpler structure with fewer offerings, we need fewer people to operate,” Dunlap wrote. “And if we're going to maintain profitability while investing more in growth, we need to free up cash flow.”

The company did not disclose the number of employees affected or the number of remaining staff. OfferUp has 435 employees, according to LinkedIn.

The layoffs come less than a year after OfferUp cut 22% of its staff last December, in a move where Dunlap cited macroeconomic trends such as programmatic ad rates that affected some of the company's revenue lines.

Founded in 2011, OfferUp competes against Craigslist, eBay, Facebook and other marketplaces where users buy and sell goods. The company says it facilitates 30 million transactions on its platform annually and is currently ranked No. 24 on the GeekWire 200, our index of Pacific Northwest startups. It generates revenue in part by charging sellers for premium features and broader reach.

Dunlap, a former exec at Xbox and Booking.com, took over for OfferUp from founder and former CEO Nick Huzar in 2021. Huzar now leads EV charging startup Juicer Energy and is co-founder of Gone.com, a logistics-driven marketplace reimagining the secondhand goods economy.

Read Dunlap's complete memo to OfferUp staff:

Team,

Today we made changes no leader wants to make. Earlier this morning, I let some of our colleagues know their roles have been eliminated. For everyone who is still with OfferUp, I want to explain why we did this, how we supported those leaving, and what comes next for us.

Why we made this decision

We are resetting the company to be more focused on reaching and serving the local communities that rely on OfferUp and that helped make OfferUp what it is today.  The work in the last year has provided us with critical signal for a few important principles:

— Our strength is in local;

— We can reach local users and drive engagement with compelling marketing in a new mix of channels;

— Local businesses can be an important part of our platform, but we must be thoughtful about the balance between business offerings and the core user-to-user interactions. 

As a reaction to this signal, we're taking several steps to embrace these principles:

— We are deprecating our shipping offering in order to provide a more focused and specific local experience;

— We are exploring ways to modernize the app experience to meet today's expectations; 

— We are bolstering the capabilities of our marketing team, and we intend to significantly increase our marketing spend to take advantage of the opportunity to reach users in new ways;

— We are consolidating our local business offerings into one group to provide a cohesive strategy that enables auto dealers, storefronts, service providers, employers, and landlords to thrive and provide value to our local users. 

These principles led to the decision to reduce our headcount for two reasons: (1) as we implement a simpler structure with fewer offerings, we need fewer people to operate, and (2) if we're going to maintain profitability while investing more in growth, we need to free up cash flow.  

Our new structure also necessitates a new way of working. At heart, we are a startup—albeit an older, wiser one. In the weeks ahead, we will lean into a leaner operating model built on clear priorities, close collaboration, and shared decision-making principles. I'm energized by what this shift can unlock for us, and I hope you will be, too.

What you can expect next

— Tomorrow's all-team: I will walk through the plan, changes to my leadership team, and how we'll measure progress

— Team-specific follow-ups: Leaders will convene their teams to clarify focus and ownership, and we'll follow up with transparent roadmaps that line up across the org

— Support for teams: We'll work together to define clear goals, make faster decisions, and cut inefficient processes so you can get time back for building

Our departing colleagues

I want to convey our deep gratitude to our departing teammates. They have made many meaningful contributions to our product, our business, and our community, and we have tried to honor those contributions with support through this transition:

— Severance – We are providing severance in an amount equivalent to 10 weeks, plus additional amounts for tenure over 5 years. 

— Healthcare – We will cover the full cost of COBRA coverage through the end of the year. 

— Outplacement Services – Our departing colleagues will have access to career services through a company that provides career transition and job placement services.

— Laptops – Our colleagues will keep their OfferUp-issued computers at no cost. 

For most of those impacted, today is their last day at OfferUp. We have asked a few teammates to stay on to help teams transition over the next few months. Please join me in extending thanks and support to all of these colleagues in the days ahead.

I know this is a difficult day and the work ahead will be hard, but it's the right work. OfferUp belongs in the world. I believe in that, and I believe in this team. A world of local opportunity awaits.

Looking forward to spending time together tomorrow—

Todd

A U.S. Border Patrol video featuring antisemitic lyrics went viral on X on Tuesday after far-right users discovered it had been posted to Facebook and Instagram. The video, which included the lyrics “Jew me” and “kike me,” was deleted from the platforms on Wednesday morning, though it's not clear whether the offensive content was taken down by Border Patrol or Meta.

The 13-second video appears to have been posted to Instagram in August, but was pinned in the Reels section of the official Border Patrol page, making it more visible to a wider audience. The video only gained widespread attention late Tuesday on X, where far-right extremists celebrated a signal that was clearly intended for them. The Instagram video had 3.4 million views when Gizmodo viewed it Tuesday night.

The audio used in the clip comes from Michael Jackson's controversial 1995 song “They Don't Care About Us.” The song includes the lyrics “Jew me, sue me, everybody do me/ Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me.”

The lyrics were criticized at the time for being antisemitic, though Jackson defended his words, insisting he didn't intend for them to be offensive. The singer, who died in 2009, issued an apology and later released an edited version of the song.

The video starts with footage of someone adjusting a bodycam before viewers see Border Patrol agents walking around with guns. Another shot shows a truck hauling Border Patrol dune buggies, and then a shot in the desert where a dune buggy kicks up dust behind it.

Gizmodo saved a copy of the Border Patrol video before it was taken down from Instagram and Facebook.

The video is very short, making it clear that the choice of lyrics was the intentional focus. Viewers are obviously meant to hear the antisemitic aspects, since it's more or less the only audio in the 13 seconds being presented. DHS didn't respond to questions from Gizmodo on Wednesday morning.

Comments on Instagram included people who clearly understood the message of the video as antisemitic. One commenter replied, “based song choice,” which was liked by the Border Patrol account. Another commenter wrote, “if you know you know.”

Comments from the far-right on X were even more explicit, including “This deserves 6 million likes and shares,” a reference to the number of Jews who died in the Holocaust.

Other commenters on X marveled at how mainstream their far-right and antisemitic ideas were becoming, with one person writing, “This movie is taking a strange turn. It's strange to me because I never thought I'd see this in the mainstream—it was always underground.”

And while it's accurate to describe the shift as “strange,” it was entirely predictable after President Donald Trump was inaugurated for a second time in January. Billionaire Elon Musk really kicked off the tone of the era with two Nazi-style salutes. Musk later denied he was making Nazi gestures, but many of his supporters clearly took it as a sign that they could drop the mask. Steve Bannon, a former top advisor to Trump, made the same salute not long after.

Trump himself has also said some extremely antisemitic things, including when he used the term “shylock” at a rally in July.

“No death tax, no estate tax, no going to the banks and borrowing from, in some cases, a fine banker. And in some cases, shylocks and bad people.”

In fact, there's an entire Wikipedia page devoted to collecting examples of Trump's antisemitism.

U.S. Border Patrol is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which has been posting far-right extremist content since Trump took office for a second time. In a tweet on Tuesday, DHS posted just one word, “Remigrate,” a term more popular in Europe among the far-right that refers to ethnic cleansing through deporting non-white people.

DHS also posted a video that included the words “Save America” in a typeface that's clearly meant to evoke Nazi-era imagery.

The dog whistles from DHS are blaring foghorns at this point

DHS has frequently posted fascist propaganda using copyrighted material without permission, something that sometimes gets the content removed from the major social media platforms.

The people of DHS often know they're the bad guys, like when they responded to questions from John Oliver's HBO show by talking about the “heroism” of Darth Vader. The late-night host was asking about a video posted by Gregory Bovino—the new face of anti-immigrant operations in the U.S., with his frequent appearances on TV—where Vader is destroying rebel forces labeled with things like “gang member,” and “fake news.”

Is a lot of this trolling? Sure, that's one defense of it. But at some point, you own the words and images that you push into the world. And if you spend all day, every day saying racist and antisemitic things, people have to start taking you at your word.

Not to mention the fact that DHS has real power in the world to upend lives and has no business joking or “trolling” the American people. Agencies under DHS, like ICE, are currently harassing and arresting people for looking Latino. And that often includes American citizens.

Ironically, DHS said back in April that social media would be screened for “antisemitism” by any foreign nationals in the country. In reality, DHS was looking for anyone who opposed the war in Gaza, falsely equating such a position with antisemitism. The U.S. State Department announced Tuesday it had canceled the visas of six people who had written negative things about Charlie Kirk.

Antisemitism runs deep in the modern Republican Party. Politico published leaked texts from the Young Republicans on Tuesday, which included messages like “I love Hitler.” Vice President JD Vance defended the texts and dismissed criticism as “pearl-clutching.” And guys like Vance know their audience. They can be dismissed as shitposters, but they're some of the most vile racists on the planet, and they're becoming normalized in ways that would've been unthinkable even a decade ago.

Americans who are opposed to Trump plan to stage nationwide protests on Saturday, Oct. 18, for what's being dubbed another No Kings rally. Republicans have tried to characterize the upcoming protests as hate marches, falsely insisting they would be full of “Hamas supporters.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Wednesday that the reason the government hasn't opened yet is because of the upcoming demonstrations, a claim that makes no sense whatsoever.

“This crazy No Kings rally this weekend, which is gonna be the farthest left, the hardest core, the most unhinged in the Democratic Party, which is a big title. No Kings equals no paychecks,” said Bessent.

The No Kings rally, which is likely to include a wide variety of Americans who are opposed to Trump's fascist takeover of the country, has a website that allows people to find their nearest demonstration. It won't just be the “hardest core,” as Bessent puts it, if past protests are any guide.

While employees spend much of their day communicating and coordinating amongst themselves on projects, this effort is often undermined by the availability of specific individuals. When a colleague with vital information is away — whether on vacation or in a different time zone — the rest of the team must delay progress until that person responds.

Ashutosh Garg and Varun Kacholia, the co-founders of Eightfold — an AI recruiting startup last valued at $2.1 billion — believe that advances in LLMs and data privacy technologies can help solve some aspects of this costly problem. Earlier this year, they launched Viven, a digital twins startup with a mission to grant employees access to crucial information from teammates even when those colleagues are unavailable.

On Wednesday, Viven emerged out of stealth mode with $35 million in seed funding from Khosla Ventures, Foundation Capital, FPV Ventures, and others.

Viven develops a specialized LLM for each employee, effectively creating a digital twin by accessing their internal electronic documents such as email, Slack, and Google Docs. Other employees in the organization can then query that person's digital twin to get immediate answers related to common projects and shared knowledge.

“When each and every person has a digital twin, you can just talk to their twin as if you're talking to that person and get the response,” Ashutosh Garg told TechCrunch.

One major hurdle is that people just can't share everything with anyone who asks. Employees often handle sensitive  information or have personal files they want to keep private from the rest of the team.

According to Garg, Viven's technology solves that complex problem through a concept known as pairwise context and privacy. This enables the startup's LLMs to precisely determine what information can be shared and with whom across the organization.

Viven's LLMs are smart enough to recognize personal context and know what information needs to stay private — like questions related to an employee's personal life. But perhaps the most important safeguard is that everyone can see the query history of their digital twin, which acts as a deterrent against people asking inappropriate questions.

“It's a very hard problem to solve, and until recently, it was unsolvable,” Ashu Garg, a general partner at Foundation Capital told TechCrunch.

Viven is already in use by several enterprise clients, including Genpact and Eightfold. (Co-founders Ashutosh Garg and Varun Kacholia continue to lead Eightfold, splitting their time between that company and running Viven.)

As for competition, Ashutosh Garg claims that no other company is tackling digital twins for the enterprise yet.

He wasn't sure that there were no competitors when he first started thinking about the idea. So he called Vinod Khosla to ask about it. The legendary investor assured Ashutosh Garg that nobody is doing this and agreed to invest.

Ashu Garg of Foundation Capital was equally excited about Viven.

“When Ashutosh came to me and described the product, the big aha for me was: there's this horizontal problem across all jobs of coordination and communication, which no one is automating,” Ashu Garg told TechCrunch.

But just because there are no direct competitors now, it doesn't mean that other companies won't build digital twins for companies in the future. Ashu Garg said that Anthropic, Google's Gemina, Microsoft Copilot, and OpenAI's enterprise search products have a personalization component. But, if they do enter this market, Viven hopes its “pairwise” context technology will be its moat.

Seattle startup Electric Era today unveiled a sleek, interactive EV charging device that uses artificial intelligence to converse with drivers as they're juicing up their vehicles. 

The company builds electric vehicle charging systems that are typically deployed at convenience stores and other businesses. The modern-looking new unit — dubbed RetailEdge — can provide information on a vehicle's charging status, suggest how much power is required to reach the next destination, give information on loyalty points earned at a partnering business, and even tell jokes.

“This is a next generation charging dispenser that does more than just charge cars. It can talk to drivers, it can answer their questions. It can provide them an intelligent and immersive interface while they stop to charge and shop,” said CEO and co-founder Quincy Lee. 

RetailEdge incorporates in-house-designed hardware and software, including bilingual AI technology that can integrate with business partners' existing systems. The chargers also include payment interfaces. While some competitors cut costs by using off-the-shelf components, Lee said his startup achieves efficiency by developing custom solutions.

“We are a uniquely capable team of designing very low cost products that have heightened product capabilities,” he said. 

Electric Era launched in 2019 and distinguished itself by pairing its DC fast-charging systems with giant batteries to help deliver and store power needed by recharging EVs. The company has served 72,000 drivers in the past year and has 130 charging stalls deployed in roughly a dozen states. Lee said he expects those numbers to at least double by the end of next year.

The company has 40 employees and has raised $20.5 million in equity funding plus $8.9 million in debt financing.

Today's announcement comes as EV charging infrastructure continues expanding despite policy headwinds. Republican leaders recently canceled tax credits for EV purchases, but charging stations are proliferating.

Bloomberg reported that the number of public charging stations in the U.S. increased by 19% in the first nine months of this year, with 780 high-speed stations added in the third quarter alone.

“The charging map is also being filled in by restaurants and retail stores, which increasingly see [charging] cords as a way to attract customers,” Bloomberg reported — which is the sector targeted by Electric Era.

The startup will keep selling its original charging units alongside RetailEdge. Lee described his products as “cost competitive” but didn't share specifics.

Electric Era has so far avoided the charging cable thefts that plague many installations, as thieves sever the cables for the copper and other metals they contain. Lee suspects the company's units are going into locations with more activity and employee oversight, but he recognizes the vulnerability.

The issue is particularly acute in the Seattle area, where Electric Era will be installing 32 ports over roughly the next eight months. The region has been hard hit by thieves targeting not only charging sites but also utility and telecommunications infrastructure.

Lee said his team is “constantly lobbying” state leaders to pass laws that protect this sort of essential infrastructure.

Cybersecurity firm F5 Networks says government-backed hackers had “long-term, persistent access” to its network, which allowed them to steal the company's source code and customer information.

In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, F5 said it now “believes its containment actions have been successful,” after first discovering the hackers in its network on August 9.

The Seattle, Washington-based company, which specializes in providing application security and cybersecurity defenses for large companies and governments, said the hackers had access to its BIG-IP product development environment and its knowledge management systems, which included source code and publicly undisclosed security vulnerabilities.

F5 said it wasn't aware of any modifications to its software while in development, nor was it aware of any exploitation of the vulnerabilities. The company published several updates on Wednesday for its BIG-IP platform to fix the undisclosed security flaws and urged customers to patch them.

The company also said the hackers downloaded configurations and implementation information about some of its customers' systems, files that could help hackers find and exploit potential design weaknesses, and potentially hack into those customers' systems.

F5 said in the notice that the U.S. Department of Justice allowed the company to delay its public disclosure. An F5 spokesperson would not say for what reason the delay was allowed, but the DOJ can allow companies to hold off on notifying the public if there is a “substantial risk to national security or public safety.”

F5 has over 1,000 corporate customers and serves more than 85% of the Fortune 500, the largest public companies by revenue, including banks, tech companies, and critical infrastructure companies.

The U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre warned on Wednesday, following F5's disclosure, that hackers could “enable a threat actor to exploit F5 devices and software.”

CISA said in an email on Wednesday that it has ordered civilian federal agencies under an emergency directive to patch their systems by October 22, citing the security risks.

The company did not attribute the attacks to a particular government or nation-state-affiliated hacking group, and F5 spokesperson Dan Sorensen declined to answer TechCrunch's questions beyond the company's published statement, including how many customers are affected and if it was known how the hackers broke in to begin with. 

F5 is the latest tech company in recent years to have been hacked by government hackers, including Microsoft — by China, and Russia, at least twice; cloud and enterprise technology firm Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and several other companies as part of the broader Russian cyberattack on the software maker SolarWinds.

Cybersecurity and networking company F5 disclosed that a “highly sophisticated” nation-state threat actor infiltrated its internal systems this summer, stealing portions of the company's BIG-IP source code and details about software vulnerabilities.

The Seattle-based company disclosed the incident Wednesday in an SEC filing and a customer memo, saying the attacker maintained “long-term, persistent access” to some of its product development and engineering systems before the breach was contained.

F5 said it learned of the intrusion on Aug. 9, and that the U.S. Department of Justice authorized a delay in public disclosure. The company said it believes its containment efforts have been successful and that it has seen no new unauthorized activity.

F5 shares were down more than 3% in early trading Wednesday.

Some of the breached files contained configuration details for a small percentage of customers, the company said, and those customers are being notified directly.

F5 said it has no evidence that the attackers accessed CRM or financial data, or tampered with its software supply chain. Independent reviews by NCC Group and IOActive confirmed that the company's build and release systems were not modified.

The company also said the attackers did not reach its other major product lines, including NGINX, F5 Distributed Cloud Services, or Silverline.

F5 released software updates for several products, including BIG-IP, F5OS, and BIG-IP Next, urging customers to patch immediately. F5 is providing a threat-hunting guide and new tools to help users harden systems and monitor for suspicious activity.

F5 is one of Seattle's largest public tech companies, with a market capitalization around $19 billion and thousands of enterprise customers worldwide, including 80% of the Fortune Global 500. Its hardware and software sit in the middle of much of the world's internet traffic, providing load-balancing, application delivery, and security services for major corporations and government agencies.

While F5 products themselves have been targeted in the past — including a vulnerability in 2020 and the “Velvet Ant” malware campaign uncovered in 2024 — this appears to be the first publicly disclosed breach of F5's internal systems.

Separately, F5 announced Wednesday that Michael Montoya resigned from the company's board and became its chief technology operations officer. Montoya was most recently COO at New York-based cybersecurity company BlueVoyant. 

F5 reported revenue growth of 12% to $780 million in its most recently fiscal earnings, with GAAP net income of $190 million, up from $144 million in the year-ago period.

Apple on Wednesday announced its new M5 chip along with the new iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and Vision Pro, all powered by the new chip.

These devices are now available for preorder, with shipping and in-store availability expected on October 22.

The M5 chip will allow the new devices to run faster than their predecessors. Apple says the chip has over four times the peak GPU compute performance compared to the M4. Johny Srouji, Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Technologies, added in a statement that it “ushers in the next big leap in AI performance for Apple silicon.” 

For the new iPad Pro, Apple touts that the chip brings “up to 3.5x the AI performance” of last year's Pro and up to 5.6x faster than the iPad Pro with M1.

Other upgrades include Apple's C1X cellular modem with up to 50% faster cellular data performance and the N1 chip for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Thread connectivity. Additionally, the new iPad Pro has faster storage read and write speeds and faster charging of up to 50% in around 30 minutes.

Adding more power to the iPad Pro seems like a logical step for Apple to take, as the tech giant is pushing it to feel more like a laptop. With iPadOS 26, the tablet is getting more intuitive window displays, the Preview app, and the ability to create folders for better organization. 

The pricing starts at $999 for the 11-inch model and $1,299 for the 13-inch, with color options in black and silver.

The new 14-inch MacBook Pro is expected to be even faster than its predecessor, featuring upgraded graphics performance (up to 1.6 times better), a higher memory bandwidth of 153Gbps (increased from M4's 120Gbps), and improved storage speeds.

It also boasts a battery life of up to 24 hours.

The price starts at $1,599, and it is available in space black and silver.

Vision Pro is also set to receive the M5 chip, replacing the current M2.

The M5 chip enhances display rendering by 10%, supports refresh rates up to 120Hz (up from 100Hz), and accelerates AI-powered features, making them 50% faster. Additionally, battery life improves by 30 minutes, providing up to 2.5 hours of general use and three hours of video playback.

The upgraded Vision Pro also comes with a Dual Knit Band to give users a more comfortable fit. It's available in small, medium, and large. The price remains at $3,499.

The announcement of the new Vision Pro follows reports that Apple is shifting its focus toward developing smart glasses instead of overhauling its VR headset.

Without much fanfare, Apple has unveiled three new flagship products today via a press release—no special event, no prerecorded show. That might be because the new iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and Vision Pro don't change the mold—they're identical to their predecessors—but internally, they're debuting Apple's highly anticipated M5 chip.

All of the devices are available for preorder today and go on sale October 22. Here's everything you need to know.

The M5 processor is the heart of the announcements today, as it powers all the new Apple hardware. It's built on the 3-nanometer process, with a 10-core GPU and a neural accelerator in each core, which Apple claims improves performance in GPU-based AI workloads and provides four times the peak GPU compute performance over the M4 chip.

Graphics performance in general is 30 percent higher than the M4, and the 10-core CPU offers 15 percent faster multithreaded performance. (Apple claims this is the “world's fastest CPU core.”) The 16-core Neural Engine has also been enhanced, which should mean Apple Intelligence and other AI tasks (like transforming a 2D photo to a spatial scene) should be faster. Apple says there's a 30 percent increase in unified memory bandwidth, allowing larger AI models to run on the device, but it also helps deliver better performance for the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine.

It has been roughly a year and a half since the debut of the M4-powered iPad Pro, but the new M5 iPad Pro tablets don't change much outside of the processor. You still have two sizes to choose from: 11 or 13 inches. Both of them feature fast charging—you can get 50 percent in 30 minutes when using a compatible charger—though annoyingly, Apple only includes a 20-watt USB-C power adapter in the box.

Both feature Apple's N1 networking chip that debuted in the iPhone 17, which includes Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread. Also in tow is the C1X 5G modem from the iPhone Air for 50 percent faster cellular performance and 30 percent less power usage than the M4 iPad Pro. Over its predecessor, you'll see a 3.5X boost in AI performance, 1.5X faster 3D rendering with ray tracing, up to 1.2X faster video transcode performance in Final Cut Pro, and 2.3X faster AI video upscaling performance in DaVinci Resolve. The 256- and 512-GB models use 12 GB of unified memory now, twice as much as before, and the faster memory bandwidth means everything gets a speed boost.

Many of the other specs are the same. They're just as thin as before, feature Apple's Tandem OLED display technology, and can hit 1,600 nits at peak brightness. You still get the nano-textured glass upgrade if you want to reduce glare on the screen. Speaking of the screen, Apple says there's a new capability for these iPads to drive external displays at up to 120 Hz; if you already have a 120-Hz screen, a new Adaptive Sync feature will ensure the lowest possible latency between iPad and monitor.

As before, the 11-inch iPad Pro costs $999, and the 13-inch iPad Pro starts at $1,299. They're compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro, Apple Pencil USB-C, Magic Keyboard, and Smart Folio.

Interestingly, Apple did not completely revamp its MacBook Pro lineup with the M5 chip. Instead, there's just one new model: a 14-inch MacBook Pro with four storage options (512 GB, 1 TB, 2 TB, or 4 TB) and three unified memory options (16, 24, or 32 GB). The base version starts at $1,599, like before, but if you max out all of the upgrades, it can cost as much as $3,369. We'll likely see M5 Pro and M5 Max chip options in 2026 alongside a 16-inch MacBook Pro.

You'll see similar speed increases like on the iPad Pro M5—3.5X faster AI performance, 1.6X faster graphics over the prior M4-powered MacBook Pro, and 2X faster SSD performance. Otherwise, this is the same 14-inch MacBook as before, with the claimed “24-hour” battery life, mini-LED display with the nano-texture glass option, a six-speaker system, and a 12-MP webcam. There are three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI, an SDXC slot, a headphone jack, and the MagSafe charging port.

Widely regarded as a miss with consumers, Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset is back but with no major changes to the hardware. Well, there's a new head strap: the Dual Knit Band. It's included in the box, and Apple says it's soft and cushioned, allowing for a comfier fit. The headset is now powered by the M5 chip, which enables faster performance, sharper details throughout visionOS 26, and better battery life. Specifically, Apple says the M5 renders 10 percent more pixels on the micro-OLED displays than before, and the refresh rate can also jump up to 120 Hz.

Battery life is now two and a half hours of general use, as opposed to just two hours on the original Vision Pro. That extends to three hours with video playback.

Unfortunately, the price remains firm at $3,499. It's arriving right before Samsung is expected to unveil its Android XR mixed-reality headset, Project Moohan, which will hopefully come with a lower price tag.

MINTernet is the latest in the growing field of home 5G internet services


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Several cell providers have hopped on the 5G home internet service bandwagon, with T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon offering service in select areas across the United States. Now, a new player is entering the fray: Mint Mobile. Mint Mobile is a subsidiary of T-Mobile, which is a known quantity in this segment, and its new service is called MINTernet.

Unsurprisingly, MINTernet operates on T-Mobile's nationwide wireless network, offering unlimited 5G service. Now, whenever unlimited data is mentioned in the 5G realm, you should always look at the fine print. In this case, Mint Mobile says that once you consume over 1TB of data within your billing cycle, "network speeds vary and may be reduced." This is similar to the T-Mobile Home Internet policy, where the restriction is implemented after exceeding the 1.2TB threshold.

Regarding the speeds you can expect, the "Broadband Facts" label for MINTernet indicates that typical download speeds will range from 133 to 415 Mbps, while uploads should reach a maximum of around 55 Mbps. As for latency, expect to see 16 to 28 ms in most situations.

MINTernet costs $40 per month if you opt for the introductory 3-month offer, and this price is contingent upon paying the entire cost upfront ($120). However, if you already have a Mint phone plan (or intend to add one at the time of signup), your monthly cost drops to $30 ($90 upfront).

A 6-month plan is also offered at $45/month ($270 upfront) or $35/month ($210 upfront) with a phone plan. Finally, there's a 12-month plan that drops back down to $40/month ($480 upfront) or $30/month ($360) with a qualifying phone plan. All customers will get a free 5G gateway (modem/Wi-Fi router) with their order, along with a 14-day money-back guarantee.

Considering that MINTernet runs on T-Mobile's 5G network, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that my first run-in with its 5G home internet service ended in disaster in 2022. However, I revisited the service in 2024 with much better results, averaging over 600 Mbps for downloads and over 50 Mbps for uploads. T-Mobile Home Internet costs $50/month with autopay, so if you tick the right boxes, MINTernet will save you up to $20/month.

There's no better time to check the social media accounts of your favorite sports team than when that team is winning and you want to bask in the shared experience with other fans.

The vibes are especially good right now for the Seattle Mariners, who less than a week ago dispatched the Detroit Tigers in an earth-shaking 15-inning thriller, and this week jumped to a 2-0 series lead against the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League Championship Series. 

Game 3 is at T-Mobile Park Wednesday, and a team behind the scenes will be ready to react to the next big play on the field or fan moment in the stands in hopes of transferring the energy in the ballpark across the city and region and as far as the internet will take it.

“This home stretch of the season and then into the postseason has been a really fun time for us,” said Tim Walsh, senior director of digital marketing and social media for the Mariners. “It's cool because we have a lot more eyeballs on our content now, and it allows us to really showcase what we've been doing this whole season, and even more so over the last few years.”

Walsh joined the Mariners in 2020 after managing social media for more than four years with the New York Mets. A Long Island, N.Y., native, he said it's become evident during his five years that Seattle is a baseball and sports city. And he thinks the Mariners' unique collection of players and personalities, combined with an energized fan base, make his job especially enjoyable.

Walsh works with teams across the Mariners organization, managing social accounts for everything from the Mariner Moose to T-Mobile Park to the farm system. Content creators, videographers, graphic designers and others all funnel their work to the social team for use on channels including Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and more, in search of a coveted young demographic.

“Instagram in particular for us this year has been awesome,” Walsh said, adding that the Mariners passed 1 million followers this season. “I feel like the team playing well, combined with a really good strategy and a really good group of people producing the content leads to tremendous success from a social standpoint, in terms of engagement growth and the numbers that we measure ourselves by.”

The goal is to provide a mix of content to reach many different types of fans and to serve a variety of purposes for the organization. As the only team to never reach a World Series, there's a lot of emotion around what the Mariners are trying to accomplish, and the social feeds capitalize on that to engage fans. The hype video below is a good example.

Walsh also enjoys pushing a casual “group chat mentality” that can be a relatable tone to strike, leaning heavily on memes, pop culture references and trending content. Here's a strange and simple example that drew 26,000 likes and elicited this comment: “Mariners social media manager is my hero.”

The late season and playoffs have been filled with a number of viral fan moments, spotlighted by the social team and other media organizations. There was the fan who caught Cal Raleigh's historic 60th home run ball and unselfishly handed it to a little kid, or the fan in Detroit wearing a “Dump 61 Here” shirt when he caught another Raleigh smash and got himself a meeting with Raleigh and a trip to Seattle.

“One of the things we try and do is weave our fans into all of the content that we're sharing, because they are so important. They create an incredible home field advantage, unlike anything else in baseball,” Walsh said.

Taking fans behind the scenes is also important. The Mariners have experimented with GoPro cameras in the announcer's booth to catch personalities such as Rick Rizzs calling the action. But a video last Friday night (below), captured from the perspective of pitcher Luis Castillo exiting the dugout to join his team's celebration on the field, drew national applause.

Walsh credits the players for letting the social team get close to the stories that matter to fans, like when a “hidden camera” captured Julio Rodriguez getting called up to the big leagues or when rookie Cole Young got his news and made an emotional call to his family.

“Some things are going to do better than others, but I think we're not afraid to fail,” Walsh said. “I think that's really important in the social space — trying new things and not being afraid to do things that might not click or resonate in the way that you were hoping for.”

As much as the social team prides itself on reacting to key plays or viral moments of each individual game, Walsh is equally proud of the preparation his team puts in to be able to move quickly. Captions, scripts, graphics and videos that are prepared in advance enable the team to be ready for the unpredictable. 

“We don't want to get too far ahead or jinx, but we have to prep, to be ready for what's next and to tell those stories in a fun, unique way,” Walsh said. “So that when a crazy moment happens in a game, or fans start wearing shoes on their head, we're able to jump on it.”

No word on M5 Pro or Max, yet.

After teasing a new product launch on X earlier today, Apple has just announced the 2025 refresh to its 14-inch MacBook Pro lineup, now equipped with the shiny new M5 chip. The press release, accompanied by a separate M5 announcement, was just published on the company's website, unpacking the new laptop in great detail. It's largely an iterative update, with the new chip nicely slotting in for yesteryear's M4 in an otherwise largely unchanged package.

There are no design tweaks or exciting features to speak of. The chassis, including the 14-inch Mini LED display, is identical to previous models — just like all the other core features such as ports, speakers, keyboard, trackpad, and even the 12 MP webcam. The battery is once again quoted to last 24 hours in video playback, and you still only get Wi-Fi 6E. However, the SSD is 2x faster compared to last gen, and you can now spec it up to 4 TB, twice as much as previous gen.

 




It's clear that Apple is entirely focused on what's inside, the latest generation of its homegrown M-series silicon — M5. This swap is what likely enables the memory bandwidth to be upgraded from 120 GB/s on the M4 to now "over 150 GB/s" on the M5.

The SoC package includes a 10-core CPU, a 10-core GPU with "a Neural Accelerator in each core," and a 16-core NPU for on-device AI. The M5 chip is built on TSMC's N3P node and has a faster GPU that can deliver 1.6x more FPS in games, 20% faster multi-core CPU performance, and 1.7x quicker render times in Blender — all versus the M4. Apple even says it's 86x more powerful than Intel-based Macs in AI applications.

The price for the new 14-inch MacBook Pro remains the same as last year, with the base model starting at $1,599, offering you a 512 GB SSD and 16 GB of RAM. Keep in mind that, just like M4, the base M5 isn't available on the 16-inch models as they start out with a Pro chip (so, presumably M5 Pro). The device is available to pre-order right away, with general availability beginning next week on October 22. Alongside the MacBook Pro, Apple also refreshed the Vision Pro and the iPad Pro with the new M5 chip.

 




The tablet gets Apple's in-house C1X modem and N1 networking chip that brings Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6 support, offering faster connectivity across the board with 30% less power usage compared to the M4 iPad Pro. On the other hand, the mixed reality headset now has a new Dual Knit headband, also available for purchase separately for $99. Therefore, M5's improvements in performance, battery life, and AI-powered workflows are present on the Vision Pro and iPad Pro as well.

Accompanying that is the fresh software for each of these devices, including the MacBook Pro, with the latest OS versions adding newer features and, of course, the Liquid Glass visual overhaul. Prices remain the same as last gen for both the iPad and Vision Pro as well.

Apple's Vision Pro is getting its first big upgrade since its release, and just like all the products Apple announced today, everything centers on the M5 chip. According to Apple, the introduction of the M5 brings quite a few benefits to the Vision Pro experience, including “10% more pixels on the custom micro-OLED displays,” which should equate to a sharper, better-defined viewing experience. A new 10-core GPU architecture will also enable ray tracing and very likely make gaming feel even more immersive, particularly when it comes to rendering light and shadow.

On top of that, the M5 will bump the Vision Pro's refresh rate to 120Hz, helping to reduce ghosting and make watching pretty much any experience involving lots of motion look even smoother. If you're worried about AI performance, the M5 will also perform better on that front. Apple says native AI experiences like Personas and spatial video run 50% faster, which may not be the most important metrics in the world, but they will be a boon to those who don't like waiting around for things to load. As you might expect from Apple silicon, the M5 sounds like a step up generation-to-generation, but it's not just about performance; the chip is also bringing much-needed battery improvements.

Apple says the M5 Vision Pro is rated for 2.5 hours of general use and three hours of video playback. That last one is especially important considering that the Vision Pro is still positioned as the best headset for long-form content thanks to its premium display. Speaking of wearing the Vision Pro for hours at a time, Apple is also introducing a new Dual Knit Band that has both upper and lower straps. That might not sound like the most mind-blowing upgrade, but having used the previous Vision Pro myself, I predict that extra support will go a long way, especially since the headset weighs between 600 and 650 grams. The band will also be sold separately for $99.

One thing you won't be getting in this generation is a discount. With the M5 and upgraded head strap, the price this generation will remain the same—which is to say, $3,500. That's a heck of a lot of money for a headset, but if you're in the market for a very expensive toy and have the cash to spare, this Vision Pro is shaping up to be the best, most performant one you can buy.

You can preorder the M5 Apple Vision Pro starting today, and the headset hits shelves on Oct. 22.

Apple's 3nm M5 is here


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Cupertino just launched its 5th-generation Apple silicon, the M5 chip, with the company saying that it has embedded a neural accelerator in each GPU core, allowing it to run AI workloads much faster. Aside from that, Apple says that the base M5 chip now has a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU, giving the newer processor two extra cores in both the graphics and general compute departments compared to the previous generation's entry-level SoC.

“M5 ushers in the next big leap in AI performance for Apple silicon. With the introduction of Neural Accelerators in the GPU, M5 delivers a huge boost to AI workloads,” Apple Senior Vice President of Hardware Technologies Johny Srouji said. “Combined with a big increase in graphics performance, the world's fastest CPU core, a faster Neural Engine, and even higher unified memory bandwidth, M5 brings far more performance and capabilities to MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Apple Vision Pro.”

Although it still uses 3nm technology from TSMC, the N3P process node used on the M5 (versus N3E on the M4) delivers improved capability through slightly higher transistor density. The company says that it has four times the peak GPU performance when it comes to AI processing over the M4, and that it offers up to 45% better graphics quality, plus third-generation ray tracing capability. There's also a 30% bump in memory bandwidth, with the speed going from 120GB/sec to 153GB/sec in the M5, and, of course, a 15% improvement in multithreaded performance.

Apple's press release mostly focuses on the chip's better performance in artificial intelligence workloads, but we're also hopeful that these numbers will translate to a better gaming experience on the Mac. Unfortunately, we don't know how the chip will perform compared to its competitors from AMD and Nvidia in the 14-inch MacBook Pro, as we haven't seen benchmarks yet. However, a leaked Geekbench result of an M5-powered iPad Pro showed the base M5 matching the M4 Max and beating every other competitor in the single-core test.

Those who want to be on the latest, cutting-edge Apple hardware can now pre-order the Apple M5 chip inside the MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Apple Vision Pro. The company expects these devices to ship on the 22nd, with in-store availability arriving on the same day.

Those who are already on Apple M3 or newer should wait for third-party benchmarks to appear, just so they know if the M5 is worth upgrading to or if they should wait a couple more years. We also don't have the Pro and Max versions of the M5 (or the M4 Ultra) just yet, but the company typically waits a few months before releasing them to the public.

Apple's top-end iPad models will be first in line to showcase Apple's more powerful silicon, just as the iPad Pro with M4 did last generation. The new M5 iPad Pro is thin—even slimmer than the latest iPad Air—and it packs the same tandem OLED display and 11- and 13-inch flavors. It may essentially be a spec bump over last year's Pro model, but if you were planning on running endless tiled windows with iPadOS 26, that still makes it your best bet.

The new M5 chip is the highlight. It promises faster AI performance than its M4 predecessor thanks to new neural engines built into each of the 10 GPU cores. That could lead to 3.5 times better performance when using apps that leverage AI. The new iPad Pro also includes what appears to be the same 10-core CPU—with four performance and six efficiency cores—as the new MacBook Pro 14 with M5. This means an enhanced ray-tracing engine is coming to Apple's tablets, and that the new iPad Pro could be slightly better than the M4 silicon at 3D rendering.

Beyond the chip bump, the new iPads now support options for Apple's own optional C1X cellular modem and N1 wireless chip that debuted in the iPhone 17. Apple also promoted similar memory write and read speeds to the M5 MacBook Pro 14. Memory bandwidth has jumped to 150GB per second, which should make multitasking slightly faster on the new version than it was on the 2024 iPad Pro. Otherwise, the 11- and 13-inch models both support WiFi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread connectivity.

Why do you need a more powerful Apple tablet? Well, beyond the creative apps that require more horsepower, Apple promoted that the latest updates to iPadOS would enable users to have multiple apps on their screens at once. You'll still find your workspace constrained—even if you opt for the larger screen—but if you were planning on using your tablet for multitasking with several intensive programs running in the background, you may be better off with the more expensive iPad.

The 11-inch model of the new M5 iPad Pro starts at $1,000; you'll need to shell out $1,300 for the 13-inch version. Each comes with 256GB of storage at base, and if you jump for the 2TB options, prepare to spend $2,000 or more. That's without opting for 5G connectivity, the $130 Apple Pencil Pro, and the $300 Magic Keyboard. All options start shipping Oct. 22

If only there were some way to release the source code for your userland programs so that the computing public could look at the code, then offer a fix for a bug such as this.Unfortunately, so far as I'm aware, there is no way to do this and having a few people who are working against what has to be a large number of deadlines look at extremely low-level code for very sophisticated software is the only way forward for these things.

ASML has enough. For now.

The chief financial officer of ASML has told Bloomberg that the lithography giant is well prepared for China's export controls regime on rare earth elements and technologies for their mining and refining. The company has long lead times for its advanced tools, so it has plenty of raw materials in stock to support short-term demand from its clients. What happens after the company's reserves deplete is something unclear, though.

"We have long lead times, and therefore, also in our supply chain, we make sure that we have the materials in that we that we need for the next couple of months," said Roger Dassen, CFO of ASML, in a conversation with Bloomberg.

Under the new export control rules China imposed last week, companies have to get an export license to ship such rare earth materials as holmium, thulium, or ytterbium, or products based on these materials, from China's Ministry of Commerce. Furthermore, China imposed its export controls beyond its own borders on products containing rare earth materials originating from China if their value content within that product is more than 0.1% starting December 1, 2025.

This decision of the Chinese government could essentially stop all the supplies of all rare earth materials and products containing them across the world, something that could harm ASML, which uses a number of them inside its DUV and EUV lithography systems, metrology tools, and inspection tools.

However, Dassen downplayed the possibility of halting production after December 1, saying that the company's supply planning and long production cycles give it enough flexibility to absorb temporary disruptions. Meanwhile, the company now has over a month to buy rare earth materials or components containing them before the new export controls regime is enacted.

Speaking of China, ASML re-emphasized that it expects demand from its customers in the People's Republic to drop in 2026 due to the revocation of fast-track VEU license exemptions for Micron, Samsung, SK hynix, and TSMC, as well as softening demand from local chipmakers.

"When we look at China, we believe that the demand of our Chinese customers is going to be significantly lower in 2026 than it has been in 2024 and 2025 when we had very strong business there," said Christophe Fouquet, chief executive of ASML, during the company's earnings call with investors and analysts.

Prepaid phone plans are for more than just setting up a burner phone. Instead of getting locked into a contract and indefinitely paying for a phone you may never actually own, prepaid phone plans promise lower prices while delivering the same coverage and speed as the major networks like AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. What's not to love?

Although prepaid phones sometimes get a bad rap, they make a lot of sense for some customers, particularly if you're partial to buying unlocked phones and owning them outright. By cutting out contracts that stipulate several lines, financing on phones like the iPhone 17 that can climb well over $1,000, and extras you may not need, like mobile hot spot coverage, prepaid phone services end up much cheaper than major carriers without big performance losses. Still, they aren't made equally. Most prepaid phone providers tap into an existing cellular network, but they have different limitations on how much access you have to that network. Here's everything you need to know.

Check out our other mobile guides, including the Best iPhones, Best Android Phones, Best Cheap Phones, Best Samsung Phones, Best Motorola Phones, and Best Google Pixel Phones.

Prepaid phone plans used to be easy to sort out, but after decades of mergers and acquisitions, the lines have gotten a little messy. The best place to start is the difference between mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) and mobile network operators (MNOs). MNOs own and operate a mobile network, and they include T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon. MVNOs use an existing network. For example, Cricket Wireless uses AT&T's network, while Google Fi relies on T-Mobile.

The lines between MNOs and MVNOs have blurred in recent years. Previously independent MVNOs like TracFone have been gobbled up by larger carriers (in this case, Verizon). Other brands used to operate mobile networks but now serve as MVNOs. A good example of that is MetroPCS, which merged with T-Mobile in 2012 and eventually became Metro by T-Mobile in 2018.

With how intertwined MVNOs and MNOs are these days, it's hard to separate them based purely on infrastructure. The more important distinction is whether your phone plan is prepaid or postpaid: With a prepaid plan, you pay for your data and time up front. With a postpaid plan, you're billed for the data you've used after you've already used it.

Beyond when you pay, there are a few other aspects that separate MVNOs from traditional MNOs:

Those are the broad differences, but you'll find smaller distinctions within MVNOs themselves. For instance, Tello Mobile is what you'd call a “full MVNO,” managing everything from marketing to billing and customer service. Boost by T-Mobile is a lighter MVNO, where aspects of service like support are more closely tied to a major carrier (in this case, T-Mobile).

It'd be great if prepaid MVNOs were cheaper than major carriers without any downsides, but that's not the case. For MVNOs, the devil's in the details. MVNOs are treated somewhat as second-class citizens on the network, at least when push comes to shove. That means you might experience slower or even throttled speeds in some cases.

MVNOs aren't forthcoming about these limitations, but you can find them spelled out in policy documentation. Let's look at Mint Mobile's network management policy as an example.

The first hurdle is deprioritization. “Other brands may be prioritized higher on the T-Mobile network,” reads Mint's network management policy. “For all Service plans, T-Mobile may also reduce speeds during times of network congestion.” These policies aren't clear about how severe the slowdown is, but generally, if a network has a lot of congestion, MVNOs will see slower speeds before those on major carriers.

In most parts of the country, this isn't a problem. However, you'll likely experience slower speeds in major cities and at large events. If you're at a concert and everyone is trying to post Instagram stories and TikToks, you'll probably notice a significant slowdown.

Another downside with most MVNOs is throttling. You'll be able to purchase an “unlimited” data plan, but there are usually soft caps to the amount of data you can use before speeds slow. Again using Mint as an example, it classifies “heavy data users” as those who use more than 35 GB of data in a month, and it says these users will “have their data usage prioritized below the data usage (including tethering) of other customers at times and at locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources, which may result in slower data speeds.”

Those are the two big drawbacks, but some smaller limitations pop up depending on the provider you look at. Mint, for instance, uses “video optimization,” which basically means video streams are capped at standard definition when using mobile data (480p). This happens automatically on the network, even if you're trying to stream a higher resolution.

I'm using Mint as a touchstone here, but these practices are common among most MVNOs. Cricket has similar data restrictions and video limitations as does Optimum Mobile. Major carriers that have direct prepaid plans, like T-Mobile, generally have higher data limits before reducing speeds.

Outside of those limitations, some MVNOs don't offer additional cellular features like roaming or a mobile hot spot. Those limitations aren't universal, but they're some good things to look out for when you're looking at providers and plans.

The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) determined decades ago that phone providers don't own phone numbers. Broadly, you're allowed to keep your number when transferring to a new carrier, regardless of whether that's a prepaid or postpaid carrier. In fact, since 2009, the FCC requires carriers to transfer—or, more properly, “port”—your number within one business day.

Under the FCC's rules, a carrier can't deny porting your number, even if you refuse to pay a porting fee. However, porting fees are allowed. Some carriers, such as T-Mobile, don't have any fees for porting your number. Others charge anywhere from a few dollars to $20.

There are situations where you can't port your number—for instance, if you're moving to a different region. Most MVNOs allow you to check if you can bring your own number over. Visible by Verizon, for example, features a portability checker on its website, along with a detailed guide on transferring your number.

Is T-Mobile an MVNO?

T-Mobile is a mobile network operator, or MNO, so it wouldn't fall under the category of an MVNO. However, T-Mobile owns several MVNOs, including Metro by T-Mobile and Mint Mobile.

Do Prepaid Phone Plans Need a Credit Check?

You generally don't need a credit check with prepaid phone plans. Virtual carriers like Metro by T-Mobile use prepaid service instead of postpaid service. You pay for your calls, texts, and data up front, while traditional carriers use a postpaid model where you're billed at the end of your billing cycle.

Although prepaid phone services don't need a credit check for the service itself, you may need a credit check if you want to finance or lease a phone. Many prepaid phone services allow you to bring your own device if you're unable to finance or lease a new phone.

Can I Bring My Own Phone to an MVNO?

Nearly all MVNOs allow you to bring your own phone. That's one of the big advantages of using an MVNO over a major carrier, in fact. You'll need an unlocked phone, however.

T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T all allow you to unlock devices that are locked to their networks, with some stipulations. For instance, Verizon keeps your device locked for 60 days from the purchase date. Regardless of the particular policy, you'll need to own the device outright before you can unlock it.

There are a ton of MVNOs, and I don't use “a ton” lightly. There are dozens and dozens of prepaid providers, absolutely, but also smaller, niche MVNOs. For instance, Secure Phone is an MVNO largely focused on selling its own GPS-tracking phone and app; the cellular service isn't the main draw. There are also plenty of MVNOs that aren't really around anymore. GoSmart Mobile, for example, still allows you to sign up for a plan on its website, but it doesn't offer anything beyond 3G speeds. I've excluded those providers.

Here's a list of MVNOs mainly focused on providing prepaid cellular service, separated by network. Most MVNOs only use a single network, but some tap into multiple networks. You'll see those names listed multiple times. I haven't included providers that use other networks for roaming. Boost Mobile, for example, uses its own network, but it taps into the T-Mobile and Verizon networks when roaming.

MVNOs on the AT&T Network

There's nothing wrong with a prepaid phone, especially today. Although prepaid plans sprang up as an alternative for customers who couldn't pass the credit checks to lease or finance a phone, that's not the case today. There are budget phones that carriers will (almost literally) give away for free, and most carriers own a handful of prepaid services for customers who don't want a contract.

You should be careful when browsing MVNOs, though. It takes little more than some startup money, a graphic designer, and a bit of promotion to spin up an MVNO—just look at Trump Mobile. MVNOs are all using existing infrastructure, so performance actually isn't as important as it seems. It's more important to pay attention to the limitations of service and customer service. That's what MVNOs provide.

Everything is an Xbox now, right? If that's the case, why can't we mod our smart fridge or smart toaster with screens to transform them into the rough approximation of an Xbox gaming machine? The hard truth is that there is no unified sense of “Xbox” anymore. That's epitomized by the $1,000 Asus ROG Xbox Ally X handheld. It's the first piece of real gaming hardware with an Xbox name to roll out in five years. Despite the moniker, it's far more of a PC than it is any flavor of Xbox console. And thanks to Microsoft's efforts to fix Windows for a small screen, it's one of the best handheld PCs yet.

The ROG Xbox Ally X can certainly compete with Valve's Steam Deck, and it can do so without worrying about kernel anti-cheat compatibility. The one point it can't compete on is price. At $1,000, the ROG Xbox Ally X will seem like an overindulgent splurge that won't net you the ease or comforts of a true-blue console. And though it has better graphics potential than Valve's handheld, maximizing its capabilities requires coaxing.

If this is what we can expect from “Xbox” going forward, then console gamers had better get used to their new PC playground—whether that means adjusting power and graphics settings or dealing with Windows' penchant for bugs and missing settings. But it also means a cleaner, more gamer-focused experience than any other handheld Windows device released over the past several years can match.

Asus ROG Xbox Ally X

It's the first step on a long road to reinventing the Xbox brand. In the meantime, it's one of the best handheld PCs you can get, despite one glaring bug.

Pros

Cons

The real innovation of the Xbox Ally is the new “full screen experience,” or FSE. The built-in software finally alleviates the excruciating experience of forcing Windows 11 desktop to run on a 7-inch screen. Now, a hit of that newfangled Xbox button pulls up most (but not all) of the features and apps you need. Even better, you can access games across the most popular game launchers with a few quick taps. Plus, the device promises better performance on this version of Windows. In our tests, that proved true compared to devices with similar specs.

The new UI is imperfect, and the software is far from complete. You'll still find game launchers or incongruous settings that require you to muddy your screen with your grubby fingerprints. There are options missing—some are still stuck behind Windows settings—and I've experienced concerning issues with the device depleting standby power, as if leaking juice like sand through an hourglass. Since this handheld has the entire weight of Microsoft's gaming arm behind it, I hope updates come swiftly and that the FSE makes its way to more handhelds than just the one bearing Microsoft's Xbox logo.

Still, this isn't the Nintendo Switch 2 of the Xbox brand. The Xbox Ally is the kind of device to make me imagine what a true merging of PC and Xbox could be. It could prove an expensive disaster—or a glorious (but still expensive) shift to the entire gaming landscape.

Xbox told me that Microsoft and Asus started working together shortly after the launch of the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X to craft the new handheld. What, can't you tell? It's the two prongs on both sides of the device that the two partners in crime claim was modeled directly on the Xbox wireless controller. When you hold the controller and Xbox Ally up together, you'll see the similarity isn't 1-to-1—not that it matters. Each prong holds a rumble motor that feels far more present than those of other unibody handhelds do.

Despite all that, I wouldn't go as far as to say it's more ergonomic than flat body designs. I can curl my digits around a Steam Deck and play comfortably just as well as I can with the ROG Xbox Ally X.

This is still a PC. With that in mind, you have access to two USB-C ports (one being USB-4 compatible, for hooking up external devices like an eGPU) on top alongside a microSD slot and a headphone jack. There's no port on the bottom to enable a Switch-like dock. In fact, all your regular Steam Deck docks you bought for other handhelds may not work as well with the two grips sticking out from the body. My Steam Deck Dock from Gulikit does not fit the Xbox Ally, even though it's perfectly usable with past handhelds.

While I didn't find the grips supremely comfortable, there's another extra benefit to the controller-like design. My wrists never fell asleep as I lost circulation while playing while lying down, like they often do when I'm using my personal Steam Deck or Switch 2. I like to play my handhelds in bed, so the extra grips proved to be a plus despite making the handheld even thicker.

It weighs in at 1.58 pounds, which is barely any more heft than the original $800 ROG Ally X and lighter than other handheld PCs like the Legion Go lineup.

The triggers and bumper buttons also have a feel akin to the Xbox controller and its “Impulse” triggers with individual vibration motors. The sides of the device are sloped more than they are on the ROG Ally X, meaning I don't need to perform any crab claw gestures to access the LB and RB buttons. But if you were expecting the device to feel exactly like an Xbox controller, you'll end up disappointed. The A,B,X,Y layout is the same, but the look and feel of both the buttons and joysticks are far more ROG Ally than Xbox.

In the end, all that matters is if it feels good to play. I can comfortably say: It does.

Beyond the twin menu buttons, the only switch you need to care about for menu navigation is the new Xbox button found next to Asus' own Armoury Crate toggle. Hitting the button once brings up the Game Bar menu, delivering quick access to your game library across all launchers. Hitting the library button will take you to the Xbox app, where you can access Game Pass (you get a three-month Xbox Game Pass Premium subscription with the device; just don't forget to cancel) and Xbox Cloud gaming. It's here you'll also find your library of both games and supported apps, which mostly include game launchers.

Xbox gamers who have never had to even consider their consoles' power draw will now need to start thinking about TDP, or thermal design power. Despite originally telling me it was working on a replacement for power management, Microsoft left Asus' Armoury Crate software in this handheld. You can access the program from the Game Bar to tweak the power draw you're sending to the processor. More TDP means better performance at the cost of battery life. As a rule of thumb, you can stick to lower performance modes for two-dimensional or less intensive games. For everything else, shift it to “Turbo,” which ends up at 25W on battery power, or the max 35W if you have the device plugged in.

How does it fare compared to Valve's SteamOS, the Linux-based operating system made popular by the Steam Deck? Like SteamOS, the Windows FSE is a controller-first layout designed to make accessing the Xbox game store and your game library easier than it is on a desktop. Firms like Asus, Lenovo, and MSI have designed front ends to enable some easy access to your titles, but the FSE has come closest to a “console-like” feel.

When you hold down the Xbox button, you can easily swap between open apps. Want to access Steam's Big Picture Mode? It's a few taps away, with no need to muddy the touchscreen with your fingerprints. It's here you'll also see an option to open up desktop mode if there are platforms you can't access through the Xbox app.

Asus originally described the FSE to me as the system dual booting Windows. However, the improved performance is available in either variation.

As if you needed another reminder, this is a PC, not an Xbox console. A 2023 update redesigned the Xbox app so it could be navigated with a controller. There's still more work to be done on this front. You can't use the right stick to scroll. There isn't enough use of the RB and LB buttons for navigating through side-by-side menus. Beyond those hangups, what's particularly egregious is just how limited Microsoft made its first-party software. On the Linux-based SteamOS, I can drop into the desktop mode, install Emulation Station, and access it from the Steam Deck's home menu. The Xbox app will recognize apps like GOG Galaxy, Epic Games Store, Battle.net, and Ubisoft Connect, but it won't enable other apps you may load on. Accessing them requires entering the Desktop Mode. SteamOS can be tweaked to allow third-party apps to appear on the home screen, but Microsoft, being Microsoft, won't let you do the same with the FSE.

What's often lost in the rat race for better performance is the fact that small improvements mean a lot on a power-sipping device like a handheld: A 5 fps difference can determine whether a game is playable or not.

AMD's Ryzen Z2 Extreme offers only a marginal bump in performance compared with the Ryzen Z1 Extreme that hit the scene two years ago. However, the updates Microsoft made to Windows 11 also supposedly limit background tasks and boost performance. From what I experienced comparing the Lenovo Legion Go 2 to the ROG Xbox Ally X, that seems to check out. Asus' device displayed small performance gains (the delta varied by title, of course) at the same resolution and TDP.

There are areas in which Lenovo's handheld wins, of course. The Legion Go 2 contains 32GB of RAM; the Ally sports just 24 alongside its 1TB of SSD storage. The Legion also sports a massive 8.8-inch OLED display. After spending more than a week with the Xbox Ally's 7-inch IPS LCD, I miss those deeper black levels and contrast.

But for that specific upgrade, you have to drop the price equivalent of a new Nintendo Switch—$350 after recent price hikes. Lenovo's Legion Go 2 held the price record among AMD Ryzen Z-series devices with the astronomical $1,350 launch price of its AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme model. The same APU—or accelerated processing unit—can be found in the much more affordable ROG Xbox Ally.

At 1080p resolution and 35W when plugged in, I could get around 52 frames per second in Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam Deck settings. In actual gameplay, you'll see frame rates at just under 50 fps in most scenarios. At 30W, last year's ROG Ally hits around 46 fps. Other games, like Shadow of the Tomb Raider, see better uplift, with the new Xbox Ally X netting around 10 fps more than its predecessor.

Synthetic benchmarks may help us get a better idea of how much the device has improved. The Xbox Ally X netted around 400 points more than its predecessor did on 3DMark Steel Nomad Light and did 600 points better on 3DMark Time Spy. In actual gameplay, the difference is more minute, especially at the highest wattage. On some tests, notably 3DMark and games like Baldur's Gate III, the device didn't perform exceptionally better than the MSI Claw 8 AI+ running an Intel Core Ultra 258V. On others, the Ryzen Z2 Extreme underperformed Intel's mobile chip.

But the Z2 Extreme's secret weapon is that it performs better at lower wattages than previous generations did. When testing multiple games at 15-25W, relying often on AMD's FSR upscaling, I could finally achieve playable frame rates on titles like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Star Wars Outlaws. (Even on the “Turbo” profile, the device defaults to 25W when running on battery.) I found that I could run multiple current AAA games, and a few unreleased Xbox titles, at playable frame rates with just a bit of finagling in the graphics settings.

And here's another secret: You don't even need the FSE to get this boost. Xbox claimed the latest Windows build (which includes the FSE) would separately enhance the Ally's performance, and that has more than panned out. I updated the Lenovo Legion Go 2 to the latest Windows Insider Update without bothering to install the updated user interface. It displayed bigger performance improvements than the Ally had (perhaps influenced by the Legion's additional memory, which is the most significant difference between the two systems). The update moved the needle by 5 fps or more in games like Cyberpunk 2077 and up to 3 fps in Shadow of the Tomb Raider.

There's a voice in the back of my brain that's hard to ignore. It tells me to shake my fist at Microsoft in a “man yells at cloud” fashion over how simple this fix seems to have been. Are you telling me we could have had this level of gaming performance on Windows this whole time?

There's a “just fine” quality to the ROG Xbox Ally's 1080p display. It's a semi-glossy IPS LCD that lacks the “inky” qualities of OLED. I eventually tired of the large bezels surrounding the display, and the size makes it difficult to read text in RPGs like Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader and other RPGs. The screen is plenty bright indoors and in ambient light, but it's still not enough to survive direct sunlight. It didn't help that I was moving between the Asus model and the Legion Go 2 in quick succession; for some, the larger screen will probably be worth the extra heft. Still, the Ally's panel is serviceable in the same way that Apple's MacBook displays get the job done, even if it's the same damn screen every damn year and there's a big notch.

The 120Hz refresh rate, now a constant throughout three Ally generations, is more than enough for 3D titles. However, when you opt to play a game like Hollow Knight: Silksong or Hades II, and your game can easily net over 160 fps on the lowest power settings, you may start to feel a little cheated after paying $1,000 for a handheld like this.

Sound quality through the dual speakers was nothing to write home about either. Audio got plenty loud, but unlike when using the Legion Go 2, I wanted to reach for a pair of gaming headphones or earbuds more often. It wasn't terrible, and neither were the visuals, but the whole affair did feel a bit lackluster for a third-generation device in the Ally's price category.

Handhelds don't have great battery life. The Xbox Ally X, with its 80Wh battery, can claim more playable time than most other handhelds. The Lenovo Legion Go 2 and MSI Claw 8 AI+, with their larger screens and higher resolution, will sap energy faster. The Switch 2 has notoriously poor battery life, and you'll be lucky to get two hours out of that. Still, don't count on the Ally to get you through long-haul flights. I eked out around three and half playable hours of Hades II at low power before the device was begging for the sweet embrace of a power cable. More intense titles could cut another hour off that span.

The Xbox Ally X has other problems when trying to go to sleep. There were times I tried to put it to bed by hitting the power button, only to receive a gray screen and be prompted to restart my game.

There were also multiple instances in which I thought I'd successfully put my review unit to sleep via the power button, only to later find it had been sucking power for hours and eventually died. The fans would occasionally kick in while asleep, which indicates to me there's an issue Microsoft needs to fix before I can safely store the device away after a quick gaming session.

It's clear Microsoft was working on this software until the last minute, and that means there's still work needed to clear up these glitches. The issues were enough to diminish what would otherwise have been a glowing review.

High-end handhelds now cost more than $1,000. Sorry, but that's what we should expect from now until Sony releases a handheld PlayStation 6. The base ROG Xbox Ally, available in in white, features a lower-end Ryzen Z2A chip that I have not yet had the opportunity to fully test. That system is positioned to compete with the $550 Steam Deck OLED and Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS. Inevitably, because of tariffs and trade retaliations from China, we shouldn't expect many budget handheld releases aside from Nintendo's more restrictive hybrid console.

There's a part of me that believes prospective handheld buyers should hold off for the next generation. Today's Z2 Extreme devices are running on an RDNA 3.5 GPU. Tomorrow's may instead include a chip based on AMD's RDNA 4 architecture, which would mean access to AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution 4. That would offer improved AI upscaling, making games appear to run at higher resolutions than they actually are. The technology may be a staple of future consoles, and Microsoft and Sony will likely push developers to use it. The Xbox Ally X will be left out of the loop.

On the other hand, Microsoft seems keen to improve the FSE in preparation for a next-gen Xbox console. Hopefully, that means Xbox has enough incentive to fix what's broken and polish the experience to a squeaky-clean shine. Is that enough to make me abandon the Steam Deck? Maybe one day. Is it enough to give Xbox gamers the new hardware they're looking for? It'll depend on their tolerance for the PC gaming lifestyle.

A handheld Xbox has been rumored since at least the Xbox 360 era, where gaming forums were rife with speculation that Microsoft was about to face off against Nintendo's DS and Sony's PSP. If there was ever anything to the rumor, nothing came of it—until now, 20-odd years later, with Xbox's first genuine foray into portable gaming.

The Redmond giant isn't diving in solo, though—rather than its own dedicated device, Microsoft has partnered with Asus to deliver two distinct units, the entry-grade ROG Xbox Ally at $600, and the more powerful ROG Xbox Ally X at a somewhat staggering $1,000. These aren't so much Xbox handhelds as Xbox-branded handhelds, though, adding recognizable iconography onto what might otherwise be the next generation of Asus' own portables. The team-up delivers top-tier portable play—but a frequently confusing experience.

It's best to start with what the X-ROGs—not official terminology, but good shorthand for the pair—aren't. They're not Microsoft's answer to the Nintendo Switch 2, a bespoke console letting you seamlessly enjoy home-quality gaming on the go. Nor are they a take on the Steam Deck, a portable built around the Xbox ecosystem rather than your Steam library. Despite sporting the same signature “X” icon button as on an Xbox controller, these are handheld gaming PCs in Xbox drag, with all the good and bad that entails.

Both X-ROGs run a full version of Windows 11, with the Xbox app for PC's new “full screen experience” as the default user interface. Because these are PCs at heart, though, even if you're using the same Xbox account as on your Xbox Series X or Series S, your game library on the X-ROGs will only show titles included in the Xbox Play Anywhere program. Since you can only figure out what's not available by their absence, you may find a game you fancied playing on the go isn't an option. Along with the difference in how the library is sorted and filtered, it's not the smoothest transition for console players.

The overall UI also feels more cluttered than a handheld should, with a home screen that shows your recently played games above a bunch of “Featured” offers, a row of titles recently added to Game Pass, and more. It's a far cry from the stark, minimalist elegance of the Switch 2, highlighting how much is left to be desired in optimizing the Xbox for the handheld form.

Unfortunately, Microsoft is also crow-barring AI features in, with a new Gaming Copilot assistant (also coming to the desktop PC Xbox app). It's pitched as “your personal gaming sidekick,” recognizing what's happening onscreen and responding to voice inquiries for help on parts you're stuck on. It speaks in one of four “personalities,” including a cringey “heroic”—it's detestable, but thankfully optional, so I quickly deactivated.

Running Windows under the Xbox hood also means frustrations when it comes to software updates—is it just the Xbox app that needs an update or the whole system? Should you go through the Windows App store or the Windows Update tool? Will a future system update break your games? It's all a lot more convoluted than simply turning a console on and playing a game. And, while you can swap to a full Windows desktop view at any time—and even connect a mouse if you don't fancy battling through Windows' endless menus and submenus with the X-ROGs' thumbsticks or touchscreens—finding exactly what setting may need fiddling with when you just want to play a game can be a chore.

However, because the X-ROGs are fundamentally regular PCs, they're a lot more versatile than Nintendo's or Valve's efforts. Not only can you play media, browse, or do anything else you might do on a PC (even Office tasks, if you hate joy), but you can install any other PC gaming client—Steam, Epic, GOG, and more are all available. Better still, the Xbox app aggregates all games installed on the system into one library view, regardless of where they originate. You can even turn your ROG Xbox into an ersatz Steam Deck by running Steam in Big Picture mode (although some of its controller key bindings may not work).

The big win—pardon the pun—is that you can install mods with ease. While I've gotten a few mods running on my Steam Deck over the years, its Linux underbelly makes things trickier. On the X-ROGs, I've been able to use mods as easily as on my main gaming desktop, with no second-guessing if they'll actually work. It's a great feature that's facilitated by having standard Windows as the base.

But wait, there's a third UI player in the mix: Asus' own Armoury Crate SE software. Broadly, this is more of a device manager, with a dedicated button on both consoles to bring up a Command Center quick menu. This allows you to instantly switch power profiles, create custom control inputs, or set frame rate limits. It also offers a real-time monitor displaying useful system information like temperature, CPU and GPU performance, battery level and power drain, and the current frame rate.

However, fully open Armoury Crate and you'll find an array of far deeper controls, from granular system settings to tweaking color profiles of the LED rings that sit under each thumbstick. It also has its own Update Center—yet another to check—and its own unified library, distinct from the Xbox app's. After a week with the X-ROGs, I'm finally familiar with where functions live, but the learning curve is steep, and having essentially three central interfaces—Xbox, Windows, Armoury Crate—for a single device is ridiculous.

On this at least, the X-ROGs are no different from Asus' original ROG Ally or 2024's ROG Ally X, or even other Windows-based gaming handhelds, such as the Lenovo Legion S Go. Hopping between multiple UIs doing variations of the same thing has become a kind of jank that feels baked into the entire product category. If you're accustomed to that, you'll feel right at home with the X-ROGs, with all their foibles.

However, the Xbox branding here is likely to attract players who, while perhaps more committed than “casual” gamers, still want a slick, pick-up-and-play experience from a handheld. If you stick purely to the Xbox app, the X-ROGs can be close to that, but the more you want to get out of them, the less intuitive they are.

That's a lot to get your head around before getting started, but mercifully, it's worth it. Both the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X are significant improvements on Asus' predecessors. In fact, these might be two of the best handheld gaming PCs I've ever used—although the use case for each ends up being quite different.

At a glance, the X-ROGs might seem separated only by colorways. The ROG Xbox Ally comes in white with multi-colored A/B/X/Y face buttons, while the ROG Xbox Ally X opts for all-black with gray buttons. Both use the same 290.8 x 121.5 x 50.7-millimeter form factor, each subtly decorated with near-microscopic “XBOX ROG” lettering cascading vertically down the shell like The Matrix code. They look and feel distinctly premium, as you'd expect given their prices.

Ergonomics are superb, with angular grips feeling more like holding a conventional Xbox controller than the brick-with-a-screen of many handheld PCs. All inputs are within reach, from the traditionally asymmetrical thumbsticks to the textured shoulder buttons and satisfyingly chunky triggers. At the rear sit two macro buttons with customizable inputs. Despite being nominally heavier than a Steam Deck's 669 grams—the Xbox ROG Ally weighs in at 670 grams, the Ally X at 715 grams—the masterful design means they sit better in the hand and are more comfortable to use for long play periods.

Both models also use the same screen, a 7-inch, 1920 x 1080p, 16:9 IPS touchscreen panel with a 120-Hz refresh rate and 500-nit brightness. Buyers will want to get a screen protector—it's made of Gorilla Glass Victus, but given how often you'll poke or swipe the screen to navigate the system, added protection feels necessary. When it's not covered in finger smudges, this is a great, sharp display at its default settings, and its performance can be further tweaked in Armoury Crate, either manually or with quick-sets tailored to specific gaming genres.

However, at the prices these handhelds are coming in at, it's hard not to feel a bit shortchanged that the screen isn't OLED, even on the higher-priced ROG Xbox Ally X. These are essentially the same screens as on Asus' previous ROG Ally, and despite both X-ROGs offering a higher resolution and refresh rate, the Steam Deck OLED‘s perfect black levels and ability to deliver HDR does still give it a slight edge.

The X-ROGs more clearly diverge in function. Some differences are small—the Ally's triggers incorporate Hall effect tech, while the Ally X uses Microsoft's Impulse Triggers for more nuanced haptics. Both feature two USB-C ports at the top—and you can charge through either—but the Ally's are both USB 3.2 Gen 2 (with DisplayPort 1.4 output and Power Delivery 3.0 support), while the Ally X has one USB 4 port with Thunderbolt 4 compatibility, and one USB 3.2 Gen 2 (both with DisplayPort 2.1 out), giving more versatility.

Major distinctions come down to raw power. The Ally packs in an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor, 16 GB LPDDR5-6400 RAM, and a 512-GB SSD—no slouch, but wildly outclassed by the Ally X. The flagship model's Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme chip is an absolute beast, and it's backed up by 24 GB LPDDR5X-8000 RAM and a 1-TB SSD. The resulting difference is clear to see, both in performance and who each handheld is aimed at.

Installing Forza Horizon 5 on both, the Ally impressed initially, still meeting requirements for the game's “High” quality preset. However, the game automatically set the frame rate cap to 30 fps, while a buried setting within the Xbox app for the Ally itself (absent on the Ally X) was set to “automatically limit games to 720p” resolution. Turning that off and raising the frame rate to the 120 fps the Ally is hypothetically capable of, performance dived, resulting in slightly juddery races around Mexico. Plugging the Ally in, maxing its power profile to the 20-watt “Turbo” setting in Armoury Crate, and boosting just about every other possible metric improved things, reaching a high of 48 fps—eminently playable, but nothing amazing.

On the Ally X, however, Forza ran at a smooth 60 fps straight away, off battery. Again, lifting the frame cap to 120 fps, even the Ally X never quite hit that magic number, but it did hover around 78 to 85 fps, while plugging in and setting the console to its 25-watt Turbo max saw it occasionally crest over 90 fps. Similar performance differentials were observed on other demanding AAA games installed on each handheld, including Gears of War: Reloaded, Avowed, and Halo Infinite—the Ally struggled while the Ally X handled everything I threw at it.

The basic Ally can shine with less technologically demanding games, though. Hollow Knight: Silksong hits a consistent 120 fps, while some retro classics and indies installed via Steam—Final Fantasy IX, Dredge, and Owlboy among them—all ran without a hitch. Much like the Steam Deck itself, the Ally feels best suited to these smaller titles, which also have the benefit of not eating up the entire SSD. Forza alone required a full quarter of the Ally's storage, colossal install sizes being another reminder of a lack of optimization. Both X-ROGs use standard M.2 2280 factor SSDs, though, so they should be easily upgradable, and both support microSD cards too—again better for smaller, less demanding games to be installed on.

There's one other workaround for performance throttles or storage issues, though: cloud gaming, which is surprisingly well implemented here. Testing out Bethesda's DOOM: The Dark Ages through Xbox Cloud Gaming (other platforms such as Nvidia's GeForce Now are also accessible), it connected quickly, played without a single drop-out, and ran at a consistent 60 fps on both X-ROGs. I don't know what witchcraft Xbox has been doing backstage, but this is the best cloud gaming I've ever encountered.

Whatever and however you're playing, battery life is impressive for both X-ROGs. Even though the Ally X again has an advantage—packing an 80-Wh battery versus the Ally's 60-Wh—I regularly got around six hours' play out of both units between charges, depending on the game. Playing an hour of Hollow Knight: Silksong—again, not the most demanding title—on each took the Ally from full to 85 percent, while the Ally X dropped to 88 percent. Cloud gaming saw barely any drain on either, about 7 percent per hour, but locally installed Forza or Gears slurped up around 30 to 35 percent of a full charge on both X-ROGs in around 45 minutes. Even that's far less draining than I expected, rendering both units surprisingly viable for longer play.

Both X-ROGs stand out in the increasingly crowded field of handheld gaming PCs, thanks to strong design, comfort of use, and cross-platform versatility that outpace most of the competition. Neither model is perfect, but for its first venture into the handheld space, Microsoft gets a lot right in its partnership with Asus.

If you want a reasonably powerful gaming PC that can run small to mid-size games with ease, and even some more demanding ones in a playable if not astounding state, the ROG Xbox Ally is a great choice—especially if you're happy to turn to cloud gaming for the most demanding titles.

If you want uncompromising performance and high-end capabilities, though, the ROG Xbox Ally X is a clear winner. It breezes through everything the baseline Ally does, and delivers authentic AAA gaming to boot. It's exceptional. In doing so, it's clearly, unabashedly targeting the “hardcore” gamer—and it's going to financially bleed them for the privilege.

Those prices are by far the biggest obstacle for either model, but if you're able to splash out on a high-end handheld, these can take portable gaming to the next level.

Seattle entrepreneur Connor Folley has teamed up with his brother Maxwell Folley to build out Alkemi, an AI platform that aims to let employees query their organization's data in plain English — without technical skills or risk to proprietary information.

Connor Folley previously co-founded Downstream, an Amazon advertising analytics startup acquired by Jungle Scout in 2021.

He spent two years at Jungle Scout, which offers tools for Amazon sellers, and said he saw “how the world's most valuable knowledge remained trapped, out of reach for the frontline workers who needed it most.”

Alkemi's technology is designed to help non-technical employees make decisions directly from company data. The company's product, DataLab, connects directly to platforms like Snowflake, Databricks, and Looker, and can also be integrated into AI agents and apps through MCP-compatible endpoints. 

The company said it aims to offer the speed and usability of tools like ChatGPT without the privacy tradeoffs that come from uploading proprietary files to public models.

DataLab does not upload or train on customer data, and its answers include traceable logic and sources.

Alkemi enters a crowded and fast-moving market. A growing wave of startups and enterprise vendors are pitching “AI copilots for data,” promising to democratize analytics while keeping information secure. 

The 7-person company has raised $1.65 million in pre-seed funding, led by Tuesday Capital with participation from DNX, MGV, and other angel investors — all of whom previously backed Folley at Downstream.

Before launching Downstream in 2018, Folley was a marketing manager at Amazon. Maxwell Folley sold his last startup Caravel, a conversational intelligence platform, to Commsor.

'We clarify that MSI has never officially sold or distributed the GeForce RTX 5090 in China'

MSI has issued a statement clarifying that it does not sell Nvidia's RTX 5090 GPU, following a spate of rumors and a photograph circulating online depicting hundreds of MSI-branded cards at an unspecified location in the country.

Three days ago, a user on Reddit posted an image showing unattended pallets of RTX 5090 GPUs lying in a street in China. This prompted online chatter pertaining to a lack of enforcement for export controls, as the RTX 5090 is one of many high-end cards that are banned from export to China. Aware of the PR connotations of getting caught, or even accused, of dealing the GPUs in the region, MSI was quick to issue a rebuttal.

In a new statement posted on its site, the company has clarified that it had nothing to do with the RTX 5090 shipments spotted in China, and claims the global serial number tracking has confirmed they are parallel imports — when a genuine product is imported through questionable means, without the explicit permission of the parent company.

Dealers skirting export controls on high-demand GPUs remains a headache for Washington. Just recently, a Singaporean company was accused of helping smuggle $2 billion worth of Nvidia GPUs into the country. We've known for a while now that underground markets exist in the region, where cards are regularly modded with increased VRAM to make them better for AI applications.

All of this leads to a precedent where, even though Beijing shouldn't be the recipient of high-end AI cards on paper, reality begs to differ. Nvidia has made region-specific RTX 5090D and 5090D V2 models for China, but they carry neutered specs, which leads to shady, black-market shipments thriving. Nvidia has always held the position that China is an important market for the chipmaker, but that it, too, has nothing to do with how the region keeps getting its hands on banned GPUs.

 




MSI reiterated that it only sells its RTX 5090 in the U.S., Europe, and some Asia-Pacific markets, and that any unauthorized units obtained via grey channels are not covered under warranty. These illicit GPUs allegedly arrived in China through third-party resellers and retailers in overseas markets who bypassed regulations and illegally imported the cards.

While there was no word on any active investigations or whether the hardware manufacturer plans to take action, MSI did note that any products bought through non-official channels may have been resold or tampered with, and aren't eligible for warranty, repair services, or technical support. MSI is a Taiwanese company, a country that remains imperative in the ongoing U.S.–China trade war, and is an extremely sensitive region geopolitically. A significant portion of MSI's production facilities is located in Mainland China.

It's a free Linux-based OS with 200+ games included. Commodore promises ‘No nags. No noise. No tracking'.

A lot of column inches were spent saying goodbye to Windows 10 yesterday. Recently, we have also shared quite a few articles which may help you decide where next on your computing journey – whether that be Windows 11, or an alternative like Ubuntu Linux. Now, the reinvented digital detox tech brand, Commodore, has thrown its hat in the ring, proposing you “Save your PC. Save your sanity” by transitioning to the totally free (Linux-based) Commodore OS Vision 3.0.

Commodore has set up a microsite to help steer you towards its unique vision of a modern operating system. If you head over to commodore.net/closewindows, you will first see a banner image of the Commodore 64X PC with OS Vision. But that is essentially an x86 PC in a C64-style ‘bread bin' chassis, so don't worry about the hardware.

Your Windows 10 era is ending. As of October 14: No more updates, no more security patches, no more support. Ever.Microsoft may be leaving you behind. We won't.Meet #Commodore OS Vision 3.0 – a totally FREE, modern, Linux-based sanctuary from tech gone too far. Calm.… pic.twitter.com/2Y7abUGZWEOctober 14, 2025

As per the official Commodore post above, this OS is being pitched as a fresh start, as Windows 10 rides off into the sunset. Those frustrated with Microsoft's OS, and its assumed direction of travel given what we've seen of Windows 11 so far, are promised “a reset” rather than an upgrade.

Key touted attractions of Commodore OS Vision 3.0 are that it is “a totally FREE, modern, Linux-based sanctuary from tech gone too far. Calm. Creative. Privacy-first. Retro-futuristic. No nags. No noise. No tracking. No toxic social media,” says Commodore. Those sound very much like the words and philosophies of its new CEO, Christian ‘Perifractic' Simpson.

To be clear, Commodore OS Vision 3.0 hasn't just been released to take advantage of Windows users in flux, though. This version of the OS was released back in April.

There is a lot going on in this Linux (Debian)-based OS, which partly explains the humongous download. One of the most striking elements of the Commodore OS Vision 3.0 is its uniquely crafted interface, a love letter to the Commodore legacy, which is a retro-futuristic take on UI design.

Once in the OS, there are lashings of extras. Most notably, the games and demos. This distro includes over 200 free Linux-compatible games, along with a selection of classic Commodore games and demos – thus providing a mix of nostalgia and modernity.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Another key attraction of this OS is its inclusion of Commodore OS BASIC V1. This included BASIC interpreter has been bolstered to support 3D graphics, physics, and more. The original Commodore machines sparked a flood of creativity from bedroom coders, and being able to write computer programs without additional software is very much in the DNA of these influential machines.

Last but not least, as far as highlights go, we must mention the Commodore OS Central. This is a hub for retro-oriented resources and manuals. It is also earmarked for development into a game store, installer, and launcher – with community interaction.

If the idea of moving to the Commodore OS Vision 3.0 intrigues you, we recommend watching the video overview, published by Explaining Computers, below.

Those eager to get stuck in with Commodore OS Vision 3.0 on one of their PCs can find lots of discussion about the operating system on the busy official forums. There, you can also find an extensive installation guide, with walk-throughs for testing (in a VM) or even fully adopting this OS.

The GPU shortage during COVID could soon look like child's play.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AI datacenters are eating up the world's supply standard DRAM memory, NAND flash for SSDs, and hard drives. Adata chairman Simon Chen just made it extremely clear that in his three-decade tenure in the industry, he's never witnessed a simultaneous shortage of all of the aforementioned components, via a DigiTimes Asia report.

Chen goes on to explicitly state that Adata and its usual competitors aren't fighting between themselves for supply in what would be businesss as usual. Instead, cloud service providers (CSPs) — almost always AI datacenters in this day and age — are now gobbling up all available capacity of these components.

As if all that wasn't enough, Chen believes that the shortage of hard drives is incentivizing customers to try and purchase SSDs for non-volatile storage needs instead, further twisting the spiral of storage scarcity. Adata's sales team has purportedly gotten instructions to "sell sparingly" and "give priority to loyal customers" in turn.

Additionally, the inventory at upstream suppliers is charitably described as barebones, with only two to three weeks' worth of supply, down from the usual two-to-three months of capacity. In other words, that means that SK hynix, Samsung, Micron, Kioxia, and Western Digital are selling most everything they make to AI projects.

In case you're not entirely convinced of how big a deal Chen's suspicion-confirming statements are, Adata had a 11% share in the SSD market in 2024, and holds a 5% slice of the memory market. Those are small percentages, but they're for the entire world, meaning that Adata purchases memory and flash chips at large volumes and careful negotiated prices. The deals are likely done multiple months in advance, and Adata certainly would otherwise have far bigger negotiation power than, say, Joe's Discount Memory.

The company's stock price has climbed sky-high since August, and it hit a 15-year revenue high in Q2 2025. That's keeping in tandem with the general industry trend, with DRAM revenue jumping 17.1% in the past fiscal quarter, and enterprise SSD revenue boosting by 12.7%. Even CPU/GPU chipmakers are charging gigantic premiums for their top-shelf wares, too.

All of this AI-fueled demand is now affecting the supply chain for all modern consumer electronics. Most any advanced device, including phones, TVs, consoles, and cars, all need one or more of the components that are now in high demand. If you're on the fence on whether to purchase a new handset, computer, or television, you'd be wise to consider moving sooner rather than later. Even if AI isn't taking all of our jobs, it seems poised to take all of our silicon.

Rodney Scott, MBChB, MRCP, DipStat, PhD, Division Chief of Neurology, Nemours Children's Health, Delaware Valley, has received a prestigious National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director's Transformative Research Award. Dr. Scott will use the $2.6 million, five-year grant to investigate malfunctions in the brain's hippocampal region, aiming to identify patterns that could lead to shared therapies for patients with autism, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease.

"In disorders like autism, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's, the part of the brain called the hippocampus doesn't function properly. Current treatments target each disease separately, often with limited success," Dr. Scott explained.

Instead, our research will look for shared abnormal brain activity patterns across conditions. If found, we will develop novel methods of brain stimulation that could restore healthy hippocampal function across a range of disorders."

Dr. Rodney Scott, MBChB, MRCP, DipStat, PhD, Division Chief of Neurology, Nemours Children's Health, Delaware Valley

The NIH Transformative Research Awards promote cross-cutting, interdisciplinary approaches, supporting high-risk, high-reward research that could potentially create new paradigms for understanding disease and developing new therapies and preventive strategies.

Dr. Scott's project will analyze patterns of dysfunction in the hippocampus, the region of the brain that regulates memory and emotions. The research is based on the theory that autism, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's may share the same faulty mechanism-specifically, a disruption in the brain's neural networks. Through his NIH award, Dr. Scott and co-principal investigator Matt Mahoney, PhD, Principal Computational Scientist with the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, will devise living and computer models to pinpoint the disruption. Dr. Scott's research team will collect biological data, while Dr. Mahoney and colleagues will lead the effort to develop mathematical models. Together, the investigators will be able to examine a high volume of data and potentially accelerate the pace of discovery.

Dr. Scott joined Nemours Children's in 2021, continuing an accomplished career that has spanned hospitals in Zimbabwe, England, and the United States. He has made groundbreaking advances in the treatment and management of epilepsy, as well as the application of complex adaptive systems theories to neurological disease. In addition to his post at Nemours Children's, he is a Professor of Neurology and Pediatrics at Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University; and a Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Delaware.

"This high-risk, high-reward support from the NIH allows investigators like Dr. Scott to develop and rigorously test innovative ideas that are not in the mainstream," said Matthew M. Davis, MD, MAPP, Executive Vice President, Enterprise Physician-in-Chief, and Chief Scientific Officer, Nemours Children's Health. "Through this research, it may be possible to improve cognitive function and quality of life for patients with a broad range of neurological conditions, in childhood and adulthood. This project demonstrates Nemours Children's commitment to research and academic excellence in the pursuit of advancing science and improving health outcomes for generations to come."

A low-fat vegan diet that doesn't limit calories or carbohydrates could help people with type 1 diabetes reduce insulin use and insulin costs, according to new research by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine published in BMC Nutrition.

Insulin is a hormone that helps move glucose (sugar) from the blood into muscle and liver cells to be used as energy. People with type 1 diabetes must take insulin because their body doesn't produce enough. Some people with type 1 diabetes may need to take additional insulin, because they have insulin resistance, a condition in which cells don't respond well to insulin and glucose remains in the blood. Insulin resistance is strongly influenced by dietary fat, which can inhibit glucose from entering the cells.

The new research, which is a secondary analysis of a 2024 Physicians Committee study, compared the effect of a low-fat vegan diet to a portion-controlled diet on insulin use and insulin costs in people with type 1 diabetes. The analysis found that the total dose of insulin decreased by 28%, or 12.1 units, per day in the vegan group, compared to no significant change in the portion-controlled group. The reductions in insulin use in the vegan group likely reflect improved insulin sensitivity, or how well the body responds to insulin. Total insulin costs decreased by 27%, or $1.08 per day, in the vegan group, compared to no significant change in the portion-controlled group.

The 2024 study found that a vegan diet also led to an average weight loss of 11 pounds, improved insulin sensitivity and glycemic control, and improved cholesterol levels and kidney function in people with type 1 diabetes.

The new research comes as insulin prices in the United States continue to rise. Spending on insulin in the United States tripled in the past 10 years, reaching $22.3 billion in 2022, due to the increased usage and higher price of insulin, according to the American Diabetes Association. The inflation-adjusted cost of insulin increased by 24% from 2017 to 2022.

As insulin prices continue to rise, people with type 1 diabetes should consider a low-fat vegan diet, which can help improve their insulin sensitivity and reduce the amount of insulin they need, potentially saving them hundreds of dollars a year."

Older adults, especially those living with health conditions, who hold positive views about aging are more likely to engage in vigorous physical activity, according to a study led by the University of Surrey.

Surrey researchers found that how an individual's outlook on aging - whether they see it as a time of growth or decline - is a significant correlate of their physical activity levels.

The research, published on Healthcare, analysed data from 1,699 UK residents aged 50 and over, and found that positive views on aging were linked to a greater likelihood of engaging in vigorous activity. People with a higher number of non-communicable diseases - such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease - were more likely to engage in vigorous physical activity if they had a more positive view of aging.

Our research suggests that a positive outlook on aging could act as a psychological buffer, helping individuals stay active despite health challenges. Addressing people's beliefs about aging may be just as important as addressing their physical health needs, which should be considered when designing public health strategies to promote a healthy and active lifestyle."

Professor Victoria Tischler, co-author of the study and Professor of Behavioural Science, University of Surrey

The researchers propose that public health campaigns and interventions should support older people to maintain a positive attitude towards physical activity, even if they experience illness or long-term conditions. So, promoting positive views on aging can be important not only to promote health, but also to improve the quality of life in older people who experience one or more health conditions. These efforts could help older adults reframe aging not as a period of inevitable decline, but as a life stage where it is still possible to maintain an active and engaged lifestyle.

Dr Serena Sabatini, lead author of the study and visiting lecturer at the University of Surrey adds:

"The ultimate goal is to create a society where an active and engaged later life is not only possible but expected, even in the presence of health challenges."

Polyethyleneimines (PEIs) are extensively researched as non-viral vectors for gene and medication delivery because of their capacity to condense nucleic acids into nanoparticles known as polyplexes.1

Compared to viral vectors, PEIs have lower immunogenicity, higher loading capacity, and lower production costs.2

However, their clinical translation has been hampered due to low transfection efficiencies.3

The type of polyplex formation, which regulates cellular absorption and intracellular release, is an important element in managing transfection.

Effective delivery systems require polyplexes that are sturdy enough to avoid premature nucleic acid release, while remaining weak enough to release the payload at the appropriate time and position within the cell.4

Understanding the intermolecular interactions and conformational changes involved in polyplex synthesis and stability is critical for enhancing PEI-based delivery platforms. According to Mustafa et al., attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy is ideal for this application.5

It reveals molecular-level information about DNA structure and binding via vibrational modes of the phosphate backbone and nucleobases. This article shows how ATR-FTIR can be utilized to characterize polyplex production using linear and branching PEI architectures.

Mustafa et al. provide a detailed discussion of their procedures. ATR-FTIR measurements were taken using a commercially available FTIR spectrometer with a Harrick ConcentratIR2™ multiple reflection silicon ATR attachment.5

Two PEI structures were investigated: linear (LPEI, 15 kDa) and branching (BPEI, 10 kDa). Polyplexes were generated at N/P ratios ranging from zero to three in 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).

The final concentrations were three millimolar LPEI, five millimolar BPEI, and one millimolar DNA. Before measurements were taken, the samples were incubated for one hour at room temperature.

To confirm the spectrum interpretation, additional samples were generated at increasing sodium chloride concentrations (50-250 mM) to test for electrostatic interactions. All spectra were background removed, baseline corrected, and normalized.

Figure 1 shows ATR-FTIR spectra of DNA with increasing N/P ratios for LPEI and BPEI. With LPEI, the asymmetric phosphate stretching band at 1222 cm-1 shows a noticeable frequency shift as N/P rises, showing strong electrostatic binding to the DNA backbone.

This frequency shift also signals a conformational change in the DNA structure, from B to Z. Moderate alterations were found in the nucleobase ring stretching region (1400-1500 cm-1) and carbonyl band (1680 cm-1). These modifications imply that LPEI interacts weakly with DNA nucleobases.

The spectra of BPEI-based polyplexes exhibited no shift at 1222 cm-1, but a considerable intensity decrease and splitting of the 1680 cm-1 band, indicating interactions with nucleobases via intercalation, without major disruption of the phosphate backbone.

Salt screening assays supported these interpretations. Figure 2 shows that increasing NaCl reduced LPEI binding by around 70 %, consistent with electrostatic interactions. At the greatest salt concentrations, BPEI binding decreased by just 20-30 %, indicating that interactions with DNA nucleobases primarily aid binding.

This study shows that ATR-FTIR with the ConcentratIR2 accessory may successfully distinguish between binding modes in PEI-DNA polyplexes.

The 1222 cm-1 phosphate band detects electrostatic interactions between LPEI and DNA, while the 1680 cm-1 band indicates BPEI intercalation with nucleobases. These findings serve as a foundation for developing more successful non-viral gene delivery technologies.

Surveys of more than 1,000 Italian patients and clinicians uncover why oral steroid use remains widespread in asthma care, revealing gaps in guideline adherence, patient education, and access to advanced biologic therapies.

Study: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients with asthma: how far is clinical practice from the guidelines? Results from surveys of patients and doctors. Image credit: zlikovec/Shutterstock.com

A recent Frontiers in Allergy study examined usage patterns and barriers to adherence to oral corticosteroid (OCS) treatment guidelines for asthma in Italy. To do so, surveys were conducted with healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients.

Asthma affects an estimated 262 million people worldwide, with the highest incidence seen in children under nine. Globally, its prevalence has increased by about 15% between 1990 and 2019. In Italy alone, around 4 million people live with asthma, including approximately 200,000 with severe asthma (SA), a group that represents a substantial burden on healthcare resources and costs.

The management of SA often requires the use of long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs). Existing guidelines recommend the use of OCS only as a last option due to severe adverse effects, such as growth impairment in children and iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency. Despite this, OCS medications are commonly prescribed in asthma treatment. However, patients have their concerns, and research shows that about 44% of adults report worries about OCS use, sometimes leading them to reduce or discontinue treatment without medical supervision by HCPs. Therefore, a gap exists between clinical practice and guidelines, which needs to be examined.

To address the knowledge gap between guidelines and clinical practice concerning asthma treatment, the Respiriamo Insieme Association in Italy, in collaboration with Sanofi, conducted two surveys among HCPs (survey 1) and patients (survey 2). The current study documents the results of these surveys, which aim to reduce OCS dependence and enhance the quality of life of SA patients.

Survey 1 comprised seven closed-ended questions (six multiple-choice and one rating scale) and gathered insights into the OCS prescribing practices, barriers to proper use, potential overuse patterns, and adherence to current guidelines. Survey 2 explored patients' perspectives on awareness and involvement in treatment decisions, usage patterns, treatment adjustment and monitoring, education provided by HCPs, management of adverse events (AEs), and safety practices concerning OCS use.

A total of 366 HCPs completed the survey, and 82% preferred a 10-day OCS treatment duration. A duration of more than 21 days was preferred by 14% of HCPs, and the remaining opted for longer treatment durations. Ninety-nine percent of HCPs said that either more than 6 months of OCS use per year or 2 or 3 cycles per year was necessary to classify a patient as OCS-dependent. The remaining 1% thought a single cycle was enough. Concerning the annual cumulative corticosteroid use, 28% reported never keeping track of the total OCS dose for their patients, 40% reported doing this, 24% did this occasionally, and the remaining 8% based their calculations on prescribed OCS doses.

Twenty-seven percent of HCPs thought the maximum safe daily dose was 7.5 mg/day, while 43% put this at 5 mg/day. Twelve and 18% thought the safe limits were 2 mg/day and 10 mg/day, respectively. Regarding strategies to minimize the OCS dose in managing SA, 43% responded that changing the ICS/LABA combination was the most effective. This was closely followed by using biologic therapies (37%). More than half of the HCPs thought that a multidisciplinary approach is crucial to prevent adverse effects of OCS, and about 44% recommended monitoring visits for bone densitometry every two years.

Overall, patients and their families/caregivers completed 829 questionnaires, of which 468 belonged to patients with SA. Only two-thirds of patients with non-SA were prescribed OCS, compared with 95% of patients with SA. Around 47% of SA patients used OCS more than once, for at least two cycles per year, compared with 27% of non-SA patients. Overall, 13% of SA and 14% of non-SA patients reported having ceased OCS use. Forty-seven percent of SA patients and 24% of non-SA patients used OCS once a year or more without a valid prescription. Forty percent of SA and 31% of non-SA patients did not taper the dose when stopping, while 52% and 33% of SA and non-SA patients did, respectively.

In about 71% of SA patients, the physician involved them in the decision to take OCS, compared to 43% for non-SA patients. Physicians did not inform 45% of non-SA and 49% of SA patients about the possible alternatives to OCS, respectively. Concerning the long-term strategy, inhaler medications were common in the non-SA group, while biologics were most common in the SA group.

Twenty-two percent of non-SA patients reported being informed about adverse reactions, whereas 35% reported never being informed. Among the SA patients, 41% were informed about potential side effects, while 57% reported not being referred to a specialist. Most patients did not receive a bone health assessment. The study also found that about 40% of patients self-administered OCS at least once per year without a prescription, often due to fear of exacerbations or difficulty accessing healthcare. This reflects the ease of access to OCS without a prescription in Italy. A much higher proportion of SA patients acquired OCS without a valid prescription, relative to non-SA patients.

The findings show a significant discrepancy between guideline recommendations and clinical practice, and OCS use remains very high in Italy. Reducing unnecessary OCS use through biologic therapies could also help lower healthcare costs.

Several unmet needs and proposed systemic reforms: establishing a clearer and pragmatic definition of “OCS dependency,” improving patient education and shared decision-making, increasing access to multidisciplinary care (including psychological support), and using digital or diary-based monitoring tools to track OCS adherence and side effects.

A key limitation of the study was the inability to distinguish between respondents from pediatric and adult care settings. This may have led to misinterpretation of notable differences in OCS use between adults and children. Secondly, the study's cross-sectional nature exposes it to response bias, inaccurate self-reporting, and recall bias. Finally, the results may not be generalizable to other populations as the study was conducted on a selected set of Italian HCPs and patients.

The study underscores the persistence of high OCS use despite guideline recommendations, highlighting the need for coordinated education, standardized monitoring, and integrated psychological and specialist care to reduce unnecessary OCS exposure in severe asthma management.

Rapid and urgent action on food is needed if the UK is to reboot its flagging economy, save the NHS billions, ensure national food security, and meet climate commitments, according to a new report.

The Roadmap for Resilience: A UK Food Plan for 2050, calls for radical transformation, at a scale and pace not seen since the Second World War. It says if we do not act now, change will be forced upon us by increasing pressures and the UK will lurch from crisis to crisis, including from food price shocks, climate disasters and weakening economic productivity.

Acting now however, allows the UK to decide its own future, and must include three core transformations: more resilient farming, smarter land use, and healthier diets. Government must take the lead with "decisive and coordinated action", says the report, and proposes 10 key recommendations and a timeline to 2050.

The report is published as renewed attention is being given to global food system transformation, including through the EAT-Lancet Commission's latest report released earlier this month.

"Achieving this transformation has the power to deliver a food system where everyone in the UK has access to healthy and sustainable food," said Neil Ward, Co-lead of the Agri-Food for Net Zero (AFN) Network+, which coordinated the report, and a professor at the University of East Anglia (UEA).

Through these three transformations we can reduce pressure on the NHS and help people lead healthier and more economically active lives. Nature will flourish, emissions will fall and farming will be more resilient and secure for future generations."

Neil Ward, Professor, University of East Anglia

"Pressures from climate change, global shocks and poor diets mean significant change to our food system is inevitable over the next 50 years. However, if we act now, we still have time to shape our future, and positively impact national security, national health, economic growth and climate change. Our window to act is narrow though - if we do not, change will be forced on us by crisis," added Professor Ward.

The report had input from 150 scientists and industry professionals from across research institutes, farming, charities and the food industry, and is the culmination of three years of work by the AFN Network+, a project funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), with 3,000 members and led by a group of 11 universities and research institutes.

The report highlights that the UK food system is a significant source of national greenhouse gas emissions and will become the largest source of emissions by the 2040s. Meanwhile, poor diets cost the economy £268 billion a year in direct healthcare costs as well as indirect costs such as low economic activity, and 7.2 million people now live in food-insecure households - an increase of 80% in just three years. Adding to these challenges, the UK is vulnerable to supply chain disruptions, since it is dependent on imports for 50% of vegetables and 85% of fruit, despite these being essential to healthy diets.

The Roadmap calls for transformation in three key areas:

 

The authors set out 10 priority actions, urging the government to work in partnership with farmers, food companies and local authorities. These include:

Professor Tim Benton, Co-lead of the AFN Network+, said: "Every year of delay makes transformation harder and more costly. We call on all parties, public institutions, industry and civil society to unite to drive forwards the transformations highlighted in this Roadmap. Change is coming to our food system, but how we shape it is our choice to make."

Professor Charlotte Deane, Executive Chair of UKRI's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, said: "Agri-food remains one of the UK's most stubborn sources of emissions.

"The AFN Network+ has brought together a powerful community of research leaders and stakeholders across UK agri-food, third sector organisations, policymakers and agri-food industry professionals to tackle this challenge and now delivered a clear roadmap for change.

"Our investment has resulted in a legacy of insights which will help shape future land use and food strategy, supporting the UK's path to net zero."
The Roadmap for Resilience: A UK Food Plan for 2050 was developed by the AFN Network+, drawing on insights from across its community of more than 3,000 members. The AFN Network+ is jointly led by UEA, the University of Leeds, University of York, and the University of the West of England.

The first full-length structures of two heat shock chaperone proteins in a complex reveal the key structural region regulating their function, according to a new study from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The chaperone complex binds misfolded proteins and gives them another chance to fold correctly. This process is essential for cells because improperly folded proteins tend to aggregate, potentially causing a diverse array of diseases. However, the mechanism by which these two major heat shock chaperone proteins, Hsp40 and Hsp70, bind each other and misfolded peptides was unclear. The new structures enabled the scientists to identify how the cellular machinery works. The findings were published today in Molecular Cell.

"Heat shock chaperone proteins form the first line of defense against protein misfolding and aggregation, a precursor to many diseases," said corresponding author Charalampos Babis Kalodimos, PhD, St. Jude Department of Structural Biology chair.

We showed how these two particular heat shock chaperone proteins come together, revealing a previously unknown set of mechanisms explaining how they work in tandem, and how they can malfunction."

Charalampos Babis Kalodimos, Department of Structural Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital

Heat shock chaperone proteins are essential in most organisms, with similar versions present from bacteria to humans. Bacterial Hsp40 and Hsp70 are known to help misfolded proteins correctly refold, with decades of research into their function as chaperone proteins. The human versions of these proteins are also linked to several diseases. However, exactly how Hsp40 and Hsp90 bind a client protein and each other was unknown, because no one had been able to overcome the technical hurdles involved in capturing the massive full-length structure. 

Instead of using a single approach, the St. Jude scientists combined cryogenic electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and X-ray crystallography data to finally solve the bacterial complex's structure. They captured multiple forms of the structure, consisting of dimers (pairs) of Hsp70 interacting with dimers of Hsp40, in several different states of binding client proteins.

"Most importantly, we captured the full-length structures of the active and inhibited states, bound to an incorrectly folded protein," Kalodimos said. "But we also solved multiple smaller pieces. By assembling them together, they've given us a new model of how the Hsp40 and Hsp70 complex really functions."

Mutations in a specific region of Hsp40 are associated with an array of ailments, including many neurodegenerative diseases, but how those mutations disrupt normal functions was unknown. The region is rich in highly conserved amino acids called glycines and phenylalanines, though their exact functions were unclear. The structures revealed that this region of Hsp40 binds a client protein first, then a particular phenylalanine binds to the substrate binding site on Hsp70. That phenylalanine then pulls the misfolded protein into the substrate binding site, displacing itself, though the rest of Hsp40 remains bound to Hsp70. After the handoff, the misfolded peptide is then unfolded by Hsp70.

"We first uncovered the mechanism of handover, where Hsp40 gives the client to Hsp70 by initially tucking in a phenylalanine into the binding pocket, which subsequently transfers the client into the same site," Kalodimos said. "But then, by having structures of the complex in multiple states, we also saw how the complex releases client proteins."

The scientists found that when ATP, the energy currency of the cell, binds to Hsp70, Hsp70 changes shape, pushing the phenylalanine back into the binding pocket, which in turn pushes out the client protein and releases it into the cell. Afterward, Hsp40 leaves Hsp70 and is then available to bind another misfolded protein, starting the process again.

"We now understand mechanistically how the chaperones and protein client form this very big complex, how they are released, and how they cycle through these states," Kalodimos said. "Using that knowledge, we have a starting place to look for therapeutic interventions to compensate for disease-causing mutations, to exploit as drug targets in cancers or inspire next-generation antibiotics."

In a compelling Genomic Press Interview published today in Genomic Psychiatry, Dr. Najaf Amin unveils transformative insights that fundamentally reshape international understanding of depression genetics. The Oxford University Associate Professor, ranked among the top scientists globally in genetics and the top women in science worldwide, shares ground breaking discoveries that promise to revolutionize how researchers across continents approach major depression. With over 350 peer-reviewed publications and an exceptional h-index of 125, Dr. Amin has positioned herself at the vanguard of molecular epidemiology, challenging long-held paradigms about depression pathogenesis through innovative multi-omics approaches that extend far beyond traditional genetic frameworks.

The interview, published as part of the Innovators & Ideas series, reveals how Dr. Amin transformed early career setbacks into scientific breakthroughs that now influence research laboratories from Europe to Asia. Her journey from Pakistan to becoming one of Oxford's leading molecular epidemiologists exemplifies the power of perseverance in advancing global medical knowledge. When traditional genome-wide association studies failed to produce significant results for depression, Dr. Amin pioneered alternative approaches that have since yielded extraordinary discoveries benefiting researchers and patients worldwide.

Dr. Amin's identification of the RCL1 gene mutation represents a watershed moment in depression research, opening entirely new avenues for understanding the disorder's biological mechanisms. This discovery connects primate-specific interlaminar astrocytes to depression pathogenesis, providing researchers worldwide with novel therapeutic targets previously unexplored. Her work challenges the conventional view of depression as primarily a neurotransmitter imbalance, instead revealing it as a systemic disease involving multiple bodily systems.

The scope of her contributions extends beyond single gene discoveries. Leading the most extensive published studies on epigenomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiome in major depression, Dr. Amin has identified 124 metabolites associated with the disorder, with 49 being entirely novel discoveries. These findings, published in prestigious journals including Nature Communications and JAMA Psychiatry, provide the international scientific community with crucial biomarkers that could revolutionize diagnosis and treatment approaches globally.

The interview reveals Dr. Amin's paradigm-shifting perspective on depression as fundamentally a systemic disease rather than purely a brain disorder. This conceptualization transforms how researchers worldwide approach the condition, encouraging investigation of immune system disturbances, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction, oxidative stress, and metabolic perturbations. Her integrative approach, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and single-cell analysis, provides unprecedented molecular insights that benefit laboratories across continents pursuing personalized medicine approaches.

Dr. Amin emphasizes the critical importance of understanding feedback loops among biological, psychological, and social factors in depression development and maintenance. This holistic view influences treatment strategies globally, moving beyond one-size-fits-all models toward personalized interventions tailored to individual biological markers, life histories, and environmental contexts. The implications extend to public health policies worldwide, as her research demonstrates why depression contributes to higher morbidity and mortality through its effects on multiple physiological systems.

The interview provides intimate glimpses into the personal challenges that shaped Dr. Amin's scientific philosophy and resilience. Her transition from electronics enthusiast to world-renowned geneticist began with her own diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome at age 19, sparking curiosity about genetic mechanisms that would define her career. The narrative of overcoming significant personal and professional obstacles, including navigating academia as a brown woman from a developing country, resonates with scientists worldwide facing similar barriers.

Dr. Amin candidly discusses critical moments that nearly derailed her career, including the departure of her supervisor early in her doctoral studies and initial project failures that left her without publications. Her mentor, Professor Cornelia van Duijn, played a pivotal role in transforming these setbacks into opportunities for growth. This relationship exemplifies the importance of mentorship in fostering scientific excellence across cultural and geographic boundaries.

Her advocacy for equality, diversity, and inclusion in scientific grant awards and promotions addresses systemic issues affecting researchers globally. Dr. Amin's observation that she must invest "at least twice the effort" of many European counterparts to achieve comparable outcomes highlights persistent inequities requiring international attention and reform.

Looking forward, Dr. Amin outlines ambitious goals for experimentally verifying causal associations between genetic and environmental risk factors for depression. Her vision encompasses developing integrated models spanning the entire chain of causation from risk exposure to molecular perturbation to clinical outcomes. This comprehensive approach promises to benefit healthcare systems worldwide by enabling more effective prevention and intervention strategies.

The research particularly emphasizes understanding how discoveries apply across diverse populations, ensuring that advances in depression genetics benefit people regardless of geographic location or ethnic background. Dr. Amin's work on rare variants demonstrates that population-specific genetic factors require consideration in developing truly global solutions to depression treatment.

Her dedication to open-access publishing through Genomic Press ensures that these groundbreaking discoveries remain accessible to researchers worldwide, particularly those in resource-limited settings who might otherwise lack access to critical scientific literature. This commitment to scientific democratization amplifies the global impact of her research, enabling scientists everywhere to build upon her discoveries.

Dr. Najaf Amin's Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today's most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist's impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.

The brain's mechanisms for repairing injuries caused by trauma or degenerative diseases are not yet known in detail. Now, a study by the University of Barcelona describes a new strategy based on stem cell therapy that could enhance neuronal regeneration and neuroplasticity when this vital organ is damaged. The results reveal that the use of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), combined with stem cell-based cell therapies, could help in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases or brain injuries. 

The study, published in International Journal of Molecular Sciences, is led by Professor Daniel Tornero and researcher Alba Ortega, from the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences and the Institute of Neurosciences of the University of Barcelona (UBneuro). The study involves the decisive participation of a group of UB students who were awarded one of the gold medals in the international synthetic biology competition iGEM 2024, the most important international synthetic biology competition for young researchers. 

BDNF is a protein that is synthesised mainly in the brain and plays a key role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. Several studies have described its potential to promote neuronal survival and growth, findings that are now extended by the new study.

The findings indicate that BDNF can promote the maturation and increase the activity of neurons generated in the laboratory from donor skin cells. The skin cells must first be reprogrammed to become induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and then differentiated to obtain neuronal cultures."  

Daniel Tornero, UB's Department of Biomedicine and the CIBER Area for the Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED)

In this way, the study combines cell therapy with the production of BDNF in the same cells. This study confirms the beneficial effects of this growth factor in neuronal cultures derived from human stem cells, the same cells that are used in cell therapy to treat, for example, stroke in animal models.

"This strategy is being applied at an experimental level to design cell therapies and to generate laboratory models to help study brain diseases," says Tornero. When these neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are modified to continuously overexpress the BDNF protein, "we obtain more mature and active neuronal cultures, without altering the normal organization of their connections or the functional networks," explains researcher Alba Ortega.The study focuses on the more functional aspects of neuronal regeneration, such as neuronal activity and axon generation, which are directly involved in the integration of cells that are transplanted into the brain.

"In addition, cells that produce BDNF are able to attract axons — the extensions that allow communication between neurons — more efficiently. This chemo-attraction effect would be related to the production of this factor," says the researcher.

BDNF's ability to attract growing axons has been described previously. Now, the team shows this effect for the first time in neurons derived from human stem cells using a microfluidic chip system. This innovative technology — with two chambers that isolate populations of neurons with or without the ability to produce BDNF — makes it possible to grow populations of neurons communicating through small channels and thus observe precisely how they interact with each other.

"The cells that produce BDNF generate a concentration gradient in these channels, which we believe guides and facilitates the formation of neuronal projections in a specific direction," says student Santiago Ramos, representing the group of students who have contributed an innovative perspective to the conceptual and experimental design of the study.

Neurodegenerative diseases and neuronal injuries, which are increasingly frequent in the population, are one of the major challenges for healthcare systems. As the endogenous regenerative capacity of the human brain is very limited, lesions only partially recover and affected patients are often left with motor and cognitive sequelae. In this context, there is an urgent need to design strategies that complement these endogenous brain mechanisms with human stem cell-based therapies to promote neuronal repair, functional integration and more efficient recovery.

In this regard, the team plans to transfer these results to animal models, a line of research developed for some time in this laboratory to improve human stem cell therapy in ischaemic stroke lesions affecting the cerebral cortex.

The application of preclinical advances in patients will mark a turning point in the treatment of many neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are still many obstacles to implementing stem cell-based therapies and avoiding potential side effects (tumour generation, etc.). Some international clinical trials based on stem cell transplantation for the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease (in Japan, Sweden and the United States) are showing promising results.

"Although there are many challenges, progress in Parkinson's clinical trials shows that we are closer than ever to applying these therapies safely in patients with stroke or other neurodegenerative diseases," the experts conclude.

Peginterferon-α treatment exhibits low rates of the serological conversion rate of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and the negative conversion rate of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, with significant myelosuppression leading to treatment discontinuation in some patients. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may ameliorate liver inflammation and modulate immune responses. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of combining TCM with pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN) α-2b and its impact on myelosuppression adverse effects.

This study included 117 HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients who started initial antiviral therapy at Xiamen Hospital of TCM between June 2018 and January 2023. According to the treatment regimen, patients were divided into the observation group (n = 56, receiving PEG-IFN α-2b combined with Licorice 15 g, Angelica sinensis 20 g, Poria 20 g, Paeonia lactiflora 20 g, Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae 20 g, Radix Bupleurum Chinense 20 g, Mentha piperita 3 g, Ginger three slices for more than six months) and the control group (n = 61, receiving PEG-IFN α-2b alone). This study retrospectively analyzed etiological indicators, liver biochemical indicators, and blood routine tests before and after treatment.

After 24 and 48 weeks of treatment, the observation group demonstrated significantly superior outcomes to the control group in quantitative reduction of hepatitis B surface antigen, the serological conversion rate of HBeAg, and the reduction in HBV DNA quantification (P < 0.05). By week 48, the HBV DNA negative conversion rate in the observation group (46.67%) was significantly higher than that in the control group (26.67%) (P < 0.05). Regarding safety, the incidence of myelosuppression in the observation group was significantly lower than that in the control group at both 24 and 48 weeks of treatment (P < 0.05)

Real-world findings demonstrate that adjunctive TCM significantly enhances the antiviral efficacy of peginterferon α-2b in HBeAg-positive CHB patients while concurrently mitigating treatment-limiting myelosuppression.

When doctors analyze a medical scan of an organ or area in the body, each part of the image has to be assigned an anatomical label. If the brain is under scrutiny for instance, its different parts have to be labeled as such, pixel by pixel: cerebral cortex, brain stem, cerebellum, etc. The process, called medical image segmentation, guides diagnosis, surgery planning and research.

In the days before artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), clinicians performed this crucial yet painstaking and time-consuming task by hand, but over the past decade, U-nets ⎯ a type of AI architecture specifically designed for medical image segmentation ⎯ have been the go-to instead. However, U-nets require large amounts of data and resources to be trained.

"For large and/or 3D images, these demands are costly," said Kushal Vyas, a Rice electrical and computer engineering doctoral student and first author on a paper presented at the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Society, or MICCAI, the leading conference in the field. "In this study, we proposed MetaSeg, a completely new way of performing image segmentation."

In experiments using 2D and 3D brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, MetaSeg was shown to achieve the same segmentation performance as U-Nets while needing 90% fewer parameters ⎯ the key variables AI/ML models derive from training data and use to identify patterns and make predictions.

The study, titled "Fit Pixels, Get Labels: Meta-learned Implicit Networks for Image Segmentation," won the best paper award at MICCAI, getting recognized from a pool of over 1,000 accepted submissions.

Instead of U-Nets, MetaSeg leverages implicit neural representations ⎯ a neural network framework that has hitherto not been thought useful or explored for image segmentation."

Kushal Vyas, a Rice electrical and computer engineering doctoral student and first author

An implicit neural representation (INR) is an AI network that interprets a medical image as a mathematical formula that accounts for the signal value (color, brightness, etc.) of each and every pixel in a 2D image or every voxel in a 3D one.

While INRs offer a very detailed yet compact way to represent information, they are also highly specific, meaning they typically only work well for the single signal/image they trained on: An INR trained on a brain MRI cannot typically generalize rules about what different parts of the brain look like, so if provided with an image of a different brain, the INR would typically falter.

"INRs have been used in the computer vision and medical imaging communities for tasks such as 3D scene reconstruction and signal compression, which only require modeling one signal at a time," Vyas said. "However, it was not obvious before MetaSeg how to use them for tasks such as segmentation, which require learning patterns over many signals."

To make it useful for medical image segmentation, the researchers taught INRs to predict both the signal values and the specific segmentation labels for a given image. To do so, they used meta-learning, an AI training strategy whose literal translation is "learning to learn" that helps models rapidly adapt to new information.

"We prime the INR model parameters in such a way so that they are further optimized on an unseen image at test time, which enables the model to decode the image features into accurate labels," Vyas said.

This special training allows the INRs to not only quickly adjust themselves to match the pixels or voxels of a previously unseen medical image but to then also decode its labels, instantly predicting where the outlines for different anatomical regions should go.

"MetaSeg offers a fresh, scalable perspective to the field of medical image segmentation that has been dominated for a decade by U-Nets," said Guha Balakrishnan, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Rice and a member of the university's Ken Kennedy Institute. "Our research results promise to make medical image segmentation far more cost-effective while delivering top performance."

Balakrishnan, the corresponding author on the study, is part of a thriving ecosystem of Rice researchers at the forefront of digital health innovation, which includes the Digital Health Initiative and the joint Rice-Houston Methodist Digital Health Institute. Ashok Veeraraghavan, chair of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and professor of electrical and computer engineering and computer science at Rice, is also an author on the study.

While MetaSeg can be applied to a range of imaging contexts, its demonstrated potential to enhance brain imaging illustrates the kind of research Proposition 14 ⎯ on the ballot in Texas Nov. 4 ⎯ could help expand statewide.

Trinity Rodman, one of the scoring stars of the Olympic gold medal run in Paris last year, is returning to the U.S. women's national soccer team in time for its match at Rentschler Field Oct. 26.

Rodman, who scored three goals at the Olympics, including a game-winner in the knock-out stage against Japan, has been sidelined much of the last 15 months managing recurring back injuries. But she has returned to her pro team and was called up to the 26-player USWNT roster announced Wednesday by coach Emma Hayes.

“We are extremely excited to get back together with the team,” Hayes said, upon the roster reveal. “There has been a big gap from July until now and we've watched many club games. Now, it's time to start the build towards qualifying for the 2027 World Cup. We want to maximize every minute we have together, push the players, and keep the momentum going. These three fantastic games ahead of us will help us do that.”

From a modest beginning in CT, Patrick Agyemang is returning home a soccer sensation with USMNT



The U.S. team has three friendly matches lined up, against Portugal on Oct. 23 in Pennsylvania and again in East Hartford on Oct. 26, then vs. New Zealand in Kansas City on Oct. 29.

Stratford's Alyssa Naeher, who retired after an history-making career as America's goalkeeper, will be honored before the game at Rentschler at 4 p.m., following the U.S. men's deaf national team's friendly match against Germany, which starts at 1 p.m.

Rodman, 23, the daughter of former NBA star Dennis Rodman, turned pro in 2021, joining the Washington Spirit in 2021. She has been with the USWNT since 2022, making the 18-player roster for the Olympics.

Her back injuries kept her out until April 2025, when she scored a goal for the U.S. in a win over Brazil, and a recurrence kept her out until recently. But Rodman has five goals in 11 games since returning to the Spirit.

“When she came in in April, I think she really felt she was in a good place, but the reality was having so much adrenaline got us through that game,” Hayes told reporters on a Zoom call Wednesday. “But afterwards, that reality hit home that there were some issues in her back that were unresolved and, collectively with club and country, we took the time to say, look, we've got to get it right for the long term. And I think that club and country collaboration has really put her in the position she's in right now.”

CT's Alyssa Naeher posts third straight shutout as US women's soccer team clinches gold



Over her career, Rodman has played 47 games with USWNT, scoring 11 goals.

Hayes gave many of her European pro players a break from action during the summer, but has reassembled most of her top players for this game in East Hartford, in which she will probably have 23 active. The rest of her roster:

Forwards: Michelle Cooper, Catarina Macario, Trinity Rodman, Yazmeen Ryan, Emma Sears, Ally Sentnor, Alyssa Thompson.

Midfielders: Sam Coffey, Lindsey Heaps, Claire Hutton, Rose Lavelle, Sam Meza, Olivia Moultrie, Jaedyn Shaw, Lily Yohannes.

Defenders: Jordyn Bugg, Emily Fox, Lilly Reale, Tara McKeown, Avery Patterson, Emily Sams, Emily Sonnett, Kennedy Wesley.

Goalkeepers: Claudia Dickey, Mandy McGlynn, Phallon Tullis-Joyce.

Massachusetts Democratic leaders on Wednesday questioned, if not outright scoffed at, President Trump's threat that he could “take away” the 2026 World Cup matches scheduled to be played in Massachusetts over public safety concerns in Boston, and instead suggested the Republican should pull out a map.

“First of all, he's talking about the crime rate in Boston. The World Cup is going to be played in Foxborough, so he should check his geography before he does anything else,” Massachusetts House Speaker Ron Mariano told reporters Wednesday at the State House. 

“I don't know where the crime is high in Foxborough,” the Quincy Democrat added of the 18,000-person community 30 miles south of Boston. The crime rate dropped in the town between 2023 and 2024, data show. “So I don't know what basis he's got to make a statement like that.”

Trump said Tuesday that if he felt there were “unsafe conditions” in Boston, he would ask FIFA president Gianni Infantino to move the matches to another location.

There are currently seven matches scheduled to be played at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough next year. Eleven U.S. cities — plus others in Mexico and Canada — are under contract with FIFA to play host to the tournament, meaning Trump has no direct control over where matches are played.

Trump on Tuesday suggested that Infantino “wouldn't love” to move matches, “but he'd do it very easily.”

Trump made his comments in response to a question about the so-called “street takeovers” in Boston and several communities in Eastern Massachusetts in recent weeks. An Oct. 5 incident in Boston's South End included images of a police car being attacked and resulted in two arrests.

“We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup matches. “I love the people of Boston and I know the games are sold out. But your mayor [Michelle Wu] is not good.”

“There are worse than her,” Trump continued. “At least she's intelligent.”

Wu, speaking during an appearance Wednesday on the “Java With Jimmy” show, waved off concerns that Trump could jeopardize the state's host status for the World Cup.

She said officials have undergone months of planning and preparation to host matches in the region, including fan festivities in Boston, and that “no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it.” 

“There's no ability to take away the World Cup games,” said Wu, who is running unopposed for another term in November's election. “There's no real threat when it comes to saying cities are so unsafe that they can't host the Games.”

Massachusetts House leaders have proposed setting aside at least $10 million for costs related to hosting the 2026 World Cup matches as part of a supplemental spending bill.

State Representative Aaron Michlewitz, the chamber's budget chief and a North End Democrat, said Boston is one of the country's safest major cities and framed Trump's comments as reacting to “a video or two” showing crime in Boston.

“You can get any video to show anything at any point in time and point it out and make it out to be something that it's not,” Michlewitz said. “What does one have to do with soccer games being played in Foxborough? I don't know.”

Boston has been a regular target for the president and other top administration officials, including given the city's stance on immigration. Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox said cars and unruly crowds have been descending on intersections across the country for the past few years, and called it a “culture trend” fueled largely by social media.

Governor Maura Healey last week dismissed a question about whether she was concerned that Trump would consider deploying the National Guard in Massachusetts, as he has done in other Democrat-leaning states and cities, in light of the so-called street takeovers.

“He absolutely shouldn't,” she said. “There's no need for that here.”

Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed he could take World Cup matches away from US cities he deems “unsafe”. Here's what he said – and what powers he does and doesn't have

Which time? Tuesday was the second time Trump has threatened to take away World Cup games from US host cities on the basis of their political leadership or opposition to his policies. However, it's important to note that this suggestion of moving games is not something Trump has suggested organically, of his own volition. In both cases, the US president was responding to leading questions centered around the idea of moving games. 

On 25 September in an Oval Office event, a member of the White House press corps asked Trump about cities that have demonstrated against Trump's use of federal agencies for immigration and crime crackdowns. The reporter mentioned Seattle and San Francisco as two cities that have seen demonstrations, and pointed out that both cities are World Cup hosts (though San Francisco is not a host city, but part of the San Francisco Bay Area that will host games at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara). The reporter then asked Trump if the demonstrations could result in the loss of World Cup games from those host venues. 

“I guess, but we're going to make sure they're safe,” Trump said. “They're run by radical left lunatics and that don't know what they're doing.” 

Later Trump said that Chicago would be safe for the World Cup after he sends in federal agencies in a similar manner as Washington DC. Chicago is not a 2026 World Cup host city. 

“If any city we think is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup … we won't allow it to go to it. We'll move it around a little bit,” Trump said. 

Three weeks later, on 14 October, Trump was asked about another host city, Boston, even though the games themselves will be held in suburban Foxborough, Massachusetts. Towards the end of that day's press event, a reporter asked Trump about a recent “street takeover” in Boston that saw police officers attacked and a police car set aflame, and if the concerns raised by the incident could result in the revocation of hosting duties for next year's expanded 48-team soccer tournament. The reporter also asked if Trump would work with Michelle Wu, the Democratic mayor of Boston, to address the issue.

“We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. “Their mayor is not good … She's radical left, and they're taking over parts of Boston. That's a pretty big statement, right?”

Street takeovers, a social media-driven phenomenon that sees large crowds of people gather on city streets late at night to perform stunts in cars, have been a repeated nuisance in American cities since the Covid-19 pandemic shutdowns. Recent such gatherings have turned violent in Massachusetts, including in Boston. However, the gatherings are generally not seen as being tied to any particular political ideology, nor have they been touted as a large-scale safety concern for World Cup attendees. 

“If someone is doing a bad job, and I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni [Infantino], the head of Fifa, who is phenomenal, and say let's move it to another location,” Trump said on Tuesday. “And he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it. Very easily, he'd do it.”

Later in that same event, Trump for the first time broached the possibility of moving the 2028 Olympics from Los Angeles as well. 

“If I thought LA was not going to be prepared properly, I would move it to another location if I had to,” he said. “On that one I'd probably have to get a different kind of a permission, but we would do that.”

In short: No. At least not unilaterally. In the World Cup's case, the host city agreements are signed between Fifa, soccer's global governing body, and the local municipalities. Though the deal involves a public government, it is essentially a private business deal, and the US president does not have authority to cancel it on his own.

That said, Trump can apply pressure to the various parties to back out of the deal if he is truly committed to removing games from the cities in question. That could include withholding federal funding from the cities as he has for various other aspects of American life. It could also include an appeal to Fifa president Gianni Infantino, who has carefully cultivated a close relationship with Trump since the US president's return to office.

Theoretically, yes. We can say this with relative surety thanks to Seattle, which released the host city agreement it signed with Fifa. Within that agreement there is a clause (4.5, to be exact) that addresses the possible revocation of host city selection. The clause essentially states that by agreeing to be a World Cup host city, Seattle also agrees to do a number of different (and often expensive) things to increase public safety, including the deployment of additional security measures and transportation methods, plus the assumption of various financial liabilities.

Fifa could in theory point to that clause as reasoning for revoking Seattle's status as a World Cup host city if it feels like safety standards are woefully behind. It's hard to imagine it being all that likely, though. Any World Cup is a gigantic logistical affair, let alone one spread across three countries and 16 host cities featuring more teams than ever before. It's hard enough for Fifa to create the match schedule and oversee teams' travel. Introducing a reduction in venues, or a change in venues, or multiple of them, would be a gargantuan undertaking so close to the actual event. It's easy to assume it would be the subject of legal action on behalf of the host city as well. 

So far, it has been mostly promotional and/or threatening in nature. Trump convened a World Cup task force earlier this year headed by Andrew Giuliani, with a stated mission of “facilitat[ing] comprehensive planning, organization, and execution of the largest sporting events in the history of mankind.”

The federal government also has a role in approving visas for visitors from other countries, but processing times for those have ballooned to such a level that many fear that they won't have visas approved in time for the games themselves. 

There is also the public safety aspect. One can presume that FBI agents and potentially those from Homeland Security and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) will be dispatched to World Cup host cities with the stated intention of providing an additional layer of security on top of local police.

So far, Fifa president Gianni Infantino has said nothing publicly about Trump's threat. He did, however, find time to travel to Egypt to be alongside Trump at the Gaza summit – a curious move for someone whose role in the world is nominally about sports. 

Fifa vice-president Victor Montagliani, a Canadian, was far more direct speaking at a London conference in early October, responding to Trump's comments about Seattle and San Francisco. 

“It's Fifa's tournament, Fifa's jurisdiction, Fifa makes those decisions,” Montagliani said. “With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans. That's the beauty of our game, that it is bigger than any individual and bigger than any country.”

A Fifa spokesperson told Politico “Safety and security are of the utmost importance at all FIFA events worldwide and it is ultimately the government's responsibility to decide what's in the best interest of public safety. We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to fulfill all necessary requirements for a successful 2026 World Cup.”

Outside of Fifa, Wu responded to Trump's threat by pointing out that much of Fifa's host city agreements are “locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it.

“We're in a world where for drama, for control, for pushing the boundaries … ongoing threats … are issued to individuals and communities who refuse to back down and comply or be obedient to a hateful agenda.”

Only in cases of extreme and/or unexpected health and safety concerns, war, or other political disturbance. The 2003 Women's World Cup was the last senior-level tournament with that name to be moved – it was originally due to be held in China but was shifted to the US due to that year's Sars outbreak. 

Fifa also pulled the 2023 Under-20 World Cup from Indonesia after several members of that country's government and large sections of the populace opposed the inclusion of Israel in the tournament. Indonesia does not maintain formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has broadly supported Palestine. Indonesia later hosted that year's U-17 World Cup after Peru pulled out of hosting. 

The Olympics have been canceled due to wars or postponed a year in the case of Covid-19 and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but they have not changed host cities since 1908, when the eruption of Mount Vesuvius forced the Rome games to decamp to London.

Likely because he has made that topic a feature of his administration. It is the guise under which he has deployed the national guard, Ice, and other federal agencies to Washington DC, Chicago and other cities. The fact that safety is a genuine and justified concern at any major gathering of people – especially one as vast as the World Cup – makes it an easy line to fall back on for his administration.

That'll be the real test, won't it? When Washington has intervened in many other aspects of American life, the targeted institutions have often complied or tried to negotiate. It remains to be seen if Fifa or the IOC will take that path – if indeed Trump decides to pursue this at all.

Trump claimed Fifa president could ‘easily' move games

Wu says Trump comments are ‘targeting Boston values'

The mayor of Boston, Michelle Wu, implied the city was ready for a face-off with the US president Donald Trump over his claim he could order Fifa to remove World Cup games from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, 22 miles south-west of the city.

Wu appeared on local podcast “Java with Jimmy” on Wednesday to respond to Tuesday's criticism from the White House, which labeled the Democrat as “radical left”. Trump threatened he would make a call to the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, if Boston did not “clean up its act”.

“Much of it is locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it,” Wu said. “We're in a world where for drama, for control, for pushing the boundaries … ongoing threats … are issued to individuals and communities who refuse to back down and comply or be obedient to a hateful agenda.

“We are going to continue to be who we are and that means, unfortunately, we are going to be in a conversation in a way that is targeting Boston's values,” Wu added. “Ten toes down for Boston.”

Infantino appeared in photographs alongside Trump at the Gaza summit earlier this week. The Fifa president has also visited the Oval Office and presented World Cup and Club World Cup trophies to Trump as gifts.

On Tuesday, Trump was asked about recent disturbances in South Boston that included a police vehicle being set on fire. “If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni [Infantino] – the head of Fifa, who's phenomenal,” Trump replied.

“I would say: ‘Let's move into another location' and they would do that. He wouldn't love to do it. But he would do it very easily.” Trump also directly criticised Wu, saying: “Their mayor is not good … she's radical left, and they're taking over parts of Boston. That's a pretty big statement, right?”

Trump has made previous comments suggesting he would take up the same conversation with Infantino about moving games from Seattle and San Francisco, which are among the 16 host cities across North America.

The United States are joint hosts of the 2026 World Cup, alongside Mexico and Canada. The 48-team event is scheduled to be played from 11 June to 19 July next summer.

Donald Trump says he could call up the head of FIFA, Gianni Infantino, and he would do what he suggested.

FIFA has told Sky News the US government does have the right to determine if cities are safe for the World Cup - after Donald Trump threatened to remove the Boston area from hosting.

The US president stepped up his criticism of crime in Democrat-run cities at the White House after previously claiming California could be stripped of matches at the FIFA event next year, and at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino is a close ally of President Trump's - attending his Gaza peace summit in Egypt this week - and is not pushing back on his World Cup interventions.

In a statement to Sky News, FIFA said: "Safety and security are the top priorities at all FIFA events worldwide.

"Safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety.

"We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfill all necessary requirements."

FIFA did not directly comment on changing any of the 11 venues in the US for the expanded 48-team men's football World Cup which will see the Americans host 78 of the 104 fixtures, including the final in New Jersey.

The remaining games are in Canada and Mexico.

Boston does not have matches itself, but the home of the NFL's New England Patriots is being used by FIFA for seven matches, 30 miles away in Foxborough, Massachusetts.

President Trump said: "If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni - the head of FIFA who's phenomenal - and I would say, 'Let's move into another location,' and they would do that.

"He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily."

President Trump and Mr Infantino first encountered each other during Mr Trump's first term in office, when the US was awarded the right to host next year's tournament.

They have popped up together at summits and meetings across the world since.

The FIFA president was even among those in attendance as Mr Trump and world leaders signed the recent Israel-Gaza peace deal.

Earlier this week, President Trump slammed Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu, and said the "radical left" was taking over Boston.

He made the comments while hosting Argentine president Javier Milei.

The Trump administration has already deployed National Guard troops to Washington, Los Angeles and Memphis in what he said was a bid to clean up crime.

Driving through the Highway 99 tunnel in Seattle could be pricier during next summer's FIFA World Cup.

With traffic expected to surge when the city hosts several matches, the Washington State Transportation Commission may temporarily hike tolls for the two-mile tunnel to defray additional costs associated with the international sporting event.

Commissioners heard Tuesday that their staff are evaluating potential increases of 50 cents and $1 that would be imposed between June 1 and July 15, 2026, the period in which six World Cup contests are scheduled at Lumen Field in downtown Seattle. 

State lawmakers directed the commission to consider a temporary increase and use the money to cover added costs of managing traffic around the stadium and throughout the Puget Sound when fans flood the region in those six weeks.

Doing nothing is an option too, said Carl See, the commission deputy director. While commissioners need to keep in mind the impact of the influx of visitors, they also need to remember any increase “may have an impact on those who have no interest” in taking part in what will be a “monumental event” for the state, he told the panel.

The Pacific Northwest will host 13 World Cup matches — six in Seattle and seven in Vancouver, B.C. Conversations have been underway for months on how to avert monumental backups at the U.S.-Canada border and assist fans moving between the host cities.

About 750,000 people are anticipated to come to Washington state in the course of six weeks. In addition to matches, teams will be practicing at the University of Washington in Seattle and Gonzaga University in Spokane. There will be training locations and fan zones in the state, too.

State lawmakers earmarked roughly $24 million in the current transportation budget for World Cup-related expenses. Additional dollars were cribbed into the operating and capital budgets for security and field upgrades.

With transportation, there's $14 million for transit, including $5 million for expanding intercity bus service in the state, and another $8.25 million for operational improvements aimed at keeping people moving. 

There's $2 million for maintenance in the vicinity of the tunnel. Those dollars will come out of the tunnel toll revenue account. Lawmakers assumed that sum could be covered from a temporary toll rate increase but didn't mandate one.

Roughly 47,000 vehicles travel through the tunnel each day based on a July 2024 analysis.

Tolls vary based on time of day with higher rates in peak commute hours and lower rates on nights and weekends. They are collected in both directions as one exits the tunnel. 

Weekdays, the cost ranges from $1.25 to $1.85 per trip with a Good to Go pass. It is $1.25 on weekends. Drivers pay an extra 25 cents per trip with the Pay By Plate option, in which they register their license plate on a Good To Go! account without a pass. There is a $2 fee tacked on if you pay by mail.

What will be studied are potential increases of 50 cents per trip and $1 per trip that would be imposed at all times, including on weekends.

In December, staff will present the commission with projections of how much money might be generated from those assessments and how many drivers might choose to use local roads and Interstate 5 to avoid higher tolls.

See cautioned that he didn't want to “overpromise” what data would be delivered. If approved, this would be the first such temporary toll-rate hike, he said. Given the short six-week duration and uniqueness of the sporting event, it will be hard to model for every possible factor with precision, he said.

If the commission decides to proceed with a one-time temporary toll rate increase, it would conduct a rate-setting process including gathering public input on potential rate options.

As excitement continues to build for next year's FIFA World Cup 26, Philadelphia Soccer 2026 has announced the grand opening of its new volunteer center.

FIFA World Cup 26 will take place in June and July 2026, and is anticipated to be the largest sporting event ever, with three host countries and 16 host cities, including Philadelphia.

The volunteer center, now located at the Fashion District on 901 Market Street, will serve as a training and recruitment location for volunteers.

There is also an in-house FIFA museum in the center, where volunteers can learn more about the history of the FIFA World Cup and Philadelphia Soccer 2026's mission. 

Philadelphia Soccer 2026 is the local host committee in charge of planning and executing FIFA World Cup 26 in collaboration with the city of Philadelphia.

“With the opening of Philadelphia's FIFA World Cup 26™ Volunteer Center, we are entering an exciting new phase of preparations,” said Alison Grove, Senior Director, Strategy, Operations, and Partnerships/Volunteer Lead for Philadelphia Soccer 2026. “This space is one of the first physical touchpoints for the tournament in Philadelphia, and it's ready to welcome, train, and inspire thousands of volunteers. It's a special space for the people who will help bring the World Cup to life and show the world what makes our city so special.”

The Fashion District spans three blocks in the center of downtown Philadelphia. The area is home to several designer stores, restaurants and hotels.

The Volunteer Center will be adjacent to the Pennsylvania Convention Center and within walking distance of over 6,000 hotel rooms. Public transportation is also easily accessible from the center's location. 

“The launch of our FIFA World Cup 26™ Volunteer Center embodies Philadelphia's energy, optimism, and pride in welcoming the world,” said Michelle Singer, Co-Chair, Philadelphia Soccer 2026. “Located in the heart of the city, it showcases one of the many ways Philadelphia will make this tournament shine—creating a vibrant hub where volunteers, citizens, and visitors can come together to experience the excitement of the moment and help build an enduring legacy for the future.”

FIFA World Cup 26 is expected to have 3,000 volunteers from a diverse range of communities within Philadelphia. 

Officials said a core team of “Starting Lineup Volunteers” has already been selected and will assist with Volunteer Team Tryouts, scheduled to begin later this month.

PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- The countdown is on for the FIFA World Cup 26 in Philadelphia.

The Action Cam was on the scene as the volunteer center opened in Center City on Wednesday.

The grand opening featured the new space, and a preview of the exclusive FIFA museum.

The new building at the Fashion District Philadelphia on Market Street will be the hub for volunteer team tryouts, training, accreditation, uniform pickup and more.

Philadelphia is one of the 16 host cities for next year's FIFA World Cup in June and July.

World Cup

World Cup 2026

Countdown

 Andrew Caballero-Reynolds / AFP / Getty Images)

President Donald Trump's suggestion that he could move 2026 World Cup games out of U.S. cities he deems unsafe rippled through soccer and political circles in late September. Then he doubled down in mid-October, repeating his assertions.

The idea, previously unexplored, was first raised by a reporter at the White House and entertained by Trump. It sparked a wide range of reactions, many tinged with confusion, because the U.S. government had no official role in choosing World Cup host cities; and it does not have any explicit authority to relocate World Cup games.

Nonetheless, Trump's comments elicited responses from host city mayors and World Cup organizers. Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell ripped Trump's “ignorance,” and said in a statement: “We're working every day to make the World Cup a safe, welcoming, and fun experience.”

The following is a rundown of what else has been said and whether games could actually be moved.

Trump did not proactively make the suggestion. In fact, he initially seemed to resist it. During a press session in the Oval Office, when the reporter prefaced his question with “immigration, crime and the World Cup,” Trump interjected with a hint of humor: “That's a lot — that's a lot of questions.”

The reporter continued: “You have a number of cities that are pushing back against your immigration and deportation, as well as your crime initiatives.”

Trump interjected again: “I don't think they're very much pushing back at all.”

The reporter went on: “But some of those cities have World Cup games. Seattle, San Francisco.”

Trump cut him off yet again: “They're gonna be very secure.”

But the reporter continued: “Could those games move if they don't cooperate with your crime initiatives and your immigration initiatives?”

Trump then spoke for two minutes and 45 seconds. He began: “Well, that's an interesting suggestion. I guess. But we're gonna make sure they're safe.”

He continued on a tangent about cities who, he said, are “run by radical left lunatics that don't know what they're doing.” He spoke about Washington, D.C., which is not hosting World Cup games. He spoke about Memphis and Chicago. “It will be safe for the World Cup,” he said, despite both Memphis and Chicago also being uninvolved. (Chicago pulled out of the running for World Cup games during the bid phase, citing “FIFA's inflexibility” and taxpayer risk.)

“If I think it isn't safe, we'll move it into a different city, absolutely,” Trump said. “It's actually a very fair question. If I think it's not safe, we're going to move it out of that city.”

He then went on another tangent about JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, who has accused Trump of deploying National Guard troops to Democrat-controlled cities in an effort to exert “authoritarian” control ahead of next year's midterm elections.

Trump concluded: “If any city we think is gonna be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup … we won't allow it to go to [those cities], we'll move it around a little bit. But I hope that's not going to happen.”

When repeating his remarks in another Oval Office media session, Trump said he would call in a personal favor with FIFA president Gianni Infantino.

“If I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni — the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal — and I would say, ‘let's move it to another location,' and he would do that.” Trump said. “He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.”

The World Cup is owned and operated by FIFA, soccer's global governing body. FIFA, years ago, signed “host city agreements” and “stadium agreements” with entities in various U.S. markets, and chose 11 of them — plus three in Mexico and two in Canada — to host games.

The federal government, meanwhile, signed various declarations and guarantees when the three North American countries were bidding to host the World Cup back in 2018, during the first Trump administration. But it had no role in selecting the cities or negotiating their contracts, which were originally signed in 2017 and updated with addendums in 2022.

“The federal government is not a direct party to these agreements,” Nathan O'Malley, an attorney at Musick, Peeler & Garrett and co-leader of the firm's Olympics & World Cup practice group, told The Athletic.

Trump, therefore, cannot unilaterally cancel those contracts and move games to other cities.

The contracts, some of which have been obtained via public records requests, do require cities to implement robust security and public safety measures. If FIFA deems a city unsafe, it could, potentially, terminate the agreements and relocate matches. Trump, in theory, could pressure FIFA to do so.

But leaders in most or all 11 cities have stated their confidence in the security plans being developed.

“Public safety officials, including our Republican-appointed Police Board, are working daily to ensure the games in Kansas City are safe for all,” Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas told The Athletic in a statement via a spokeswoman. “I am confident in their work. FIFA loves Kansas City and Kansas City loves FIFA. We'll be fine.”

Trump has a direct line to FIFA's president, his “great friend” Infantino, who has publicly supported and praised Trump repeatedly. In December will bring the World Cup Draw to Washington, D.C., largely so that Trump can be involved.

Trump, in theory, could leverage this relationship and push Infantino to pull games out of cities whose mayors resist him, which is what he insinuated in his Oct. 14 remarks. It's unclear how Infantino and FIFA would respond. After the initial suggestion, FIFA did not give a statement, but in responding to a query from Politico following Trump's doubling-down, a FIFA spokesperson said, “Safety and security are of the utmost importance at all FIFA events worldwide and it is ultimately the government's responsibility to decide what's in the best interest of public safety. We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to fulfill all necessary requirements for a successful 2026 World Cup.”

Trump's other potential lever is the $625 million in security funds that Congress allocated to World Cup cities this summer. That money will be split proportionally — not equally — among the 11 U.S. host cities, depending on their needs. The cities will submit their costs and requests for reimbursement, according to Andrew Giuliani, head of the White House's World Cup task force. It's unclear if Trump, who chairs the task force, could potentially politicize and withhold some of that funding.

Trump has clashed with Democratic mayors throughout his second term over immigration policy and other topics. His latest push is on crime. After his federal takeover of D.C., he has threatened to send troops to Chicago and other cities, even as many mayors and governors say that crime is not out of control and federal assistance is not necessary or welcome.

The World Cup host cities in left-leaning states with Democratic mayors that Trump could target would include Seattle, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Boston. Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas and Kansas City are also led by Democrats. The U.S. men's national team is due to play its group games in L.A. and Seattle.

At this stage, eight-and-a-half months out from the World Cup opener, finding new host cities would be unrealistic. The 11 chosen cities have already spent years preparing for matches and adjacent events, plus the thousands of visitors they'll bring. It would be extremely difficult for a 12th city to cram all that planning into eight months. And especially after the Dec. 5 draw, relocation would anger fans and teams who've planned travel to a specific city.

Perhaps some of the 11 cities could take on additional games, if one or two cities were forced out of the rotation. But even that would be a massive disruption. FIFA set the World Cup schedule, complete with dates and locations, in 2024. It has already sold hospitality packages to specific stadiums, and is set to open ticket sales next week.

According to one person briefed on the planning efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose details, FIFA has previously told local organizers that it will not be relocating games.

The 11 U.S. cities and stadiums slated to host the 2026 World Cup are:

In Mexico, Monterrey, Guadalajara and Mexico City are the three hosts. The two in Canada are Toronto and Vancouver.

Most mayoral offices and local World Cup host committees have declined to comment or did not respond to The Athletic's inquiries. Representatives in a few cities, however, have spoken.

Harrell's words were the strongest. Seattle's mayor said in a statement published on his website: “President Trump continues to display his ignorance about our city. We are doing the hard work to prepare for this once-in-a-generation opportunity to welcome the world to Seattle.

“The facts are clear: violent crime is down 20% in Seattle. We are making record-breaking progress on police hiring with nearly 130 officers hired this year. My proposed 2026 budget also makes additional investments in safety preparations for the World Cup, including new removable vehicle barriers at Pike Place Market and Seattle Center campus.

“While we are doing our part to make safety improvements ahead of hosting games, the Trump administration has made our city less safe by withholding critical funding for counterterrorism tools. While the City's lawsuit has successfully released a portion of this funding, President Trump's words about safety don't align with his administration's actions.

“We're working every day to make the World Cup a safe, welcoming, and fun experience for both residents and visitors to our city and will continue to advance plans with local partners to ensure we make the most of this special event.”

A spokesperson for Harrell had previously told KOMO News: “While the president continues to peddle baseless, divisive, and empty threats, our administration is doing the hard work to prepare for this opportunity. We're working every day to make the 2026 World Cup a safe, welcoming, and fun experience for residents and visitors. We're advancing plans with FIFA and local partners to ensure Seattle is a destination and that we make the most of this special event.”

Hana Tadesse, a spokeswoman for the Seattle World Cup host committee, wrote in a statement to The Athletic: “We are committed to ensuring a safe, welcoming, and memorable experience for fans, players, visitors, and residents alike. Since being selected by FIFA as a host city, we've worked closely with them, the White House Task Force for FIFA World Cup 26, community partners, and law enforcement, and are confident in our planning and coordination in advance of next summer's matches. Seattle looks forward to shining on the world stage and hosting an event that is not only spectacular, but safe for all.”

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who has previously said that “Boston will not back down” from the Trump administration amid legal threats over immigration policies, initially said in response to a question about Trump's World Cup comments: “We are very excited for the summer that Boston will have next year. It's going to be an incredible show of what our city's made of as we welcome people from all over the world [for the World Cup and other events]. We are very proud, and hold ourselves to the high standards of being the safest major city in the country. And that takes work every day, but we have the record and the results to prove it.”

With Boston specifically targeted in Trump's latest threat, Wu simply said, “Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions.”

Natalie Hamilton, a spokeswoman for the New York/New Jersey host committee, wrote in a statement to The Athletic: “Formal agreements are in place between each Host City and FIFA, and we continue to work closely with FIFA and our local, state, and federal partners to ensure a safe and secure tournament, which remains our top priority. Planning for World Cup is already underway, and we are fully committed to delivering an unforgettable tournament that this country, and this region, will be proud of well beyond 2026.”

Philadelphia Soccer 2026 said in a statement to The Athletic: “We appreciate President Trump's commitment to safety and security for this global event, and we share that same commitment, as do our colleagues across the nation. Safety is paramount to the City of Philadelphia, and we have every confidence in the significant planning that is ongoing between City, State, and Federal officials as well as the White House Task Force. Just as Philadelphia was for the political conventions, Papal Visit and NFL Draft, we will be ready to welcome the world and deliver a safe, exceptional experience for fans and residents alike.”

Along with Haji Wright, who scored both goals Tuesday against Australia, Balogun has given the U.S. soccer team a desperately needed scoring threat.

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — It's one of those things that befuddles soccer's devotees as much as its critics.

The net is big and the field is vast. So why do people in the sport often say that scoring a goal is the hardest thing to do?

It surely can't be that difficult to run forward, have a teammate pass you the ball, and shoot it in.

During the last men's World Cup in 2022, U.S. fans had to spend the Monday after Thanksgiving explaining to their office colleagues why a 0-0 tie — a most un-American result — against England was one of the best games the team has ever played.

The retort was obvious: If it was that good, why didn't they score?

Three years is a long time to wait for answers. But as next year's tournament draws closer, the new American squad may have finally found them.

Haji Wright is one. He carried his strong club form with Coventry City of England's second division into Tuesday's 2-1 win over Australia, scoring both U.S. goals with style.

Ricardo Pepi is another, though he hasn't shown it for a bit. He's just back from a long injury absence that has kept him from the national team since last November. Hopefully he'll return for next month's games, including a matchup vs. Paraguay at Subaru Park.

But the biggest answer is Folarin Balogun. Two-and-a-half years since he joined the senior U.S. national team, he has officially seized the mantle for his country.

The 24-year-old Brooklyn native has scored goals in two of the Americans' four games so far this autumn, taking his career total to seven tallies in 21 national team appearances. Both numbers would likely be bigger if not for shoulder and ankle injuries over the last 12 months.

“It was a fantastic and unique journey for me to begin playing with the men's national team,” Balogun said, a journey that included being recruited to the U.S. program with all the flash of a college football team chasing a quarterback.

He delivered an early payoff with a goal in the 2023 Concacaf Nations League final, and scored twice in last year's Copa América group stage — one of the only U.S. players who wasn't a flop in the tournament.

But then came those injuries, halting his momentum and the national team's. We'll never know how much better things could have gone at this year's Nations League final four had Balogun been there.

“Last year was frustrating, being out for so long with a shoulder injury, but all I can do is just focus on the present and focus on what I can control,” Balogun said. “I've had the game[s], obviously, in the last camp [in September], and that was just important for me to be around the team again and just to reintegrate. And for me it's about building momentum, consistently being a part of the team, and being available — the most important thing for any athlete is to be available.” 

When he said that, no one thought to ask if he knew that phrase was popularized by another former New Yorker years ago. But then again, Balogun was six months from being born when Bill Parcells departed the Jets in January 2001. (Of the current U.S. squad's 26 players, only 38-year-old Tim Ream was alive when Parcells left the Giants in 1990.)

“I want to prove that to myself, prove that to the coaching staff,” Balogun said of hoping to stay healthy. “And yeah, I think once I'm on the pitch, and the longer I'm on the pitch, building confidence, good things are going to happen. It's a process, but I'm definitely happy with how it's going.”

So is manager Mauricio Pochettino.

“Well, what I like the most is that he is scoring,” he said earlier this week, a line that even soccer critics might like. “When they score is what I like the most in a striker. And then I think, his work ethic: available to drop and to play and to connect.”

As Pochettino spoke, he was interrupted by a banging noise from a nearby wall. Alas, it did not come from a chorus of those critics wishing to thank him. It was just the wind outside, flying down from the Rockies and slamming into a closed door.

“I think [there are] many things about the game, not only to score — that is what I like the most — but also it's the capacity to link with the team,” Pochettino concluded. “He's a player who can drop and play, as you see with our offensive players and midfielders, and going to the [open] space, running. [He] has a little bit of everything that I like.”

Just as significant as Balogun's form and skills are the players around him. Pochettino's 3-4-2-1 formation allows for the striker to get service in multiple ways, from the wingbacks out wide and the attacking midfielders more centrally. The ball might come through the air or on the ground, via a cross or via a threaded ball up the middle — the kind Balogun fizzed home against Japan.

“He's taken his opportunities, and that's all you can ask for [from] a No. 9,” said fellow New Yorker Tim Weah, referring to a striker's traditional jersey number. And he would know, as a former forward who now plays as one of those wingbacks for the U.S. and Italian club Juventus.

“We all know he's an amazing player and he can help us save a game,” Weah continued. “He's sticking his foot out in actions, he's running behind, fighting the defenders. … Hopefully we can feed him some more and get him some more goals.”

Nor is it a coincidence that the assist for Balogun's goal vs. Japan came from Christian Pulisic, and the one for his goal vs. Ecuador on Friday came from Malik Tillman. Their dynamism and creativity sets up Balogun to be at his best, and that's a big part of why they're now atop the attacking midfield depth chart. 

Weston McKennie can add another element, as can Alejandro Zendejas, Brenden Aaronson, or Gio Reyna if he can regain a place on the squad.

“He's always going off the back shoulder — he's really difficult to deal with, because he's always dribbling, going at players and also going in behind,” the Medford-born Aaronson said. “He's got two different [ways] that he can play: He can hold up the game, and he can also go in behind and create chances by himself. He's a really good player, and he's really good for this squad.”

Balogun appreciates how he fits in with his teammates, and with Pochettino's system.

“I feel like the manager gives us that freedom to just do what we want up there, and I think that shows in the way we play,” he said. “Everything's kind of just freestyle. But we're good enough players to figure it out, and he believes in us.”

As Balogun has grown into the U.S. team on the field, he has grown into the country off it, too. Though he was born in Brooklyn, he moved to London with his Nigerian parents after just a month. He has spent his entire professional career in Europe, only able to visit the United States for national team games and too-rare vacations.

So he makes the most of those moments when he can.

“I love being back here — especially in New York, my favorite city,” he said. “I definitely feel like I get my trips in. I would like more, and after my career I think it's somewhere I would like to live. Being in Europe, balancing that with international football, I'm not going to get as much time as I want, but I definitely feel like I do get enough time there.”

U.S. fans in Philadelphia might have to forgive Balogun next month for his choice of city. But they know as well as his team that right now, he's on the way to the greatest trip home of all.

The U.S. women's national team will be back in action after 113 days. The program will play a three-game series in October against Portugal and New Zealand, and head coach Emma Hayes has named a 26-player roster for the upcoming matches. Two of the three games will feature retirement celebrations for Alex Morgan and Alyssa Naeher as the group aims to build off their previous meeting, a 3-0 win over Canada, in July.

"We are extremely excited to get back together with the team," said Hayes. "There has been a big gap from July until now and we've watched many club games. Now, it's time to start the build towards qualifying for the 2027 World Cup. We want to maximize every minute we have together, push the players, and keep the momentum going. These three fantastic games ahead of us will help us do that."

The three game window will begin against Portugal on Oct. 23 and Oct. 26 before concluding against New Zealand on Oct. 29. The expanded roster is to help manage player minutes and match load with the upcoming NWSL playoffs set to begin in November, and Hayes will only name 23 players on matchdays.

Forward Trinity Rodman returns to the USWNT camps for the first time since April. The lengthy absence was due to a back injury, and she has since returned to play with her club, Washington Spirit. Rodman scored the game-winner in her last USWNT appearance, a 2-0 win against Brazil. Gotham FC midfielder Jaedyn Shaw also marks her return to the senior team after featuring with the U-23 team since April. 

While Hayes is narrowing down her pool of players ahead of FIFA Women's World Cup qualifiers in 2026, there are still players earning first-time callups. Second-year San Diego Wave defender Kennedy Wesley was named to the roster and could make her senior debut over the three friendlies after spending time with the U-23 program earlier this year.

The October international window will have continued training camps running alongside the senior team. The U-23 program will be in Philadelphia, and the U-20 team will be in Kansas City, concurrent with the USWNT. The dual camps are an example of the U.S. Soccer's development philosophy, the U.S. Way, which focuses on and encourages increased opportunities for youth national teams.

Also returning to the roster are several Americans who play abroad. Five players, midfielder Lindsey Heaps, defender Emily Fox, forward Catarina Macario, midfielder Lily Yohannes, and goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, were given the summer window off. Alyssa Thompson joins the roster from Chelsea FC, her first call-up since moving to Europe. Each player is currently playing in the UEFA Champions League. Fans can watch every UWCL match across CBS Sports platforms , Paramount+, CBS Sports Network , and CBS Sports Golazo Network.

Take a look at the official roster:

Goalkeepers (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 2), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 4), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United, ENG; 3)

Defenders (8): Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC; 2/0), Emily Fox (Arsenal FC, ENG; 67/1), Lilly Reale (Gotham FC; 2/0), Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit; 8/0), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash; 6/1), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride; 5/0), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC; 110/2), Kennedy Wesley (San Diego Wave; 0/0)

Midfielders (8): Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC; 38/4), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 167/38), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current; 6/1), Rose Lavelle (Gotham FC; 113/25), Sam Meza (Seattle Reign FC; 2/0), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC; 9/2), Jaedyn Shaw (Gotham FC; 26/8), Lily Yohannes (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 8/1)

Forwards (7): Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current; 8/1), Catarina Macario (Chelsea FC, ENG; 24/11), Trinity Rodman (Washington Spirit; 47/11), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston Dash; 12/2), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville; 8/1), Ally Sentnor (Kansas City Current; 12/4), Alyssa Thompson (Chelsea FC, ENG; 22/3)

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. – If there's ever been evidence that the U.S. Men's National Team is growing under head coach Mauricio Pochettino, it might be best encapsulated by the team's last three matches. 

The team is riding a three-match unbeaten streak, dating back to September. The trio of games began when the U.S. put together a resounding 2-0 win over Japan on Sept. 9 led by a technically superb volley from Alex Zendejas and a skillful second-half finish from Folarin Balogun. 

The second was the first match of the October window. When facing a surging Ecuador side that had only given up one goal in its 10 previous matches, the U.S. didn't flinch. The Americans rallied after conceding an early goal and equalized against a very strong defensive side to draw the match in Austin, Texas. 

Finally, the third was the team's latest performance against Australia on Tuesday night. Haji Wright and Cristian Roldan linked up twice to steer a massive come-from-behind win in Commerce City, Colorado and record the first comeback win in Pochettino's tenure with the USA. 

“Any time you can win against these kinds of opponents, it's a big confidence boost,” said James Sands, who started alongside Roldan in the central midfield Tuesday night. 

In all three matches, the United States showed flashes of goal-scoring and a fighting mentality. Twice, the Americans trailed – twice they fought back. And in each match, Pochettino found positives to take away. 

One of those major takeaways was the quality of the competition. 

All three opponents the United States has faced during this unbeaten run are teams that have already secured qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. These nations are among the top in their confederations. Ecuador finished second in CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifying, just after 2022 champion Argentina. Japan was the first team outside of the host nations to qualify for the 2026 tournament. Australia is a top-ranked squad in the AFC. 

Two of these teams, Ecuador and Australia, were riding double-digit unbeaten streaks heading into their matchups with the U.S. 

Given these strong resumes, the U.S. has approached these matches seriously. While the matchups are labeled as international friendlies, the U.S. has adopted a competitive mindset with only so many windows together before next summer's tournament — a message that has come from Pochettino and his coaching staff. 

“It's important to size ourselves up against these nations because we understand that we're going to be competing against these guys at the World Cup,” Roldan said. “It's really important these last two windows, and hopefully our next window, we can show a little progress and confidence after some of these good performances.” 

Pochettino has been reiterating the importance of progress this year in the lead-up to the World Cup. He's still learning things about his team – following both matches in the October window, the manager was positive but expressed that there are details the team needs to iron out. He's still putting different combinations of players on the pitch. For example, against Australia he made six changes to the starting lineup from the Ecuador match. Pochettino is also observing players in different situations and seeing which connections are fruitful – like Wright and Roldan on Tuesday night. 

“It does wonders,” Wright said of the confidence this win gives them. “We're playing against quality opposition now, so we're gearing up for the final test before the World Cup starts, and we're happy with a win today.” 

The U.S. has been progressing in this build-up which is starting to dwindle as the World Cup draws nearer. Even going back to earlier this summer with the USMNT's Concacaf Gold Cup run, which featured 14 players on this October roster, progress was made. Under Pochettino, the team gave up just one goal in the group stage and advanced all the way to the final. Players emerged in that tournament like Matt Freese, who made his debut this summer and has gone on to become a valued piece in the goalkeeping room. The 24-year-old goalkeeper has started 10 straight matches for the USMNT, including Tuesday's win. 

“It's important to start building confidence, but it's also very important to continue to improve and trust in the process,” Freese said. “As each result comes, we want to be putting together results, but we also want to be putting together performances. Over the long run, that leads to more successes. As we lead into the World Cup next summer, these friendlies are not so friendly. It becomes about getting a result and showing that next summer when the whistle blows, we're there to get a win.” 

The October window closed on a high note for the group, and November is just around the corner. The United States will have a chance to extend its current unbeaten run against two more World Cup-bound nations: Paraguay and Uruguay. 

The goal for that window, as center back Chris Richards put it, is to "keep stacking them up." 

“It gives us confidence knowing that we are not even close to being 100 percent,” Richards said. “That's probably the biggest takeaway from these two games we've had is that we still have so much more to grow and so much more potential – it's kind of untapped right now. It's a process. It's a journey. I know by the World Cup next summer, we'll be ready for it.”

Juventus have rejected multiple bids for midfielder Khephren Thuram from Premier League clubs including Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool over the past six months. The club, who signed Thuram in the summer of 2024, have no plans to let him go and have deemed both he and attacking star Kenan Yildiz as untouchable players.

FIFA has issued a statement after US President Donald Trump threatened to change the host cities for next summer's World Cup.

The tournament will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada, with the final set to take place at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on July 19.

However, despite the competition being just nine months away, Trump has warned that he could intervene and change the host cities.

He claims he could contact FIFA President Gianni Infantino to pressure Democrat-run cities to take a tougher stance on crime.

At a cabinet meeting on Sunday, he said: “If somebody is doing a bad job and I feel there are unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location.'

"He wouldn't love to do it, but he would do it very easily.”

In response, a FIFA spokesperson told POLITICO: “Safety and security are of the utmost importance at all FIFA events worldwide.

"And it is ultimately the government's responsibility to decide what's in the best interest of public safety.

"We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to fulfill all necessary requirements for a successful 2026 World Cup.”

The United States are set to host two of the world's biggest sporting events in the coming years.

After next summer's World Cup, Los Angeles will stage the Summer Olympics in 2028.

Trump's latest comments are now the second time he has threatened to change World Cup venues.

City officials have since spoken out against Trump, stressing that they have spent several years preparing to host matches.

Lisa Gillmor, the mayor of Santa Clara, California, said: “Any suggestion that Santa Clara is unsafe is simply not based in fact.

"We have been preparing for these games for nearly 3 years, and we will be proud to welcome the world to Santa Clara for the World Cup next year."

Another official from a host city added that the agreements over which locations would stage matches were finalised back in 2017 and 2018.

The controversy is just the latest difficulty ahead of the World Cup.

Fans have already hit out at the prices, with the cheapest seats for the final starting out at $2,030 (£1,510), and the most expensive reaching $6,000 (£4,462).

FIFA has also adopted a 'dynamic pricing' system for the tournament, allowing ticket prices to rise sharply in response to higher demand.

And weather conditions could also pose a logistical challenge, with extreme heat likely to force later kick-off times.

Where do you even begin when talking about a legendary career like the one Angel City FC and USWNT superstar forward Christen Press has had? Today was the day plenty of women's soccer fans likely saw coming, but were absolutely looking to avoid. Even now, if you listen hard enough, you can probably hear a swelling of ‘la-la-la-la-la-‘ with hands over ears, hoping that if they don't hear the words, then it can't make it true. Unfortunately for the game, it is true, as Christen Press has announced her retirement from soccer, with these final two games in the NWSL 2025 season, being her last.

Thank you, Christen 🖤

“It's hard to find the words to say goodbye to a sport that has defined my life for over three decades. Football has given me everything, and I will miss being on the pitch so very much. Thank you to my family, friends, teammates, coaches, and community for this beautiful ride. I promise we will continue to reimagine sports in this next life!!” shared Christen Press as she reflected on her retirement.

In a statement, Angel City FC CEO and Co-Founder Julie Uhrman said “Christen retires as one of the most decorated and respected forwards in U.S. soccer history, a pioneer whose legacy is woven into the very fabric of our club. As Angel City's first signing, Christen's contributions to the club have been unparalleled. From her extraordinary skill and relentless competitiveness on the pitch to her unwavering commitment to making the game and our community more equitable, inclusive, and impactful. On behalf of everyone at Angel City, we thank Christen for everything she has given to the sport, our club, and future generations of athletes and fans.”

Christen Press wraps up her career as not only one of the best players this sport has ever seen, but as one of the most influential off the pitch that this sport has had the honor of knowing. She finishes as one of the leading scorers in USWNT history, netting 64 goals in her 155 International caps. She played a critical role in helping the National Team win back-to-back World Cup titles (2015 and 2019) as well as helping secure Olympic Bronze in the 2021 Olympic Games.

Then there's the domestic list of achievements. Press is a Hermann Trophy winner from her time at Stanford University, where she set multiple scoring records. She has played in four different leagues, WPS, NWSL, FA WSL, and Sweden's Damallsvenskan. She won the Golden Boot in Sweden as a member of Tyresö FF, scoring 25 goals in 26 appearances that season. In the WSL she featured in 14 matches for Manchester United where she scored four goals, but most will know her for her time in the NWSL, where she has played for Chicago Stars, Utah Royals, and most recently her hometown team Angel City FC, where she became the club's first signing back in 2022, acting as an ambassador for the club's mission of equity and inclusion. She has scored 49 regular-season goals across her 122 NWSL appearances.

Beyond her on-field achievements, Press has been a driving force in athlete advocacy and the evolution of women's sports. Through her company RE—INC, she has championed athlete ownership, creative expression, and social progress, continuing to shape the landscape of sport long after the final whistle. Which is what makes this announcement such a bittersweet moment. For so many women's soccer fans, she was the entry point. A creative, technically precise, high work-rate forward who made the game look easy at times. Exuding confident and kindness, Press has been the type of player even the most casual of ball knowers have heard about. Her impact on this sport will last for generations, and she retires as one of the most decorated and respected USWNT players. With just one last home match remaining in the 2025 NWSL season, expect the Los Angeles soccer legend to make it a day to remember, with what will likely be a packed BMO full of fans, family, friends, admirers and those who gained inspiration from Press all showing up to say their goodbyes, and thank her for the honor of being able to watch her approach this game not just with immense talent and ability, but with incredible dignity and strength.

After a remarkable career that includes two FIFA Women's World Cup titles and recognition across multiple club leagues, U.S. women's national team and Angel City FC forward Christen Press has announced she will retire following the conclusion of the NWSL season. 

"It's hard to find the words to say goodbye to a sport that has defined my life for over three decades. Football has given me everything, and I will miss being on the pitch so very much. Thank you to my family, friends, teammates, coaches, and community for this beautiful ride. I promise we will continue to reimagine sports in this next life," Press said in a statement.

The long-time attacker, known for her iconic cut-backs and clinical finishing, leaves a profound impact on and off the field. As she closes her playing career with Angel City FC, the 36-year-old closes a chapter on an influential tenure in women's soccer. The California native built the beginning of her career at Stanford University and broke school records.

She became the all-time leading scorer with 71 goals, while also setting new benchmarks for career points (183), assists (41), and shots (500). She left the University as a Mac Hermann trophy winner and two-time runner-up at the NCAA Women's College Cup.

Press is part of a larger group of players who helped domestic league soccer grow in the United States. She was part of Magicjack in the WPS and was named 2011 Rookie of the Year. After the league folded, Press was among a wave of U.S. players who continued their club careers in Europe, and played in Sweden with Goteborg FC and Tyreso FF where she became the first American to win the Damallsvenskan Golden Boot (2013) and scored 25 goals in 26 games for Tyreso.

As the NWSL launched, Press returned to the states in 2014 to play in the new American league. She became the Chicago Red Stars' leading goal scorer with goals (35) during her time with the club. She later joined Utah Royals FC in 2018 after a brief return in Sweden, and also played in England's Women's Super League with Manchester United in 2021 before returning to her hometown, Los Angeles, and became Angel City's first player signing. 

The success across club performances led to titles at the international level. Press leaves the U.S. women's national team with 155 appearances and 64 goals, while being a key member of the USWNT's iconic era, winning back-to-back World Cups in 2015 and 2019, and a 2020 Olympic bronze medal. She was an integral part of the USWNT's legal battle against U.S. Soccer for equal pay.

Her impact had a ripple effect on and off the pitch and forever changed women's soccer in the United States when she came forward alongside former teammates and anonymous sources with her early experiences in NWSL. She discussed her time in Chicago and the conditions of a toxic workplace and abusive environment. The reporting led to more investigations into player wellness across women's American soccer, including the Sally Yates report and the NWSL and NWSL Players Association joint investigation report. 

Press' legacy will continue through advocacy, entrepreneurship, media, and philanthropy. She's been a long-time global ambassador and board Member for Grassroot Soccer, an adolescent health organization that uses soccer as a tool to educate and inspire youth in developing countries.

In 2019, she launched RE-INC, a gender-neutral lifestyle brand that aims to reimagine the status quo and create a more inclusive landscape in sports media. The RE-CAP Show she hosts alongside her wife, Tobin Heath, has become a platform to center female athletes and champion inclusivity. She's been vocal about the importance of visibility and respect for LGBTQ and Black players and communities. 

Her final season with Angel City has been a powerful comeback story. Press returned in 2024 following a grueling two-year journey that included four surgeries after tearing her ACL in 2022. She scored her first home goal since her injury in May 2025.

Press's career is an inspiring story of a great goalscorer who ultimately became a builder of greater things. As she savors her final moments on the field, she leaves the game in a far better position than she inherited. She'll be remembered not only for the records she broke or titles she won, but for the many she inspired along the way and the barriers she helped tear down.

The penultimate international break of 2025 may have robbed us all of club football action, but it at least made the 2026 World Cup picture a little clearer.

England, Egypt, Algeria, Ghana, South Africa, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Cape Verde punched their tickets for the showpiece event in North America in October, with the latter set to make its first appearance at the global football tournament. 

That brings the confirmed party guests up to 28 nations, with another set of fixtures in November expected to yield a few more RSVPs.

While FIFA's official world rankings provide a useful gauge of where each country stands in the international game, it doesn't exactly account for nuance. 

That's where we come in. Read on for the latest power ranking of the top 20 men's international football teams. 

20. Ivory Coast

FIFA ranking: 44

B/R September ranking: New entry

After dropping out of B/R's international power ranking in September, having landed in 20th in March's edition, the Ivory Coast is back.

While fellow World Cup qualifiers from Africa might be higher in FIFA's ranking—Algeria (38th), Egypt (35th), Senegal (18th)—the Elephants are the reigning Africa Cup of Nations champions, which gives them an edge in this context. 

Ivory Coast just pipped Gabon to the top of qualifying Group F courtesy of a 7-0 win over Seychelles and a 3-0 victory against Kenya in October. 

With that, the Elephants return to the World Cup after last appearing in 2014. In North America, they will be hoping to progress from the group stages for the first time in their history. 

19. Ecuador 

FIFA ranking: 24

B/R September ranking: 16

After landing as high as 11th in B/R's world football rankings in March, Ecuador has been gradually slipping away.

That high spot was as a result of incredible form in CONMEBOL qualifying, in which La Tri finished second. 

While Ecuador can be proud of that placement, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was helped by the underperformance of other South American nations.

In fact, while La Tri are undefeated in their last seven games, they have only won one, albeit an impressive 1-0 victory over Argentina. 

Momentum seems to be flagging a bit, and that's reflected in their drop in power ranking.

18. USA

FIFA ranking: 16

B/R September ranking: 18

In 10 games since the start of the Gold Cup on June 15, the United States has lost just two matches.

That might be an overly optimistic way of looking at the team's run of results, but it still reads well, and it includes games played in a tournament setting. 

The Stars and Stripes finished the October break with a draw against Ecuador and a victory against Australia, two teams that will also be playing in next summer's tournament. 

With Ecuador finishing second in CONMEBOL qualification ahead of Brazil, Uruguay, and Colombia, that 1-1 stalemate doesn't look as problematic either.

It's not exactly Earth-shaking form, but the Stars and Stripes are starting to look solid while approaching their co-hosting duties.

17. Japan

FIFA ranking: 19

B/R September ranking: 19

Japan has been disappointing since sealing World Cup qualification in March, with just two wins in six matches from June onwards.

However, on Tuesday, the Samurai Blue came back from 2-0 down to secure a 3-2 friendly win over Brazil.

Of course, it's easy to point to that result coming in an essentially meaningless game, but it demonstrates the team's resilience, and Brazil still put out a strong XI. 

For Japan, it's now about fine-tuning ahead of the World Cup in June, and more results like the one against the Seleçao Canarinho will set it up nicely for North America. 

16. Uruguay 

FIFA ranking: 15

B/R September ranking: 15

Uruguay has demonstrated a notable level of consistency in the last two international breaks, going undefeated in four games and winning three.

For a squad that was criticized for being frustrating in September's B/R rankings, that's a notable improvement.

However, with teams surrounding Uruguay performing at a similar level in the last few months, and the level of competition it faced not as strong—Peru (48th), Chile (57th), Dominican Republic (142nd), and Uzbekistan (54th)—it falls a place to 16th.

Friendly matches are an opportunity to rotate and test tactics, so underperforming is to be expected. Still, if La Celeste wants to establish a dark horse reputation for themselves heading into the tournament, like they have in years past, they will need some better results.

15. Norway

FIFA ranking: 31

B/R September ranking: 17

Norway stormed into September's B/R power rankings, and it looks intent on staying there on the way to its first World Cup appearance since 1998.

Largely thanks to the most deadly striker on the planet, Erling Haaland, the Scandinavians are at the top of qualifying Group I with a staggering goal haul of 29, seven more than the next top-scoring team, the Netherlands. The 25-year-old is responsible for 41 percent of them. 

As long as Haaland is around, Norway is a potent threat. Despite having the lowest FIFA ranking of any team listed here, they should not be underestimated. Rather, Norway should be feared. 

However, that reliance on Haaland was demonstrated in his absence on Tuesday. Without the Manchester City striker, Norway could only manage a 1-1 draw with New Zealand. 

Manager Ståle Solbakken will be frantically placing an order for bubble wrap. 

14. Belgium

FIFA ranking: 8

B/R September ranking: 13

Manager Rudi Garcia has brought a spark back to the Belgian men's national team. 

The Frenchman has guided the Red Devils to five wins in eight matches in charge, and they sit on top of World Cup qualifying Group J with a game in hand over North Macedonia.

Now, it looks certain Belgium will be heading to the World Cup, and the squad will be full of confidence after scoring 20 in the last five games

Despite North Macedonia playing at a standard well above their 63rd-place FIFA world ranking, the fact that the Red Devils couldn't crack them over two qualifying games—including a 0-0 draw in October—will be a mild concern. 

13. Italy

FIFA Ranking: 10

B/R September Ranking: 14

With two matches to go, Italy is still trailing Norway in qualification Group I. That means a trip through the playoffs is the most likely scenario to seal their spot in the global soccer showcase.

The Azzurri will surely fancy their chances should it come to that, but it's an extra layer of jeopardy they would undoubtedly rather not have to deal with. 

Italy has not qualified for a World Cup since the 2014 edition in Brazil, and being on the outside looking in once again will surely be too much to bear for the nation's football-mad fans.

Thankfully, Italy is on a good run of form, picking up five consecutive wins and scoring 18 in the process.

12. Mexico

FIFA ranking: 14

B/R September ranking: 10

Mexico is having a serious Gold Cup hangover. No wins in four games since lifting the trophy is a hugely disappointing run, with their co-hosting duties approaching.

Among those results was a crushing 4-0 home loss to Colombia in October. While the friendly fixture provided an opportunity to test potential options before the nation opens its doors in June, the nature of the defeat will dampen what would otherwise be jubilant preparations. 

While still the most promising among the host nations in terms of possible success, Mexico needs to turn things around with a little over six months to go.

11. Colombia

FIFA ranking: 13

B/R September ranking: 11

After no wins in six from November 2024 to the end of August 2025, some alarm bells were sounding for Colombia.

However, World Cup qualification was sealed in September, and Los Cafeteros have now won three of their last four while scoring 13 in the process.

James Rodriguez is still performing international miracles at the age of 34, scoring once and providing four assists in those fixtures. 

Meanwhile, Luis Diaz's hot start to life with Bayern Munich will give the South Americans even more hope for a long stay in the neighboring northern continent.

10. Croatia

FIFA ranking: 9 

B/R September ranking: 12

Croatia keeps plugging away, picking up decent results to keep them top of UEFA qualification Group L.

An away draw with Czechia in their most difficult remaining game of the qualifying stage would have been greeted positively, although the bafflingly brilliant form of the Faroe Islands will at least give the Vatreni cause for concern in their penultimate qualifying fixture.

While only three points separate Croatia from Czechia in second, the former has a game in hand, which at least provides some margin for error on the road to the World Cup.

9. Brazil

FIFA ranking: 6

B/R September ranking: 6

Consistency is an increasing concern for Brazil. Granted, that's difficult to achieve on the international stage, given issues with establishing chemistry and the difficulty of squeezing a raft of talent into XI spots.

However, for a team of Brazil's enviable selection options and a manager of Carlo Ancelotti's caliber, things don't look so promising ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

In six games in charge, the Italian has only managed to guide the Seleçao Canarinho to three wins. That includes a 1-0 loss to 77th-ranked Bolivia and a 3-2 collapse against Japan when they were 2-0 up.

There's a lot of work to do between now and June if Brazil wants to reestablish its previously feared reputation.

8. Morocco

FIFA ranking: 11

B/R September ranking: 9

By rights, Morocco should be much higher in the international power rankings.

Outside of the African Nations Championship—a tournament that European-based players don't participate in—the Atlas Lions have lost just once since January 2024.

However, the strength of opponents has to be factored in, with Morocco not often tested by low-ranked African nations. 

That's still a remarkable streak, though, and one that shouldn't be taken lightly. Victories breed victories, after all. 

With Achraf Hakimi in the form of his life, fresh off being ranked the sixth-best player in the world at the 2025 Ballon d'Or awards, he'll be a driving force as captain in North America.

7. Germany

FIFA ranking: 12

B/R September ranking: 8 

After a woeful run of form that saw Germany go winless in four matches from late March to early September (including three defeats), things are looking up for the Die Nationalelf.

With World Cup qualification looking in peril after a shocking opening-game loss to Slovakia, Germany has rattled off three consecutive wins to top Group A on goal difference.

That sets them up nicely heading into November's crucial qualifying games, where Slovakia will be waiting in the final, likely decisive matchup.

Still, just eight goals scored in four qualifying games will be troubling, especially since half of those came in a 4-0 victory over 96th ranked Luxembourg.

6. Netherlands

FIFA ranking: 7

B/R September ranking: 7

The Netherlands just loves scoring goals.

In the last three games, the Oranje have smashed in 11, conceding just two in the process. Take it back a little further, and the Netherlands has 20 goals in its last five games, with only three conceded. In October, the Dutch defense didn't surrender a goal.

For a nation that always seems to have an enviable collection of stars, the Netherlands has never won a World Cup final, despite reaching the tournament's climactic game three times.

With manager Ronald Koeman finding the secret to international scoring success while maintaining a stingy back line, the Oranje might again manage a deep tournament run.

FIFA ranking: 2

B/R September ranking: 4

France had the chance to seal 2026 World Cup qualification with a win on Monday.

While Ukraine ensured that wouldn't be possible after notching a 2-1 victory over Azerbaijan, France didn't hold up its end of the bargain, either.

Les Bleus stumbled to a 2-2 draw against world No. 74 Iceland, meaning they will have to wait until November to find out if they should buy some plane tickets to North America. 

A 3-0 win over Azerbaijan at least made October's international slate a little less concerning. However, manager Didier Deschamps might come under scrutiny for his tactics and team selection in the subsequent stalemate, when a win could have eased the pressure on his side significantly.

FIFA ranking: 5

B/R September ranking: 3

Portugal has been living a little dangerously, needing a late goal in two of its last three World Cup qualifying games to seal victory and conceding a late equalizer on Tuesday. 

If not for Dominik Szoboszlai's strike, A Seleçao would have confirmed their spot in the 2026 World Cup. However, they will now have to wait until November.

In addition to that disappointment, Portugal slips in the B/R power rankings because its results simply aren't convincing at the moment. 

While Cristiano Ronaldo found the goal (and then another) that took him to the top of the all-time World Cup qualifying top scorer list, his remarkable exploits are not enough on their own for Portugal to rely on.

FIFA ranking: 3

B/R September ranking: 2

After dropping from first to second in September's B/R power ranking, Argentina's descent continues as it lands in third. 

Although qualification for the World Cup had already been secured at that point, it succumbed to a 1-0 defeat against Ecuador in September. The 1-0 victory over 49th-ranked Venezuela that followed in October wasn't entirely convincing.

La Albiceleste did secure a 6-0 win against Puerto Rico on Tuesday, but beating the 155th-ranked team isn't much to be pleased about. 

Following a disappointing defeat in Ecuador and with little else to boast about from their recent outings, Argentina has slipped after more impressive results from another nation. 

FIFA ranking: 4

B/R September ranking: 5

England has steamed into second with the Thomas Tuchel train hitting full speed. 

A 3-0 friendly victory over Wales without Harry Kane was a welcome result for U.K. bragging rights, but the 5-0 win over Latvia was significantly more important.

With that, the Three Lions will have the opportunity to end 60 years of hurt in Canada, Mexico, and the United States, with World Cup 2026 qualification sealed.

England is the only European nation to confirm a berth in the competition so far, doing so with six wins from six in Group K and no goals conceded.

Tuchel's tenure started with a concerning lack of goals, but the German has well and truly opened the attacking floodgates. That's 13 goals in the last three games, with Kane providing just three of them. 

For a team that has been so reliant on its talismanic No. 9 for the better part of a decade, that's a really promising sign. 

Tuchel has been ruthless in his selection, relying on players who are showing their best form rather than counting on reputation, and it's paying off.

FIFA ranking: 1

B/R September ranking: 1

Spain simply looks unshakable at the top of B/R's international football rankings.

FIFA apparently agrees, having put the country at the summit of its own ranking list in September's update. 

If you ignore the penalty-shootout loss to Portugal in the Nations League final, La Furia Roja haven't been defeated since a March 2024 friendly against Colombia, in which usual starters were rested.

In October, Spain brushed aside Georgia and put four past Bulgaria with no reply, putting it comfortably atop Group E and within touching distance of automatic World Cup qualification. 

With inconsistencies from many of the typically favored nations, Spain must be considered the favorite when the action starts in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.

President Donald Trump said he may call FIFA's president to suggest World Cup games be moved out of Boston if he believes there are safety concerns in the city.

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu responded after President Donald Trump threatened to pull FIFA World Cup games out of the city next year. 

"Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions," she said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.

Boston is currently set to host seven matches when the World Cup comes to North America next summer. The slate includes five group-stage games, one Round of 32 fixture and the first quarterfinal on July 9.

Trump made the suggestion that he would have games moved out of Boston while speaking to reporters on Tuesday while discussing an incident that happened in the city this week when a group of people took over one of the city's streets in a violent display. 

According to the Boston Police Department, over 100 people were involved in the takeover that involved street racing just after 2 a.m. on Oct. 5. Officers found people trying to attack police cruisers with fireworks, cones, poles and other items. One police cruiser was destroyed by flames and needed to be towed away from the area, officials said.

"We can take them away. I love the people of Boston. And I know the games are sold out, but the mayor is not good. There are worse than her. At least she's intelligent. You know, some are extremely low IQ. Those bother me more. She's intelligent, but she's radical left," Trump said. 

Trump added he would call FIFA President Gianni Infantino to have the games moved.

"The answer is yes, if somebody's doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location,' and he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it, very easily he'd do it. And this is the right time to do it." 

Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey addressed the violent incident in Boston on Tuesday.

"I'm committed to doing everything I can to get after this issue," Healey said. "That's my message today: No more.

"Not going to happen here. And if you do it, you're going to be punished. I'm serious."

President Donald Trump says he has the authority to "take away" 2026 World Cup soccer matches scheduled in Boston if he feels the city is unsafe.

Suggesting that parts of Boston had been "taken over" by recent unrest, Trump criticized mayor Michelle Wu and said on Tuesday, Oct. 14, that Boston – which is set to stage seven matches at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough during next summer's tournament – could have its games relocated with a phone call to FIFA president Gianni Infantino.

"If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who's phenomenal – and I would say, ‘Let's move into another location,' and they would do that," Trump said. "He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily."

Trump's remarks came during a White House appearance with Argentine President Javier Milei, days after Boston police reported multiple arrests tied to a late-night street gathering that turned violent. 

Boston was one of 11 U.S. cities, along with three in Mexico and two in Canada, selected three years ago to host matches for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Making changes to plans already in place just eight months before the tournament kicks off June 11 would create severe logistical hurdles.

"We could take them away," Trump said. "I love the people of Boston, and I know the games are sold out. But your mayor is not good."

Wu's office issued a statement that read: "Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions."

Trump also suggested that he would consider moving the 2028 Summer Olympics out of Los Angeles for similar reasons.

"If I thought L.A. was not going to be prepared properly, I would move it to another location if I had to."

At 36, Press has cemented her legacy as one of U.S. soccer's all-time greats.

Christen Press, one of the most celebrated players in U.S. women's soccer history, is officially hanging up her cleats.

At 36, the two-time World Cup champion and Angel City FC forward announced her retirement from professional soccer, sharing the emotional news in an interview with "Good Morning America" that aired Wednesday.

"I'm retiring from professional soccer, and I've decided that this is my last season and my last few games," Press said. "I feel a mix of everything. There's yes, there's relief, there's joy, there's excitement, there's fear, there's so much grief. I have so much grief, a part of me, a piece of me, I'm losing her."

Over the course of her remarkable career, Press earned 155 caps and scored 64 goals for the U.S. Women's National Team, helping lead the squad to two FIFA Women's World Cup titles.

Known for her speed, technical precision and calm under pressure, Press became a defining figure of the USWNT's golden era.

Her influence extended well beyond the field. As a trailblazer for equity in women's sports and a founding member of Angel City FC, Press helped shape the next generation of women's soccer in Los Angeles.

Three years ago, Press suffered a devastating knee injury that sidelined her for more than a year.

Despite a determined comeback and return to the pitch last season, she said her decision to retire came from wanting to choose her moment, not have it chosen for her.

"I thought I would wait until I didn't want to play anymore," she explained. "But I realized that time's never going to come and I can play, and my body can keep going. And I think it was really important for me to make this decision for myself before that became a different reality."

Press will play her final Angel City home game this Sunday, fittingly, not far from where her journey first began.

Soccer, Press added, has always been a family affair.

Her father, a former college football player, was the first to spark her love for the game.

"He had three girls, and so this is how he connected to us," she shared. "And I think because of that, it became so important to my mom to have that connection between my dad and I."

But it was her mother, Stacy, who became her source of strength during the most difficult moments of her career.

In 2018, as her mother battled brain cancer, Press didn't want to leave her side until her mom insisted she rejoin the national team. That same week, she scored a game-winning goal against Spain.

"My dad was upstairs watching the game on his iPad, and he ran downstairs to my mom to show her the goal," she recalled. "And my dad told me that my mom took his hand and she smiled and she actually passed away that night. And I think in some ways it gave her a little peace."

Press's next chapter will be one of partnership -- both in life and in passion.

Earlier this year, she and former teammate and longtime partner Tobin Heath revealed that they are married, after quietly tying the knot years earlier.

"There was a time where a lot was off limits and Tobin and I's approach was wanting to keep our relationship sacred and out of the public eye," she said. "We actually have been married long before this year. And you know, my manager, my family [were] just as surprised as you were, but everyone knew that I was in [a] committed relationship."

Together, the couple co-founded a media company and co-host The RE-CAP Show podcast, where they talk candidly about life, love, and the game that brought them together.

"It's authentic, because it is just the same conversations we often are having here at the house," she said.

Heath retired from soccer earlier this year, and Press admitted that her wife's decision influenced her own.

"She would absolutely hate me saying this, but a lot," she said. "I think it is time for my family to move on to our next chapter, we're going to be a part of this game forever, but it's time for it to look different for us."

As she is about to step off the field for the last time, Press said she feels grateful for her career, her family, and the city that raised her.

"I get to leave this game with a family, a dog, a wife, a house in the city that I grew up in that I love, and that feels like a really soft landing," she said.

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — It has certainly been a journey to this point, but coming out of Tuesday night's 2-1 win over Australia, it is beginning to feel like we have an idea of the players U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino trusts.

That's not to say that this roster is set in stone. Not even close. That would be antithetical to everything Pochettino and his staff have tried to build into the ethos of this group. He wants no one to feel as if anything is guaranteed. But if we look at the last two international windows, certain players have started to work themselves into a better position to be a part of the 2026 World Cup team.

And it's not just the stars that we have long expected to be there.

Yes, some of the regulars of the 2022 cycle are still a big part of this pool's best 26 players: Christian Pulisic, Tim Weah, Antonee Robinson, Sergiño Dest, Tim Ream and Chris Richards are unsurprisingly featured players when available. And while Weston McKennie hadn't been in camp since March, the Juventus midfielder clearly showed his quality in this window and brings important elements to the U.S. team.

But Pochettino's top-to-bottom search of the pool has also led to some new — and not so new — names emerging into the picture.

Cristian Roldan, a glue guy on the 2022 World Cup squad, had two assists on Tuesday and Pochettino levied the ultimate compliment to the Seattle Sounders midfielder: “If you want to build your perfect player, he has a little bit of everything,” he said.

Matt Freese got his first cap from Pochettino on June 7. Now he looks to have a path to being the No. 1 next summer, if he can hold off veteran Matt Turner and a swell of goalkeepers trying to break in.

Malik Tillman, one of the final cuts from the 2022 World Cup squad, has evolved into a potential starter next summer.

Max Arfsten, the Columbus Crew wingback, and Alex Freeman, the 21-year-old Orlando City right back, have become regulars (and saw their value increase as the system moved to use wingbacks more regularly), as has Real Salt Lake midfielder Diego Luna.

Lyon midfielder Tanner Tessmann, who last played in March, was back in camp and made a positive impression to force his way into the conversation, too.

This team is by no means a finished product. There was plenty to improve on from the win over Australia. The team lacked energy for the first 30 minutes and gave up a sloppy goal – the second time conceding first and within the opening 25 minutes in a matter of days. But this October window did start to feel like forward momentum toward the World Cup.

Not many would have predicted that after a comprehensive defeat to South Korea last month. But a positive result against a heavily-rotated Japan squad started to give some confidence. The performance against Ecuador last Friday — albeit in a draw — added to it. And Tuesday's win gives the U.S. a chance to lean further into that feeling.

“People say (friendlies) don't mean anything,” U.S. center back Chris Richards said. “But for us, it means everything. Going into a World Cup, we want to win as many games as possible.”

We still have not seen Pochettino's nominal best XI on the field at the same time. Some of that is due to the reality of a national team. You're rarely going to have all of your best players available at the same time.

It's why Pochettino, with no games of consequence on the docket and no World Cup qualification at stake, has insisted that it's more important to see as many players as he can, and to assess chemistry up and down the pool rather than prioritizing on-field chemistry. He conceded that relationships on the field are “really important,” but also insisted that “we still have time to decide” and to build that chemistry.

“We still (have a) long time to the World Cup,” Pochettino said, though there are just four first-choice friendlies left until pre-World Cup camp next June. “And I think we can assess (the group), and it's open. It's open for every single USA player that is playing here or outside of this country. … The thing that is important (is) they need to feel the confidence and trust (from) us. And when they come, it is because we are going to provide the possibility to play and show (their) quality.

“When you need to decide the 26 players next summer, (you want) to be sure that you know which type of profile, of characteristics you need. Because not only do you need good players, but also you need good teammates, good people, people that can put the interest of our national team (higher) than their own interests.”

November will bring two more good tests. World Cup-bound Paraguay and Uruguay both finished CONMEBOL qualifying with 28 points — Uruguay placed fourth, Paraguay sixth. Those games carry a ton of weight now, not just to carry forward the momentum, but to allow for positivity and optimism to be the narrative around the team ahead of a four-month break before friendlies in March.

After a year of trying to decipher where exactly this group was going, and who exactly would be on the team, it would be a welcome opportunity to lean into even a fraction of the excitement that once existed around the potential of this program.

Or, as Pochettino said, to believe that “the seed” his staff planted is starting to blossom.

“Sometimes [it] is difficult to explain how that magic happens,” Pochettino said of a team starting to come together and believe — to have the capacity to come from behind against an Australia team that was unbeaten in its previous 12 games. “But this is about to work every day, every time that we work together, is to put the seed and start to be very consistent in our decision, in the way that we communicate and in how the message arrives to the team, to the staff, to everyone.

“And I think when that starts to grow inside the team, that is why this type of thing starts to happen. And for sure, more positive things will happen.”

Juventus have reportedly identified Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca as a potential future manager amid growing scrutiny on Igor Tudor. While the Bianconeri remain unbeaten in Serie A, frustration is mounting over their series of draws and lack of progress. Maresca, who has impressed in England, is seen as an ideal long-term fit for the Turin giants.

Colin Udoh reveals the role he played in 'helping' Nigeria secure a World Cup play-off place after their 4-0 win over Benin. (1:47)

South Africa's 3-0 win over Rwanda that booked them a place in the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico was not only a strong footballing performance but also a symbol of the resilience that coach Hugo Broos has instilled in the team.

Bafana Bafana faced a self-made crisis heading into the final game, as they trailed Benin by two points at the top of Group C. After relinquishing top spot by having their March win over Lesotho overturned for fielding the ineligible Teboho Mokoena, they dropped two more points in a 0-0 draw with Zimbabwe on Saturday.

However, Benin 's 4-0 defeat by Nigeria left Bafana with a fighting chance: Victory over Rwanda was all they needed to progress. In the past, this is the sort of opportunity that South Africa had become accustomed to squandering.

When Broos watched Bafana Bafana lose a decisive 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier to Sudan five years ago, when they needed only a draw to make the tournament in Cameroon, he saw a team backed by a relative abundance of resources but foiled by a lack of mental fortitude.

That match led to the departure of his predecessor, Molefi Ntseki, and the Belgian's subsequent appointment as head coach. Almost five years later, he has delivered on his mission to overhaul Bafana Bafana's belief in their own abilities -- with his focus on youth paying off.

"I saw the game against Sudan, and Bafana Bafana needed only one point, and when I see the way they played the game there in Sudan... I couldn't understand it," Broos told ESPN in 2021 after making early progress in changing the results and culture of the team. "You go until the end -- until you die -- but you need that point. This was not the mentality I saw.

"So then I started to see who was playing. There were so many players of 27, 28, 29 years old. Afterwards, there was someone who was telling me: 'Yes, coach, but those players are experienced.'

"I said: 'Yes, that's right, but if you do not play the younger players, then when are they going to have experience?'

"So, therefore, I started also with young players who had quality. This is the first thing they need to have, and that's why we have such good results."

That process has now paid dividends, with a dominant performance led by young players who were cool, calm and collected from the first whistle to the last. Bafana led 2-0 at halftime, courtesy of a long-range Thalente Mbatha strike and a curling finish by Oswin Appollis, before Evidence Makgopa's 72nd-minute header sealed the win that saw South Africa qualify for their fourth World Cup -- and their first since they hosted the tournament in 2010.

Broos, alone, cannot take credit for the development of players such as Mbatha, Appollis and Makgopa -- Orlando Pirates stars in their mid-20s -- but the former Cameroon head coach, who won the 2017 AFCON against all odds, was a driving force for South Africa's nationwide shift in attitudes towards young players. Makgopa, in particular, was a beneficiary, as he scored a brace on his Bafana Bafana debut in Broos' first match in charge -- a 3-2 win over Uganda in June 2021. Then at Baroka FC, Makgopa had not been fancied to lead the line at international level, but Broos took a chance on him and it paid off.

Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns -- the two dominant clubs in South Africa over the past decade -- also deserve their fair share of credit.

Sundowns have invested heavily under the ownership of Confederation of African Football president Patrice Motsepe, who bought a controlling stake in 2003 and then the remaining shares the following year. However, the culture of the club changed specifically during Pitso Mosimane's tenure as head coach from 2012 to 2020.

Off the back of a disappointing spell in charge of Bafana Bafana, a reinvigorated Mosimane led Sundowns to their first CAF Champions League title in 2016 -- only the second by a South African club; Pirates previously won it in 1995.

That triumph -- and Sundowns' dominance of the South African Premiership under Mosimane and successors Manqoba Mngqithi, Rhulani Mokwena and Miguel Cardoso -- forced their rivals to level up and take continental competitions more seriously.

None could quite match the financial might of Sundowns, but Pirates improved their talent development and recruitment structures -- and their streamlined squad has closed the gap on a Sundowns side now struggling with fatigue and player discontent after the FIFA Club World Cup, a tournament that saw them impress on the global stage but face struggles keeping their players away from prying eyes elsewhere in the world.

Broos has often encouraged Bafana Bafana players to move overseas, but facing an injury crisis heading into a decisive qualifier, he started with an entirely locally-based XI. South Africa started five Sundowns players -- Ronwen Williams, Khuliso Mudau, Aubrey Modiba, Mokoena and Thapelo Morena -- five Pirates players -- Mbatha, Appollis, Makgopa, Nkosinathi Sibisi and Sipho Mbule -- and one from TS Galaxy, Khulumani Ndamane.

That, alone, speaks volumes of the quality in South Africa's club football.

However, this is nothing new.

What is new -- first and foremost -- is the apparent end of the days when South African players were viewed as too comfortable and pampered to win when the going got tough.

Having finished third at AFCON 2023 in Ivory Coast, Bafana are among the favorites for the tournament in Morocco in December and January. At the World Cup, the goal will be to make the knockout rounds for the first time.

The qualification campaign exposed that the South African Football Association still has a long way to go before it can offer Bafana the support they need to reach their full potential; but if the mentality in the upper echelons of the organization still needs to change, the players and coach are now embodiments of the promise of what South African football is capable of being.

Thomas Tuchel has completed his first task as England manager with ease as the Three Lions became the first European side to qualify for the 2026 World Cup on Tuesday.

After a perfect qualifying record of six wins and 18 goals without conceding from six games, the hard work for the German now begins in burdening great expectations in tough conditions next year in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

AFP Sports looks at the challenges ahead for Tuchel and his team if they are to end a 60-year wait to win a major men's tournament.

Tuchel's bold decision to leave out Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden from his squad this month underlined his desire to find the best collective unit rather than a collection of the best players at his disposal.

"We try to collect the guys who in the end have the glue and cohesion to be the best team, because we need to arrive (at the World Cup) with the best team," Tuchel said last week.

Elliot Anderson has been the main beneficiary, starting the last four England games.

But if the Nottingham Forest midfielder is to cement his place alongside Declan Rice, it would likely leave only one starting spot available for Bellingham, Foden and Cole Palmer.

It will take a far braver call for Tuchel to leave out some of his star names when it comes to naming his World Cup squad.

Chelsea's Palmer and Real Madrid right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold were also missing this month due to injury and will expect to be on the plane across the Atlantic come June.

Tuchel accepted from his first day in the job that anything other than winning the World Cup will be regarded as a failure.

England came as close as they ever have since 1966 to ending their trophy drought during his predecessor Gareth Southgate's tenure, losing two European Championship finals.

By splashing out on a proven winner in the former Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain boss on a short-term contract, the English Football Association are banking on Tuchel to turn a supremely talented generation from nearly men into winners.

However, the 52-year-old will be stepping into the unknown for his first tournament as an international manager in challenging conditions.

England have rarely thrived in the sweltering heat they can expect in many host cities next summer.

Moreover, a number of Tuchel's key men will head into the tournament on the back of 12 months without a break after their role in the Club World Cup last summer.

Preparations have already begun with the FA reportedly exploring June friendlies in the heat and humidity of Miami to acclimatise to the conditions before the World Cup kicks off.

The appointment of only the third foreign manager to lead the England team was not overwhelmingly popular.

However, that has not prevented the forthright Tuchel from speaking his mind.

He branded the Wembley crowd "silent" during Thursday's 3-0 friendly win over Wales and claimed his players deserved more from the fans.

The travelling support for Tuesday's 5-0 win in Riga over Latvia were quick to hit back, telling Tuchel they would "sing when we want".

England's rocky road to the Euro 2024 final was beset by an uneasy relationship with fans on the ground in Germany.

Southgate was pelted with beer cups after a 0-0 draw against Slovenia in the group stages.

Tuchel can ill afford such a toxic relationship to add an unwanted distraction to his quest to deliver England's first ever major trophy on foreign soil.

President Donald Trump suggested he will work to have 2026 FIFA World Cup games pulled out of Boston if the city's mayor, Michelle Wu, does not curb crime that recently included a violent street takeover targeting police.

Trump made the suggestion while taking questions from the media during Tuesday's meeting with Argentinian President Javier Milei at the White House, threatening to call FIFA President Gianni Infantino to have the games moved to cities that do cooperate, citing safety concerns.

“We can take them away. I love the people of Boston. And I know the games are sold out, but the mayor is not good. There are worse than her. At least she's intelligent. You know, some are extremely low IQ. Those bother me more. She's intelligent, but she's radical left,” Trump said. 

“The answer is yes, if somebody's doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location,' and he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it, very easily he'd do it. And this is the right time to do it.” 

Trump's comments come after a group of people took over one of the city's streets in a violent incident this week.

The president of a union that represents Boston police officers said that people who took part in a recent street takeover in the city were “hell-bent” on attacking law enforcement officials.

According to the Boston Police Department, over 100 people were involved in the takeover that involved street racing just after 2 a.m. on Oct. 5. 

Officers found people trying to attack police cruisers with fireworks, cones, poles and other items.

One police cruiser was destroyed by flames and needed to be towed away from the area, officials said.

Boston is currently set to host seven matches when the World Cup comes to North America next summer.

The slate includes five group-stage games, one Round of 32 fixture and the first quarterfinal on July 9.

Fox News Digital has reached out to Wu's office for further comment.

Trump added that he would also consider pulling the 2028 Summer Olympics out of Los Angeles for similar reasons. 

“I could say the same thing for the Olympics,” he said. 

“If I thought LA was not going to be prepared properly, I'd move it to another location.”

Wu has accused the Trump administration of being a party that “doesn't follow the law.”

“At a time when this federal administration is already causing so much fear and harm in our communities, these threats are serious and consequential,” Wu said in August. 

The remarks came after the Trump administration warned it could sue or cut federal funds if cities refused to cooperate on immigration enforcement.

ALMATY—It's all in the details, some say.Daniil Medvedev is buying into that notion, as he continues settling into his new coaching team of Thomas Johansson and Rohan Goetzke.The 2021 US Open champion is coming off a semifinal showing at the Rolex Shanghai Masters, his first run to the last four of a 1000-level event in more than six months. As he describes the early goings of the collaboration, it's one that is honing in on touching up his existing brand of tennis.“I think my game is complete enough, but it needs a lot of small details to add here and there and that's what we're looking for,” he told press Wednesday in Almaty during the English portion of his pre-tournament press conference.“It's everything: forehand, backhand, volley, serve. It's already good enough because I was number one, but small details needs to be improved.”

Medvedev mutually ended an eight-year partnership with coach Gilles Cervara after his first-round loss to Benjamin Bonzi at the US Open. There wasn't much time to get acquainted with Johansson and Goetzke ahead of an encouraging Asian swing, where he also advanced to the Beijing semifinals after dismissing Alexander Zverev.“It's just a start. We made good results in China for sure. When you start playing better, you want to do more, and I know how to do more, but it's a step by step process for sure,” said Medvedev.“It's not also easy to judge because there are tournaments, so we had like a week in Monaco and then it's tournament after tournament. There is no time to really do something big, but so far it has been working well, so we'll see how it goes later.”

The Russian is seeded second this week in Almaty, behind Wednesday's practice partner and defending champion Karen Khachanov. He's well-acquainted with Kazakhstan, though this marks his first trip to the Apple City. Needless to say, Medvedev's liked what he's seen with the operation so far at Almaty Arena.“They do a great job, the federation and the tournament itself. For a 250, it's a really, really good one. Everyone who came here for the first time is telling this,” he shared.“I heard a lot of good things about Almaty. Getting in a bit late from Shanghai, I'm not gonna have much time to see the city. I went to the center once already.”

Naomi Osaka battled past defending champion Suzan Lamens in three sets to reach the Kinoshita Group Japan Open quarterfinals, but suffered an injury scare in the match's closing stages.

No. 1 seed Naomi Osaka came out on top of a 7-6(6), 3-6, 6-2 battle with defending champion Suzan Lamens to reach the Kinoshita Group Japan Open quarterfinals, but suffered an injury scare in the closing stages of the match that left her limping off court.

Osaka: Scores | Draws | Order of play

A high-quality contest had seen Osaka respond well to Lamens' challenge, raising her level to pull away from the surging Dutchwoman in the third set. But with Lamens serving down 5-0 but up 30-15, Osaka pulled up on her left leg. Lamens sprayed a backhand wide on that point, but won the next, and at 40-30 to Lamens, Osaka requested a medical time-out.

Returning to the court with her left thigh strapped and with her movement significantly hampered, a visibly distressed Osaka attempted to close the match out with first-strike tennis that bypassed extended rallies. She was unable to take two match points on her own serve at 5-1, double faulting on the first and netting a backhand on the second. However, she was able to get over the line on return, summoning up a backhand winner to convert her third match point.

"It was definitely really difficult -- I'm kind of sorry about my attitude," Osaka said in an on-court interview that had to be cut short due to her leg pain.

In press, Osaka was hopeful that she could continue in the tournament.

"I took Advils, so I think it feels better than what it is right now, but obviously it doesn't feel good," she said. "I couldn't really move that well. It's not good, but I think I'm a fast healer so it should be OK for my next match."

Prior to the injury, Osaka had managed to raise her level in key moments to take control of the contest. Both players took their time to fully settle -- Lamens lost the first eight points of the match, including consecutive double faults to open her first service game; Osaka then conceded nine straight points to go down a break. Lamens threw in an error-strewn game when attempting to serve the set out at 5-4, and at 5-5 in the ensuing tiebreak Osaka played her best point of the set to inch ahead.

Lamens swiftly put the disappointment behind her, finding her form with her lethal forehand to take the second set. At the start of the third, the 26-year-old seemed poised to pull away after winning the best point of the match, ending a 19-stroke lung-buster with a thumping forehand winner on the line. Osaka responded immediately. On the very next point, she came up with a hot shot of her own, ending a 12-stroke athletic exchange with a superb backhand angle.

"Emotionally, I was going through a lot in this match," Osaka said. "And then in the third set I tried my best to have no regrets."

Osaka is scheduled to face Jaqueline Cristian in the quarterfinals on Friday. The Romanian rebounded from a first-set whitewash to defeat No. 8 seed Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 0-6, 6-4, 6-2, avenging a first-round loss to the Spaniard in Beijing three weeks ago.

Hair journey update in Osaka ☺️

“This is a very weird video,” Osaka starts, laughing. “I've been really struggling with my hair for like the past two years. Like, during pregnancy and after pregnancy I lost my edges and stuff.“They're back now,” she adds proudly. “Well, kind of. Kind of! Don't look too closely. I also dyed my hair a lot, so I had to cut it off, blah, blah, blah. But I think it's back now.”According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, postpartum hair loss—known as telogen effluvium—is common after childbirth:“Postpartum hair thinning or hair loss… occurs when hormone levels drop back to their regular levels after childbirth… Postpartum hair loss usually ends about 6–12 months after giving birth. Most women see their hair returning to its normal thickness as their hormone levels stabilize.”Read More: Naomi Osaka opens up about body image struggles, pressure to “snap back” after giving birthOsaka welcomed her daughter Shai on July 7, 2023, after stepping away from tennis in late 2022. She returned to training just two weeks later and has since spoken openly about body image challenges and the pressure—self-imposed and external—to “snap back.”“Anyway, I've been wearing a ponytail, as you can tell, because I didn't know how to wear my hair,” Osaka says later in the TikTok. “And then I watched one TikTok yesterday—don't look too close, again—but I think we're back!

The lasting effects of Stephen King's horror novel It can be felt almost 40 years after the book was published, thanks to its traumatizing villain. And now Pennywise's origin story makes its way to the small screen in HBO's Welcome To Derry, which premieres October 26. The prequel series brings It‘s Bill Skarsgård back into the fold as the maniacal clown who gleefully terrorizes and attacks children. But the show also delves deep into the eerie lore of  its titular small Maine town, with stories inspired by the interludes in King's novel. Series co-creator Andy Muschietti, who helmed 2017's It and Chapter Two, tells The A.V. Club that he's been itching to get back to this franchise since the latter film was released in 2019. 

Set in 1962—a whole 27 years before the Losers initially encountered Pennywise in the recent films—Welcome To Derry introduces a new group of kids who become the creature's targets. Muschietti dubs them the “new Losers,” who investigate the disappearance of a friend in the sewers while confronting some of their darkest fears. Meanwhile, the adults (played by the likes of Jovan Adepo, Taylour Paige, Chris Chalk, and James Remar) embark on their own secret missions that unwittingly put them on the same dangerous path as the kids. All roads, of course, lead to Pennywise. 

The A.V. Club spoke to Muschietti about establishing Welcome To Derry‘s “intense” tone and aesthetic, bringing in a major King character, crafting a new narrative that ties into the Native American community, and how much we'll get to see of Skarsgård in that darn clown costume. 

The A.V. Club: What was it about the interludes in Stephen King's books that felt like compelling entry points for an It spin-off? 

Andy Muschietti: So there are two things here. One was we all shared a desire to go into the origins of Pennywise or the monster who became the clown. And part of that equation was the conversations I had with Bill Skarsgård while filming It Chapter Two. Both of us were excited about the prospect. We thought it would be a movie at first. But then life happened, and we went into different projects. But this idea kept coming back to me and took shape into something deeper and more extended. It was my curiosity that made me dig into the other parts of Stephen King's book, particularly the research and investigation done by Losers Club member Mike Hanlon that form the interludes that are shrouded in mystery. Mike just gets bits and pieces of information, and he tries to build this puzzle, but never gets to put all the pieces together. In a way, I desired to put those pieces together and create an expanded story about everything that happened in Derry before the events of the movies, and hopefully create a compelling, emotional story. 

AVC: The show takes place in 1962. How does this specific time period affect the arc and aesthetics of the show? 

AM: 1962 is the Pennywise cycle previous to the story in the movie, but in the book, the main story happens in 1958 with the kids. So that was exciting to us right away because even if it's not the same characters, we're going into a similar cultural era covered in the book. We wanted to capitalize on the fear of being in the Cold War and the panic of possibly being bombed by Russia. There's also another range of fears from this era I wanted to tap into from the kids' perspective, which is things like radioactive mutations. Using both those angles to help with the creation of this world, aesthetically speaking, was appealing. I treated this season as if it were a movie, in the sense that we got Chapter Two‘s production designer [Paul D. Austerberry] and costume designer [Luis Sequeira] because I wanted to preserve that cinematic feel. Everybody was very excited to jump into the early '60s and embrace not only the aesthetic parts but the deeper idiosyncrasies of what an American small town at that time was like.

AVC: Does the show match the film's tone in terms of creepiness, or did you get to change things since you have eight hourlong episodes? 

AM: I wanted to maintain the same tone of the movie because I wanted the movies themselves to maintain the tone of the book, which is terribly scary and graphically violent. There are heightened emotions, but there's also a lot of humor. The mandate for me was always being faithful to all that, but I will say the show does get more intense. We had the opportunity to make it creepier because it's a bigger canvas with more characters and more of their fears to explore. The intention is to take things to the edge and give audiences more than what they've experienced in the movies before. 

AVC: You directed the opening scene of the premiere, which is quite gnarly and further helps establish that creepy tone. 

AM: Yeah, I wanted to establish a sense of how no one is really safe in this world, which is a little bit of the same idea that we expressed in the first movie's opening with Georgie's death, which is pretty gruesome, and also with Adrian Mellon's death at the beginning of Chapter Two. In general, as an opening for the show, I wanted to create an augmented feeling that nothing is sacred or safe in Derry. The challenge was how to do it and make it more spectacular, especially for people who have seen the movies and understand how effective a graphic incident like the show's opening scene is. It all comes from what I mentioned before about my desire to make a creature that stems from what a kid's fear in the early '60s was, which is a mutant of some sort. 

AVC: Did you always sign up to direct four installments, or did that choice come about naturally while working on the scripts? 

AM: That part evolved a bit. I knew I wanted to develop and create the show with other writers, but I knew I couldn't direct all eight because that's a big task. I also wanted time to make other movies. But over the course of the first few months, as the drafts were happening, I realized that I wanted to do more, so I thought I'd direct episodes one and two for the specific reason of establishing certain new characters. I was committed to that. And then I said, “Well, of course I'll do the finale, too.” But the lead-up to our finale is so great that I didn't want to not be part of the penultimate episode. So then I committed to doing those four, and I love and respect the other directors who came aboard.



AVC: A huge source of tension in It is the disconnect between the kids experiencing Pennywise's terrors and the adults not necessarily believing them. How does that aspect factor into Welcome To Derry? 

AM: Yeah, that's the fog in Derry, when adults don't seem to see or pay attention to what's going on. It's mostly about the kids suffering. Kids are gifted with the ability to imagine things that don't exist, for good and for bad. Our monster is a creature made of belief and will obviously target and use that as bait, which is more effective on younger people. That's one of the reasons we wanted to go back to his origins, to understand more the how and why of It becoming a clown. This fog is based on what Stephen King perceives as a sort of real-life behavior and a larger reflection about childhood versus adulthood. There are moments when you become an adult where your imagination fades away, unless you carry the child that you were within you. We absolutely use it in our show as a love letter to memory and the child inside who keeps the imagination alive. The fog is the end of childhood. Adults don't pay attention to everything in the world of children; that's impossible to do when you're occupied with life stuff. When we don't listen to kids to the full extent that we should, things can get forgotten or overlooked, or brushed under the carpet. 

AVC: Another important arc seems to be about the Native American rituals and beliefs about the monster and how they tie into what the adults are doing.

AM: The intervention of Native characters in the book is very important, and we wanted to grab it and extend it. In the interludes, it unlocks the investigations of the Losers and makes them face reality differently. I was always very attentive to that in the book. Natives were the first people on this land and so the first people who encountered It. In many ways, their story is as or more important than the story that our Losers go through. But it's a big question mark in the book about how this happened. So we basically go into that in the show and open the drawer to create a story that might be unfamiliar to readers as well. It's a new narrative that connects to the Indigenous community. 

AVC: One of the main characters is Dick Hallorann, played by Chris Chalk, who fans of The Shining will be familiar with. What was the idea behind bringing him into Welcome To Derry in such a big way? 

AM: Dick has a very predominant role in this story. In the book, he's part of the Black Spot tragedy when it burned down, but that story is told in fragmented pieces. We don't know the full extent of Dick's participation, and that's what we wanted to find out here. We realized he plays a much larger role. Chris Chalk is exceptional in this. I hadn't known him before in person before casting him, and when I saw his tape, it blew my mind. He brought a great deal of mysticism, but he's also grounded. His character goes on a weird journey as someone who has “the shine” and is in conflict with that throughout.

AVC: We can't end without a tease of just how much we'll see of Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise.

AM: I cannot say when and how Pennywise appears because it would be a spoiler. Of course, we're going to see him incarnated in different ways, but eventually, we will see the clown that we all love to hate. There was an attempt to keep Bill not in the proximity of the new young actors to preserve that aura that he has when he's in costume and in character, at least just to preserve the first scene when they all see each other. But then, after that, everyone quickly became friends with Bill. He's very careful about the effect he has on people when he's in costume, but all the actors were very excited about Pennywise showing up on set.

Karl Marx himself may have written that “history repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.” Still, not even the most dedicated members of Japan's Red Army Faction — a militant, “Communist Manifesto”-carrying group most famous for hijacking a JAL flight in the spring of 1970 — could have imagined their signature action would eventually be restaged as a slick and sprawling Netflix comedy combining the smirking political satire of “Burn After Reading” with the cold-blooded visual dynamism of a Park Chan-wook film. 

 










Sure, the Yodogo Hijacking Incident wasn't quite a tragedy, and “Good News” is just a bit too grounded to feel like a true farce, but the disconnect between the severity of what happened and the blitheness with which Korean director Byun Sung-hyun (“The Merciless”) has re-imagined it is striking enough to affirm Marx's point. I have to imagine that the hijackers would've been happy about that; bumbling and inept as they appear in Byun's movie, their conviction smacks of courage when compared to the spinelessness of the bureaucrats tasked with solving the crisis, all of whom care more about their own egos and careers than they do the 130 passengers whose lives are at stake.

Just droll, twisty, and stylish enough to forgive this 136-minute film for using a lot more runway than it needs to be airborne, “Good News” is a veritable caricature of middle-management — an epic parody of passing the buck. That so few of the actual facts have been changed, despite an impishly self-conflicting disclaimer that insists it was “inspired by real events” but also that “all of the characters and events portrayed are fictional,” only serves to strengthen Byun's damning portrayal of political cowardice.

For all of the lip service that Byun and Lee Jin-seong's knotted script pays to the relative nature of truth, however, “Good News” initially makes it easy to separate fact from fiction. Did heavily armed hijackers commandeer a Boeing 727 as part of their plan to further a worldwide revolution against the United States and its allies? Indeed, and an opening flurry of newsreel footage helps to confirm that we aren't completely outside of history. Did the Communists obsessively quote the boxing manga “Ashita no Joe” as a source of inspiration? Was their leader as handsome as “Tokyo Vice” star Show Kasamatsu, or their youngest member barely old enough to fly without parental supervision? Probably not. 

 










Did the crisis highlight the Kafkaesque absurdity of Cold War politics by sparking an international circle-jerk between various representatives from South Korea, North Korea, Japan, America, and the Soviet Union? You bet. Did the South Koreans rely on the help of a rumpled and mysterious fixer called “Nobody” (a Lupin the III-esque Sul Kyung-gu, his character wise enough to treat the whole situation like a cosmic joke) to goad everyone into action? I highly doubt it, but history tends to forget the people who refuse to accept credit for it. Ditto those who manage to avoid taking the blame.

“Good News” has plenty of fun exaggerating the personas of the different parties involved in the situation, from the violent JAL chairman who only cares about his brand, to the veteran airplane pilot who can't stop complaining about his hemorrhoids, and the Korean Central Intelligence Agency Director (Ryoo Seung-bum) who tries to wash his hands of this entire shitshow like a used car salesman desperate to move an old lemon off the lot. But the movie only really takes flight after the line between “tragedy” and “farce” begins to blur, like when a proactive air force “double parks” a jet in front of the 727 as it stops to refuel. (The visual of the two planes facing each other on the tarmac as the pilot scampers away from his vehicle is a real laugh-out-loud moment in a movie that tends to fall back on knowing smiles.) 

 










Funny as it is, that sequence pales in comparison to what happens later, when a young Korean Air Force lieutenant named Seo (Hong Kyung) has the bright idea of executing a double hijack. The Red Army Faction believes they're flying into Pyongyang, but Seo — in a standoff that's shot like a Sergio Leone spaghetti western, complete with ultra-wide framing, skintight leather chaps, and a few errant tumbleweeds for good measure — wrests control of the radio frequency from his North Korean counterparts and fools the hijackers into landing in Seoul's Gimpo International Airport instead. 

Remarkably, this part of the story is rooted in truth. Gimpo really was hastily outfitted to resemble Pyongyang in the hopes that the hijackers would believe they'd succeeded. Byun simply “yes ands” the record by imagining that an overweight local movie director was recruited to complete the illusion with a fleet of costumed extras waiting for the Red Army Faction on the “North Korean” runway. Like everyone else in this movie, however, the director wants to frame this story on his own terms (“If I can't capture this historical moment on film, I at least want to participate in it!”), and his eagerness to control the action risks creating new conflict. 

 










Not only does this display of egomaniacal buffoonery make for “Good News”' most effective setpiece, the sheer absurdity of the situation embellished by Byun's arch framing and previously unknown flair for dry comedy, it also epitomizes the core ethos of a film in which shaping the narrative is always more important than saving the hostages. Even the relatively noble and clear-headed Seo is motivated by the legacy of his father's sacrifice, which complicates his feelings about the value of heroism even as it pushes him to make the most of his moment in the limelight. 

“Good News” has no compunctions about depicting its characters — even and especially the South Korean ones — as narcissistic dolts. But these larger-than-life figures are as broad as their context is hyper-specific. That functional mismatch saps away at the comedy of a film clearly made to be enjoyed by a global audience. (Netflix is releasing it around the world at the same time, and the multi-language audio track will unhelpfully default to English for anyone who tries to stream the movie from America.) Pointed gestures toward the lingering tension between Japan and Korea — and between those two countries and the rest of the planet — are drowned out by tiresome bickering and exaggerated gags, like a meaningful conversation swallowed into the sound of an airplane engine screaming overhead.

 










Byun's visual playfulness is likewise compelling enough to compensate for the shortcuts in his storytelling — active camerawork and inventive CGI combine with Jo Hyoung-rae's heightened cinematography to imbue the film's airplane cabins and flight control towers with a vivid sense of theatricality. Yet the director is so eager to make a spectacle out of this scenario that “Good News” begins to feel as self-insistent as its characters. 

Perhaps that's by design, and Byun is bending his own form towards a damning commentary on universal self-interest — even in the face of a crisis. But the movie's soft-hearted underbelly fails to support that reading, and by the time the story finally arrives at its final moments, the unsparing cynicism that supplied its initial lift has been dragged back down to Earth by the weight of bland truisms. In a rich but increasingly disappointing film where everyone is trying so hard to pass the buck, it's only fitting that viewers end up holding the bag.

“Good News” will be available to stream on Netflix starting Friday, October 17.

Netflix‘s upcoming new series Extraction is rounding out the cast with Sacha Dhawan (The Great), Ross McCall (Silo), Pip Torrens (The Crown), Sam Woolf (We Were the Lucky Ones), Michael Zananiri (Once Upon a Time in Gaza), Riyad Sliman (Ramy), Muhannad Ben Amor (Andor), Aaron Heffernan (Brassic), Jojo Macari (Those About to Die), Theo Ogundipe (Mickey 17) and Emma Appleton (Everything I Know About Love).


	They join the previously announced lead Omar Sy, as well as Boyd Holbrook, Natalie Dormer, Waleed Zuaiter, and Ed Speleers.


	From showrunner, writer, and EP Glen Mazzara, and produced by AGBO, Extraction is set in the world of the action thriller movie franchise starring Chris Hemsworth. The series explores the trauma, betrayal, and moral conflicts of characters pushed to the edge.

	The eight-episode first season follows a mercenary (Sy) who embarks on a dangerous mission to rescue hostages in Libya. Trapped between warring factions and ruthless killers, he must navigate life-or-death choices while confronting deep emotional wounds. 


	The 2020 action thriller Extraction, directed by Sam Hargrave, was based on the graphic novel Ciudad by Ande Parks, with art by Fernando León González, and co-written by Joe and Anthony Russo. Hemsworth stars as an Australian black ops mercenary who takes on a mission to save an Indian drug lord's kidnapped son in Dhaka, Bangladesh, but the mission goes awry when he is double-crossed.

	











	A sequel, Extraction 2, was released in 2023, with the main cast reprising their roles. The movie brings back Hemsworth's Rake, who is tasked with a new mission — rescuing the battered family of a ruthless Georgian gangster from the prison where they are being held. AGBO produced both films.


	In addition to the Russo Brothers and Mazzara, executive producers include Angela Russo-Otstot, Scott Nemes, and Chris Castaldi for AGBO, Sam Hargrave, Eric Gitter, and Peter Schwerin, Netflix & AGBO: A Proven Partnership. Ari Costa produces for AGBO.

	Aniyah Saint-Surin was about to live her dream. A lifelong Billie Eilish fan, Saint-Surin was finally able to see the Hit Me Hard and Soft singer for the first time in concert when Eilish began her tour at Kaseya Center in Miami on Oct. 9. The tickets had come together at the last minute, and with the help of her aunt, Saint-Surin had thrown together a serviceable outfit, complete with a red bandana that had been gathering dust in the corner of her room. The clothes didn't matter — she was there to see her Billie. Saint-Surin has seen countless Eilish concerts through her phone screen, so she knew what was going to happen next. After hearing Eilish sing “Guess,” her hit collab with Charli XCX, Saint-Surin could see Eilish getting ready to run past the crowded barricade. This was what she had been waiting for, when Eilish would hop down from her stage and speed past a hoard of waiting fans, arms all outstretched for a second of contact. This was her moment. Eilish had just touched Saint-Surin's fingertips when everything went haywire. A fan grabbed Eilish, and the singer went down hard — slamming into the metal barricade. 

	











	“Instantly, something clicked,” Saint-Surin tells Rolling Stone. Before she even realized what she was doing, she was pushing the fan away, leaving her coveted spot at the barricade — and her chance to interact with Eilish again — to loudly berate the man for grabbing Eilish so roughly. A few minutes later, she was back in her spot, shaken up but convinced no one had noticed her actions. 

	











	Saint-Surin has been listening to Billie Eilish for as long as she can remember — at least six years — which for an 18-year-old, is a substantial chunk of her life. Since Eilish released her debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? in 2019, Saint-Surin has been a self-proclaimed stan, following the Los-Angeles based singer as she went from an industry newcomer to a Grammy and Academy Award-winning powerhouse. She watched Eilish's concerts via TikToks, streamed interviews on YouTube, and of course played her music constantly. “When tickets dropped, I got everyone, my brother, my sister, everybody on their Ticketmaster app,” she says. “I just kept saying ‘I need these Billie tickets.' I need them!” She was still overwhelmed to be at her first ever Eilish concert, so she regaled her family with the story later that night, but went to bed thinking it would be forgotten by the time she woke up. When she fell asleep, she had about 70 followers on TikTok. Five days later, she's reached half a million.

she deserves infinite free tickets bro 😭 #billieeilish #redbandanagirl #billieeilishconcert #ae #edit 


	What Surin didn't know was that the night of her concert, several clips of her yelling at the fan that grabbed Eilish slowly went viral online, garnering posts from Finneas and Renee Rapp. Ticket reselling company StubHub got her tickets to the next show, making sure she could finally live her dream of touching hand with Eilish. Through her tour manager, Eilish got Saint-Surin's brother a ticket to a show — and even sent Saint-Surin several pieces of merch to thank her for her actions. (The fan who grabbed Eilish has not been identified.) The viral video comes as artists have become more vocal about fan behavior at concerts can put them in danger. In a 2023 interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Eilish herself noted that when fans are excited, trying to grab her or throw things, it can get scary. “People just get excited and it can be dangerous. I have mixed feelings about it, because when you're up there it blows,” Eilish said. “But you know it's out of love and they're just trying to give you something. You're in a vulnerable position, but I've been getting hit with stuff for like years.”


	Now Saint-Surin is a hero online, dubbed with the moniker “Red Bandana Girl” for the red headscarf that was on her head when she went after the fan who grabbed Eilish. For her first public interview, Saint-Surin spoke to Rolling Stone about her love for Eilish, the deterioration of concert etiquette, and why it might be time for fandoms to have a reckoning in their ranks.

How long have you been a music lover? Do you have a preferred genre? I love this question. It all depends what mood I'm in. I've been listening since I can remember, and I'm so deeply in love with all the genres and the feelings they give me. From pop to hip hop, and K Pop, I love it all. I love music so much. Like, what would I do without it?


As someone who loves so many different genres, what draws you in about Billie Eilish as an artist? I've been a Billie stan for six years. It feels like I watched her grow — Well, I did watch her grow — but it's like this connection that she has with us. Call stans crazy, but I swear it's real. What really connected me to Billie's music was the way she puts her stories and experiences and traumas into something so beautiful that helps millions of other girls like me also get through obstacles in their lives. From watching her interviews and personality, everything about her character is so captivating to me. When you're a fan and you find your artists, it's like… they just get it. 


How many Billie concerts have you been to before this viral incident?Thursday was my very first time. 


As someone who's been a fan for so many years, that must have felt a bit overwhelming. Oh my gosh. As I walked into that arena and I grabbed that barricade, it felt like every time I closed my eyes, I was going to be in bed, and I've never felt that way before, like it's more than a dream, one, like this is not even real. I've watched her do this show online. But to really look at that stage and look at everybody excited around me, and I'm talking to people about her, It did not feel real. Yeah, I kept falling to the ground. I kept falling to the ground.


Walk me through the incident with the fan. Okay, so Billie has two stages, a small stage and the main stage, which is a long rectangle. So she sings “Guess” and then “Everything I Wanted” and I realized, “Wait, this is when Billie does the crowd walk.” So I rushed back to my barricade spot, and my girls saved my spot. So I get there and I just hold on. I'm like, “This is it.” This was my dream. This is every stan's dream, just to be able to have that second of contact with their favorite artists. It just means so much. So Billie's walking down. I have my phone [tight to my chest]  because I want to remember this, but  I don't want the phone in my face. But the second our fingers touch, Billie goes down. It didn't look right at all, because her head was down and she was smashed against the barricade. I try to pull her arm up and I feel a pull on me, so I turn around and it's this guy. And instantly, something clicked. It was immediate. All I thought was, “You just put your hands on this little lady? Now it's me and you.” 

	











What did you do? All I saw was his face and I just started rushing him. I was screaming and honestly, it was a lot of cussing. “What are you doing? What are you doing? Don't mess with Billie! Get him out of here!” And then next thing I remember, what felt like six police officers were on top of him. I don't even remember the police kind of grabbing me as well, but they were actually really nice and ended up being on my side. 


Were you able to enjoy the concert after the incident? After the security guards questioned me, and they were very nice, I went to my spot by the barricade. Everyone there was so nice. They kept my purse for me. They were asking if I was OK. They're the sweetest people ever. I love them forever. But I was so angry I couldn't really just enjoy the moment. Like in all my concert videos after that, you can hear me screaming “I can't even believe this happened! This is insane!” By the end of the concert, everyone was smiling, filling their hands with confetti and because I went by myself, I was just walking around the arena solo trying to find the exit, just yelling “I can't believe that!” to myself. I know I looked insane.


Did you expect the incident to go as viral as it did? No, I was still very heated, so I didn't even go on social media. The first thing I did was call my aunt, and tell her this guy just attacked Billie and that I rushed him. I thought I was really the only one with the video. I called my mom and she was immediately like, “No more solo concerts. That's a grown man. You could have gotten hurt.” I did see one video about it by the end of the night, but I thought it would be gone by morning. So I go to sleep and when I wake up, I have 2,000 new followers on TikTok. 


Were you concerned when you realized just how viral the clips were getting, especially the ones focused on you? So when I first saw the video on Twitter, I gasped. I was like, “Oh my goodness, all people are going to see is an angry Black woman. Many Black women before me dealt with showcasing their emotions to disrespect, even if you're trying to defend someone that you care about. So I was really worried that I would be taken out of context and treated like that. But I'm glad that people understood and I'm very thankful for the opportunity to be seen as justified, because a lot of women did not get that same grace.


How do you think fandom and obsession plays a part in incidents like this? That connection with stan and artist, your favorite artists — you care so deeply about them. And they care about all of the people that support them, too. I'm a woman. Billie is a woman. And it felt like this man just abused his power. Billie even has a song that is about that. So to forcefully grab her for no reason, just to be aggressive, you're just out of your mind. But I feel like I would have done the same for anybody in that pit. I don't play about putting hands on people and overstepping boundaries. It was just so disrespectful. I couldn't fathom how that all went down so it led to so much anger in me. I've never ran up on nobody before. Yes, you could call me confrontational with my words, but it was just something about that situation. I had to do something. And I see a lot of comments like, “You saved Billie. You saved Billie.” Well, Mr. Police and Mr. Security — they saved Billie. But I was definitely going to give that man a piece of my mind.

As someone who identifies as a stan, do you think concert etiquette like this has gotten worse because of parasocial relationships? One thousand percent. People see artists in the industry and think, “You owe me.” And I'm even guilty of this. When I first started getting into music I'm like, “Oh my gosh, if I see them I'll run up and ask for a picture, give them a hug.” It's because I know them, but they're looking at me and being nice but I'm a stranger. It's reached a certain level of creepy, like now people are crossing boundaries. It's getting weird. It's getting invasive. And I think it's really important to keep understanding that you are strangers to your favorite artists. Yes, you have that relationship through their music, but you don't know them personally. Yes, you watch them on live, yes, you watch all their interviews, and yes, you know every song, but you don't know anything about that person. I think that's something people really need to understand. 


Do you think stans are aware of when this kind of love and obsession gets disrespectful? I think so. I like to call them real stans, people who respect those boundaries. It's the people who aren't googling into their business and trying to find out what's going on in their personal life. When headlines come out about Billie — that's none of my business.  Something I keep in mind is Billie saying something along the lines of she wishes she could tell us everything, but then it would be all over the internet. If it was only Billie stans and my girl, we'd have so much fun. But I understand that when she disappears for months, I just know my girl is probably vibing because she needed that space. And I tell myself that she'll come back again. She always does.

After more than 20 years of hosting country music shows on SiriusXM, beloved on-air personality and singer-songwriter Dallas Wayne has signed off — temporarily, he hopes — as he battles a blood cancer called multiple myeloma.

Wayne, a mainstay on SiriusXM channels Willie's Roadhouse (61) and Outlaw Country (62) revealed via a social media post on October 14, 2025, that he received the diagnosis “a while back” and has been in treatment, but now needs to undergo an autologous stem cell transplant, which will require him to step away from the mic. 

“I've been undergoing treatment for some time now,” he wrote, “and while there is no ‘cure' for this type of cancer, it looks like I'm well on my way to remission. My prognosis is promising — I am hopeful.”

A post shared by Dallas Wayne (@dallas.wayne)

Wayne shared his news “in the spirit of transparency,” noting that “in the coming weeks, I'll be taking some time off my radio show” to undergo his upcoming procedure. 

“Rest assured that I'm surrounded by a team of excellent doctors and medical professionals that are taking great care of me, and I have complete faith in their expertise,” Wayne told his fans. “But I'll need a little time to rest and recover.”

“In the meantime,” he continued, “thank you all for your support and understanding. I look forward to seeing you on the radio, and on the road, again very soon! As we say on the radio every day, ‘Be safe, and be good to each other; it's the right thing to do.'”

An autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), according to Mayo Clinic, is an intense process that “uses healthy blood stem cells from your own body to replace bone marrow that's not working properly.” It's typically performed on patients whose bone marrow has been damaged due to high doses of chemotherapy and radiation. 

A typical ASCT patient spends around six weeks in a hospital or transplant facility, per the International Myeloma Foundation, and the average recovery takes three to six months. 

Fans flooded Wayne's social media post with love, wishing him well and sharing success stories of loved ones who've undergone similar cancer treatments. 

One wrote, “Hoss – I've spent many an hour listening to you and Willie's roadhouse and always enjoyed your good cheer and company. Just know that every country music fan enjoy your radio shows is behind you 100%. You're gonna beat this – sending all my ❤️”

“Dallas, I will be praying for you,” one wrote on Instagram. “Thanks for sharing this. I really enjoy your show on Sirius XM and pray you get needed rest. I have a niece in Missouri who is 44 and fighting cancer also. Doctors can do so much but I believe God can do much more. More than any of us can fathom.”

Another shared, “I love your work, I'm a regular OUTLAW listener. I wish you a healthy recovery. Thank you for what you do. All the best Brother.”

Among thousands who shared their well-wishes on Facebook, one chimed in, “Battling cancer does take a team of professionals. Take all the time you need, we'll still be here when you're back on the radio.”

In addition to his on-air work for SiriusXM, Wayne is also an accomplished singer-songwriter who's released 13 albums and is a member of the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame, according to Country Insider.

Few contemporary films about unresolved childhood abuse — which is always unresolved, in the end, anyway — cut as narrowly close to the bone as Elliot Tuttle's two-hander masked as provocation, “Blue Film.” 

Rejected by mainstream film festivals before it premiered in Edinburgh this summer and NewFest in New York in October, this taboo-busting study of a masculine camboy confronted by the pedophile teacher who many years ago desired him holds back little and offers even less that's palatable to swallow. Its limitations as a stagelike piece aside, the movie wrings emotional complexity from a fraught, ever-shifting dialogue between a convicted child abuser and the student, now a late twenties sex worker, he spared.

“Blue Film,” which takes place entirely in a rented Hancock Park Airbnb in Los Angeles with only two actors, dares to go places I have not seen an American movie travel to in a while. There was an Israeli movie called “Princess” at Sundance in 2014, directed by Tali Shalom Ezer, which freaked a lot of people out. It was about a 12-year-old girl's “close relationship” with her mother's boyfriend. There was the 2011 Austrian movie “Michael,” directed by Michael Haneke protégé Markus Schleinzer, about an insurance salesman sexually abusing the 10-year-old boy locked up in his basement. These were shocking. Neither were American.

Tuttle, an American filmmaker himself who received support on the project from Mark Duplass of all possible collaborators, is willing to take you to those same dark places, ones that remind you of European directors who want to shake you with their frank psychosexual provocations. It's impressive where Tuttle, this second-time feature filmmaker, goes with his surprisingly humanistic and empathetic approach to material about abuse. One where a pedophile teacher's sexual fantasy about his former student's talent show performance emerges as oddly wistful.

“Blue Film” stars rising actor Kieron Moore as dom camboy Aaron Eagle (whose real name is Alex McConnell) opposite Reed Birney as his estranged middle school teacher, who reconnect over one night filled with conversations about desire, shame, and guilt. I'm not surprised festivals, allegedly such as Sundance and SXSW, looked away from it. Mainstream audiences will be alienated by this unapologetic exploration of quote-unquote aberrant sexuality, but those looking for a challenge in the vein of ‘90s films from Todd Solondz or Gregg Araki will feel seen in Tuttle's exploration of how abuse warps memory, and memory warps accounts of abuse.

In asking you to feel sorry for a pedophile while making a gay man his scene partner, “Blue Film” dances on the tricky line from early abuse to later-in-life sexual behavior. When the movie begins, we see Aaron (Moore), sweaty and hairy in white briefs and tattooed top-to-toe, putting on a live stream for his submissive followers. One of his anonymous fans offers $50,000 for an in-person meet-and-greet. Financially desperate, he agrees to spend the night with the client, who greets him sheathed in a balaclava with the promise of even more money and perhaps pizza if Aaron is willing to open up about himself.

 










That client, it turns out, is Mr. Grant, aka Hank, Aaron's long-ago teacher, and one who took a special interest in Aaron as a child. Some time while Aaron was in school, Hank was intercepted sexually assaulting a child on campus, was fired from his job, and received a prison sentence. With the mask off and Aaron stripped down yet again, their walls start to come down. Hank, he reveals, has now turned to religion as an atonement for his own torment, but his search for meaning has not been without other attempts at or contemplations of assaulting kids, as he tells Aaron.

Tuttle's script and camera pass no judgment on the characters, like when Aaron shares a bone-chilling story of childhood abuse while naked in a bathtub that may or may not be true, or when Hank also offers a sickening recounting of molestation he endured at the hands of a relative. The actors are as game as any you could imagine, working from a script that you can imagine a lot of people said “hell no” to.

Birney, 71, and best known for work in television and theater (“The Humans”), invites you to feel all his hurt, even as his world is a morally disturbed one we are made to live inside for the movie's running time. As Aaron, Moore, meanwhile, conceals deep wounds of his own, while also high on the power imbalance this situation has tipped his way, where Hank wants to know if he “still loves” Aaron. Another wrinkle is that the camera certainly wants us to also desire Moore, who is often next to naked, placing us at least adjacent to Hank's gaze.

 










Hank is also curious about whether he can still be attracted to adult whom he once desired as a child. He shaves Aaron head to toe to make him look more physically childlike in one of the film's queasier implications. What these two actors take on is undeniably brave, even as the movie tilts toward becoming suffocating, which is intentional. “Blue Film” is confined to a single environment, after all.

Cinematographer Ryan Jackson-Healy also shot the equally controversy-starting, Birney-led film “Mass,” about the ramifications of a school shooting for the parents affected. The DP knows his way around a tight room with just a few people, and the visual beauty of this movie (indeed, often cloaked in literal blues as night turns to dawn) helps alleviate the agonies on display.

Tuttle wisely avoids flashbacks or out-of-this-room context. We are stuck with these two people and our discomfort with them, even though we might also feel tenderness toward them. “Blue Film” nudges at a lot of tricky issues, like the question of whether being gay in the present day is somehow the result of inflictions of the past. And the parallel to that question is whether abuse can also beget more abuse, i.e. make you into a pedophile or sex offender. Hank says he knew who he was once his sexual fantasies in middle school, about his fellow same-age classmates, remained the same into adulthood. What Tuttle wants to attack here is this terrible fork-in-the-road notion that pedophilia and homosexuality stem from the same root.

 










Still, “Blue Film” does the rare work of listening with compassion to a pedophile such as Hank, and as an audience, you can either be curious about that or just let it make you uncomfortable. Hank is tormented by who he is, as is Aaron, but they are not the same person, and they did not come from the same place. “Blue Film” leaves you feeling a little bit ill, and very uneasy about how you're supposed to feel. But when most films either wouldn't dare go here at all, or would tell you how to feel about the material, that's rare and welcome.

“Blue Film” premiered at the Edinburgh Film Festival and NewFest. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


NBC News went through a round of layoffs on Wednesday, impacting about 150 staffers, as the network cuts costs as it prepares for the split of most of Comcast's cable networks into Versant.


	The job reductions are scattered throughout NBC News. They represent about 2% of the NBCU News Group workforce and a single-digit percentage of NBC News, according to a source familiar with the plans. Status newsletter, the first to report on the pending cuts, put the figure at 7% of the network's workforce.


	Staffers are being told that the layoffs are taking place because NBC News no longer will be providing newsgathering for two networks, not just MSNBC but CNBC. The two networks will be part of the collection of cable channels under the Versant umbrella. Also cited is the economic climate, as linear networks have been trimming staffs amid advertising shifts to other platforms.

	The impacted employees, who are being informed of the elimination of their roles on Wednesday, will receive severance and outplacement services, and 60 days notification and benefits support, per the source. They will be able to apply for 140 openings across the newsgroup. About a dozen of the eliminated positions are being repurposed into new roles, and those laid off also can apply for those jobs.

	The NBC Digital News Guild, which represents staffers including reporters, editors and video journalists, has not received any official notice from management, a spokesperson said. In a statement, Susan DeCarava, president of The NewsGuild of New York, said, “What's clear: NBC management is prioritizing corporate profits at the expense of our hard-working members, without whom there would be no NBC News.”


	Comcast announced last year that it would spin off most of its cable networks, including MSNBC and CNBC, into a new company, later branded as Versant. The spinoff is expected to be completed by the end of the year, with MSNBC building up its own newsroom given that it no longer will have NBC News as a sister network.

	











	On Oct. 6, MSNBC no longer relied on NBC News correspondents and crews in their coverage, with the exception of Washington, D.C. operations. Those ties are expected to be severed next week, on Oct. 20. MSNBC also will be taking on a new name, MS NOW, or My Source, News-Opinion-World.


	In a memo to employees last week, Cesar Conde, chairman of the NBCU News Group, said that a planned NBC News subscription service will launch later this year, while NBC News will expand its sports hub as events like the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics and World Cup approach. He also said that NBC News would be launching a new marketing campaign.

If the layoffs were due to no longer needing to provide services for CNBC and MSNBC, then shouldnt there be growth jobs available at CNBC and MSNBC to manage those same functions?

Because CNBC and MSNBC are being phased out. Versant wasn't spun off to save legacy media, it was to manage the decline so Comcast could focus resources on new media acquisitions like CBS is doing with Bari Weiss.

Famed Method actor Daniel Day-Lewis doesn't think the technique deserves the bad rap it's gotten over the past few years. He also swears he's not in a cult. (Hear that, Brian Cox?) “All the recent commentary in the last few years about Method acting is invariably from people who have little or no understanding of what it actually involves,” the Oscar winner said during a conversation at the BFI London Film Festival, per Variety. “It's almost as if it's some specious science that we're involved in, or a cult. But it's just a way of freeing yourself so that the spontaneity, when you are working with your colleagues in front of the camera, that you are free to respond in any way that you'll move to in that moment.”

However you feel about the immersive, somewhat controversial technique, it's clearly worked for Day-Lewis. He's won three Best Actor Oscars throughout his career (for My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood, and Lincoln) and has been nominated for three more. Some such as actor David Harbour have even held him up as a rare exception to their personal philosophy that Method acting is mostly just madness. To Day-Lewis, on the other hand, it's really quite simple. “It's very easy to describe what I do as if I'm out of my mind. Plenty of people have been happy to do that, but it just makes sense to me,” he said. “You have an obligation to try to understand as far as you're humanly able to what it feels like to be inside of that experience.” The actor also pushed back against the claim that immersing yourself in a role means “you're sealed off from experiencing” your own life. It actually means “you're in a self-contained experience of your own,” he said. “But really, if you've done your work, you should be free to accept whatever passes through you.” 

The acclaimed actor recently ended his “retirement” to co-write and star in his son Ronan Day-Lewis' directorial debut, Anemone. In the film, he “unsurprisingly… delivers every line with masterful, lived-in magnetism,” as Luke Hicks wrote in his review of the surreal project for The A.V. Club. Ronan had never experienced his father's techniques from behind the camera before, but backed up his claim that immersion in a character doesn't mean you're fully cut off from the reality of the world around you. In a recent interview with The A.V. Club, the younger Day-Lewis said he wasn't expecting how “collaborative [Daniel] was able to be on set, despite how fully enmeshed in his character he was.” He added, “That was amazing to see and very reassuring early on in the shoot.”

Amid a whirlwind of shocking series cancellations at HGTV during the summer of 2025 and news of new series in the works, twin sisters Lyndsay Lamb and Leslie Davis have been noticeably quiet about the future of their show, “Unsellable Houses.”

The duo remains active on social media, still running and promoting their Lamb & Co. real estate, design, and decor businesses in Snohomish, Washington. Now, one year after their show's fifth season debuted in the fall of 2024, one of the sisters has finally begun to acknowledge fans' questions about their on-air future. 

Throughout the summer, many of Davis and Lamb's HGTV peers made headlines as they revealed their shows were not renewed for new seasons, including Jonathan Knight's “Fixer to Fabulous,” Egypt Sherrod and Mike Jackson's “Married to Real Estate,” and “Bargain Block” with Keith Bynum and Evan Thomas. 

Meanwhile, in late August, HGTV announced a full slate of new and returning shows for the end of 2025 and early 2026 — but “Unsellable Houses” wasn't on the list. 

For months, when fans peppered Davis and Lamb's social media posts with questions about their show's future, the duo typically ignored the inquiries. But in early October 2025, Lamb has acknowledged some of her Instagram followers' comments about wanting to see the show return. 

On an Instagram video she posted on October 3 about creative tabletop ideas for hosting a fall meal, she replied to a fan who commented, “Beautiful! Miss seeing you and your sissy on TV -😔, hope you two have another show brewing !!!!” Lamb's reply? “Always 😍”

On October 14, Lamb posted a video of the fall decor outside their Lamb & Co. storefront. She liked one fan's comment that said, “Looks great! Will you two be back on TV? I miss watching you!” She also liked when a fellow fan replied, “me too! I'm in withdrawals! 😫”

Davis, however, has primarly shared personal posts over the last several months, including chronicling her first trip overseas (to Denmark) this month and has not commented on or liked any inquiries about the show. 

Despite the lack of information about the future of “Unsellable Houses,” HGTV continues to regularly air reruns of the show. 

The show follows the twins as they help local homeowners update the houses they've had trouble selling. In a July 2024 episode of their “Twin Win Unfiltered” podcast, the sisters said they never expected or sought out being on TV. 

Davis explained that their production company checked out their YouTube after being tipped off by a friend. She said, “A friend of ours, Gina, was approached about a TV show. She said ‘no' for numerous reasons. Then she called us, and said, ‘Hey, FYI, I gave your name to a production company because I think you guys would be good on a show.'”

Jason Kelce, brother of Travis and former star of the Philadelphia Eagles, has issued a statement after a fake quote of him appearing to criticize those unhappy with the selection of Bad Bunny for the Super Bowl Halftime Show went viral. 


	“I normally don't comment on things like this, but I feel I need to address that there are a number of accounts posting fake quotes and attributing them to me on this platform right now,” Kelce wrote on X yesterday, Oct. 14. 


	The phony quote attributed to Kelce was: “If Bad Bunny is a bad fit for the Super Bowl, then maybe the people making these comments are a bad fit for America's future.” While the veracity of the quote was debunked even before Kelce addressed the matter, it still went viral on social media. Its spread was fueled, too, by conservative activists like Dinesh D'Souza and David Harris Jr., whose posts are still up as of publication (via Snopes). 


	On X, Kelce said he appreciated the placement of community notes on several posts boosting the fake quote. He also said, “I will not address the other accounts specifically, because I do not want to amplify their engagement. But please know, unless you hear something directly from me via one of my platforms, it is not real.”

	The fact that the fake quote went so viral speaks to the extent of the conservative melt down over Bad Bunny's Super Bowl performance. Right-wing commentators have complained about Bad Bunny's stance on immigration enforcement, as well as the fact that he sings in Spanish. Turning Point USA even announced their plan to “counter program” Bad Bunny's performance with their own “All American Halftime Show.” (A performer has yet to be announced.)

	











	The Trump administration fueled the culture war outrage further, with Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem saying that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will be “all over” the 2026 Super Bowl. And Trump himself said, “I don't know why they're doing it, it's crazy, and then they blame it on some promoter that they hired to pick up entertainment. I think it's absolutely ridiculous.”

	Bad Bunny, for his part, has brushed off the backlash. While hosting the season premiere of Saturday Night Live, he joked during his monologue that “everyone is happy” about the show, “even Fox News.” 


	“I'm very excited to be doing the Super Bowl, and I know that people all around the world who love my music are also happy,” he said before continuing in Spanish. “Especially all the Latinos and Latinas in the whole world, and here in the United States, all the people who have worked to open doors, more than I have achieved, who have achieved everything, demonstrating that our way, our carrying of this country, no one can ever remove nor erase.”

If you're wondering what members of the French 75 chat about when they're not breaking immigrants out of detainment centers or robbing banks, the answer is astrology. Or at least that's what the cast of Paul Thomas Anderson's “One Battle After Another” discussed in between firing prop machine guns and driving getaway cars in the vigilante thriller.

“We were all of us just there, chatting up in between takes, talking about astrology, talking about full moons,” Shayna McHayle, who plays French 75 member Junglepussy, told IndieWire. “Teyana [Taylor] was saying something about Scorpios, and I'm like, ‘I'm a Scorpio,' and Leo[nardo DiCaprio]'s like, ‘Yeah, I'm a Scorpio.' It was this whole thing.”

For McHayle, spending time on the set of a blockbuster action film with A-list talent was quite surreal, and not something she sought out, but the experience was “written in the stars.” While she's previously appeared in two films, 2018's “Support the Girls” and 2023's “The Perfect Find,” she's predominantly a musician who raps under the stage name Junglepussy. After Anderson saw her on tour with Tame Impala in 2022, however, he was so inspired that he created a character, also named Junglepussy, just for McHayle.

 










“My agent reached out to me like, ‘Paul Thomas Anderson wants your number. Can I give it to him?' He wants to talk to you directly,” McHayle said. “I was like, ‘Who? OK, yeah, give him my number.'”

The pair then met several times in New York City over the next few years, with Anderson telling McHayle he was crafting a far-left vigilante based on her stage persona. 

“I didn't know that it was like Junglepussy for real until it really got close to locking in,” McHayle said. “He gave me a hard copy of the script, and when I read it, I was like, ‘What the…? What is this?' When I saw my name in there, and I saw my lyrics in there, and I just saw all these pussy references, I was gagged.”

Even before shooting, however, astrology was a key topic of conversation. “Teyana's a Sag. Regina [Hall]'s a Sag. Alana [Haim]'s a Sag,” McHayle said. “One day, me and Paul were texting before we started filming, and he thought I was a Sag too. He's like, ‘Yeah, you know I got all these badass Sagittarius women in the French 75,' and I was like, ‘Yeah, I'm a Scorpio.' He was like, ‘OK, you're fired.'”

After reading the “One Battle After Another” script, however, McHayle asked Anderson to make some changes to her character. “He's writing and directing, so he wants to control everything,” she said, “But I was just like, ‘Paul, I am Junglepussy. This is me. I have to be Junglepussy after this movie. I was Junglepussy before this movie, and while I love the collaboration here that you're cooking up, I still have some non-negotiables.' There were things that I was like, ‘OK, hard no on this. Junglepussy would never, like ever.'”

 










Crafting a character that was a mix of her real-life persona and a fictional French 75 radical required some nuance from McHayle as an actor. “Because he reached out to me directly, and was so inspired by my music, even ‘This pussy don't pop for you,' having it like as a sign in the movie, which is how I've been performing it for the past decade, I knew there were a lot of things that he was drawn to, and I wanted to keep that part of me alive in the role,” she said. “But I also wanted to do some things that I wouldn't usually do, like shooting a machine gun out of a moving vehicle, like robbing a bank.”

McHayle channeled her stage persona while filming, especially during her instantly iconic bank robbery monologue. Walking across the tellers' counter amid the chaos of a stick-up, McHayle delivers a speech that serves both as a mission statement for the French 75 as well as a nod to Junglepussy's work. It's here that she tells the world, “This pussy don't pop for you.” But filming in front of the entire cast and crew was daunting. 

“That day, I just had to channel the same energy I bring to the stage whenever I do a big show,” she said. “I just had to channel that energy and do my thing.”

McHayle is “still gagged” at the magnitude of the film, and the stunts in particular. “The stunts were scary,” she said, laughing, “Like the car chase scene, we were in the vehicles, like we were in it. When the minivan takes that hard left, we were in it…I'm not even, like, a rollercoaster kind of girl. I prefer a ride over a rollercoaster, but this was like a rollercoaster ride from hell.” 

 










“I know Warner Brothers didn't want to get in trouble with me,” she added about the movie's safety protocols. “I just had to let go and trust they knew what they were doing, because they know they have to keep us safe.”

While “One Battle After Another” may only be McHayle's third movie, it's her second working with Regina Hall, whom she acted alongside in “Support the Girls,” where they both played employees of a Hooters-esque establishment called Double Whammies. McHayle described the reunion as “a dream.” 

“She is such a calming force,” McHayle gushes, “The role she plays as Deandra [in ‘One Battle After Another'] is just like steady, grounded. That's the literal energy she gives me when we work together on set. I just feel super calm around her. She's an OG, like that's my girl, just big sis vibes, like just super nurturing. I'm just like, ‘Girl, I can't believe this is my second movie with you.' Love her for life.”

McHayle is now manifesting a third Regina Hall collab and one “with more screentime for both of us.” She's also rooting for Hall to earn an Oscar for her performance. “She is truly such a force,” McHayle said. “I need her getting that Oscar. No pressure, but I want her to have it.” 

After filming wrapped in early 2024, McHayle had to wait patiently for over a year before she finally got to watch “One Battle After Another.” She was invited to a private screening at the IMAX theater at New York's Lincoln Square AMC for a morning viewing. “It was like me and some of the Christmas Adventurers, Tony Goldwyn and them,” she said. “We're in this big-ass theater, and everybody's in their own row and taking it all in.” 

 










McHayle brought a coffee and a croissant and, during her first watch, was mostly just assessing how much of her work made the final cut. “I was there ticking my boxes,” she said. “Like I know what I did, and I know what I didn't do. Now let's see what's in here. When I saw all the pieces just remained, I was like, ‘Oh, Paul is a real one. He was serious,' because you never know for real until it's done.”

Since her first screening, where she admitted to being “over-caffeinated” and “overstimulated,” she's seen the movie five more times, including in VistaVision. She's still “gagged” by the whole process, and knows there will be more to come. 

“For some reason, whenever I do me, do my music, make my art, I'm attracting these opportunities,” she said. “I'm just staying super open to expanding my acting career, because it's obviously something I can't run from, hide from, like it just keeps popping up. I am going to surrender to the process and to the full spectrum of my gifts, my artistry, and just keep being me.” 

Hopefully, that means Shayna McHayle x Regina Hall 3.0 in the near future. 

“One Battle After Another” is now in theaters from Warner Bros. Pictures.

The Latin star surprised the world in 2022 when he announced his retirement — but now he's back, with a renewed faith and a commitment to make "music with a purpose."


													By
												

	Leila Cobo


Chief Content Officer Latin/Español, Billboard


At some point during the past turbulent months, as he searched for purpose and faced the pressures of a very public divorce that engulfed both his personal and professional life, the music stopped for Raymond Ayala.


	“For the first time in my life, the muse shut down,” says the man long known as Daddy Yankee. “That had never happened to me before. Ever.”

	











	It wasn't supposed to be like this. In 2022, Daddy Yankee — that rare artist who has garnered both vast commercial success and respect from artists and the industry alike — surprised the world when he announced his retirement from music. He released what was supposed to be his last studio album, Legendaddy, and performed what was set to be his last tour, grossing $197.8 million and selling 1.9 million tickets, then the second-highest-grossing Latin tour in Billboard Boxscore history. But Ayala was spent.


	Then, on Dec. 3, 2023, at the tour's final date at Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot in San Juan, he made yet another shocking revelation: “Tonight, I recognize, and I'm not ashamed to tell the whole world, that Jesus lives in me and I live for him,” he told the 15,000 fans that packed his hometown venue. “A story ends and a new story begins.”


	Ayala immediately started spreading the word of the Lord, in music and in deed. He released songs brimming with positivity, traveled on missions to Africa, made impromptu appearances in churches in Puerto Rico and other Latin countries and saw firsthand the reaction to his new brand of “music with a purpose,” culminating with a Latin Grammy win for best urban song for “Bonita” (Pretty), a non-album single released in 2023.

	











	But in December 2024, Ayala's wife of nearly 30 years filed for divorce, and an initially amicable split turned sour amid a spate of legal disputes over his many businesses and assets, including his past catalog negotiations. Making music became even more difficult.


	“But it was part of the process to arrive at a total dependency on God,” Ayala now says. “He said, ‘Even if your muse is gone, remember, I am your muse. I am your inspiration.' Today, I'm making music and I'm building a new catalog.”


	I'm chatting with Ayala in a private dining room at a Brooklyn hotel — his first interview with the press since he announced his conversion to Christianity — over tea and fruit. He is 49 years old, but his trim physique (later, he'll go to the gym with pal J Balvin) and youthful, unlined face display none of the travails of an artist who grew up in Puerto Rico's housing projects and whose music career was jump-started by a gunshot to the leg that ended a promising baseball run.


	As Daddy Yankee, Ayala is widely recognized as the man who catapulted reggaetón from underground genre to global movement, in large part thanks to his 2004 smash, “Gasolina,” and the relentless string of global hits that followed. Today, he has 105 entries — including seven No. 1s — on the Hot Latin Songs chart, among them “Despacito” alongside Luis Fonsi and his most recent, “Sonríele” (Smile), which is currently charting. At the time of publication, Daddy Yankee was the No. 37 most listened-to artist on Spotify despite the fact that he has released only a few singles in the past two years.


	That is a testament to the power of the name and the man. “Without Daddy Yankee, there would be no J Balvin,” Balvin says. “He was, and continues to be, the source of inspiration that has so propelled me to elevate urban music to a global level.”

	











	Now Ayala has embarked on a dramatically different second act, with Jesus as a centerpiece and the goal of releasing music that's commercially successful but is “music with a purpose,” as he calls it, rather than religious music with evangelical lyrics.


	“Having a life of success is different from having a life of purpose,” Ayala replies when I ask what prompted his conversion and the ensuing shift in direction. “Before, my interest was transforming the industry [through music], and that purpose had to do more with business and money, influence, success. Now my purpose is to transform lives with that same instrument. They're very different purposes.”


	But the vehicle is still the same. On Oct. 23, Ayala will perform as Daddy Yankee at the Billboard Latin Music Awards, his first televised performance in three years. And he will release Lamento En Baile (Mourning Into Dancing), his first album since 2022 — and his first since publicly converting – on Oct. 16. The title comes from Psalm 30:11, which says, “You have turned my mourning into dancing,” and dovetails with its first focus track, “Sonríele,” a peppy merengue brimming with optimism.


	It's the first track Ayala has released under DY Publishing, as well as the first step in rebuilding his catalog. In October 2024, Concord purchased key elements of his music publishing and master-recording catalog, including chart-topping hits “Gasolina,” “Con Calma” and “Despacito.” According to Concord's website and Billboard reports, the agreement encompasses work from 2002 through 2019 and includes certain name, image and likeness rights. Prior to that acquisition, Billboard reported that parts of his catalog had been quietly acquired around 2021 by Cinq Music and a private fund that asked not to be named, which then sold those assets to Concord. (Concord, Cinq and Ayala himself decline to comment about specifics of the deals.)

	











	“Someone like [Daddy Yankee], someone who is as prolific as he is productive, we imagine it will happen fairly quickly,” says Jorge Mejía, president/CEO of Sony Music Publishing Latin America and U.S. Latin, which continues to administer all songs written by Ayala for the world. “This is not an unusual situation for us. Artists inevitably evolve throughout their careers — growth, change and reinvention are all part of the creative journey.”


	Ayala is releasing his new music on his own DY Records through a license deal with HYBE Latin America, which announced the signing in July in tandem with the release of “Sonríele” and is betting big on Daddy Yankee as its first major and established artist. “Obviously, partnering with [Daddy Yankee] is extremely important for us,” HYBE Latin America COO Juan Sebastián Arenas says. “We're partnering with a music icon, supporting a new project. Our goal is to tell the industry we're here to do something new. There's no one better than [him] to accomplish that.”


	Likewise, in HYBE, Ayala found a label partner that's young (HYBE Latin America launched in 2023), inquisitive and eager to break molds. This summer, Ayala, who has a big following in Asia, went to South Korea for the first time and shot the video to his upcoming single “El Toque,” incorporating elements of Korean dance.


	“I am my own manager now and I'm managing myself 100% alone, and I have good allies,” Ayala says. “HYBE is a good ally. They have a progressive mentality and they're in constant reinvention. That's very compatible with my new vision.”


If you listen closely, it's clear the seeds of Ayala's conversion were planted in his music long ago. On 2007's “Coraza Divina” (Divine Shield), for example, an autobiographic rap set over salsa tumbao that narrates his rise from the hood, he named a higher power: “Evil realized he was the chosen child and sought to destroy him/But you know what? I have a divine shield, the power to light my path,” he says in the chorus.


	“Many people don't know that I converted to the Lord for the first time at 19 years old,” Ayala says. “But I diverged from the path. My lyrics were clean, but I knew they belonged to the world, [not to God].”

	











	Still, in a genre rife with sexually graphic lyrics that often glorify drugs and violence, Ayala always stood out as a rapper with a conscience who delivered mostly G-rated material, but nevertheless oozed swagger and braggadocio. The strategy let him open the door for reggaetón to find success among mainstream Latin audiences and beyond: He was the first Latin urban artist to consistently place hit songs on radio when that medium was the key driver to success.


	But clearly, the content of Ayala's music went deeper than a commercial play. On 2004's Barrio Fino, the breakout album that includes “Gasolina,” there were tracks that referenced God and resilience. It's a theme that appears again and again in his work — through to 2016, when, unbeknown to the public, he privately converted. He didn't announce it, he says, “because I had many agreements I had signed and committed to” — label deals, recordings with other artists, brand deals, a major tour — “and I had to deliver.”


	Ayala is known for keeping his word. He's a man of habit and discipline: makes his bed every morning, works out, reads, eats healthy, goes to the studio, repeats. As the “Big Boss” of reggaetón and the urban movement itself, he couldn't conceive of not fulfilling his contractual obligations. So he kept his allegiance to Christ to himself, until that 2023 show where he told the world about his new path.


	“I wanted to get to where I am now and not owe anything to anyone,” he says. “I wanted to be in peace and complete liberty.”

	











	And he was, for a while.


Daddy Yankee's reentry into the world of music as an artist led by faith in Jesus initially appeared seamless. He returned with the single “Bonita,” an uptempo reggaetón fused with horns and merengue that was all about positivity and happiness.


	It was the first of a handful of tracks distributed through SoundOn, TikTok's distribution and marketing platform, prior to his HYBE deal, and it benefited from TikTok support and exposure. Users have created over 1.2 million videos with “Bonita,” which generated over 1.1 billion views, and Daddy Yankee-posted content got more than 48.5 million likes, 1.7 million comments and over 3.8 million shares.


	The fact was, Ayala had announced his retirement from music in 2022. “The perception was that Yankee had retired and [now] we wanted to say he hadn't,” says Gabriel Llano, head of artist services for U.S. Latin and Latin America at SoundOn at TikTok. “When he made this musical shift, we wanted users to take those songs of his with positive messages to tell their own stories.”


	After “Bonita,” Ayala released “Donante de Sangre,” a rap track where he addressed his conversion head-on for the first time. The song, which was also a metaphor for life, was used for a Red Cross blood donation campaign in Mexico, adding a dimension of social good to his new music.


	Other like-minded singles trickled out, even as, in October 2024, Concord announced its purchase of parts of Daddy Yankee's catalog. Then, on Dec. 2, 2024, Ayala made yet another surprise announcement.


	“After more than two decades of marriage and after many months of trying to save my marriage, which my wife and I share, today my lawyers respond to the divorce petition received [from] Mireddys,” he wrote in a letter shared to Instagram, referring to Mireddys González, his longtime wife and high school sweetheart. “I'm grateful for the time we shared, full of blessings and values, of love and with a beautiful family that will continue to be our priority.”


	González was not only Ayala's wife but also the president of his label, El Cartel Records, and a member of its board of directors. Within weeks of the divorce announcement, on Dec. 17, Ayala filed two legal motions seeking an injunction against González and her sister Ayeicha González-Castellanos (El Cartel's secretary/treasurer), alleging they withdrew tens of millions of dollars from his business bank accounts without authorization, according to court documents.

	











	It was the first of a series of back-and-forth complaints, some of which are still in litigation, that have been reported widely by the press and touch many aspects of Ayala's career and assets, including information surrounding the initial sale of catalog assets in 2021.


	Although the cases are public, Ayala has not spoken about them — save for perfunctory comments as he's gone in and out of court in Puerto Rico — and he declined to answer questions now. But he has definitely learned some things.


	“Be on top of everything, even if you have lawyers and accountants,” Ayala says. “Now I'm alone, so I have to be 100% [involved]. Things I used to delegate, I don't delegate anymore. It's my responsibility, and I feel good and I feel I've learned so much more. You think you know everything about the music business and the rules keep changing. The smallest things can make a great difference.”


	And, he cautions new artists, male and female: “Even if you're not famous or successful and your career is only beginning, get married with a prenup. Music is unpredictable.”


Whatever challenges Ayala has faced over the course of his lengthy career, they've been impossible to discern from the outside. Through the years he's been unflappable, even-keeled, scandal-free. He has never even been attacked on social media — a feat in this day and age. But the past year shook him up.

	











	“I've always taken good care of myself, [but now] I've learned to give myself more self-love,” he muses when I ask what he has taken from this experience. “It's very important to be clear on what self-love is and establish limits. All kinds of healthy limits. Learn how to say no. I learned that we sacrifice ourselves for many people, and you do it so much that you normalize it. And that's not the way it should be. You need to set limits. I've learned to be more assertive.”


	When I point out I always found him assertive, he nods. “I've always been assertive with those outside my close circle. But you also need to set limits on those close to you.”


	And eventually, Ayala learned how to make music again.


	“I never thought I'd be in this situation, but I found myself in it,” he says. “And the strength I found to record an album full of joy in the most unexpected moment of my life is what helped me regain my strength. When we're in the middle of a crisis, one of our biggest fortitudes lies in adoring and praising the Lord because it brings joy.”


	Despite the change in content and the change in purpose, Ayala intends to tackle the marketing and promotion of his “music with a purpose” with every tool at his disposal, something that has proved tricky in the Latin world for religious artists who previously made secular music. Many Latin acts, particularly from Puerto Rico, are devout Christians but don't share their beliefs in their music. And many others have publicly announced their conversions and released evangelical music with mixed results.


	“From a programming perspective … it will all depend on the lyrics,” iHeartLatino senior vp of programming Pedro Javier González says. “Yankee is being smart in how he's handling it. He knows he has global impact and is looking for the best way to take the message without alienating anyone. Up to now, it's been positive lyrics that don't sound religious. A lot of people are looking for this kind of content.”


	HYBE's Arenas agrees. “HYBE likes to send positive messages to the world, and I do see a trend coming with inspirational music, music that has undertones of faith,” he says. “We've seen it in the Anglo world, and we're starting to see it in Latin as well. I think there's an audience for these fans, but the right platform for the music hasn't existed before.”


	For Ayala, it's simply part of who he is now.

	











	“Everyone who's inside the faith has to go to the world and preach the gospel,” he says, an obligation that applies to all, not just pastors or evangelizers. “I can't simply convert and stay silent, you know? This isn't simply making Christian music; the challenge is to make the kingdom part of pop culture. My vision [in the past] was to transform the industry when they told me I couldn't. Now I'm in the same situation with a different purpose: revolutionize and reinvent.”

The rapper paid loving tribute to the neo soul icon who died at 51 on Tuesday (Oc. 14) following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.

Lauryn Hill and D'Angelo were like twin stars birthing a new R&B universe in the late 1990s. The pair released just one collaboration, 1998's sensual, seductive “Nothing Even Matters” from Hill's Grammy-winning debut solo album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, but the song, and their friendship, clearly made a huge impression on the former Fugees rapper/singer.

	











	In an emotional post paying homage to D'Angelo in the wake of the singer's death at 51 on Tuesday (Oct. 14) due to pancreatic cancer, Hill lavished praise on D'Angelo for being a beacon of light for music, and fellow Black men, while lamenting that she didn't have more precious moments with the enigmatic “Brown Sugar” star.


	“People need reflection. I regret not having more time with you. Your undeniable beauty and talent were not of this world, and a presence not of this world needs protection in a world that covets light and the anointing of God,” Hill wrote. “You sir, moved us, stirred us, inspired and even intimidated others to action with your genius.”


	She added, “Thank you for being a beacon of light to a generation and beyond who had no remembrance of the legacy that preceded us. Thank you for charting the course and for making space during a time when no similar space really existed.”


	Though D'Angelo only released three albums in his lifetime, his beloved 1995 debut, Brown Sugar, followed by 2000's Voodoo and 2014's Black Messiah, Hill wrote that the singer's aching vulnerability and incomparable passion moved, and inspired, the culture. “You imaged a unity of strength and sensitivity in Black manhood to a generation that only saw itself as having to be one or the other,” Hill wrote. 

	











	“It is my earnest prayer that you are in peace, far away from selfishness, fear and/or controlling interests,” she added. “Far from possessiveness, far from greed, far from manipulation, far from exploitation, far from intentionally designed chaos and that you Brother are in peace, in bliss and in eternal light and fulfillment with our Father in heaven. I Love you and I miss you. May God grant peace and shelter to your family, true friends and genuine appreciators, Brother, King.”


	The post included a series of pictures of D'Angelo in the studio, as well as a snap of the two musicians in which D is giving one of his classic pensive, knowing looks and Hill is smiling as the pair lean their heads together. In a 2008 interview with Rolling Stone, D'Angelo reflected on his studio time with Hill, calling her “warm and sweet” and revealing that the original plan was to show up on each other's projects.


	“Originally, we were going to swap tunes for each other's projects because I was working on Voodoo at the same time and my keyboardist James Poyser was also working with her,” he said at the time of the producer/songwriter who has been a member of the Roots since 2009 and who has produced and written songs for a constellation of neo soul giants including Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Common and others. “I went to her house in New Jersey, she played a lot of songs for me and gave me a rough copy to listen to. When Lauryn and I went into in the studio together, I laid down my vocals in the course of an hour.


	Hill joined an emotional chorus of friends, fans and fellow musicians who paid tribute to D'Angelo on Tuesday, a roster that included Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Tyler, the Creator, Missy Elliott, Doja Cat, DJ Premiere and many more.

The star who retired from acting in 2017 spoke at a packed Screen Talk at the BFI London Film Festival, where he was joined by his director son Ronan.

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Daniel Day-Lewis was back in the London spotlight for the first time in years on Wednesday, appearing at a jam-packed Screen Talk as part of the 69th edition of the BFI London Film Festival (LFF) where he was welcomed with a rousing ovation after signing autographs for fans before the event.


	Discussing his return to acting after eight years in family drama Anemone, directed by his son Ronan Day-Lewis, and his career, the three-time Oscar winner shared: “It began with a pure wish really to work with Ronan” to address the “sadness” of maybe not getting to do so in film otherwise. He described the film as an exploration of brotherhood and the reuniting of estranged siblings.

	“The lack of need for words” is what interested him, and understanding his character's army career trajectory was key for him to unlock the character, who is chasing his brother, and his behavior.


Anemone follows a middle-aged man, portrayed by Sean Bean, on his journey into the woods, where he reconnects with his estranged hermit brother, played by Day-Lewis. Samantha Morton also stars in the movie. Day-Lewis previously shared that he had “certain reservations about being back in the public world again” by starring in the film, but that his son “made it pretty clear that he wasn't going to do it if I didn't do it.”

	











	The project from Focus Features had its world premiere at the New York Film Festival. The movie is the feature directorial debut of Ronan Day-Lewis and was co-written by him and his father.


	In a wide-ranging discussion, the star was asked on Wednesday about how he has gotten into the physicality of many of his roles, such as My Left Foot. He eased into that one with “very gentle steps,” he shared. “I thought of the wheelchair as a cage … and I began to work a lot with my foot.”


	Asked about his approach to acting, Day-Lewis said that immersion “to me makes sense,” but other actors can do great work without that, “and hats off to them.” He emphasized that “I still find that process a joyful thing. We're playing games for a living.”


	The star also argued that criticism of method acting in recent years has at times been portrayed like a cult, saying such comments often come from people who don't really understand it. “It is invariably from people that have little or no understanding of what it actually involves,” Day-Lewis said. “It's almost like some special science that we're involved in, or a cult, but it's just a way of freeing yourself [for] the spontaneity when you are working with your colleagues in front of the camera, so that you are free to respond in any way that you're moved to in that moment.”


	The star emphasized that he came into My Left Foot without the screen experience he could have used. ”I was clueless,” he said, drawing laughter. “I didn't have a fucking clue what I was doing.”

	











	Back when he went to acting school, theater was considered the “elite cultural form,” while film was seen as “dodgy,” and TV got the reaction of “really?!” he recalled. “It always bugged the hell out of me that we were basically performing for a group of privileged people,” he said about his feelings towards such attitudes.


	To more laughs, he shared how “Stephen Frears was exasperated with me,” because Day-Lewis always needs something “real” to be able to stay in the illusion and in the sphere of acting. For example, he would, in a role, stop sweeping the floor once it was clean, to the director's frustration, Day-Lewis said.


	Asked about his long creative relationship with Jim Sheridan, he shared: “I met Jim, and I basically had a crush on him within 10 minutes.”


	He also mentioned on Wednesday how he “revered Marlon Brando,” among other actors. And he shared: “I had a crush on Mary Poppins. Julie Andrews, I mean,” he also shared. That and Zulu were two of his favorite films when he was young.


	The role that changed his life when he viewed it was Dai Bradley in Kes. “It remains one of the greatest performances,” he said before expressing hos “admiration for Ken Loach.”


	The star also discussed working with writer-director Rebecca Miller, now his wife, on The Ballad of Jack and Rose and now his son. “There was never any question about … a conflict of interest” between family and work roles in both cases, he concluded. Both movies were “experiences that people will remember happily,” he said.

	











	Ronan Day-Lewis joined the on-stage discussion for the final 20 minutes, sharing that the shoot for Anemone, much of which takes place in a shed, was “claustrophobic” but also “incredibly intimate.”


	The two wrote the script together, with Day-Lewis senior mentioning that he can't really type. But his son also saw another benefit of working with his father, explaining the familial collaboration this way: ”It takes the edge off because you know they will give you the benefit of the doubt,” as long as you have a good relationship. Added his father: “It was a joyful experience to have this time together.”


	Ronan Day-Lewis highlighted how David Lynch has influenced him and how he shared with the legendary filmmaker the interest in “exploring darkness” without “existing in darkness.”


	Asked about funny moments in Anemone, his father said, among other things, that he found the idea of ”shitting on a priest” that is mentioned in one scene really “hilarious.”


	Daniel Day-Lewis recently admitted he regretted announcing his retirement following his role in Paul Thomas Anderson's 2017 film Phantom Thread. “Looking back on it now — I would have done well to just keep my mouth shut, for sure,” he told Rolling Stone. “It just seems like such grandiose gibberish to talk about. I never intended to retire, really. I just stopped doing that particular type of work so I could do some other work.”


	The star also shared final words of advice for young actors on Wednesday, before a farewell standing ovation. “A lot of young actors, especially if they're lucky enough – when you get chances, people want to keep coming for you. They keep looking for you as long as the money's coming in,” Day-Lewis said. “And so it takes a certain steadiness in yourself to say, ‘No, I need to just do this the only way I know how.' And I did just do it the only way I knew how.”

	Start with the laundry. Of the many times Bob Mould‘s band Sugar unexpectedly found itself at the center of pop culture in the Nineties, one in particular springs to mind for him: a 1992 festival in Belgium where Sugar were on the same bill as Metallica, Neil Young and Crazy Horse, Lenny Kravitz, and the Black Crowes. For Mould, who emerged from indie rock the previous decade with Minneapolis' mighty Hüsker Dü, it was far from a typical gig. “Being on the periphery of the excess of those times was pretty crazy,” he says. “It was very, very different than jumping in a van and doing a punk rock tour. It was like, ‘So, Metallica bring washers and dryers out with them. I get it now.'”


	Compared with his years in Hüsker Dü and the many decades after on his own, Sugar were a streaking comet in Mould's career: two albums and one EP in two years, then over and out. But within that compressed time, Sugar brought Mould, bassist David Barbe, and drummer Malcolm Travis as close to the mainstream as Mould would ever get. In addition to that Belgium festival, the band played others with headliners like the Cure, powering through sandblasters like “If I Can't Change Your Mind,” “JC Auto,” and “Your Favorite Thing,” which found a home on alt-rock radio.

	











	Now, 30 years after Sugar played their last show — and more than a dozen years after an attempted but abandoned reunion — the band has returned. The group teased something was in the works on social media last week and this week unveiled a newly recorded raver, “House of Dead Memories.” There are shows announced in London and New York, too, set for May 2026.

	Ironically, Sugar weren't even originally intended to be a band. Mould's first post-Hüskers album, Workbook, was critically lauded — “See a Little Light” was a college radio hit and found its way onto soundtracks — but the follow-up, the bleaker and tenser Black Sheets of Rain, received a more muted response. Mould plowed on, recruiting former Mercyland bassist Barbe and Human Switchboard and Zulus drummer Travis as his new rhythm section. As they were rehearsing in Athens, Georgia, to make a Mould album, the trio were invited to play a one-off show at the 40 Watt Club there.

	“We were like, ‘Sure, why not?'” Mould says. “It was already feeling like a band.” Next came a name, inspired by a packet on a coffee-shop table, and Mould unexpectedly had his first group after the glorious but often fraught ride that was Hüsker Dü. “I knew David and Malcom and their abilities and personalities, and I thought, ‘I bet this will work — I think it should work,'” he recalls. “And it did work.”


	Released in 1992, just after Nirvana's Nevermind and Pearl Jam's Ten messed with everyone's expectations of how rock could sound and sell, Sugar's debut, Copper Blue, was the right record at the right moment in the culture. “I was over in Europe in the summer of '91, playing a lot of festivals with Nirvana and Dinosaur Jr., and the table was getting set then for everything,” he says. “And to have Nirvana blow up like that, at the moment I'm coming back with a power-pop thing as opposed to what Workbook and Black Sheets were: I wish I could say, ‘Oh yeah, I knew this was coming.'”


	While not quite Nevermind in terms of sales, Copper Blue introduced Mould and his raging voice and guitar to a raft of Lollapalooza-minded kids — who probably didn't know much about his previous band but loved Mould's razor-edged songs and the MTV-friendly videos that accompanied them. “I got my ass handed to me a little bit by Black Sheets of Rain, so I went into Sugar with a little bit of ‘I'll show everybody,'” he says. “And everything sort of blew up immediately. I didn't wish for it, but when it happened It was like, ‘Well, here we are.'”


	With Sugar's success, Mould was thrust into a world of big-league alt-rock he'd only slightly experienced before. “It was a crazy time,” he says. “Whether I was in the office or doing press or writing and recording in the studio, I did not have a life beyond keeping that rocket in the sky for as long as I could. I wasn't a stranger to mainstream stuff, since Hüsker Dü was on The Joan Rivers Show. But when it's coming at you every day, that was sort of wild.”

	Late in 1994, Barbe told Mould he wanted to spend more time with his family, and the timing proved right for Sugar to wind down: A few months before, Kurt Cobain had killed himself. “Kurt's passing really hit me personally,” Mould says. “Sugar were in Atlanta, working in the studio, and to see Kurt Loder pop up on the TV and say, ‘Kurt Cobain is dead,' it was pretty demoralizing. It made me wonder, ‘What is this?' Kurt's situation was unique to him but not dissimilar to what was starting to happen when young people get really successful and lose track of things. And I thought, ‘Wow, this business is sort of harsh.'”


	Sugar played one week of shows in Japan early in 1995 and called it a day, with Travis moving on to other bands and Barbe shifting to academia (he currently teaches music business at the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business). In the 30 years since, Mould has made innumerable records on his own, ventured into DJ'ing and electronica, wrote scripts for World Championship Wrestling, and toured and recorded regularly with his current rhythm section, Jason Narducy and Jon Wurster. Sugar first resurfaced in 2011, as the 20th anniversary of Copper Blue approached. Mould, Barbe, and Travis got together and rehearsed for a possible reunion, but the musical vibe was not as inspiring as Mould had hoped. “I was a little resistant to the idea of going out on a 20-year thing,” he says. “I know a lot of people were doing it. So we got together and took a shot at it, and I think we all walked away thinking, ‘Eh, not right now.' At least for me, it was like, ‘I think I'm going to do what I'm doing.'”


	Last fall, as he was working what would be his next record, Here We Go Crazy, Mould began to sense a surge of interest in his old band, from music business folks who sensed a market and BMG, which was planning a Copper Blue reissue and a Sugar singles collection. “Fans have always shown interest,” he says. “But people in the business, whether it was BMG to different promoters around the country, were voicing things.” 


	Mould and Barbe had toured together, playing separate sets, but a year ago, the trio reconvened once more, at Barbe's Athens, Georgia, studio to play the old material. “This second time felt much, much better for all three of us, personally and as a former band,” Mould says. “So we started looking at getting back together to do a few things.”

	











	Earlier this year, they took the next step. When the band reformed 14 years ago, Mould had just written “House of Dead Memories,” which he never recorded but unearthed for Sugar's resurrection. “It's a failed-relationship song, nothing too unique for me,” he says with a chuckle. “But the riff is definitely a Sugar-type riff, and it was fun to get the three of us on the floor together to record for the first time in ages.” So much so, apparently, that the take of “House of Dead Memories” we're hearing is the first one. 


	In a curious bit of timing, another part of Mould's past will be resurfacing this fall. Arriving next month is 1985: The Miracle Year, a collection of unreleased Hüsker Dü live recordings from that pivotal moment in the band's history. Centered around a tape of an entire set recorded at Minneapolis' First Avenue club in January of that year, and fleshed out with other recordings from 1985, the album captures the blistering roar, frenetic energy, and punchy songs that Mould, Greg Norton, and the late Grant Hart made (along with covers of Donovan's “Sunshine Superman,” the Beatles' “Ticket to Ride” and “Helter Skelter,” and “Love Is All Around,” the Mary Tyler Moore Show theme song). It's a sound that, decades later, still surprised Mould when he heard the restored tapes. 


	“I was pretty speechless,” he says. “At that period, we were firing on so many cylinders at once that I never had a moment to stop and think. I just knew we were the best. I didn't know how much fire we had, so to hear it close to 40 years later, I was like, ‘Jesus Christ, this is insane.'”


	As Mould has talked about and written about in his memoir See a Little Light, Hüsker Dü could be an insane experience unto itself, thanks to tension between Mould and Hart, but the time frame of the collection brought back largely positive memories. “What we did in January '85 is in such contrast to whatever collapse happened in December of '87 and whatever animus happened in the decades after,” he says. “Grant and I were in touch, but it was a complicated, complex situation. We were very strong-minded, very stubborn, opinionated young men in a band. But 1985 was the year New Day Rising came out, and going into the summer Grant and I took full control of everything and we made ‘Makes No Sense at All' and then Flip Your Wig. Those were good times.”

	Mould particularly feels the absence of Hart (who died in 2017 of liver cancer) in the album's packaging. “Grant was always in charge of the art department, and it's been tough,” he says. “When a new designer comes along, I'm like, ‘Well, let me think about what Grant would have think of this.' People step in and do what they can. But for me personally, it's always, ‘What would Grant do with this?' It's a big chair to fill.”

	











	As far as Sugar, Mould says the response to their reunion announcement and “House of Dead Memories” will determine what to do beyond the two sets of concerts already set. “I don't want to get out too far in front of the skis, as they say,” he says. “People's reactions will probably guide a lot of the possibilities in front of us, whether it's more songs or more shows. All three of us are all in for whatever feels right. I just want to see if people are still interested.”

Promise, the AI studio backed by Google, Peter Chernin's North Road and Michael Ovitz's Crossbeam, is launching The Generation Company, led by Nem Perez, to bring visual effects to traditional studios.

	An AI entertainment studio backed by the likes of Google, Andreessen Horowitz, Peter Chernin's North Road Company and Michael Ovitz's Crossbeam wants to bring its generative AI expertise to traditional studios and production companies.


Promise, led by Fullscreen founder George Strompolos, former YouTube executive Jamie Byrne, who most recently led creator partnerships for YouTube; and AI filmmaker Dave Clark, is launching a new division called The Generation Company, which will work with outside studios and production companies to deliver visual effects and sequences created with its tech.

	The Generation Company will be led by filmmaker and generative AI artist Nem Perez, who previously founded the virtual production and AI workflow company Storyblocker, and also directed music videos for the likes of Mac Miller, Nipsey Hussle, and Chance the Rapper.

	“With The Generation Company, Promise is bringing our GenAI filmmaking expertise to partners as a true creative ally, helping them achieve their vision and push ideas beyond the limits of traditional resources, timelines, and budgets,” said Byrne, the co-founder, president and COO of Promise. “Nem is a pioneer in applying GenAI to filmmaking, building on a career leading creative teams across entertainment, advertising, and music. His work with some of the world's top GenAI artists makes him uniquely positioned to help storytellers navigate this new frontier with both artistry and precision.”

	











	“I believe GenAI exists to serve the artist, opening the door to cinematic moments that might otherwise be impossible,” adds Perez, head of The Generation Company. “For me, it's about honoring the craft I've devoted my career to while embracing new tools that expand what's possible on screen. With human expression driving everything we do, filmmakers and creative partners who work with The Generation Company can bring their full vision to life on their own terms.”


	In addition to VFX and sequences, the company will also provide a team of AI specialists meant to advise creative departments like art, costume, props, and storyboarding.


	Promise was founded last year with the goal of building out a slate of films and series using generative AI tech. Earlier this year it raised more money, with Google and Crossbeam joining its list of investors, while also making its first acquisition: The tech-centric film school Curious Refuge, which teaches filmmakers how ton utilize advanced technology in their workflows.


	The Generation Company expands Promise's business further into the services world, seeking a piece of the production puzzle that has been most disrupted by technology, as studios seek more realistic and elaborate VFX while also seeking to manage costs.

What now? Can they keep their friendships alive when they are dispersed across a city that seems to want them dead? Can they find a six out of ten or higher to have bad sex with? Can they get their shit together when the world is so obviously falling apart? Probably not. But they're going to have fun trying.”

Justin Timberlake has paid tribute to D'Angelo, whose three solo albums — his debut, Brown Sugar, 2000's Voodoo, and 2014's Black Messiah — reshaped the landscape of soul music and helped ignite a new era. Following D'Angelo's passing on Oct. 14 at 51, Timberlake shared how the visionary's work impacted his own musical journey and how he had the opportunity to meet him backstage at Radio City Music Hall.


	“I'll never forget hearing Brown Sugar for the first time. It changed me. You changed me,” wrote Timberlake in his letter posted to Instagram Stories, calling the record the “most pivotal moment in establishing confidence in my own voice.” 


	“For the first time, I heard a sound that reflected the sounds I grew up with — early R&B but now it was intertwined with a modern edge,” he continued. “The chords and arrangement carried a mixture of church/jazz/funk, the harmonies delicately dancing with one another. It sat in my spirit and always will.”

	Timberlake went on to praise Voodoo as his “favorite mixed album of all time.” He added, “The legendary players and collaborators. The sounds, the way it made colors dance around my head. It grabbed me. It shook me. I was changed once again.” 

	











	The “Selfish” singer also said that the Voodoo tour stop at Radio City was “one of the best concerts” of his life. “You. Quest. Pino. Poyser. And everyone on that stage had just ripped the faces off that crowd,” Timberlake reminisced. “And then I was lucky enough to grab a sacred moment with you backstage. And tell you how in awe of you I was.” The singer said that his previously posted photo of him and D'Angelo was taken at that exact moment and when they met, he was “kind, under-spoken.” Timberlake added, “I will never forget that.”

	











	While Timberlake said he could go on about D'Angelo's breadth of work including his “favorite Lauryn collab,” to “put it the way I know best in this moment: you took R&B and put it in all capitals.”

	“Your contribution will always be remembered. Sending love and prayers to your family. You will be missed deeply. 1 of 1. Rip trailblazer,” wrote Timberlake before signing off, “With love. One of your biggest fans.”


	Timberlake joins a flood of artists across genres that have honored D'Angelo in tributes including Lauryn Hill, Beyoncé, Nile Rodgers, Missy Elliott, and more.

Ego Nwodim has landed her first show following her exit from Saturday Night Live.


	The stand-up comedian will perform at Lincoln Center Theater's Claire Tow Theater in New York City. The show will run from November 19 through November 23, with tickets going on sale on October 20 at 10 a.m. ET.


	Nwodim's show will be part of The Comedy Series programming, which will also feature Vir Das, Jerrod Carmichael, and Sam Jay. The series is described as “a chance for these artists to test boundaries, shape new material, and explore the space between humor and truth.”


	“No two performances will be the same—because the creative process isn't a straight line, and neither is this show. It's comedy that's evolving before your eyes,” reads the press release.

	Although Nwodim was expected to return to SNL Season 51, she announced her exit from the NBC late-night show after being part of the cast for seven seasons.

	“The hardest part of a great party is knowing when to say goodnight,” she wrote in an Instagram post confirming her departure. “But after seven unforgettable seasons, I have decided to leave SNL. I am immensely grateful to Lorne [Michaels] for the opportunity, to my castmates, the writers, and the crew for their brilliance, support, and friendship. Week after week on that stage taught me more than I could have ever imagined, and I will carry those memories, and that laughter, with me always.”

	Before the release of Lauryn Hill's masterful solo debut, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, the singer met with D'Angelo to record one of the album's most captivating tracks, “Nothing Even Matters.” The duet would play a part in expanding and nurturing soul's rebirth in the Nineties, while both artists as individuals would make even deeper impacts felt across genres today. Hill's record took home five Grammy Awards, while D'Angelo would go on to release 2000's Voodoo and 2014's Black Messiah (following his own debut, Brown Sugar).


	On Tuesday, Hill penned a letter to D'Angelo following the visionary's passing on Oct. 14 at the age of 51 following a long battle with cancer.  “People need reflection,” began Hill in her tribute. “I regret not having more time with you,” she continued. “Your undeniable beauty and talent were not of this world, and a presence not of this world needs protection in a world that covets light and the anointing of God. You sir, moved us, stirred us, inspired and even intimidated others to action with your genius.”

	She continued, “Thank you for being a beacon of light to a generation and beyond who had no remembrance of the legacy that preceded us. Thank you for charting the course and for making space during a time when no similar space really existed. You imaged a unity of strength and sensitivity in Black manhood to a generation that only saw itself as having to be one or the other.”

	“It is my earnest prayer that you are in peace, far away from selfishness, fear and/or controlling interests. Far from possessiveness, far from greed, far from manipulation, far from exploitation, far from intentionally designed chaos and that you Brother are in peace, in bliss and in eternal light and fulfillment with our Father in heaven,” Hill wrote. “I Love you and I miss you. May God grant peace and shelter to your family, true friends and genuine appreciators, Brother, King.”


	When speaking to Rolling Stone in 2008, D'Angelo looked back at this time working with Hill, calling her “warm and sweet.” “Originally, we were going to swap tunes for each other's projects because I was working on Voodoo at the same time and my keyboardist James Poyser was also working with her,” D'Angelo recalled at the time. “I went to her house in New Jersey, she played a lot of songs for me and gave me a rough copy to listen to. When Lauryn and I went into the studio together, I laid down my vocals in the course of an hour.”

Tuesday night saw each celebrity perform a special tribute dance, with contestants choosing to honor their parents, siblings, former co-stars, romantic partners and children.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



[This story contains spoilers from episode five of Dancing With the Stars season 34.]


	It was an emotional night in the Dancing With the Stars ballroom for Dedication Night, and to make the night even sweeter, no one was eliminated from the competition at the end of the episode.




	Each celebrity performed a special tribute dance to honor of someone in their life, delivering 10 emotional routines in honor of the cast's parents, siblings, former co-stars, romantic partners and children. (Read who the professional dancers would dedicate their own number to here.)

	Former professional dancer Kym Herjavec also returned to the ballroom, serving as the first official guest judge of the season.


	Finishing out the fifth week of season 34, the cast is noticeably dwindling down. Hilaria Baldwin was eliminated at the end of last week's Disney Night, making her the fourth contestant to exit the competition. No one was eliminated at the end of Dedication Night, meaning the remaining cast composed of 10 couples all moved onto the sixth week of competition.


	The remaining celebrities include Secret Lives of Mormon Wives stars Jen Affleck and Whitney Leavitt, Olympian Jordan Chiles, social media star Alix Earle, The Traitors season three winner (and Zac Efron's brother) Dylan Efron, actresses Danielle Fishel and Elaine Hendrix, Pentatonix's Scott Hoying, conservationist (and son of Steve Irwin) Robert Irwin and comedian-actor Andy Richter.

	











	Richter kicked off the night with an adorable salsa alongside his daughter. One of the most highly anticipated numbers of Dedication Night was Irwin's contemporary to Phil Collins' “You'll Be in My Heart,” which he devoted to his mother, Terri Irwin. And it proved to be a memorable one, as he earned his first three nines of the season, ending with a total score of 35/40 (after sending the entire ballroom into tears).


	Fishel dedicated her jive set to the Boy Meets World theme song to her former co-star William Daniels, also known as Mr. Feeny on the series. The performance landed the actress her first eight of the competition.


	Leavitt emerged as an early frontrunner during the first half of the competition, placing as the top-scoring couple for four consecutive episodes. Disney Night was the first time she and Mark Ballas pulled ahead as the only couple to place at the top of the leaderboard, and they notably earned the season's first nine. 


	However, Efron ended her top-scoring streak on Dedication Night, becoming the first celebrity to earn four nines, one from each of the judges. The Traitors winner performed his dance in honor of his little sister set to the tune of his elder brother, Zac, and Zendaya's song “Rewrite the Stars.” Trailing close behind Efron were Irwin and Earle, who both respectively scored 35/40 points.


	At the end of (most) nights of the competition, the couple with the lowest combined total of judges' scores and viewer votes is eliminated. Live voting takes place during the East Coast airing of each show and ends shortly after the final dance is completed.

	











	See the full list of scores for week five of DWTS season 34 (aka Dedication Night) below. 


	Andy Richter and Emma Slater: 24/40Robert Irwin and Witney Carson: 35/40Elaine Hendrix and Alan Bersten: 30/40Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas: 33/40Jen Affleck and Jan Ravnik: 29/40Dylan Efron and Daniella Karagach: 36/40Jordan Chiles and Ezra Sosa: 32/40Scott Hoying and Rylee Arnold: 30/40Danielle Fishel and Pasha Pashkov: 29/40Alix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy: 35/40


	Season 34 of DWTS airs and streams simultaneously on ABC and Disney+ on Tuesdays, with new episodes available to stream on Wednesdays on Hulu.

Tonight on “Dancing with the Stars,” Whitney Leavitt and her professional partner Mark Ballas took the stage for a powerful “Dedication Night” performance. Last week the couple performed a song from “Hamilton” on Disney night. The pair danced a contemporary routine to “Heal” by Jamal Roberts, which Whitney dedicated to her husband, Connor. 

The heartfelt number followed a week of emotional challenges for Whitney, who recently opened up about having a mental breakdown while juggling motherhood, social media work, and her growing television presence.

The performance starts off and finalizes with assistance from Whitney's husband Connor. The husband and wife moment caused tears in the ballroom, including a tearful statement by Carrie Ann. She complimented the performance by expressing how “dance was made for self-expression”. 

Ballas and Leavitt receive a combined score of 33/40 for the night. Just one point behind Robert Irwin and Witney Carson.

Whitney revealed that rehearsing for Dedication Night pushed her to the edge. “I had a breakdown yesterday, a mental breakdown. But we made it,” she admitted, describing the experience as one filled with “blood, sweat and tears” reported The National Desk. She confessed that the demands of reality TV and influencer life left her feeling detached from herself but said, “I feel most like myself when I'm dancing.”

A post shared by Whitney Leavitt (@whitleavitt)

Mark Ballas praised Whitney's ability to channel her emotions into movement, calling her “a fabulous mother and an excellent wife” while applauding her determination to keep going. The night became even more special when Whitney's husband, Connor, joined her and Mark on stage. Whitney shared that he had been rehearsing and couldn't wait to participate, adding, “He tells us multiple times that he is so excited to get on the dance floor. So I cannot wait.” The performance gave audiences a rare look into the couple's deep connection and shared strength.

A post shared by Whitney Leavitt (@whitleavitt)

“Dedication Night” is a Season 34 theme where each celebrity performs for someone meaningful in their life, often with that person joining the stage. Whitney and Mark's dance to “Heal” stood out among the evening's emotional performances. Other dedications included Andy Richter honoring his daughter, Robert Irwin paying tribute to his mother, and Scott Hoying dancing for his husband.

As one of the competition's top contenders, Whitney entered the night with high expectations. The emotional tone added an extra layer of intensity, particularly for Mark, who has been defending his choreography against critiques earlier this season. Despite the scrutiny, he maintained that his work fits within “DWTS” standards and remains focused on authenticity.

t seemed like any city council meeting: a beige, cinderblock room, metal chairs, a U-shaped table with a maroon tablecloth reading “Leonia Board of Education.” But for the men — some sporting matching T-shirts, claiming that they were survivors of sexual abuse at the hands of a once-beloved teacher — it signified a release, a silence broken.


	Paul King, 59, choked back sobs as he took the mic, his family thronged behind him on a school lunch table bench. “I hope that none of you have ever experienced sexual assault,” he said in measured tones, despite the emotion. “So what do I want? That's a good question. I don't know. But I do know that I want what's fair. I want the people that are victims to be free to come out. To heal. … There's a saying that a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. This crisis has been going on for over 50 years.”


	“That was like the most I've ever seen him cry in my life,” King's 24-year-old son, also named Paul, later tells me. He sat behind his father during his speech, nodding emphatically. “He was reaching really deep down into his memories, into his darkest, repressed stuff, to figure out what happened to him and convey it in a way that was more digestible for these guys sitting on the council.”

	











	Nearly half a century ago, King and his fellow survivors saw their idyllic enclave of Leonia, New Jersey, turn into a hostile place. A leafy, close-knit community less than 10 miles from New York City, Leonia isn't that kind place where tragedy often happens — in fact, it was the model for the suburban utopia depicted in Disney's WandaVision. But, much like in that show, there was unease beneath the surface: back in the Eighties, King and the rest watched as their beloved hometown rallied around elementary school teacher John Anagnosti, a.k.a. Mr. A — despite the fact that Mr. A was convicted of abusing one of their fellow students. It was a stunning state of affairs: a young boy's pain dismissed, his abuser given a slap on the wrist and thousands of dollars of legal support from local parents. Now, though, due to expanding statutes of limitations on child sexual abuse cases, more and more of those who say they are Mr. A's victims are coming forward, including two brothers who sued the school board, settling for a combined $6 million. As one of the plaintiff's attorneys claims, more than a dozen survivors could be coming forward in the coming weeks — alleged victims of abuse that reportedly spanned nearly 15 years. And his supporters? Some have apologized to survivors; others are now silent.

	AT 66, MICHAEL GONZALES RESEMBLES a svelte Santa Claus, wiry and strong. But back in the 1970s, he was an eight-year-old with a high and tight haircut and a mischievous smile — a Dennis the Menace incarnate. He also believes he was likely Mr. A's first victim.


	At the time, unconventional teaching was all the rage: field trips, dinners at teachers' houses, ballgames — anything to get fidgety, bored students engaged. Mr. A embraced that educational style, even earning him a glowing piece in the local paper in 1971 about a class trip to dig fossils with a Columbia University professor. ”I spend so many hours with the kids outside the classroom because that's when I truly get to see them as human beings,” he later told The New York Times. ”They're more open then. I feel that if I get to know them, I can help them.”


	Unfortunately, it seems, those outings also allowed Mr. A unfettered access to his alleged victims, like Gonzales. “The bell rings for lunch, and he would put his arm out to prevent me from going out the classroom door, and that's when the molestation started,” Gonzales says. He says Mr. A molested him until seventh grade, roughly 500 times, a claim also included in his lawsuit against the school board. “All the kids are out in the school yard playing, and I'm here being molested. That same scenario over and over again, but not just in the classroom…. That all started with me; that was his plan on how he gathered the kids. That was his master plan.”

	Gonzales' brother, Joe, also says he became one of Mr. A's victims at age six, when Michael went by the teacher's house to rake leaves with his brother in tow. Michael didn't find out until years later, but the experience nearly ruined both of the brothers' lives. “I became a bully. I ruined friendships,” Michael says. “I came out of high school and I didn't know how to read, because I couldn't concentrate.” Joe, 60, turned to drinking at age 12; he was 35 days sober when we spoke. “I wasn't born an alcoholic,” he says. “I was born a normal kid that was abused at five, six years old, and alcohol, it was a savior, and it is the love of my life.”


	The brothers' pain only intensified in January of 1981, when an elementary school student publicly accused Mr. A of molestation. “I carried around that burden,” Michael says, his voice breaking. “Why didn't I say something? It's not what he did to me. These kids [that he may have abused], who knows if they're even alive…. It's just a total failure of humanity.” It didn't help that the people of Leonia seemed firmly on Mr. A's side back in 1981. When the child's father paraded through the town center with a sign proclaiming the teacher's guilt — then took the pulpit at the Presbyterian Church to do the same — he was charged with harassment, and endangering his child by keeping him out of school, and ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation, according to The New York Times. 

	











	Mr. A wasn't completely able to escape consequences. In spring of that year, following an investigation he was charged with molesting the student, pleaded guilty, and resigned. Still, by June, he'd changed his tune — especially after local parents had raised $7,500 for his defense. Mr. A then opted to retract his plea, claiming that he'd only fessed up to the crime to spare the child “emotional trauma.” The case then moved to state Superior Court, and in 1982, he was convicted of sexual assault. 


	It may seem strange in 2025 that Leonia would stand by an alleged child abuser, but even the headlines of the day reflect a different time: “Leonia Parents Support Teacher in Morals Case,” trumpets one, while another article, titled “Supporting a Neighbor,” casts a benefit dinner at All Saints Episcopal Church as a heartwarming communion in support of a beloved educator. ”When Mr. A resigned,” one child said, according to the paper, “we got a teacher who just told us what to do and sat there. Mr. A said it was better to learn by experiencing things. We went to New York to the planetarium, to the World Trade Center, to the Statue of Liberty and other places. The class would go to his house for dinner and talk about what we'd seen.”


	According to the the Times, the local TV shop even put up an open letter from Mr. A thanking the town for its support — a sore point for Joe, who worked at the store. Paul King had to walk by that poster every day on his walk to school, silently seething. “Joe told me, ‘Every time I walked into that TV [store], I look at that effing poster,” he says. “I'm thinking, ‘I've been abused for over two years by this guy, like big time.'…It wasn't, ‘You show me your weenie and I'll show you mine,' it was full-on physical touching and beyond.' But nobody believed the kid.” King has not filed a suit.


	Michael was similarly enraged by the support. He was on leave from the Army when he heard the news of Mr. A's conviction, and wracked with guilt and shame (and alcohol), he went to the man's house with the intention of killing him. Mr. A let him into his condo, and after calling his lawyer or psychiatrist — Michael isn't sure which — Michael changed his mind. “You know, it tortures me,” he says. “I could have went to jail. I could have ruined my whole life.” 


	Even after Mr. A was convicted of sexual assault, the judgment was muted. He received only three years of probation and a $25 fine. “I don't know what other punishment this man deserves,” the judge opined at the time, while Mr. A took the stand to tell the court: “I would rather cut off my right hand than harm a hair on a child. My love for children is genuine.” It's not all that surprising, then, that Leonia received a glowing write-up in the infamous pedophile magazine, Pan, an underground publication about “boy love.” “He was indicted by a grand jury in October. But instead of running him out of town, as, sadly, often happens in such cases, the community rallied to his support,” the magazine said. “It must have occurred to more than one of the good parents at the All Saints Episcopal Church: John Anagnosti is a paedophile in the true sense of the word; he loves children, and whether or not there is a sexual expression of this love would not seem to be very important.” 

	











	MR. A DIED IN 2020, BUT THE MEN never forgot him — or what he did. And, at the time, they suffered in silence, since neither King nor the Gonzaleses knew that they shared the same abuser. “I had lost my hope,” Michael says. “I'm going to the grave with the secret. …I'm laying in bed, and I see this commercial on TV, and it says if you were molested by a teacher in New Jersey or something or another, to call this number. I called the number.”


	The law firm from the commercial then connected Michael with Baldante & Rubenstein, which has seen a massive uptick in such cases since New Jersey, along with several other states, changed its statute of limitations for child sexual abuse survivors in 2019. Now, Michael and his brother could fight back. “When you sit down with these victims and they start to tell their story, oftentimes we're the first person they've ever spoken to about it,” lawyer John Baldante says. He adds that 80 to 90 percent of their cases deal with sexual abuse cases. “They start crying like the eight- and 10-year old-children that they were when they were abused. … One of my clients once said, ‘It's the first time I've ever spoken out on behalf of that 10-year-old version of myself.'”


	With Baldante's help, Joe and Michael each sued the Leonia Township Board of Education, alleging that the school and board knew about Mr. A's reported actions, but did nothing to stop them. “Despite such knowledge,” Michael's suit reads, “[the school] failed to adequately respond to stop harassment…against the plaintiff.” 


	The brothers garnered a combined $6 million in separate settlements in 2024. Still, according to Michael's daughter, Keegan, “this lawsuit wasn't a payday. It was acknowledgement that something horrific happened, and the school system failed these kids. The story does not end here. We're going to continue speaking about this, because this goes beyond compensation. We want people's stories to be heard.” To date, Baldante says several other men have come forward with similar stories about Mr. A, and he expects there will be many more. The firm is in the process of working up further litigation. “There's no question that there's undoubtedly hundreds [of victims],” he claims. “Mr. A was the Pied Piper.” Although stressing that there are only three cases of litigation currently pending against the teacher and school board, Baldante says “in the context of cases against a single perpetrator within a public school Board of Education, the claims against Mr. A are evolving into one of the largest clusters of claims.”

	











	AND THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THAT city council meeting. Through a series of happenstances, Keegan met the younger Paul King, and they figured out that both their fathers claim to have been victims of Mr. A — right before the Gonzaleses and another alleged survivor, Daniel Schlademan, were due to speak at the meeting on June 17. In light of more and more alleged victims coming forward, the men planned to address the Board of Education, calling on them to take steps to bring closure and comfort to the victims, as well as concrete moves to ensure the safety of the town's children in the future.


	King joined them, and, one by one, they emptied their hearts in that ugly municipal board room. The men acknowledged that the school board is populated by far different people than it was 50 years ago, but they still want justice — and recognition of systemic failure. “The Leonia school district dismissed the reports of sexual abuse made by students and tried to sweep Anagnosti's predatory conduct under the carpet,” says the lawyer, Baldante. “Unfortunately, these efforts by Leonia only compounded the problem.” 


	“The Leonia School District is currently involved in active litigation related to these matters, and therefore we cannot provide specific comments,” said Daniel Lee, President of Leonia Board of Education. “That said, our lack of direct response to the public comments on this matter must not be mistaken for indifference to the pleas of those who have come forward. We recognize how painful these issues may be for victims, their families, and the wider community. We take this concern very seriously. The Board's goal is always to foster a safe, supportive environment, and we are mindful of the role we can play in the healing process. At this moment, however, our legal and ethical responsibilities require restraint to avoid jeopardizing the district or those it serves now and in the future.”


	In a 2022 filing, the BOE denied “any wrongdoing or negligence,” adding: “The Board did not have actual or constructive knowledge of the allegations of sexual misconduct of Defendant John Anagnosti. The Board did not enable any alleged sexual abuse and the Board did not fail to take action with regards to any alleged sexual abuse.”

	Now, all the men can do is wait. Wait for the school board to listen to them. Wait for more people to come forward. Schlademan created a website in May outlining the town's history with Mr. A called Voices of Leonia; he's currently fighting his own legal battle against the school board and declined to be interviewed for this article. Meanwhile, Baldante is interviewing more survivors of Mr. A in preparation for future lawsuits. 

	











	And the Gonzaleses? They're just continuing to heal. “It's so important to me that this story is told,” Michael says. “Everybody's at fault here — full circle. I've been disappointed so many times. This guy is a monster and nobody paid attention.”

The Big Bang and the age of the universe have plenty of evidence behind them, from the temperature of the cosmic microwave background to the measured expansion of the universe. Through a lot of work over the last century, we now believe the universe to be around 13.8 billion years old.

But it would not take much to refute this idea. If we were to find a star that is definitively older than this, it would show that the universe was around before 13.8 billion years ago. Enter star HD 140283, looking suspiciously non-metallic.

HD 140283, better known as the Methuselah star, is around 200 light-years from Earth, in the constellation of Libra. It is known to be a high-velocity, sub-giant star, and one of the closest metal-poor stars to our Solar System. 

"The high rate of motion is evidence that the star is simply a visitor to our stellar neighborhood," NASA's Hubble Mission team explains of the star. "Its orbit carries it down through the plane of our galaxy from the ancient halo of stars that encircle the Milky Way, and will eventually slingshot back to the galactic halo."

In the 1950s, astronomers found HD 140283 to be very metal-poor compared to other stars in the neighborhood, suggesting that the star was formed earlier in the universe, before it had become "polluted" by heavier elements fused in the center of other stars. In the early 2000s, astronomers attempted to age it, and came up with an even more surprising result. According to their observations and analysis using stellar evolution models, the Methuselah star's age was possibly around 16 billion years old.

The age of stars is pretty difficult to pin down, relying on measurements of their absolute brightness as well as their chemical abundances, and this was far from the final word on the topic. 

"Maybe the cosmology is wrong, stellar physics is wrong, or the star's distance is wrong," Howard Bond of Pennsylvania State University in University Park and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore said in a 2013 statement, after new measurements by the Hubble Space Telescope. "So we set out to refine the distance."

That team refined distance measurements to the star, an important step in figuring out a star's intrinsic brightness, which is fundamental in determining its age. Think of it like not knowing if you are seeing a torch held by an approaching stranger, or a very distant lighthouse. Placing the star's distance at a refined 190.1 light-years, and finding that it had a higher-than-predicted oxygen to iron ratio, the team aged the star to be a much less universe model-breaking star.

"Put all of those ingredients together and you get an age of 14.5 billion years, with a residual uncertainty that makes the star's age compatible with the age of the universe," Bond said, adding, "This is the best star in the sky to do precision age calculations by virtue of its closeness and brightness."

With uncertainty of around 0.8 billion years, at the lower end of the age estimate, it is at least not older than the universe is believed to be. Further studies have placed the star's age between 13.7 billion and 12.2 billion years, with another suggesting between 11.5 billion years and 12.5 billion years. 

The Methuselah star, named for the Biblical Noah's grandfather, described as dying at the age of 969, is likely not older than the universe, nor evidence that we have the age of the universe horribly wrong. But it remains the oldest star we have found in the universe so far. There are other candidates, such as J22132050-5137385, which is thought to be around 13.6 billion years old, give or take 2.6 billion years. Further measurements of this and others could knock the Methuselah star off the top spot, or else refine the age estimate downwards.

“Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” star Lisa Barlow gets a psychic reading done at Whitney Rose‘s “Telepathic Tasting” event in episode 5. When her marriage to John Barlow is mentioned, Lisa finally opens up about the cracks in their relationship. 

Flashbacks during episode 5 shed light on some of the issues Lisa and John are going through in their relationship.

The first flashback showed a tense conversation between the couple that occurred one month prior to the psychic reading. They were discussing their son Jack Barlow‘s living arrangements when he returned from his mission trip.

“Jack and I were talking about two or three weeks ago. I actually was in favor of him getting an apartment,” John said.

“You were? I don't think he should be allowed to move out,” Lisa responded. This scene showed how the couple was on two completely different wavelengths when it came to their children.

Another flashback from a year ago showed Lisa telling John that he needs to “take it a little more seriously. I think it bothers me because I feel lonely in my feelings.”

“How can I take it more seriously? I stress about it just as much as you do,” John said.

“You don't act like you do, and that frustrates me,” replied Lisa.

Earlier in Season 6, Bronwyn Newport told Whitney that she saw legal documents related to a lawsuit Lisa was facing where she had secretly borrowed money from the “mystery man” that Angie Katsanevas had referenced in the past. It remains unclear if this accusation caused any strain in their marriage, and Lisa has already denied all of these legal claims against her.

Whitney invited an “intuitive consultant” named Terence to give the group one-on-one psychic readings during their wine tasing lunch. When Lisa first sat down with Terence, the first thing he asked was, “why do you feel like you're just rebuilding trust?” 

This immediately caused Lisa to break down in tears, reaching for her sunglasses to mask her emotions. “I don't know,” she said, her voice breaking.

“It's like an elastic band, you guys keep snapping back together,” said Terence. “You need to figure out how to communicate to each other again. I also look at this, and go, cause it feels like you have different paths. And I feel like you don't know how to find your way back to his path.” He continues to point out how much “angst and frustration,” there is in their marriage.

Lisa continued to agree with Terence. In her confessional, she explained to a producer, “marriage is hard,” while still struggling to control her emotions. She continued, “lately, I think with everything we have going on, we're, like, on totally different pages. Sometimes it feels like totally different planets.”

“I feel like he's my best friend. My person,” Lisa told Terence.

“But you're not on the same team.”

“We're not.”

The intuitive consultant concluded their session by stating, “until you get back to that same team, you're gonna feel, like, lost.”

At the end of her confessional, Lisa admitted, “I just feel, like, alone sometimes, you know? And it hurts.”

Superhero Globalist Conspiracy Theories over DC's K.O. in Titans #28, as well as Justice League Red #3 and Wonder Woman #26 (Spoilers)

Bleeding Cool mentioned that this might be coming… previously, I wrote, "DC's K.O. is coming. The big knockdown fight event, to take on Darkseid. But before any of this can happen, something is going to have to happen to the Earth. Everyone is going to have to be evacuated. The entire planet. The fight is coming, it is coming to Earth, and there can be no harm done to the bystanders. Darkseid plans to build a new Apokolips on Earth." Indeed, today's Justice League Red #3 by Saladin Ahmed and Clayton Henry sees Red Tornado prophesying such a future, and underlining the need to save Red Arrow, to stop it. 

Save the marksman, save the world.

But also it is a bit…

I mean, right? But while all that is going on, the Titans are dealing with the here and now. The DC K.O. battle is to find a champion imbued with Omega Energy to inherit the power of the Omega King rather than Darkseid. As I previously wrote, "it's down to the Titans, minus those in the competition, to evacuate a planet of eight billion people. Ships, teleportation, city shrinking, whatever comes to hand. Oh, and they only have a week." And in today's  Titans #28 by John Layman and Pete Woods are both published by DC Comics today, it comes to pass.

Rocketing populations into space in buildings that double as spaceships… and shrinking people to fit.

And it's not just the people who are being saved but also the supervillains.

Of course, as we saw in DC's K.O. #1, it seems that maybe that didn't work out as intended.

While on Earth, not everyone wants to go. As I previously wrote, …there are some who don't want to be evacuated. Who don't believe the superheroes. Who don't want to leave their homes, their possessions or their lives…."

…"And who have got placards to protest, presumably left over from COVID, or Absolute Power, dubbed "evacuation truthers". Amanda Waller taught humanity to mistrust the superheroes, and plenty, it seems, still think she was right…"

As we have seen from Moray Island in today's Wonder Woman #26 by Tom King and Daniel Sampere, they are not alone there either…

Mouse Man knows. Justice League Red #3 by Saladin Ahmed, Clayton Henry, Titans #28 by John Layman and Pete Woods and Wonder Woman #26 by Tom King and Daniel Sampere, are all published by DC Comics today.

The "MLB on FOX' crew preview the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the NLCS. 

Los Angeles Dodgers star Teoscar Hernandez revealed that he and his wife will be switching their living quarters while in Milwaukee to face the Brewers in the National League Championship Series. 

It isn't because their hotel isn't good enough, but rather, Hernandez's wife, Jennifer, is not fond of the rumors of paranormal activity connected to it.

The Pfister Hotel is historic in Milwaukee, and that's where the Dodgers have been staying for the start of this series. However, Hernandez said before Game 2 on Wednesday night that he and his wife are moving due to rumors that the Pfister Hotel is haunted.

This isn't uncommon, as Mookie Betts continues to book Airbnbs during the series in Milwaukee because of the haunting stories about the hotel. 

Hernandez said his wife heard some stories about alleged issues while staying at the Pfister from other Dodgers' significant others. The player himself doesn't care for the stories, though.

"I don't believe in ghosts," he said, via The New York Post. "I have stayed in there before. I've never seen anything or heard anything.

"But my wife is on this trip, and she said she doesn't want to stay there. So we have to find another hotel. But I've been hearing from other players and other wives that it's something happening in these couple of nights."

As for what Hernandez has heard from teammates, he said "some of the rooms, the lights goes off and on. And the doors, there are noises, footsteps, things like that, I don't know."

No matter the stories, Hernandez is focused on helping his team repeat as World Series champions, and he helped the cause early in Wednesday's game. Hernandez belted a home run as part of a two-run top of the second inning that gave the Dodgers the lead after the Brewers jumped ahead with a Jackson Chourio solo homer in their first trip to the plate. 

The Dodgers were able to stave off the Brewers' ninth-inning rally in Game 1 on Monday night, as Blake Treinen got Brice Turange to strike out to end the game with bases loaded for Milwaukee. 

If the Dodgers are unable to come away with a two-game lead in the best-of-seven series, there is a chance Hernandez and his wife won't have to return to Milwaukee.

A senior U.S. Navy officer has claimed his crew witnessed a massive unidentified underwater object racing through the ocean at around 200mph. 

The startling testimony adds to growing reports of unidentified submerged objects, or USOs, being investigated by the Pentagon and Congress.

Congressman Tim Burchett revealed the account as part of a congressional probe into unexplained aerial and underwater phenomena. 

“A very high-ranking member of the Navy described some underwater experiences with something that was doing 200mph underwater,” he said. “It was as big as a football field. That's no fish.”

Burchett told U.S. television that no man-made craft could reach such underwater speeds. 

“Not with our technology, no,” he said. “The best we have is probably in the high 30s.” 

His remarks suggest that whatever was seen moved nearly six times faster than the most advanced military submarines or torpedoes.

According to Burchett, these encounters occurred in “very deep water areas,” making them even harder to explain.

Officials are now examining reports of Unidentified Submerged Objects (USOs) alongside flying UFOs, suggesting that unexplained technology might be operating both in the sky and under the sea.

Burchett dismissed the idea that these objects might belong to any known defence program. 

“Why would we risk multi-million-dollar apparatus? Why would we put something in the air around our best pilots that could have a crash?” he asked. “It would be stupid.”

The claims echo those of Bob McGwire, a professor and intelligence officer who once worked aboard the USS Hampton. 

He said he experienced a similar encounter while on duty, hearing “something whizzing by” the submarine at speeds faster than sound.

The USS Hampton's sonar allegedly tracked the unidentified object travelling faster than the speed of sound through water, a feat no torpedo or known craft can achieve. 

“The sub's sonar picked it up. It blew by us,” McGwire said. 

He stressed that it wasn't part of any U.S. experiment or secret project.

McGwire said he kept the incident secret for decades due to the classified nature of his naval work. 

“It is mine to tell whoever I want. They blew it,” he said, referring to the Navy's failure to properly document the event. 

He only came forward when the Pentagon began its probe into hundreds of UFO and USO reports.

He recalled how “a person with knowledge of onboard systems” confirmed something had sped past their submarine “faster than the speed of sound.” 

The engagement lasted only seconds but was so distinct that everyone on board felt the shockwave.

The story gained traction after a 2019 video surfaced showing the USS Omaha tracking a glowing orb off the coast of San Diego. 

The object hovered briefly, then plunged into the water, disappearing completely.

“Wow, it splashed,” a crew member can be heard shouting in the footage.

The Pentagon is now examining over 800 unexplained encounters, including those beneath the ocean. 

Both McGwire and Burchett argue that these sightings prove humans may not be alone, or that unknown technology is operating in Earth's most remote environments.

NASA astronaut Don Pettit tests the Mould Effect in space.

NASA astronaut Don Pettit has helped YouTuber Steve Mould with the final step in his "weird chain theory": testing the idea in space.

In 2013, YouTuber and science communicator Steve Mould brought the "chain fountain", an unsolved problem in physics, to the attention of the wider public. The effect, sometimes referred to as the "Mould effect" for his work on it, is strange to see. Simply put, place a long chain in a container, pull one end out, and let it fall to the floor. Now watch as the whole chain seems to jump up out of the glass, before falling towards the floor.

     

The effect, though independently found by Mould, was known about before, even if it was unexplained. Since the effect was popularized by Mould, he, Mehdi Sadaghdar of YouTube channel ElectroBOOM, and several academic studies have attempted to explain it. Mould has also set the record for the biggest chain fountain.

    

What is really puzzling about the effect is how the chain appears to rise out of the glass before starting its downward journey.

"Motivated by the fact that the chain has a maximum local curvature, and the fact that the phenomenon does not happen with a chain that does not have this maximum bending curvature, the chain was modelled as a sequence of freely joined rods," a 2016 paper on the topic explains.

"When a rod is pulled from one end, the end attached to the part of the chain that is already moving, the rod tends to rotate around its center of mass; consequently, the other end will go down, towards the surface of beads, kicking the pile of beads. Finally, there is a reaction force to this kick that pushes the beads upwards."

Mould's explanation (see above for the full explanation, and an awesome chain fountain) is generally thought to be correct, after a long (and friendly) argument and experiments against ElectroBOOM (and further analysis by others). 

"In short, the chain rises above the pot in a fountain because of an extra upward force coming from the pot," Mould explains in his latest video, partly shot in space. "How strong does that force need to be, though? Well, it needs to be able to overcome the weight of this arc of chain that would obviously fall under gravity. And that's it. That's all you need."

Unfortunately, in order to test his idea, Mould needed gravity to disappear. This is where NASA astronaut Don Pettit came in. Pettit, who had been intrigued by Mould's videos, offered to test the behavior of chains on the International Space Station (ISS).

 

"According to the maths, that yanking of the chain has no influence on the ark at all. If gravity wasn't a factor, the ark would be fixed there in space even though it was being yanked downwards at one end. Or at least that's the theory," Mould explained. "That's what we want to test. We want to test the theory that a chain moving at constant speed will flow through its own shape so long as it isn't acted on by an external force like gravity."

In a phone call with Mould, Pettit attempted to tug on the chain and test whether the chain truly did flow through its own shape, supporting Mould's idea, or whether it did something else. Unfortunately, it's pretty difficult to get a chain to remain stationary in microgravity, with Pettit describing them as moving around like molecules. 

Mould suggested that instead they put a chain into a loop, and stretch it out to make a rectangular shape. Then Pettit could grab the longer sides of the rectangle-ish chain and set them in motion, pushing the top one right and the bottom left, for example. If he was correct, the chain should flow through that rectangle shape, rather than spread out into a circle as you might expect.

The setup was not ideal, and the two were limited by the ISS passing out of reach of communication satellites. However, before the informal experiment ended, they did appear to set chains in motion that followed their own shape, seemingly adding evidence to Mould's explanation for the effect.

"It was a great demonstration seeing it pass through the same path through the loop and your explanation about why it would eventually turn into a full circle due to friction was pretty adequate," Sadaghdar said, adding that he wouldn't have to embarrass himself by making another debunk video.

"Although you didn't quite demonstrate if the path will remain the same if the chain wasn't in a loop. Another simulation might be nice, but what would be better is to take 100m of chain into space and drag it behind you in a spacewalk. Do it."

Three years ago, The Black Phone (reviewed here) made a real impression by being the rare horror film to feel both grounded and fantastical. The abduction/serial killer elements were gritty and realistic, while the voices from beyond the grave were a special sauce to give the flick a unique personality. At the same time, a sequel didn't even seem possible, besides feeling unnecessary. Well, along comes Black Phone 2, and it turns out that all involved were aware of that feeling. Instead of rehashing what's come before, the now series opts to change things up in a major way, giving it a freshness that fuels things from start to finish.

Black Phone 2 moves the franchise towards a more supernatural territory, clearly taking a page from A Nightmare on Elm Street and some of its own sequels. It has a slower pace and a more serious feeling, especially in the first act, and really the first half, but once we get to The Grabber being a new Freddy Krueger, we're really cooking with gas. The horror wheel isn't being re-invented, to be sure, but it is showing how a property can extend its life by being creative and not playing it safe.

Four years have passed since the events of the last film, where then thirteen year old Finn (Mason Thames) was abducted by the serial killer known as The Grabber (Ethan Hawke). Finn ultimately killed his captor and escaped, though now as a seventeen year old, he's still dealing with the trauma. His younger sister Gwen (Madeleine McGraw) is now fifteen and beginning to receive calls from the black phone in her dreams. While Finn numbs himself with weed nightly, Gwen is seeing disturbing visions of three boys being stalked and murdered at Alpine Lake, a nearby winter camp. Needing to solve the mystery for her own sanity, as well as perhaps for her brother as well, she convinces them to sign up as counselors in training, in order to visit the camp.

Arriving at Alpine Lake with Ernesto (Miguel Mora), they're welcomed by Armando (Demián Bichir), though not everyone there is so kind. Plus, it's at the camp that Gwen begins to be tormented in her dreams by The Grabber, who is dead but very much still a threat. As she learns about how the killer and her family have history, he begins attacking her when she falls asleep. Along with Finn, she'll need to confront The Grabber, even as he's gotten more powerful in death, especially once they realize what he's done to them.

Ethan Hawke returns as The Grabber, alongside prior heroes Madeline McGraw and Mason Thames (as well as Jeremy Davies, playing Finn and Gwen's father). This time, McGraw is more of the lead and really does anchor the film. She's strong and determined, though also gets put through the ringer like a true scream queen. Mason Thames showcases the trauma that The Black Phone subjected him to in a way that few horror sequels opt to do, with compelling results. As for Hawke, he's not in it quite as much as last time, though he's just as disturbing, albeit in a new way. He's again having a blast being a villain, this time embracing the demonic side of being dead but still very much an omnipresent threat. If he's going to keep playing The Grabber every so often, sign me up. Demián Bichir is a bit wasted, though always a welcome presence. In addition to Davies and the aforementioned Mora, supporting players here include Anna Lore, Arianna Rivas, and more.

Co-writer/director Scott Derrickson, along with his writing partner C. Robert Cargill, is clearly influenced by the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, taking his series in this supernatural direction. Things start off pretty slowly, but once the rhythm sets in, it picks up in a big way, especially when The Grabber turns Freddy-esque. Derrickson and Cargill are interested in some heavy themes and don't shy away from darkness, though occasionally their script is on the nose and has characters saying things you only hear in the midst of a horror movie. At the same time, Derrickson's direction is a highlight, especially with how the dream sequences are shot on Super 8, giving them a unique quality. It's jarring at first, but by the end, it becomes a defining feature of Black Phone 2. That sort of creativity rarely arises in horror sequels. 

Black Phone 2 is hardly groundbreaking, but by mixing things up, the series manages to stay fresh. I'd happily see a third one if Derrickson, Hawke, and company want to keep giving us more of The Grabber. He's not quite as iconic as Freddy, admittedly, but he's in that ballpark, which is something worth exploring more. Regardless, this sequel sets itself apart by being bold enough to do things differently than most.

SCORE: ★★★
