Move by US marks sharp escalation in efforts to pressure Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro's regime

Donald Trump confirmed reports on Wednesday that he authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, marking a sharp escalation in US efforts to pressure President Nicolás Maduro's regime.

The New York Times first reported the classified directive, citing US officials familiar with the decision.

The US president said he authorized the action for two main reasons.

First, he claimed Venezuela had been releasing large numbers of prisoners, including individuals from mental health facilities, into the United States, often crossing the border due to what he described as an open border policy. Trump did not specify which border they were crossing.

The second reason, he said, was the large amount of drugs entering the US from Venezuela, much of it trafficked by sea.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If we don't organize and take action in the streets, says Mark Bray, “we're going to end up somewhere really bad.” Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. We speak with Rutgers University professor Mark Bray, who fled from the U.S. to Spain with his family after receiving death threats over his scholarship. Turning Point USA, the conservative campus group founded by Charlie Kirk, had called for Bray's firing and branded him “Dr. Antifa.” This comes as the Trump administration has dramatically escalated its war on dissent following Kirk's assassination, using his death as pretext to launch an assault on activists, organizations and speech it disagrees with. “What we're seeing today in the U.S. is increasingly fascist. President Trump signed an executive order designating antifa as a terrorist organization, but Bray stresses there is no such organization; anti-fascism is a loose political movement or ideology akin to feminism, but Trump is using the label to “demonize resistance” to his policies. Copy may not be in its final form. Yesterday, President Trump posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Charlie Kirk at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. Trump recently signed an executive order purporting to designate antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, even though it's not really an organization. Antifa is actually a shortening of the term “anti-fascist” and is a term that arose in Europe for the movement against the Nazis, both before and after World War II. Several high-level Republicans have accused this Saturday's “No Kings Day” protests of being organized by antifa. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said last week the administration will take the, quote, “same approach” to antifa as it has to drug cartels it's bombed in the Caribbean. This is Bondi on Fox News last night. ATTORNEY GENERAL PAM BONDI: That's one of the things about antifa. You're seeing people out there with thousands of signs that all match, pre-bought, pre-put together. They're organized, and someone is funding it. AMY GOODMAN: This comes as Los Angeles County officials voted Tuesday to declare a state of emergency over ongoing federal immigration raids they say have, quote, “caused widespread fear,” unquote. Violent attacks by federal agents at protests against immigrant raids have also been documented in Chicago and Portland. On Tuesday, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson [was asked] if he would call for more oversight of federal agents. He responded by complaining about a naked bike ride protest against ICE in Portland, Oregon, which Trump has called a war zone. SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON: To demand oversight on federal law enforcement? I've not seen them cross the line yet, and that we have committees of jurisdiction who have that responsibility, but it's not risen to that level. What I've seen is the abuse of law enforcement by radical leftist activists. You know, most recently, the most threatening thing I've seen yet was the naked bicyclers in Portland who were protesting ICE down there. AMY GOODMAN: Experts are increasingly raising concerns the Trump administration's attacks on antifa are ungrounded in fact and law, and violate free speech rights. For more, we're joined by someone who knows a lot about all of this. Mark Bray is a Rutgers University history professor, author of the 2017 book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook. Last week, he was forced to leave his home in New Jersey and move to Spain with his family after receiving death threats following Trump's push to categorize the anti-fascist movement as a domestic terrorist organization. Charlie Kirk's group, Turning Point USA, had also circulated a petition labeling him “Dr. Antifa” and calling for him to be fired. In a remarkable development, Bray was at first blocked from flying out of the United States last week. He wrote on Bluesky, “Someone canceled my family's flight out of the country at the last second. '” They later took another flight, and professor Mark Bray joins us now from Spain. Thanks so much for being with us. I'm sorry you've gone through all this, Professor Bray. If you can start off by talking about why you left the country and what happened, as we try to follow what was happening to you at the airport? So, I published this book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, in 2017. I'm actually researching different historical topics now. But after Trump's executive order, a series of far-right trolls, online influencers started attacking me. I received a number of death threats. Someone published my home address on X. So I started to fear for the safety of my family staying in our home. More and more death threats came in, and I knew I needed to get away. As you said, our first flight was mysteriously canceled at the last moment. AMY GOODMAN: I want to ask: When you — AMY GOODMAN: I just want to ask: When say your flight was canceled, you went to — what was it? There were a series of phone calls and mumbling. And they basically said, at the last moment, someone had canceled our reservation — not the whole flight, just for the four of us, for me, my wife and our two small children. And this is around the same time that Andy Ngo and Jack Posobiec, two of the far-right provocateurs who had been harassing me online, were meeting in the White House with President Trump to discuss antifa. I just can't believe it's a coincidence. AMY GOODMAN: And yet, you were able to rebook the next day, and you made it through security, and you actually made it onto the flight? MARK BRAY: Well, this time, I was stopped, searched and interrogated by federal agents for an hour. And at one point, they took me into a side room, and my two kids saw what looked like very bad men taking me in another room, and they started sobbing. So, it was quite an ordeal even the next day. And frankly, I'm very fearful about the potential of returning, but hopefully, by next year, things will improve. AMY GOODMAN: I mean, this is astounding. You weren't trying to come into the United States. MARK BRAY: And I'm not being charged with any crimes. If anything, I'm the victim of crimes. I wrote a book eight years ago. I'm just trying to live my life here. But, of course, because the far right is trying to create a bogeyman term in “antifa” to equate protests with terrorism, I got caught up in the middle of this. If you can explain what antifa is and what it means for President Trump to have issued this executive order calling it a terrorist — domestic terrorist organization? Talk about antifa now and through history. So, as you said, it's a term that is short for “anti-fascist” or “anti-fascism.” It's originally German from the era of opposition to Hitler. After World War II, anti-fascism continued throughout the world, and the specific European tradition of what they called antifa spread to other countries around the world. Sometimes there are feminist groups, but feminism itself is not a group. It's a thing you do to organize against the far right in decentralized groups. And it's really, you know, an obvious page out of the textbooks about fascist and authoritarian leaders. It's so — it's such an obvious imitation of, you know, the kind of the Red Scare talk about communism, but applied to today. AMY GOODMAN: It's very interesting you've moved to Spain. I mean, for years we've covered the Abraham Lincoln Brigadistas, Brigade, those Americans who went to Spain, where you are now, to fight against the fascist Franco. And this was just before World War II. They were the most experienced, presumably, in fighting. But when a number of them signed up to fight in World War II, to fight Hitler, they were labeled “premature anti-fascists.” Can you talk about that? And they were not allowed to fight in World War II. So, there were a lot of activists and leftists in the U.S. and around the world who realized the threat of Hitler well before mainstream society. A significant number of them lost their lives. And it is also worth pointing out that a number of Spanish Civil War veterans from other countries who ended up going to France after the Spanish Civil War played important roles in the French underground. And there was a tank battalion of Spanish anarchists that were among the first to liberate Paris in 1945. So, it is strange to sort of have these things twisted around. But I've received a lot of solidarity and support from the social movements here. And actually, there's a general strike today in Spain for Palestine, as well — just to throw into your news report. AMY GOODMAN: We had you on last in 2017 to discuss your book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, when it first came out. In the introduction, you wrote you hoped your work would promote organizing against fascism and white supremacy. There's also a really good book called The Black Antifascist Tradition that talks about the role of anti-fascism in Black liberation struggles, Black Panthers and so forth, which I suggest people check out. And what we're seeing today in the U.S. is increasingly fascist. And for me personally, I felt like my situation was such that I had to get my family out of harm's way. It's about attacks on academic freedom, free speech, the right to protest. And so, everyone, in their own way, needs to take action to try and organize against this. You remind me of Timothy Snyder, as well as Jason Stanley, the two Yale professors, who also left the country. I wanted to ask you about U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi's comments, saying the administration will take the, quote, “same approach” to antifa as it has to drug cartels it's bombed in the Caribbean. The latest bombing, I think, took place yesterday, killing a number of people. Even Republican politicians, behind closed doors, are saying, “Where is the evidence?” for who these people are, who have been killed by the U.S. bombs. Mark Bray, your response to Pam Bondi? Well, the paradox of fascism is that while it's trying to gain power, it talks about the need for law and order, and to the degree that it gains power, it tramples all over the law. It does not care about the law or legality, due process, civil liberties. And so, this kind of call to murder people in this country, without, of course, even having gone through any due process — not that I'm in favor of capital punishment anyway, but that's another story — it is this kind of example of calling for the strongman, in Trump, to use deadly force, without any evidence, against people accused of made-up crimes that are being equated with — you know, at times, some of the Trump administration people have compared it to — ISIS to antifa, right? So, to me, it's really this kind of fascist attack on civil liberties. — where students were gunned down in the '60s. It could happen again if we're not careful. So we really need to be very vigilant about this. AMY GOODMAN: Do you think progressive groups, groups that care about democracy, free speech, across the political spectrum, are pushing back enough around the attack on anti-fascists? MARK BRAY: Well, you know, I think there's always room for more action. And I think that my main takeaway for viewers today is that whether or not you consider yourself an anti-fascist, anyone who has any critiques of Trump is potentially in the crosshairs here, because there's a concerted project from the top to equate protest with terrorism and to say anyone who's not a Trump supporter is basically the equivalent of ISIS. You can't make this stuff up. They don't care at all about grounding in fact or information. AMY GOODMAN: Finally, I wanted to ask you about the Rutgers students calling for the university to support you, wanting Rutgers President William Tate to issue a statement, a, quote, “Resolution in Support of Professor Mark Bray's Academic Freedom and Free Expression.” This apparently is slated for consideration and vote Friday by the Rutgers University Senate. I would very much appreciate a statement of direct support from President Tate. But, you know, to his credit, he did issue a statement in support of the free speech and academic freedom of all Rutgers faculty, which did not mention me directly, but I think, implicitly, supported my right to do my scholarship in accord with my job. But, you know, again, the Rutgers community has been fantastic, and especially given attacks on higher education across the country, the way that some subjects have been, basically, straight-up banned in states like Florida, I'm happy to be a professor at Rutgers. AMY GOODMAN: Mark Bray, Rutgers University history professor, author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook. He's just moved his family to Spain after receiving death threats following President Trump's push to categorize the anti-fascist movement as a domestic terrorist organization. Coming up, we speak with a professor at Stanford University, professor emeritus, about what — the deal that was made in Sharm el-Sheikh, and also about his own niece, who had been held hostage by Hamas in Gaza for 54 days, her husband killed. AMY GOODMAN: “Nunca Más,” “Never Again,” by La Santa Cecilia. Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

Remarking on the ongoing U.S.–China dispute over rare earth exports, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said during an Oct. 15 news conference that if Beijing refuses to act as a reliable trading partner, the United States and its allies may have no choice but to decouple.

While emphasizing that decoupling—severing trade ties entirely or nearly so—is not Washington's desired outcome, Bessent said it could become unavoidable given China's posture in the current standoff over rare earths supplies.</p>

Continued from yesterday（延續自昨日） https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang While many early surnames in England were strongly influenced by the work people did, like Carpenter or Plumber, jobs were not the only factor. Physical characteristics, personal nicknames, geographical locations and even parents' first names also played a role. It's not hard to imagine how the color of a person's hair could have led to a surname like “Redhead” or “White,” while a darker complexion might have resulted in the last name “Black.” Meanwhile, someone known as a quick runner might have earned the surname “Swift,” while a clever or cunning individual could have been called “Fox”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Syria's interim president, Ahmed Al-Sharaa, travelled to Moscow for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, the first face-to-face contact the pair have had. The meeting was especially notable considering Putin's long-standing backing of Al-Sharaa's predecessor, Bashar al-Assad, whose dictatorial regime was ousted by rebel forces in December. However, during his meeting with Al-Sharaa on Wednesday, Putin insisted that the two countries “have been exceptionally friendly” for more than 80 years, and that his country's relationship with Syria has “never been tied to our political circumstances.” “Throughout these decades, we have always been guided by one thing: the interests of the Syrian people,” he continued. Earlier this year, hundreds of people were killed in days of violence in southern Syria, which began with clashes between members of the Druze minority group and Bedouin tribes and subsequently drew a military intervention. Israel also waded into the conflict, saying it wanted to protected the Druze and striking several government buildings in Damascus before a ceasefire was agreed upon. “We have close relations with Russia, and a large part of the energy sector in Syria depends on Russian expertise,” he said. Russia's deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, said later Wednesday that his country was ready to support Syria in its reconstruction after years of civil war. “Today, we discussed specific projects in energy, transport, tourism, healthcare, and cultural and humanitarian areas,” Novak told reporters. “All of this will be discussed in detail, and we are ready to provide support and participate in the reconstruction of Syria,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Madagascar's new military ruler, Michael Randrianirina, said on Wednesday he would soon be sworn in as the country's president as the African Union suspended the island nation after a coup to oust President Andry Rajoelina. Randrianirina said earlier that the military had taken power and dissolved all institutions except the lower house of parliament, or National Assembly. Soldiers in Madagascar announce military takeover after president flees Gen Z protesters, waving pirate flags, force Madagascar's president to flee country At a bloc meeting earlier on Wednesday, African Union Commission Chairperson Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said: “The rule of law must prevail over the rule of force. Randrianirina said on Tuesday that a committee led by the military would rule for up to two years alongside a transitional government before organizing new elections. Randrianirina was a commander in the elite CAPSAT army unit that played a key role in the 2009 coup that brought Rajoelina to power but broke ranks with him last week, urging soldiers not to fire on protesters. Rajoelina fled Madagascar on Sunday aboard a French military plane, security sources told Reuters. He has said his life was at risk and is now believed to be in Dubai, according to three diplomatic and opposition sources. But promises to improve living standards and eradicate corruption were never fulfilled. Between its independence in 1960 and 2020, GDP per capita plunged 45%, according to the World Bank.

MOSCOW, October 15. /TASS/. Russia will use every instrument at its disposal to protect its citizens in Latvia, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said at a news briefing.

Latvia set October 13 as the deadline for a Latvian exam after which Riga will authorize the deportation of those Russians who do not speak fluent Latvian. There have been reports that as many as 841 Russian citizens have been deported for this reason. Moscow has stressed that it has developed measures to accommodate them back in their homeland.

"The Russian embassy in Riga will continue to provide as much assistance as possible to our stranded citizens. Our nationals targeted by such Nazism will be given support, and they are welcome everywhere across our Motherland," Zakharova assured reporters. "We will use absolutely all instruments that we have at our disposal to draw attention to this issue at specialized international venues," the diplomat added as she criticized this policy pursued by who she called Latvian xenophobes as Nazism.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least 1,076 Cuban nationals have fought or are fighting for Russia in Ukraine, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15. Ninety-six are known to have died or gone missing in action. The figures come after the U.S. earlier this month circulated an unclassified cable sharing details about Cuba's support for Russia's full-scale invasion, in which it claimed an "estimated 1,000 to 5,000 Cubans (are) fighting in Ukraine." HUR claims they receive only two weeks of training at the Avangard training center in Moscow Oblast before being sent to the front line. The information provided by HUR suggests that some Cuban nationals are tricked into travelling to Russia after being lured by the promise of lucrative construction work advertised on Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok. Their travel is facilitated by "private intermediaries" who sometimes pay for flights, with Russian diplomatic institutions issuing tourist or work visas. Denmark has pledged $171 million in military aid to Ukraine, while Sweden is considering the delivery of additional aircraft. The $171 million aid will be used to support Ukraine's navy, repair tanks, and provide education and training for Ukrainian military personnel, according to a statement from the Danish Defense Ministry published on Oct. 15. Funds are also allocated for fuel donations and support within rehabilitation zones, both implemented under NATO's auspices. Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson, speaking ahead of the NATO defense ministers' meeting in Brussels on Oct. 15, said Sweden is prepared to expand its support through the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative and the aviation coalition. According to Jonson, Stockholm aims to supply radar reconnaissance and early warning aircraft to Ukraine as an initial step, and will later consider the potential delivery of Swedish Gripen fighter jets. The mayor of Dniproudne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Yevhenii Matvieiev, who was abducted by Russian military personnel, died in a Russian prison from multiple injuries, the Ukrainian media outlet Liga.net reported on Oct. 15, citing the Prosecutor General's Office. According to the report, Matvieiev died on Sept. 7, 2024, while being held at Detention Center No. Matvieiev was reportedly abducted at a checkpoint by Russian forces in 2022. Germany will provide Ukraine with an additional military aid package worth more than 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion), German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius announced on Oct. 15 during the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting in Brussels. The package will include advanced air defense systems, precision-guided weapons, and ammunition. We will continue and expand our support for Ukraine. With new contracts, Germany will provide additional support amounting to over 2 billion euros," Pistorius said. Germany will also deliver two additional IRIS-T air defense systems, accompanied by a large number of guided missiles and shoulder-fired air defense weapons. Anti-tank weapons, small arms, and secure communications systems are also expected to be part of the delivery. Of the total amount, Germany will contribute $500 million to a NATO initiative supplying Ukraine with critically needed U.S.-made weapons, the alliance announced on Aug. 13. The support will come through NATO's Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) mechanism, which coordinates funding for Kyiv's most urgent battlefield needs. A Moscow court has sentenced 42-year-old Ukrainian soldier Volodymyr Parafilo to life imprisonment after he was captured in Russia's Kursk Oblast, Russia's Prosecutor General's Office and Investigative Committee announced on Oct. 15. Parafilo was reportedly captured on Dec. 29, 2024, near the town of Sudzha, in the village of Kamyshovka, according to Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry. Parafilo is to serve the first 10 years of his sentence in prison before being transferred to a special regime correctional colony for the rest of his life. The Estonian Defense Ministry, the Estonian Defense League, and the non-profit organization HK Unicorn Squad MTU signed on Oct. 14 a memorandum of cooperation to enhance drone piloting skills among Estonian citizens. "Drone training is a major component of future warfare. We can already see this today in Ukraine," Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said. A drone struck an industrial area in the Russian city of Ufa where one of Bashkortostan's largest oil refineries is located, the Telegram channel Astra reported on Oct. 15 The Ufaorgsintez refinery is part of the Bashneft oil company, which is affiliated with Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom. According to Astra, local residents reported seeing smoke near the city's industrial zone and experiencing disruptions to mobile internet service. Russian authorities had earlier declared a drone threat in the region and implemented emergency measures  at Ufa airport. 🔥🛢️ Just now, Russian oil refinery complex Bashneft in Ufa — 1,400 km from the frontline was targeted by drones.Bashneft has a total capacity around 23-26 million tons per year.

"Let's trust our military," Rutte said at a news conference after a meeting with NATO defense ministers in Brussels. Rutte underscored that NATO countries are "25 times bigger than Russia" in economic terms. Talking about the recent aerial incursions, the secretary general noted that it is difficult to establish whether they were intentional or not. "We are so much stronger than the Russians that we don't need to shoot down their planes when they enter our airspace," he added. In addition to Yermak, Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko, National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov, First Deputy Foreign Minister Serhii Kyslytsia, and Ukraine's Ambassador to the U.S., Olha Stefanishyna, participated in the meeting. The Ukrainian delegation also held a separate meeting with representatives of another major U.S. defense contractor, Lockheed Martin.

"One of the largest Siberian Internet providers, Orion Telecom, was immediately impoverished by 66 million rubles as a result of a special operation by the HUR MO cyber corps," the source said. Finland and Lithuania have joined the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative, which facilitates the purchase of U.S.-made weapons for transfer to Ukraine, according to statements from both governments ahead of the NATO defense ministers' meeting in Brussels on Oct. 15. Lithuania plans to contribute $30 million toward procuring weapons for Ukraine. Finland, meanwhile, has announced a new military aid package, with full details expected to be released later this week. Meanwhile, Estonia is expected to deliver a batch of drones to Ukraine and allocate additional funding for the PURL initiative. The delivery of Tomahawk long-range missiles will significantly enhance Ukraine's strike capabilities in its war against Russia, a senior NATO official said during a closed-door briefing with journalists on Oct. 15, according to European Pravda. Despite Moscow's aggressive rhetoric, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, expressed doubt that Russia would take any concrete action in response to the potential deliveries. As part of its defense support, the U.K. has invested 600 million pounds (nearly $800 million) in drone production for Ukraine in 2025. Ukraine and the U.K. are also jointly developing Octopus interceptor drones. Once production is fully underway, Kyiv is expected to receive "thousands" of these drones each month, the statement read. Authorities in Kharkiv Oblast have expanded the mandatory evacuation zone for families with children in the Kupiansk district amid intensified Russian assaults, regional governor Oleh Syniehubov announced on Oct. 14. "This decision comes in response to the deteriorating security situation near Kupiansk," Syniehubov said. Russia struck a combined heat and power plant and launched three massive attacks on Ukraine's gas production infrastructure over the last week, Serhii Koretskyi, the CEO of Ukraine's state-owned oil and gas giant Naftogaz, said on Facebook on Oct. 15. Russian missiles and drones damaged gas infrastructure in Kharkiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv oblasts while drones hit the plant, as Moscow steps up its attacks on Ukraine's energy facilities and temperatures drop. "Russian terrorists are committing new acts of terrorism, aimed solely at depriving Ukraine of gas, heat, and light this winter," Koretskyi wrote, adding that the company will "restore everything." The move came a day after Zelensky stripped the tainted Odesa Mayor Trukhanov of Ukrainian citizenship, effectively pushing him out of office. Ukraine's Security Service has confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that Zelensky revoked Ukrainian citizenship of Trukhanov, ballet dancer Serhii Polunin, and former Ukrainian politician Oleg Tsaryov. All three were accused of having Russian citizenship. Sixteen fuel tanks were damaged at the Morskoi Neftianoi Terminal in Russian-occupied Feodosia, Crimea, as a result of a Ukrainian drone strike earlier this week, Ukraine's General Staff said on Oct. 15. The fire it sparked was still visible on Oct. 14 from 25 kilometers away, local media reported. In the same overnight operation, Ukrainian Defense Forces also targeted a P-18 radar system near Krasna Poliana in occupied Crimea, a drone command post in occupied Oleshky, Kherson Oblast, and an ammunition depot near occupied Makiivka in Donetsk Oblast, the General Staff added. At least seven people have been killed and 29 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Oct. 15. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 86 out of the 113 Shahed-type attack drones and other drones launched by Russia overnight, according to the Air Force. Debris from the drones was recorded at a single site. In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks killed three people and injured 15, including a child, over the past day, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a 75-year-old woman was killed in a Russian FPV (first-person-view) drone strike against the city of Nikopol, while a 19-year-old man was injured in an attack against the city of Pavlohrad, the local authorities reported. In Sumy Oblast, six people suffered injuries due to Russian attacks over the past day, according to the local military administration. In Kharkiv Oblast, Russian attacks targeted five settlements over the past day, injuring a 54-year-old man and a 52-year-old woman in the village of Nechvolodivka, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. Russia has lost around 1,126,220 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Oct. 15. According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,259 tanks, 23,347 armored fighting vehicles, 64,329 vehicles and fuel tanks, 33,671 artillery systems, 1,520 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,227 air defense systems, 427 airplanes, 346 helicopters, 70,021 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.

LONDON — Sumo wrestlers participating in the Grand Sumo Tournament in London toured the city center on Tuesday, visiting famous landmarks. The tournament will be held from Wednesday through Sunday. The two yokozuna, Onosato and Hoshoryu, along with the other wrestlers, left their hotel by coach and got off in front of the London Eye ferris wheel. As they crossed Westminster Bridge over the River Thames, many of the wrestlers took commemorative photos with Elizabeth Tower, often called Big Ben, in the background. Wherever they went, the wrestlers were greeted by tourists shouting, “Sumo wrestlers!” and they happily posed for photos. They later visited Buckingham Palace and other sites, recharging their batteries through their London stroll ahead of the opening performance the following day.

The department posted screenshots of messages and quotes it said were made by six people from Germany, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Paraguay, and South Africa. An Argentinian national allegedly accused Kirk of spreading racist views and claimed he “deserved” to die, while a German national allegedly wrote, “when fascists die, democrats don't complain.” A person from Brazil was said to have written that Kirk “was the reason for a Nazi rally where they marched in homage to him” and had “died too late.” An Argentine national said that Kirk “devoted his entire life spreading racist, xenophobic, misogynistic rhetoric” and deserves to burn in hell.Visa revoked. The US State Department said the posts were “just a few examples of aliens who are no longer welcome in the US,” adding that it would continue to identify foreigners who celebrated Kirk's death. There are people who would make the world better off dead.”Visa revoked. On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump posthumously awarded Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. Kirk's widow, Erika, received the medal on his behalf. Although most Democrats condemned the killing, Trump and other Republicans have blamed the “radical left” for inciting political violence. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. AMOS YADLIN is Founder and President of MIND Israel. He is a retired Major General in the Israeli Air Force and served as the head of Israel's Defense Intelligence from 2006 to 2010. From 2018 to 2023, he was a Senior Director on Israel's National Security Council. In his recent speeches in Egypt and Israel, U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly invoked the word “peace” when describing his vision for a new Middle East. As we argued in Foreign Affairs last December, Israel's battlefield achievements against Hamas and Hezbollah—together with the collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria—had created a rare opening for the Jewish state, the United States, and key Arab countries to forge a coalition capable of stabilizing the region and countering extremism. Earlier this month, after two years of fighting, Hamas and Israel finally agreed to a U.S.-brokered cease-fire that could both end the war in Gaza and dismantle the terror organization. As a result, these two regional spoilers are on the back foot. A better future, in other words, is very much within reach. Even Israeli politicians—foremost among them Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu—are speaking of peace again, after years in which that word had virtually disappeared from their lexicons. That does not mean the path forward is obstacle-free. Hamas is still the strongest political and military force in Gaza and has maintained support in the West Bank. Unlike in the past, these hurdles are all surmountable. But overcoming them will require a new regional coalition. It will need to eventually expand into a broader Mediterranean partnership. Trump may have been disappointed not to receive the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. But in the eyes of most Israelis, he has earned it. The U.S. president imposed a cease-fire framework on Netanyahu, who had resisted popular demand for a deal that would have returned all hostages and ended the war. Trump did so while simultaneously getting Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey to exert heavy pressure on Hamas, which had also been reticent to sign such an agreement. Many of its provisions remain undefined, and it appears that Washington offered bilateral assurances—perhaps even contradictory ones—to both parties. Israel's claim to victory centers on the return of all hostages, the military's dismantlement of Hamas as an organized force, and the creation of an international plan to eradicate its rule and disarm its militias. Israelis also get to maintain a security zone in Gaza until Hamas's disarmament is complete. Hamas, for its part, gets to declare that it withstood Israel's army for two years, forced its withdrawal from Gaza, secured the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners, put the Palestinian issue back on the global agenda, and extracted assurances that Israel will not resume the conflict. Trump's 20-point peace plan unfolds in three stages, and only the first is underway and well defined with numerical parameters: the release of all Israeli hostages in exchange for the liberation of convicted Palestinian militants, coupled with the redeployment of Israeli forces outside central Gaza. The second phase—disarming Hamas and establishing a new governing authority in Gaza with the participation of Arab and other international forces—will be far more difficult to implement. And should the parties fail to carry it out, Gaza could come to resemble Lebanon: formally ruled by a recognized government but effectively controlled by a militant organization. It will be Israel's most significant contribution to the Trump plan, taking place after Hamas's dismantlement in the second phase. Through a combination of pressure and inducements, Trump and his talented team have succeeded in forging an Arab-Palestinian front that supports the demilitarization of Hamas—an unprecedented achievement in a region where no actor has ever voluntarily surrendered its military capabilities. Israeli fighting in Lebanon, for instance, diminished the power of Hezbollah, which now faces mounting pressure from the United States and from Lebanon's government. The survival and broad recognition of Ahmed al-Shara's government in Syria further underscores Tehran's diminishing influence, especially given that Shara clearly wants to prevent Iranian meddling in the country. Its leadership seeks revenge against Israel, and it will almost certainly study the war's lessons alongside its partners in Beijing, Moscow, and Pyongyang. Its nuclear infrastructure is bruised, but it has effectively dismantled the International Atomic Energy Agency's oversight of its nuclear program and still has several nuclear weapons' worth of enriched uranium on hand. It frequently threatens to alter its nuclear strategy and has hinted at leaving the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty or even obtaining a bomb. The two countries' attacks on Iran's nuclear program, for instance, improved the United States' leverage in future negotiations without prompting escalation or regional warfare: all the predictions that U.S. attacks would provoke a regional war, close the Strait of Hormuz, prompt oil prices to skyrocket, and yield a wave of terror never materialized. Meanwhile, in Gaza, American diplomatic, financial, and military support allowed Israel to degrade Hamas and thus strike a deal to bring the hostages home. That doesn't mean the two sides were perfectly aligned; in private, U.S. officials pushed their Israeli counterparts to move toward peace, resulting in this month's agreement. Yet Washington showed that genuine influence over Israeli policy derives not from public reprimands or arms embargoes but from unwavering public support and closed-door pressure. It has achieved military success without the loss of a single American life and facilitated a peace that has been broadly welcomed across the region. Washington has demonstrated that sustained and strategic involvement in the Middle East can, in fact, reinforce the United States' position as a leading power—in contrast with its rivals. The region is not a quagmire of endless conflicts and financial burdens from which it must disengage. Distorted narratives—including claims that Israel deliberately starved civilians—were fueled by anti-Semitic networks and Hamas's global propaganda machine and compounded by Israel's own diplomatic shortcomings. The consequences of all this anger are real. Arab governments, for example, have put a stop to their efforts at normalizing relations with Israel because they are fearful of antagonizing their constituents. Regional officials are also worried that Israel is aiming not just for security but for regional hegemony through military dominance and territorial expansion. Israel is also staring down new regional competitors. Iran may be weakened, but Muslim Brotherhood–aligned governments in Qatar and Turkey have gained influence. Qatar has also extended its reach into Lebanon. But they are not friendly to the Jewish state, either. Qatar, for example, continues to act as a patron of Hamas, and it amplifies anti-Israeli messaging via its Al Jazeera media network. Israel will thus need to carefully manage its relations with the two countries and push for a shift in their hostile policies, ideally in cooperation with Washington. Otherwise, they could fill the vacuum left by Tehran by propping up Sunni radicals from East Africa to the Middle East. For Israel, diplomatic isolation, Iran, and Sunni extremism will cause continued headaches. Yet overall, the Middle East is becoming more favorable for Israeli interests. There is now a genuine opportunity to end hostilities between Israel and both Lebanon and Syria—and even to slowly normalize relations with both countries. If Azerbaijan, a long-standing Israeli partner, formally joins this regional force, it would strengthen its own relationship with the United States and reinforce stability across Central Asia. Today, countries across the world, including in the Middle East, are seeking more autonomy in their relationships, diversifying partnerships, and redefining their dependencies. They are more focused on acquiring advanced technology—which has become the currency of power—and maintaining stability. And Israel, with its powerful military, strong tech industry, and ties to Washington, is the best partner most Arab states can find for running this gauntlet. These countries can deepen their integration even without normalization. They could build a technological ecosystem that links the United States to the Gulf's infrastructure, its energy resources, and Israel's knowledge and innovation, for example, without doing so—and it would be far less politically sensitive. But either way, Arab governments will have to overcome their fears of angering their populations and plow ahead with regional integration. Israel can simultaneously forge an even stronger relationship with Washington. The two countries should set up a new technological partnership, codified in a bilateral memorandum of understanding, predicated on equitable Israeli-American capital contributions across important tech sectors—including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, energy, and semiconductors. Most of all, the United States should help facilitate Israel's integration with its Arab neighbors. But it also means that Washington should ensure Israel's innovative tech ecosystem is connected to the Gulf's and invigorating the India­–Middle East–Europe Economic Corridor (better known as IMEC). To do so, Washington could name a czar specifically tasked with making this bloc of states more cohesive. On the military front, the United States should set up a permanent security architecture that combines both Israeli and Gulf resources. It should establish a regional air defense apparatus controlled by the U.S. military's Central Command (popularly known as CENTCOM). But Washington should also establish a broader permanent joint command structure that oversees the region's maritime, cyber, and counterterrorism operations. This structure can feature Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and even Qatar—if it recalibrates its policies. To further their cooperation, Israel, the United States, and the Arab states should expand their regional coalition into a broader Mediterranean partnership—a kind of pax Mediterranea—that promotes stability, prosperity, and technological progress across all its members. And today, it is more achievable than ever. But if the United States channels its renewed assertiveness and if local actors can align their power with purpose, the Middle East may finally move from perpetual crisis management into a sustainable order. But they can certainly try to shift its trajectory in a more hopeful direction. To do so, these actors will need to embrace Trump's framework for a peace committee, which conditions any Israeli concessions on genuine Palestinian reform. Israel will need to receive the remaining hostages' bodies and retain its security primacy in Gaza in order to prevent Hamas's resurgence and ensure that whatever administration follows is effective, made up of both Palestinians and international technocrats. But regional integration cannot hinge on the Palestinian issue. A veto from Ramallah would almost assuredly doom the rest of this project—and, with it, the region's chance at long-term stability. It is instead time to prioritize peace through strength in its truest sense: not as a slogan, but as a strategy anchored in shared interests, credible deterrence, and the conviction that stability is best secured by those prepared to defend it.
