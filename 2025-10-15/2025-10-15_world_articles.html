Please make this work possible with a quick donation. We speak with Rutgers University professor Mark Bray, who fled from the U.S. to Spain with his family after receiving death threats over his scholarship. Turning Point USA, the conservative campus group founded by Charlie Kirk, had called for Bray's firing and branded him “Dr. Antifa.” This comes as the Trump administration has dramatically escalated its war on dissent following Kirk's assassination, using his death as pretext to launch an assault on activists, organizations and speech it disagrees with. “What we're seeing today in the U.S. is increasingly fascist. President Trump signed an executive order designating antifa as a terrorist organization, but Bray stresses there is no such organization; anti-fascism is a loose political movement or ideology akin to feminism, but Trump is using the label to “demonize resistance” to his policies. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. Copy may not be in its final form. Yesterday, President Trump posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Charlie Kirk at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. Trump recently signed an executive order purporting to designate antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, even though it's not really an organization. Antifa is actually a shortening of the term “anti-fascist” and is a term that arose in Europe for the movement against the Nazis, both before and after World War II. Several high-level Republicans have accused this Saturday's “No Kings Day” protests of being organized by antifa. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said last week the administration will take the, quote, “same approach” to antifa as it has to drug cartels it's bombed in the Caribbean. This is Bondi on Fox News last night. ATTORNEY GENERAL PAM BONDI: That's one of the things about antifa. You're seeing people out there with thousands of signs that all match, pre-bought, pre-put together. They're organized, and someone is funding it. AMY GOODMAN: This comes as Los Angeles County officials voted Tuesday to declare a state of emergency over ongoing federal immigration raids they say have, quote, “caused widespread fear,” unquote. Violent attacks by federal agents at protests against immigrant raids have also been documented in Chicago and Portland. On Tuesday, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson [was asked] if he would call for more oversight of federal agents. He responded by complaining about a naked bike ride protest against ICE in Portland, Oregon, which Trump has called a war zone. SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON: To demand oversight on federal law enforcement? I've not seen them cross the line yet, and that we have committees of jurisdiction who have that responsibility, but it's not risen to that level. What I've seen is the abuse of law enforcement by radical leftist activists. You know, most recently, the most threatening thing I've seen yet was the naked bicyclers in Portland who were protesting ICE down there. AMY GOODMAN: Experts are increasingly raising concerns the Trump administration's attacks on antifa are ungrounded in fact and law, and violate free speech rights. For more, we're joined by someone who knows a lot about all of this. Last week, he was forced to leave his home in New Jersey and move to Spain with his family after receiving death threats following Trump's push to categorize the anti-fascist movement as a domestic terrorist organization. Charlie Kirk's group, Turning Point USA, had also circulated a petition labeling him “Dr. Antifa” and calling for him to be fired. In a remarkable development, Bray was at first blocked from flying out of the United States last week. He wrote on Bluesky, “Someone canceled my family's flight out of the country at the last second. '” They later took another flight, and professor Mark Bray joins us now from Spain. Thanks so much for being with us. I'm sorry you've gone through all this, Professor Bray. If you can start off by talking about why you left the country and what happened, as we try to follow what was happening to you at the airport? So, I published this book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, in 2017. I'm actually researching different historical topics now. But after Trump's executive order, a series of far-right trolls, online influencers started attacking me. I received a number of death threats. Someone published my home address on X. So I started to fear for the safety of my family staying in our home. More and more death threats came in, and I knew I needed to get away. As you said, our first flight was mysteriously canceled at the last moment. AMY GOODMAN: I want to ask: When you — AMY GOODMAN: I just want to ask: When say your flight was canceled, you went to — what was it? There were a series of phone calls and mumbling. And they basically said, at the last moment, someone had canceled our reservation — not the whole flight, just for the four of us, for me, my wife and our two small children. And this is around the same time that Andy Ngo and Jack Posobiec, two of the far-right provocateurs who had been harassing me online, were meeting in the White House with President Trump to discuss antifa. I just can't believe it's a coincidence. AMY GOODMAN: And yet, you were able to rebook the next day, and you made it through security, and you actually made it onto the flight? MARK BRAY: Well, this time, I was stopped, searched and interrogated by federal agents for an hour. And at one point, they took me into a side room, and my two kids saw what looked like very bad men taking me in another room, and they started sobbing. So, it was quite an ordeal even the next day. And frankly, I'm very fearful about the potential of returning, but hopefully, by next year, things will improve. AMY GOODMAN: I mean, this is astounding. You weren't trying to come into the United States. MARK BRAY: And I'm not being charged with any crimes. If anything, I'm the victim of crimes. I wrote a book eight years ago. I'm just trying to live my life here. But, of course, because the far right is trying to create a bogeyman term in “antifa” to equate protests with terrorism, I got caught up in the middle of this. If you can explain what antifa is and what it means for President Trump to have issued this executive order calling it a terrorist — domestic terrorist organization? Talk about antifa now and through history. So, as you said, it's a term that is short for “anti-fascist” or “anti-fascism.” It's originally German from the era of opposition to Hitler. After World War II, anti-fascism continued throughout the world, and the specific European tradition of what they called antifa spread to other countries around the world. Sometimes there are feminist groups, but feminism itself is not a group. It's a thing you do to organize against the far right in decentralized groups. And it's really, you know, an obvious page out of the textbooks about fascist and authoritarian leaders. It's so — it's such an obvious imitation of, you know, the kind of the Red Scare talk about communism, but applied to today. AMY GOODMAN: It's very interesting you've moved to Spain. I mean, for years we've covered the Abraham Lincoln Brigadistas, Brigade, those Americans who went to Spain, where you are now, to fight against the fascist Franco. And this was just before World War II. They were the most experienced, presumably, in fighting. But when a number of them signed up to fight in World War II, to fight Hitler, they were labeled “premature anti-fascists.” Can you talk about that? And they were not allowed to fight in World War II. A significant number of them lost their lives. And it is also worth pointing out that a number of Spanish Civil War veterans from other countries who ended up going to France after the Spanish Civil War played important roles in the French underground. And there was a tank battalion of Spanish anarchists that were among the first to liberate Paris in 1945. So, it is strange to sort of have these things twisted around. But I've received a lot of solidarity and support from the social movements here. And actually, there's a general strike today in Spain for Palestine, as well — just to throw into your news report. AMY GOODMAN: We had you on last in 2017 to discuss your book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, when it first came out. In the introduction, you wrote you hoped your work would promote organizing against fascism and white supremacy. There's also a really good book called The Black Antifascist Tradition that talks about the role of anti-fascism in Black liberation struggles, Black Panthers and so forth, which I suggest people check out. And what we're seeing today in the U.S. is increasingly fascist. And for me personally, I felt like my situation was such that I had to get my family out of harm's way. It's about attacks on academic freedom, free speech, the right to protest. And so, everyone, in their own way, needs to take action to try and organize against this. You remind me of Timothy Snyder, as well as Jason Stanley, the two Yale professors, who also left the country. I wanted to ask you about U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi's comments, saying the administration will take the, quote, “same approach” to antifa as it has to drug cartels it's bombed in the Caribbean. The latest bombing, I think, took place yesterday, killing a number of people. Even Republican politicians, behind closed doors, are saying, “Where is the evidence?” for who these people are, who have been killed by the U.S. bombs. Mark Bray, your response to Pam Bondi? Well, the paradox of fascism is that while it's trying to gain power, it talks about the need for law and order, and to the degree that it gains power, it tramples all over the law. It does not care about the law or legality, due process, civil liberties. And so, this kind of call to murder people in this country, without, of course, even having gone through any due process — not that I'm in favor of capital punishment anyway, but that's another story — it is this kind of example of calling for the strongman, in Trump, to use deadly force, without any evidence, against people accused of made-up crimes that are being equated with — you know, at times, some of the Trump administration people have compared it to — ISIS to antifa, right? So, to me, it's really this kind of fascist attack on civil liberties. — where students were gunned down in the '60s. It could happen again if we're not careful. So we really need to be very vigilant about this. AMY GOODMAN: Do you think progressive groups, groups that care about democracy, free speech, across the political spectrum, are pushing back enough around the attack on anti-fascists? MARK BRAY: Well, you know, I think there's always room for more action. And I think that my main takeaway for viewers today is that whether or not you consider yourself an anti-fascist, anyone who has any critiques of Trump is potentially in the crosshairs here, because there's a concerted project from the top to equate protest with terrorism and to say anyone who's not a Trump supporter is basically the equivalent of ISIS. You can't make this stuff up. They don't care at all about grounding in fact or information. AMY GOODMAN: Finally, I wanted to ask you about the Rutgers students calling for the university to support you, wanting Rutgers President William Tate to issue a statement, a, quote, “Resolution in Support of Professor Mark Bray's Academic Freedom and Free Expression.” This apparently is slated for consideration and vote Friday by the Rutgers University Senate. I would very much appreciate a statement of direct support from President Tate. But, you know, to his credit, he did issue a statement in support of the free speech and academic freedom of all Rutgers faculty, which did not mention me directly, but I think, implicitly, supported my right to do my scholarship in accord with my job. But, you know, again, the Rutgers community has been fantastic, and especially given attacks on higher education across the country, the way that some subjects have been, basically, straight-up banned in states like Florida, I'm happy to be a professor at Rutgers. AMY GOODMAN: Mark Bray, Rutgers University history professor, author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook. He's just moved his family to Spain after receiving death threats following President Trump's push to categorize the anti-fascist movement as a domestic terrorist organization. Coming up, we speak with a professor at Stanford University, professor emeritus, about what — the deal that was made in Sharm el-Sheikh, and also about his own niece, who had been held hostage by Hamas in Gaza for 54 days, her husband killed. AMY GOODMAN: “Nunca Más,” “Never Again,” by La Santa Cecilia. Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leaked Young Republican club group chat allegedly describes black people as ‘monkeys' Leaked messages from the Telegram group chat for Republican students, young staffers, and budding politicians, allegedly described black people as “monkeys” and “the watermelon people,” joked about sending their political foes to the gas chamber, and wrote: “I love Hitler”. The Young Republicans group chat is said to have included members from New York, Kansas, Arizona, and Vermont. It also included senior members of the club, a sitting senator, and staffers working for elected officials, according to MSNBC, several of whom have since apologised. “The more the political atmosphere is open and liberating – like it has been with the emergence of Trump and a more Right-wing GOP even before him – it opens up young people and older people to telling racist jokes, making racist commentaries in private and public,” Joe Feagin, a Texas A&M sociology professor, told Politico. “It's chilling, of course, because they will act on these views.” “Only an activist, Left-wing reporter would desperately try to tie President Trump into a story about a random group chat he has no affiliation with, while failing to mention the dangerous smears coming from Democrat politicians who have fantasised about murdering their opponent and called Republicans Nazis and fascists,” Liz Huston, the White House spokeswoman, told Politico. Asked about the Politico report, Mr Vance said outraged reactions amounted to “pearl-clutching”. Referring to texts sent by Jay Jones, the Democratic candidate for Virginia attorney general, in which he joked about shooting a political rival, Mr Vance said: “This is far worse than anything said in a college group chat, and the guy who said it could become the AG of Virginia. “I refuse to join the pearl-clutching when powerful people call for political violence.” “Such behaviour is disgraceful, unbecoming of any Republican, and stands in direct opposition to the values our movement represents. “Those involved must immediately resign from all positions within their state and local Young Republican organisations. We must hold ourselves to the highest standards of integrity, respect, and professionalism.”</p>

It may come as a surprise to some that up until about 1,000 years ago, surnames were The world's best and most ambitious young pianists have descended on Warsaw for the Frederic Chopin International Piano Competition — for some, a gateway to classical music glory. Continued from yesterday（延續自昨日） https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang While many early surnames in England were strongly influenced by the work people did, like Carpenter or Plumber, jobs were not the only factor. Physical characteristics, personal nicknames, geographical locations and even parents' first names also played a role. It's not hard to imagine how the color of a person's hair could have led to a surname like “Redhead” or “White,” while a darker complexion might have resulted in the last name “Black.” Meanwhile, someone known as a quick runner might have earned the surname “Swift,” while a clever or cunning individual could have been called “Fox”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cancellations represent escalating government-wide campaign to suppress criticism of rightwing influencer Civil liberties advocates are warning that the Trump administration's decision to strip visas from at least six foreign nationals over social media posts about Charlie Kirk's killing represents yet another example of dangerous government crackdowns on protected speech. The visa cancellations represent an escalating government-wide campaign to suppress criticism of Kirk, who was killed last month. The administration cut visas for nationals from Argentina, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, Germany and Paraguay. “The Trump administration must stop punishing people for their opinions alone.” A German national also had their visa cancelled for a post written in German that translated to: “when fascists die, democrats don't complain.” The state department characterized this as celebrating Kirk's death and attempting to justify his murder. The Brazilian stripped of his US visa is Tiago Santineli, a far-left standup comedian and online influencer who published a series of inflammatory tweets about Charlie Kirk after his assassination. The controversial Brasília-born comedian, who has nearly a million YouTube subscribers, published several other incendiary messages about Kirk's 10 September assassination. Santineli did not reply to a request for comment but writing on X on 1 October he said he had received an email from the US embassy revoking his visa. “But the worst thing is that Charlie Kirk will never be able to leave hahahahahahahahaha.” Another person singled out by the visa restrictions was Enrique “Kike” Gamarra, a veteran talkshow host who is often critical of Paraguay's conservative government. In a recent programme, Gamarra said that Kirk's killing “doesn't absolve the way he lived his life. A state department cable obtained by the Guardian at the time ordered consular offices to conduct comprehensive social media investigations of student visa applicants, with officers instructed to preserve screenshots of “potentially derogatory” content to create permanent records – even if posts were altered or deleted. The March directive established sweeping new grounds for visa denials, writing that “evidence that an applicant advocates for terrorist activity, or otherwise demonstrates a degree of public approval or public advocacy for terrorist activity or a terrorist organization” could justify rejection. It also mandated social media reviews of all students applying for visas, with fraud prevention units directed to flag and document content the administration deems threatening to national security. The directive followed high-profile visa revocations and arrests targeting pro-Palestinian campus activism, signaling an aggressive expansion of how immigration enforcement could be wielded against political speech. “The supreme court has been clear that noncitizens have a right to freedom of speech” Fitzpatrick said. “In America, no one should fear a midnight knock at the door because of their political views.”</p>

According to the U.K. Foreign Office, both Rosneft and Lukoil conduct business in sectors of "strategic and economic significance" to the Russian government. The oil and gas industry generated 113 billion euros ($131 billion) in tax for the Kremlin in 2024, about a third of its total revenue, covering 83% of military expenditures. "At this critical moment for Ukraine, Europe is stepping up," U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said. "Together, the U.K. and our allies are piling the pressure on (Russian President Vladimir) Putin — going after his oil, gas, and shadow fleet." "We will not relent until he abandons his failed war of conquest and gets serious about peace." The new U.K. measures also target foreign companies that facilitate Russian oil exports, including India's Nayara Energy — in which Rosneft holds the largest share — and China's National Pipeline Group Beihai Liquefied Natural Gas Co. Ltd. Three companies based in the United Arab Emirates — Novus Energy DMCC, Wissol Commodities FZCO, and Alghaf Marine DMCC — were also sanctioned for transporting or trading Russian oil. The U.K. also blacklisted 51 vessels belonging to Russia's so-called "shadow fleet," tankers that operate under opaque ownership and flags of convenience to evade Western sanctions. Additional restrictions were placed on several Russian banks, the National Card Payment System, and technology firms operating in sectors deemed strategically vital to the Kremlin. Kyiv continues urging Western allies to tighten sanctions on Russia's energy sector, arguing that depriving Moscow of oil revenues would further limit its ability to finance its war against Ukraine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Madagascar's new military ruler Michael Randrianirina said on Wednesday he would soon be sworn in as president of the African island nation after a coup he led to oust President Andry Rajoelina. Randrianirina has told Malagasy citizens that the military has taken power and dissolved all institutions except the lower house of parliament or National Assembly. Soldiers in Madagascar announce military takeover after president flees Randrianirina said on Tuesday that a committee led by the military would rule for up to two years alongside a transitional government before organizing new elections. Randrianirina was a commander in the elite CAPSAT army unit that played a key role in the 2009 coup that brought Rajoelina to power but broke ranks with him last week, urging soldiers not to fire on protesters. Gen Z protesters, waving pirate flags, force Madagascar's president to flee country Rajoelina fled Madagascar on Sunday aboard a French military plane, security sources told Reuters. He has said his life was at risk and is now believed to be in Dubai, according to three diplomatic and opposition sources.

MOSCOW, October 15. /TASS/. Moscow has always been guided by the Syrian people's interests in its relations with Damascus, Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with Syria's interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa.

"Russia has never treated Syria based on political circumstances or special interests. For all these decades, we have been guided solely by the interests of the Syrian people," Putin emphasized.

According to the Russian leader, Moscow has strong, genuine ties with the Syrian people. "Suffice it to say, hundreds and perhaps thousands of people are bound by friendships and marriages," Putin explained.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to relocate World Cup matches set to be played next year in suburban Boston, after suggesting that parts of the city had been “taken over” by unrest. Trump was asked about Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu, a Democrat whom he called “intelligent” but “radical left.” “We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. He suggested “they're taking over parts of Boston” without offering details, but added “we could get them back in about two seconds.” Trump's comments came during his meeting with Argentina President Javier Milei and it wasn't immediately clear what he was referring to by parts of Boston having been seized. Earlier this month, however, there were multiple arrests in connection with a pro-Palestinian protest that turned violent on Boston Common. Trump has previously suggested he could declare cities “not safe” for the 104-game soccer tournament and alter a detailed hosting plan that FIFA confirmed in 2022. It includes games at NFL stadiums near New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Trump's travel ban allows athletes from affected nations into US for the World Cup and Olympics. World Cup host sites aren't up to Trump. Trump nonetheless said, “If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who's phenomenal – and I would say, ‘Let's move into another location' and they would do that.” The president meant FIFA head Gianni Infantino, a close ally.</p>

The department posted screenshots of messages and quotes it said were made by six people from Germany, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Paraguay, and South Africa. An Argentinian national allegedly accused Kirk of spreading racist views and claimed he “deserved” to die, while a German national allegedly wrote, “when fascists die, democrats don't complain.” A person from Brazil was said to have written that Kirk “was the reason for a Nazi rally where they marched in homage to him” and had “died too late.” An Argentine national said that Kirk “devoted his entire life spreading racist, xenophobic, misogynistic rhetoric” and deserves to burn in hell.Visa revoked. The US State Department said the posts were “just a few examples of aliens who are no longer welcome in the US,” adding that it would continue to identify foreigners who celebrated Kirk's death. There are people who would make the world better off dead.”Visa revoked. On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump posthumously awarded Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. Kirk's widow, Erika, received the medal on his behalf. Although most Democrats condemned the killing, Trump and other Republicans have blamed the “radical left” for inciting political violence. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. AMOS YADLIN is Founder and President of MIND Israel. He is a retired Major General in the Israeli Air Force and served as the head of Israel's Defense Intelligence from 2006 to 2010. AVNER GOLOV is Vice President of MIND Israel. From 2018 to 2023, he was a Senior Director on Israel's National Security Council. In his recent speeches in Egypt and Israel, U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly invoked the word “peace” when describing his vision for a new Middle East. As we argued in Foreign Affairs last December, Israel's battlefield achievements against Hamas and Hezbollah—together with the collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria—had created a rare opening for the Jewish state, the United States, and key Arab countries to forge a coalition capable of stabilizing the region and countering extremism. Earlier this month, after two years of fighting, Hamas and Israel finally agreed to a U.S.-brokered cease-fire that could both end the war in Gaza and dismantle the terror organization. As a result, these two regional spoilers are on the back foot. A better future, in other words, is very much within reach. Even Israeli politicians—foremost among them Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu—are speaking of peace again, after years in which that word had virtually disappeared from their lexicons. That does not mean the path forward is obstacle-free. Hamas is still the strongest political and military force in Gaza and has maintained support in the West Bank. Unlike in the past, these hurdles are all surmountable. But overcoming them will require a new regional coalition. It will need to eventually expand into a broader Mediterranean partnership. Trump may have been disappointed not to receive the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. But in the eyes of most Israelis, he has earned it. The U.S. president imposed a cease-fire framework on Netanyahu, who had resisted popular demand for a deal that would have returned all hostages and ended the war. Trump did so while simultaneously getting Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey to exert heavy pressure on Hamas, which had also been reticent to sign such an agreement. Many of its provisions remain undefined, and it appears that Washington offered bilateral assurances—perhaps even contradictory ones—to both parties. Israel's claim to victory centers on the return of all hostages, the military's dismantlement of Hamas as an organized force, and the creation of an international plan to eradicate its rule and disarm its militias. Israelis also get to maintain a security zone in Gaza until Hamas's disarmament is complete. Hamas, for its part, gets to declare that it withstood Israel's army for two years, forced its withdrawal from Gaza, secured the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners, put the Palestinian issue back on the global agenda, and extracted assurances that Israel will not resume the conflict. Trump's 20-point peace plan unfolds in three stages, and only the first is underway and well defined with numerical parameters: the release of all Israeli hostages in exchange for the liberation of convicted Palestinian militants, coupled with the redeployment of Israeli forces outside central Gaza. The second phase—disarming Hamas and establishing a new governing authority in Gaza with the participation of Arab and other international forces—will be far more difficult to implement. And should the parties fail to carry it out, Gaza could come to resemble Lebanon: formally ruled by a recognized government but effectively controlled by a militant organization. It will be Israel's most significant contribution to the Trump plan, taking place after Hamas's dismantlement in the second phase. Through a combination of pressure and inducements, Trump and his talented team have succeeded in forging an Arab-Palestinian front that supports the demilitarization of Hamas—an unprecedented achievement in a region where no actor has ever voluntarily surrendered its military capabilities. Israeli fighting in Lebanon, for instance, diminished the power of Hezbollah, which now faces mounting pressure from the United States and from Lebanon's government. The survival and broad recognition of Ahmed al-Shara's government in Syria further underscores Tehran's diminishing influence, especially given that Shara clearly wants to prevent Iranian meddling in the country. Its leadership seeks revenge against Israel, and it will almost certainly study the war's lessons alongside its partners in Beijing, Moscow, and Pyongyang. Its nuclear infrastructure is bruised, but it has effectively dismantled the International Atomic Energy Agency's oversight of its nuclear program and still has several nuclear weapons' worth of enriched uranium on hand. It frequently threatens to alter its nuclear strategy and has hinted at leaving the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty or even obtaining a bomb. The two countries' attacks on Iran's nuclear program, for instance, improved the United States' leverage in future negotiations without prompting escalation or regional warfare: all the predictions that U.S. attacks would provoke a regional war, close the Strait of Hormuz, prompt oil prices to skyrocket, and yield a wave of terror never materialized. Meanwhile, in Gaza, American diplomatic, financial, and military support allowed Israel to degrade Hamas and thus strike a deal to bring the hostages home. That doesn't mean the two sides were perfectly aligned; in private, U.S. officials pushed their Israeli counterparts to move toward peace, resulting in this month's agreement. Yet Washington showed that genuine influence over Israeli policy derives not from public reprimands or arms embargoes but from unwavering public support and closed-door pressure. It has achieved military success without the loss of a single American life and facilitated a peace that has been broadly welcomed across the region. Washington has demonstrated that sustained and strategic involvement in the Middle East can, in fact, reinforce the United States' position as a leading power—in contrast with its rivals. The region is not a quagmire of endless conflicts and financial burdens from which it must disengage. Distorted narratives—including claims that Israel deliberately starved civilians—were fueled by anti-Semitic networks and Hamas's global propaganda machine and compounded by Israel's own diplomatic shortcomings. The consequences of all this anger are real. Arab governments, for example, have put a stop to their efforts at normalizing relations with Israel because they are fearful of antagonizing their constituents. Regional officials are also worried that Israel is aiming not just for security but for regional hegemony through military dominance and territorial expansion. Israel is also staring down new regional competitors. Iran may be weakened, but Muslim Brotherhood–aligned governments in Qatar and Turkey have gained influence. Qatar has also extended its reach into Lebanon. But they are not friendly to the Jewish state, either. Qatar, for example, continues to act as a patron of Hamas, and it amplifies anti-Israeli messaging via its Al Jazeera media network. Israel will thus need to carefully manage its relations with the two countries and push for a shift in their hostile policies, ideally in cooperation with Washington. Otherwise, they could fill the vacuum left by Tehran by propping up Sunni radicals from East Africa to the Middle East. For Israel, diplomatic isolation, Iran, and Sunni extremism will cause continued headaches. Yet overall, the Middle East is becoming more favorable for Israeli interests. There is now a genuine opportunity to end hostilities between Israel and both Lebanon and Syria—and even to slowly normalize relations with both countries. If Azerbaijan, a long-standing Israeli partner, formally joins this regional force, it would strengthen its own relationship with the United States and reinforce stability across Central Asia. Today, countries across the world, including in the Middle East, are seeking more autonomy in their relationships, diversifying partnerships, and redefining their dependencies. They are more focused on acquiring advanced technology—which has become the currency of power—and maintaining stability. And Israel, with its powerful military, strong tech industry, and ties to Washington, is the best partner most Arab states can find for running this gauntlet. These countries can deepen their integration even without normalization. They could build a technological ecosystem that links the United States to the Gulf's infrastructure, its energy resources, and Israel's knowledge and innovation, for example, without doing so—and it would be far less politically sensitive. But either way, Arab governments will have to overcome their fears of angering their populations and plow ahead with regional integration. Israel can simultaneously forge an even stronger relationship with Washington. The two countries should set up a new technological partnership, codified in a bilateral memorandum of understanding, predicated on equitable Israeli-American capital contributions across important tech sectors—including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, energy, and semiconductors. Most of all, the United States should help facilitate Israel's integration with its Arab neighbors. But it also means that Washington should ensure Israel's innovative tech ecosystem is connected to the Gulf's and invigorating the India­–Middle East–Europe Economic Corridor (better known as IMEC). To do so, Washington could name a czar specifically tasked with making this bloc of states more cohesive. On the military front, the United States should set up a permanent security architecture that combines both Israeli and Gulf resources. It should establish a regional air defense apparatus controlled by the U.S. military's Central Command (popularly known as CENTCOM). But Washington should also establish a broader permanent joint command structure that oversees the region's maritime, cyber, and counterterrorism operations. This structure can feature Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and even Qatar—if it recalibrates its policies. To further their cooperation, Israel, the United States, and the Arab states should expand their regional coalition into a broader Mediterranean partnership—a kind of pax Mediterranea—that promotes stability, prosperity, and technological progress across all its members. But if the United States channels its renewed assertiveness and if local actors can align their power with purpose, the Middle East may finally move from perpetual crisis management into a sustainable order. But they can certainly try to shift its trajectory in a more hopeful direction. To do so, these actors will need to embrace Trump's framework for a peace committee, which conditions any Israeli concessions on genuine Palestinian reform. Israel will need to receive the remaining hostages' bodies and retain its security primacy in Gaza in order to prevent Hamas's resurgence and ensure that whatever administration follows is effective, made up of both Palestinians and international technocrats. But regional integration cannot hinge on the Palestinian issue. A veto from Ramallah would almost assuredly doom the rest of this project—and, with it, the region's chance at long-term stability. It is instead time to prioritize peace through strength in its truest sense: not as a slogan, but as a strategy anchored in shared interests, credible deterrence, and the conviction that stability is best secured by those prepared to defend it.
