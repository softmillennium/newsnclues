                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Casper Ruud recovered quickly from a shaky start on Wednesday, producing a polished serving display to secure victory on his return to the BNP Paribas Nordic Open in Stockholm. After falling behind 1-4 in the opening set, Ruud found his rhythm with commanding serves and trademark movement to improve his season record in opening rounds to 14-3. “It was a good match, I'm very happy,” said Ruud, who improved to 4-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Cilic. “Marin is a great player, very aggressive. He got a better start than me, so I just tried to get my form and rhythm back into the match. Despite his early deficit, Ruud soon took control from the baseline, combining precise groundstrokes with dominant serving to turn the match around. Ruud's one-hour, 50-minute triumph provided a boost to his bid to reach the Nitto ATP Finals for the fourth time. In the quarter-finals, he will face Sebastian Korda. The 2019 Stockholm champion, Denis Shapovalov, averted a scare against wild card Leo Borg in front of a vibrant atmosphere inside the Royal Tennis Hall. 1 Club member Bjorn Borg, was aiming to record his third ATP Tour win, but he was unable to draw on the crowd support and contain Shapovalov in the decider. The third-seeded Canadian is into his fourth Stockholm quarter-final in five appearances at the ATP 250 and awaits Jacob Fearnley or Swedish wild card Elias Ymer. Korda earlier overcame Kamil Majchrzak 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 in a thrilling two-hour, 33-minute contest. In first-round action on Wednesday,  Lorenzo Sonego kickstarted his quest for a second indoor title by defeating British qualifier Arthur Fery 6-4, 6-2. Sonego set a second-round meeting with Aleksandar Kovecevic, who led eighth seed Camilo Ugo Carabelli 4-6, 7-5, 4-0 when the Argentine was forced to retire through injury. Marton Fucsovics eased past Jesper de Jong 6-1, 6-2 to book a clash with top seed and 2022 Stockholm champion Holger Rune.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Naomi Osaka battled past defending champion Suzan Lamens in three sets to reach the Kinoshita Group Japan Open quarterfinals, but suffered an injury scare in the match's closing stages. 1 seed Naomi Osaka came out on top of a 7-6(6), 3-6, 6-2 battle with defending champion Suzan Lamens to reach the Kinoshita Group Japan Open quarterfinals, but suffered an injury scare in the closing stages of the match that left her limping off court. A high-quality contest had seen Osaka respond well to Lamens' challenge, raising her level to pull away from the surging Dutchwoman in the third set. Lamens sprayed a backhand wide on that point, but won the next, and at 40-30 to Lamens, Osaka requested a medical time-out. Returning to the court with her left thigh strapped and with her movement significantly hampered, a visibly distressed Osaka attempted to close the match out with first-strike tennis that bypassed extended rallies. However, she was able to get over the line on return, summoning up a backhand winner to convert her third match point. "It was definitely really difficult -- I'm kind of sorry about my attitude," Osaka said in an on-court interview that had to be cut short due to her leg pain. It's not good, but I think I'm a fast healer so it should be OK for my next match." Both players took their time to fully settle -- Lamens lost the first eight points of the match, including consecutive double faults to open her first service game; Osaka then conceded nine straight points to go down a break. Lamens threw in an error-strewn game when attempting to serve the set out at 5-4, and at 5-5 in the ensuing tiebreak Osaka played her best point of the set to inch ahead. "Emotionally, I was going through a lot in this match," Osaka said. "And then in the third set I tried my best to have no regrets." Osaka is scheduled to face Jaqueline Cristian in the quarterfinals on Friday. The Romanian rebounded from a first-set whitewash to defeat No. 8 seed Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 0-6, 6-4, 6-2, avenging a first-round loss to the Spaniard in Beijing three weeks ago. Naomi Osaka battled past defending champion Suzan Lamens in three sets to reach the Kinoshita Group Japan Open quarterfinals, but suffered an injury scare in the match's closing stages.</p>

Like, during pregnancy and after pregnancy I lost my edges and stuff.“They're back now,” she adds proudly. But I think it's back now.”According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, postpartum hair loss—known as telogen effluvium—is common after childbirth:“Postpartum hair thinning or hair loss… occurs when hormone levels drop back to their regular levels after childbirth… Postpartum hair loss usually ends about 6–12 months after giving birth. Most women see their hair returning to its normal thickness as their hormone levels stabilize.”Read More: Naomi Osaka opens up about body image struggles, pressure to “snap back” after giving birthOsaka welcomed her daughter Shai on July 7, 2023, after stepping away from tennis in late 2022.
