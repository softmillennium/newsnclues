But it would not take much to refute this idea. If we were to find a star that is definitively older than this, it would show that the universe was around before 13.8 billion years ago. It is known to be a high-velocity, sub-giant star, and one of the closest metal-poor stars to our Solar System. In the early 2000s, astronomers attempted to age it, and came up with an even more surprising result. According to their observations and analysis using stellar evolution models, the Methuselah star's age was possibly around 16 billion years old. The age of stars is pretty difficult to pin down, relying on measurements of their absolute brightness as well as their chemical abundances, and this was far from the final word on the topic. "Maybe the cosmology is wrong, stellar physics is wrong, or the star's distance is wrong," Howard Bond of Pennsylvania State University in University Park and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore said in a 2013 statement, after new measurements by the Hubble Space Telescope. "So we set out to refine the distance." That team refined distance measurements to the star, an important step in figuring out a star's intrinsic brightness, which is fundamental in determining its age. Think of it like not knowing if you are seeing a torch held by an approaching stranger, or a very distant lighthouse. Placing the star's distance at a refined 190.1 light-years, and finding that it had a higher-than-predicted oxygen to iron ratio, the team aged the star to be a much less universe model-breaking star. There are other candidates, such as J22132050-5137385, which is thought to be around 13.6 billion years old, give or take 2.6 billion years. Receive weekly science coverage direct to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” star Lisa Barlow gets a psychic reading done at Whitney Rose‘s “Telepathic Tasting” event in episode 5. When her marriage to John Barlow is mentioned, Lisa finally opens up about the cracks in their relationship. Flashbacks during episode 5 shed light on some of the issues Lisa and John are going through in their relationship. They were discussing their son Jack Barlow‘s living arrangements when he returned from his mission trip. “Jack and I were talking about two or three weeks ago. I actually was in favor of him getting an apartment,” John said. I don't think he should be allowed to move out,” Lisa responded. This scene showed how the couple was on two completely different wavelengths when it came to their children. Another flashback from a year ago showed Lisa telling John that he needs to “take it a little more seriously. Earlier in Season 6, Bronwyn Newport told Whitney that she saw legal documents related to a lawsuit Lisa was facing where she had secretly borrowed money from the “mystery man” that Angie Katsanevas had referenced in the past. It remains unclear if this accusation caused any strain in their marriage, and Lisa has already denied all of these legal claims against her. Whitney invited an “intuitive consultant” named Terence to give the group one-on-one psychic readings during their wine tasing lunch. When Lisa first sat down with Terence, the first thing he asked was, “why do you feel like you're just rebuilding trust?” “I don't know,” she said, her voice breaking. “It's like an elastic band, you guys keep snapping back together,” said Terence. I also look at this, and go, cause it feels like you have different paths. The intuitive consultant concluded their session by stating, “until you get back to that same team, you're gonna feel, like, lost.” At the end of her confessional, Lisa admitted, “I just feel, like, alone sometimes, you know?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bleeding Cool mentioned that this might be coming… previously, I wrote, "DC's K.O. The big knockdown fight event, to take on Darkseid. The fight is coming, it is coming to Earth, and there can be no harm done to the bystanders. Darkseid plans to build a new Apokolips on Earth." Indeed, today's Justice League Red #3 by Saladin Ahmed and Clayton Henry sees Red Tornado prophesying such a future, and underlining the need to save Red Arrow, to stop it. But while all that is going on, the Titans are dealing with the here and now. battle is to find a champion imbued with Omega Energy to inherit the power of the Omega King rather than Darkseid. As I previously wrote, "it's down to the Titans, minus those in the competition, to evacuate a planet of eight billion people. Ships, teleportation, city shrinking, whatever comes to hand. Oh, and they only have a week." And in today's  Titans #28 by John Layman and Pete Woods are both published by DC Comics today, it comes to pass. Rocketing populations into space in buildings that double as spaceships… and shrinking people to fit. Of course, as we saw in DC's K.O. While on Earth, not everyone wants to go. As I previously wrote, …there are some who don't want to be evacuated. Who don't believe the superheroes. …"And who have got placards to protest, presumably left over from COVID, or Absolute Power, dubbed "evacuation truthers". Amanda Waller taught humanity to mistrust the superheroes, and plenty, it seems, still think she was right…" As we have seen from Moray Island in today's Wonder Woman #26 by Tom King and Daniel Sampere, they are not alone there either…</p>

Los Angeles Dodgers star Teoscar Hernandez revealed that he and his wife will be switching their living quarters while in Milwaukee to face the Brewers in the National League Championship Series. It isn't because their hotel isn't good enough, but rather, Hernandez's wife, Jennifer, is not fond of the rumors of paranormal activity connected to it. However, Hernandez said before Game 2 on Wednesday night that he and his wife are moving due to rumors that the Pfister Hotel is haunted. Teoscar Hernández of the Los Angeles Dodgers rounds the bases after hitting a home run against the Brewers in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series at American Family Field on Oct. 14, 2025, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Hernandez said his wife heard some stories about alleged issues while staying at the Pfister from other Dodgers' significant others. "I don't believe in ghosts," he said, via The New York Post. "But my wife is on this trip, and she said she doesn't want to stay there. So we have to find another hotel. But I've been hearing from other players and other wives that it's something happening in these couple of nights." As for what Hernandez has heard from teammates, he said "some of the rooms, the lights goes off and on. And the doors, there are noises, footsteps, things like that, I don't know." William Contreras of the Brewers forces out at Teoscar Hernández of the Los Angeles Dodgers at home plate during the National League Championship Series at American Family Field on Oct. 13, 2025, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. No matter the stories, Hernandez is focused on helping his team repeat as World Series champions, and he helped the cause early in Wednesday's game. The Dodgers were able to stave off the Brewers' ninth-inning rally in Game 1 on Monday night, as Blake Treinen got Brice Turange to strike out to end the game with bases loaded for Milwaukee. If the Dodgers are unable to come away with a two-game lead in the best-of-seven series, there is a chance Hernandez and his wife won't have to return to Milwaukee. Teoscar Hernández of the Los Angeles Dodgers reacts after hitting a home run against the Brewers on Oct. 14, 2025, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A senior U.S. Navy officer has claimed his crew witnessed a massive unidentified underwater object racing through the ocean at around 200mph. The startling testimony adds to growing reports of unidentified submerged objects, or USOs, being investigated by the Pentagon and Congress. Congressman Tim Burchett revealed the account as part of a congressional probe into unexplained aerial and underwater phenomena. “A very high-ranking member of the Navy described some underwater experiences with something that was doing 200mph underwater,” he said. Burchett told U.S. television that no man-made craft could reach such underwater speeds. His remarks suggest that whatever was seen moved nearly six times faster than the most advanced military submarines or torpedoes. Officials are now examining reports of Unidentified Submerged Objects (USOs) alongside flying UFOs, suggesting that unexplained technology might be operating both in the sky and under the sea. Burchett dismissed the idea that these objects might belong to any known defence program. Why would we put something in the air around our best pilots that could have a crash?” he asked. The claims echo those of Bob McGwire, a professor and intelligence officer who once worked aboard the USS Hampton. He said he experienced a similar encounter while on duty, hearing “something whizzing by” the submarine at speeds faster than sound. He stressed that it wasn't part of any U.S. experiment or secret project. “It is mine to tell whoever I want. He only came forward when the Pentagon began its probe into hundreds of UFO and USO reports. He recalled how “a person with knowledge of onboard systems” confirmed something had sped past their submarine “faster than the speed of sound.” “Wow, it splashed,” a crew member can be heard shouting in the footage. Both McGwire and Burchett argue that these sightings prove humans may not be alone, or that unknown technology is operating in Earth's most remote environments.

NASA astronaut Don Pettit tests the Mould Effect in space. NASA astronaut Don Pettit has helped YouTuber Steve Mould with the final step in his "weird chain theory": testing the idea in space. The effect, sometimes referred to as the "Mould effect" for his work on it, is strange to see. Simply put, place a long chain in a container, pull one end out, and let it fall to the floor. Since the effect was popularized by Mould, he, Mehdi Sadaghdar of YouTube channel ElectroBOOM, and several academic studies have attempted to explain it. Finally, there is a reaction force to this kick that pushes the beads upwards." "How strong does that force need to be, though? Well, it needs to be able to overcome the weight of this arc of chain that would obviously fall under gravity. This is where NASA astronaut Don Pettit came in. Pettit, who had been intrigued by Mould's videos, offered to test the behavior of chains on the International Space Station (ISS). If gravity wasn't a factor, the ark would be fixed there in space even though it was being yanked downwards at one end. Or at least that's the theory," Mould explained. We want to test the theory that a chain moving at constant speed will flow through its own shape so long as it isn't acted on by an external force like gravity." In a phone call with Mould, Pettit attempted to tug on the chain and test whether the chain truly did flow through its own shape, supporting Mould's idea, or whether it did something else. Unfortunately, it's pretty difficult to get a chain to remain stationary in microgravity, with Pettit describing them as moving around like molecules. If he was correct, the chain should flow through that rectangle shape, rather than spread out into a circle as you might expect. However, before the informal experiment ended, they did appear to set chains in motion that followed their own shape, seemingly adding evidence to Mould's explanation for the effect. "It was a great demonstration seeing it pass through the same path through the loop and your explanation about why it would eventually turn into a full circle due to friction was pretty adequate," Sadaghdar said, adding that he wouldn't have to embarrass himself by making another debunk video. Another simulation might be nice, but what would be better is to take 100m of chain into space and drag it behind you in a spacewalk. Receive weekly science coverage direct to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three years ago, The Black Phone (reviewed here) made a real impression by being the rare horror film to feel both grounded and fantastical. At the same time, a sequel didn't even seem possible, besides feeling unnecessary. Instead of rehashing what's come before, the now series opts to change things up in a major way, giving it a freshness that fuels things from start to finish. It has a slower pace and a more serious feeling, especially in the first act, and really the first half, but once we get to The Grabber being a new Freddy Krueger, we're really cooking with gas. The horror wheel isn't being re-invented, to be sure, but it is showing how a property can extend its life by being creative and not playing it safe. Finn ultimately killed his captor and escaped, though now as a seventeen year old, he's still dealing with the trauma. His younger sister Gwen (Madeleine McGraw) is now fifteen and beginning to receive calls from the black phone in her dreams. While Finn numbs himself with weed nightly, Gwen is seeing disturbing visions of three boys being stalked and murdered at Alpine Lake, a nearby winter camp. Arriving at Alpine Lake with Ernesto (Miguel Mora), they're welcomed by Armando (Demián Bichir), though not everyone there is so kind. Plus, it's at the camp that Gwen begins to be tormented in her dreams by The Grabber, who is dead but very much still a threat. As she learns about how the killer and her family have history, he begins attacking her when she falls asleep. Along with Finn, she'll need to confront The Grabber, even as he's gotten more powerful in death, especially once they realize what he's done to them. She's strong and determined, though also gets put through the ringer like a true scream queen. Mason Thames showcases the trauma that The Black Phone subjected him to in a way that few horror sequels opt to do, with compelling results. He's again having a blast being a villain, this time embracing the demonic side of being dead but still very much an omnipresent threat. If he's going to keep playing The Grabber every so often, sign me up. Co-writer/director Scott Derrickson, along with his writing partner C. Robert Cargill, is clearly influenced by the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, taking his series in this supernatural direction. Things start off pretty slowly, but once the rhythm sets in, it picks up in a big way, especially when The Grabber turns Freddy-esque. Derrickson and Cargill are interested in some heavy themes and don't shy away from darkness, though occasionally their script is on the nose and has characters saying things you only hear in the midst of a horror movie. At the same time, Derrickson's direction is a highlight, especially with how the dream sequences are shot on Super 8, giving them a unique quality. That sort of creativity rarely arises in horror sequels. Black Phone 2 is hardly groundbreaking, but by mixing things up, the series manages to stay fresh. I'd happily see a third one if Derrickson, Hawke, and company want to keep giving us more of The Grabber. He's not quite as iconic as Freddy, admittedly, but he's in that ballpark, which is something worth exploring more. Regardless, this sequel sets itself apart by being bold enough to do things differently than most.
