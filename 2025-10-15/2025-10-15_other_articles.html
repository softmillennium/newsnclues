                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Something shifted for Mamoru Hosoda after he made Belle. That simple, small-scale Hosoda you loved for Mirai is gone. To me, Hosoda is like the Guillermo del Toro of Japanese animators, as his ambitions exceed his grasp, but damn it, he cultivates a striking animated spectacle nonetheless. Princess Scarlet (Mana Ashida) watches her uncle Claudius (Kôji Yakusho) carry out a coup and murder her father, the king, in medieval Denmark. She is banished and spends a large portion of her childhood in secret sword-fighting training. She finds herself in the "Otherworld," a paranormal purgatory where individuals from all backgrounds and eras — past and present — live side by side. After discovering that Claudius is also there, Scarlet and Hijiri set out to find him on a perilous journey through the different badlands knowing that if they are killed in the Otherworld, they will vanish into thin air. For better or worse, if you know Hosada's game, a lot of Scarlet will seem like the director revisiting his greatest hits. If you aren't, might I suggest taking a look at Belle and Mirai? Perhaps make it a double feature since Scarlet combines elements of both films: character-driven narrative and 3D-2D hybrid animation techniques. It might be overwhelming to take in at once if this is your first Hosoda. The beautiful animation quality from Studio Chizu is an improvement over their previous work, Belle included. Scarlet's initial set-up is just "girl Hamlet" drawn in 2D with gothic colors. Yet, once the titular rage-fueled princess enters the Otherworld, she gets hit with that colorful cel-shaded 3D beam, and so do her surroundings — once again taking cues from Belle. In this 3D landscape, Hosoda adeptly executes an epic scope for his protagonist and the action on her quest. The action sequences are intense and violent, making great use of the backdrop in 3D composition and movement, illustrating an insane level of combat as Scarlet's bright blue eyes see red — as bright as her hair — when she encounters Claudius' goons in the Otherworld. In terms of aesthetics, Scarlet is more visually and narratively accessible than Belle. Besides that, there is a storm dragon with swords in its face that horrifically kills homicidal sinners with a single thunderstrike. Scarlet is most successful when its subversive anti-war character arc is shaped by Scarlet's healing process, influenced by her developing relationship with Hijiri. His pacifism challenges Scarlet's worldview, offering reflection on her purpose outside seeking retribution. I love how during the action sequences, Scarlet, heeding Hijiri suggestions to not kill her foes, goes full Daredevil, kicking ass with brutality but still showing mercy. That said, the movie spends most of its time on our two heroes reflecting on the lives they used to live. The lines between our reality and Hamlet do blur, particularly with regards to Claudius, the selfish dictator of an impoverished land, full of false promises of an “infinite land” that he had not been to himself, weaponizing his followers' desperation for his gain. And then there's the sloppily executed yet well-intentioned no-borders theme. Hosoda likes to show the Otherworld's melting pot in slow, rambling beats, like when Hijiri learns to hula dance with a Hawaiian woman. Yet the meandering lets some themes, primarily its no-borders/false-kings narrative feel underdeveloped. As the two reach Claudius' Castlevania-like castle, the tone intensifies in a snap, leaping into war-filled chaos, missing a bridging scene or two to add cohesiveness. I couldn't help but get excited when Rosencrantz and Guildenstern joined the battle to see how they would contribute to Hosoda's passionate vision. Even if it falters in its other themes when it gets too big for its britches, Hosoda compensates with unwavering sincerity throughout. At a certain point, it explained why it was programmed at NYFF, as they usually don't program animated features to the festival. Even though I miss Hosoda's simple work, Scarlet is another stunning effort a visionary whose stories are frustratingly overambitious but still captivating. They have been seen in Entertainment Weekly, Vanity Fair, Them, Roger Ebert and Paste.</p>

Her scientific interests include genomics, personalized medicine, and bioethics. Through a lot of work over the last century, we now believe the universe to be around 13.8 billion years old. But it would not take much to refute this idea. If we were to find a star that is definitively older than this, it would show that the universe was around before 13.8 billion years ago. It is known to be a high-velocity, sub-giant star, and one of the closest metal-poor stars to our Solar System. In the early 2000s, astronomers attempted to age it, and came up with an even more surprising result. According to their observations and analysis using stellar evolution models, the Methuselah star's age was possibly around 16 billion years old. The age of stars is pretty difficult to pin down, relying on measurements of their absolute brightness as well as their chemical abundances, and this was far from the final word on the topic. "Maybe the cosmology is wrong, stellar physics is wrong, or the star's distance is wrong," Howard Bond of Pennsylvania State University in University Park and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore said in a 2013 statement, after new measurements by the Hubble Space Telescope. "So we set out to refine the distance." That team refined distance measurements to the star, an important step in figuring out a star's intrinsic brightness, which is fundamental in determining its age. Think of it like not knowing if you are seeing a torch held by an approaching stranger, or a very distant lighthouse. Placing the star's distance at a refined 190.1 light-years, and finding that it had a higher-than-predicted oxygen to iron ratio, the team aged the star to be a much less universe model-breaking star. There are other candidates, such as J22132050-5137385, which is thought to be around 13.6 billion years old, give or take 2.6 billion years. Receive weekly science coverage direct to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bleeding Cool mentioned that this might be coming… previously, I wrote, "DC's K.O. The big knockdown fight event, to take on Darkseid. The fight is coming, it is coming to Earth, and there can be no harm done to the bystanders. Darkseid plans to build a new Apokolips on Earth." Indeed, today's Justice League Red #3 by Saladin Ahmed and Clayton Henry sees Red Tornado prophesying such a future, and underlining the need to save Red Arrow, to stop it. But while all that is going on, the Titans are dealing with the here and now. battle is to find a champion imbued with Omega Energy to inherit the power of the Omega King rather than Darkseid. As I previously wrote, "it's down to the Titans, minus those in the competition, to evacuate a planet of eight billion people. Ships, teleportation, city shrinking, whatever comes to hand. Oh, and they only have a week." And in today's  Titans #28 by John Layman and Pete Woods are both published by DC Comics today, it comes to pass. Rocketing populations into space in buildings that double as spaceships… and shrinking people to fit. Of course, as we saw in DC's K.O. While on Earth, not everyone wants to go. As I previously wrote, …there are some who don't want to be evacuated. Who don't believe the superheroes. …"And who have got placards to protest, presumably left over from COVID, or Absolute Power, dubbed "evacuation truthers". Amanda Waller taught humanity to mistrust the superheroes, and plenty, it seems, still think she was right…" As we have seen from Moray Island in today's Wonder Woman #26 by Tom King and Daniel Sampere, they are not alone there either…</p>

Los Angeles Dodgers star Teoscar Hernandez revealed that he and his wife will be switching their living quarters while in Milwaukee to face the Brewers in the National League Championship Series. It isn't because their hotel isn't good enough, but rather, Hernandez's wife, Jennifer, is not fond of the rumors of paranormal activity connected to it. However, Hernandez said before Game 2 on Wednesday night that he and his wife are moving due to rumors that the Pfister Hotel is haunted. Teoscar Hernández of the Los Angeles Dodgers rounds the bases after hitting a home run against the Brewers in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series at American Family Field on Oct. 14, 2025, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Hernandez said his wife heard some stories about alleged issues while staying at the Pfister from other Dodgers' significant others. "I don't believe in ghosts," he said, via The New York Post. "But my wife is on this trip, and she said she doesn't want to stay there. So we have to find another hotel. But I've been hearing from other players and other wives that it's something happening in these couple of nights." As for what Hernandez has heard from teammates, he said "some of the rooms, the lights goes off and on. And the doors, there are noises, footsteps, things like that, I don't know." William Contreras of the Brewers forces out at Teoscar Hernández of the Los Angeles Dodgers at home plate during the National League Championship Series at American Family Field on Oct. 13, 2025, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. No matter the stories, Hernandez is focused on helping his team repeat as World Series champions, and he helped the cause early in Wednesday's game. The Dodgers were able to stave off the Brewers' ninth-inning rally in Game 1 on Monday night, as Blake Treinen got Brice Turang to strike out to end the game with bases loaded for Milwaukee. If the Dodgers are unable to come away with a two-game lead in the best-of-seven series, there is a chance Hernandez and his wife won't have to return to Milwaukee. Teoscar Hernández of the Los Angeles Dodgers reacts after hitting a home run against the Brewers on Oct. 14, 2025, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

NASA astronaut Don Pettit tests the Mould Effect in space. NASA astronaut Don Pettit has helped YouTuber Steve Mould with the final step in his "weird chain theory": testing the idea in space. The effect, sometimes referred to as the "Mould effect" for his work on it, is strange to see. Simply put, place a long chain in a container, pull one end out, and let it fall to the floor. Since the effect was popularized by Mould, he, Mehdi Sadaghdar of YouTube channel ElectroBOOM, and several academic studies have attempted to explain it. Finally, there is a reaction force to this kick that pushes the beads upwards." "How strong does that force need to be, though? Well, it needs to be able to overcome the weight of this arc of chain that would obviously fall under gravity. This is where NASA astronaut Don Pettit came in. Pettit, who had been intrigued by Mould's videos, offered to test the behavior of chains on the International Space Station (ISS). If gravity wasn't a factor, the ark would be fixed there in space even though it was being yanked downwards at one end. Or at least that's the theory," Mould explained. We want to test the theory that a chain moving at constant speed will flow through its own shape so long as it isn't acted on by an external force like gravity." In a phone call with Mould, Pettit attempted to tug on the chain and test whether the chain truly did flow through its own shape, supporting Mould's idea, or whether it did something else. Unfortunately, it's pretty difficult to get a chain to remain stationary in microgravity, with Pettit describing them as moving around like molecules. If he was correct, the chain should flow through that rectangle shape, rather than spread out into a circle as you might expect. However, before the informal experiment ended, they did appear to set chains in motion that followed their own shape, seemingly adding evidence to Mould's explanation for the effect. "It was a great demonstration seeing it pass through the same path through the loop and your explanation about why it would eventually turn into a full circle due to friction was pretty adequate," Sadaghdar said, adding that he wouldn't have to embarrass himself by making another debunk video. Another simulation might be nice, but what would be better is to take 100m of chain into space and drag it behind you in a spacewalk. Receive weekly science coverage direct to your inbox</p>
