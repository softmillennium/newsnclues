                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The lasting effects of Stephen King's horror novel It can be felt almost 40 years after the book was published, thanks to its traumatizing villain. And now Pennywise's origin story makes its way to the small screen in HBO's Welcome To Derry, which premieres October 26. Series co-creator Andy Muschietti, who helmed 2017's It and Chapter Two, tells The A.V. Club spoke to Muschietti about establishing Welcome To Derry‘s “intense” tone and aesthetic, bringing in a major King character, crafting a new narrative that ties into the Native American community, and how much we'll get to see of Skarsgård in that darn clown costume. Club: What was it about the interludes in Stephen King's books that felt like compelling entry points for an It spin-off? Andy Muschietti: So there are two things here. And part of that equation was the conversations I had with Bill Skarsgård while filming It Chapter Two. Both of us were excited about the prospect. We thought it would be a movie at first. But then life happened, and we went into different projects. It was my curiosity that made me dig into the other parts of Stephen King's book, particularly the research and investigation done by Losers Club member Mike Hanlon that form the interludes that are shrouded in mystery. Mike just gets bits and pieces of information, and he tries to build this puzzle, but never gets to put all the pieces together. In a way, I desired to put those pieces together and create an expanded story about everything that happened in Derry before the events of the movies, and hopefully create a compelling, emotional story. So that was exciting to us right away because even if it's not the same characters, we're going into a similar cultural era covered in the book. There's also another range of fears from this era I wanted to tap into from the kids' perspective, which is things like radioactive mutations. Using both those angles to help with the creation of this world, aesthetically speaking, was appealing. I treated this season as if it were a movie, in the sense that we got Chapter Two‘s production designer [Paul D. Austerberry] and costume designer [Luis Sequeira] because I wanted to preserve that cinematic feel. AVC: Does the show match the film's tone in terms of creepiness, or did you get to change things since you have eight hourlong episodes? The mandate for me was always being faithful to all that, but I will say the show does get more intense. We had the opportunity to make it creepier because it's a bigger canvas with more characters and more of their fears to explore. AVC: You directed the opening scene of the premiere, which is quite gnarly and further helps establish that creepy tone. AM: Yeah, I wanted to establish a sense of how no one is really safe in this world, which is a little bit of the same idea that we expressed in the first movie's opening with Georgie's death, which is pretty gruesome, and also with Adrian Mellon's death at the beginning of Chapter Two. In general, as an opening for the show, I wanted to create an augmented feeling that nothing is sacred or safe in Derry. The challenge was how to do it and make it more spectacular, especially for people who have seen the movies and understand how effective a graphic incident like the show's opening scene is. It all comes from what I mentioned before about my desire to make a creature that stems from what a kid's fear in the early '60s was, which is a mutant of some sort. AVC: Did you always sign up to direct four installments, or did that choice come about naturally while working on the scripts? I also wanted time to make other movies. And then I said, “Well, of course I'll do the finale, too.” But the lead-up to our finale is so great that I didn't want to not be part of the penultimate episode. How does that aspect factor into Welcome To Derry? AM: Yeah, that's the fog in Derry, when adults don't seem to see or pay attention to what's going on. Our monster is a creature made of belief and will obviously target and use that as bait, which is more effective on younger people. This fog is based on what Stephen King perceives as a sort of real-life behavior and a larger reflection about childhood versus adulthood. We absolutely use it in our show as a love letter to memory and the child inside who keeps the imagination alive. Adults don't pay attention to everything in the world of children; that's impossible to do when you're occupied with life stuff. When we don't listen to kids to the full extent that we should, things can get forgotten or overlooked, or brushed under the carpet. AM: The intervention of Native characters in the book is very important, and we wanted to grab it and extend it. I was always very attentive to that in the book. But it's a big question mark in the book about how this happened. So we basically go into that in the show and open the drawer to create a story that might be unfamiliar to readers as well. It's a new narrative that connects to the Indigenous community. AVC: One of the main characters is Dick Hallorann, played by Chris Chalk, who fans of The Shining will be familiar with. What was the idea behind bringing him into Welcome To Derry in such a big way? AM: Dick has a very predominant role in this story. In the book, he's part of the Black Spot tragedy when it burned down, but that story is told in fragmented pieces. We realized he plays a much larger role. I hadn't known him before in person before casting him, and when I saw his tape, it blew my mind. His character goes on a weird journey as someone who has “the shine” and is in conflict with that throughout. AM: I cannot say when and how Pennywise appears because it would be a spoiler. There was an attempt to keep Bill not in the proximity of the new young actors to preserve that aura that he has when he's in costume and in character, at least just to preserve the first scene when they all see each other. But then, after that, everyone quickly became friends with Bill.

Karl Marx himself may have written that “history repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.” Still, not even the most dedicated members of Japan's Red Army Faction — a militant, “Communist Manifesto”-carrying group most famous for hijacking a JAL flight in the spring of 1970 — could have imagined their signature action would eventually be restaged as a slick and sprawling Netflix comedy combining the smirking political satire of “Burn After Reading” with the cold-blooded visual dynamism of a Park Chan-wook film. Sure, the Yodogo Hijacking Incident wasn't quite a tragedy, and “Good News” is just a bit too grounded to feel like a true farce, but the disconnect between the severity of what happened and the blitheness with which Korean director Byun Sung-hyun (“The Merciless”) has re-imagined it is striking enough to affirm Marx's point. I have to imagine that the hijackers would've been happy about that; bumbling and inept as they appear in Byun's movie, their conviction smacks of courage when compared to the spinelessness of the bureaucrats tasked with solving the crisis, all of whom care more about their own egos and careers than they do the 130 passengers whose lives are at stake. Related Stories IndieWire's Future of Filmmaking to Partner with SCAD on Behind Their Lens Panels at Savannah Film Festival ‘Blue Film' Review: A Disturbing Look at Pedophilia and Gay Shame Is Independent Cinema at Its Most Provocative Just droll, twisty, and stylish enough to forgive this 136-minute film for using a lot more runway than it needs to be airborne, “Good News” is a veritable caricature of middle-management — an epic parody of passing the buck. That so few of the actual facts have been changed, despite an impishly self-conflicting disclaimer that insists it was “inspired by real events” but also that “all of the characters and events portrayed are fictional,” only serves to strengthen Byun's damning portrayal of political cowardice. For all of the lip service that Byun and Lee Jin-seong's knotted script pays to the relative nature of truth, however, “Good News” initially makes it easy to separate fact from fiction. Did heavily armed hijackers commandeer a Boeing 727 as part of their plan to further a worldwide revolution against the United States and its allies? Indeed, and an opening flurry of newsreel footage helps to confirm that we aren't completely outside of history. Was their leader as handsome as “Tokyo Vice” star Show Kasamatsu, or their youngest member barely old enough to fly without parental supervision? Ditto those who manage to avoid taking the blame. But the movie only really takes flight after the line between “tragedy” and “farce” begins to blur, like when a proactive air force “double parks” a jet in front of the 727 as it stops to refuel. Funny as it is, that sequence pales in comparison to what happens later, when a young Korean Air Force lieutenant named Seo (Hong Kyung) has the bright idea of executing a double hijack. The Red Army Faction believes they're flying into Pyongyang, but Seo — in a standoff that's shot like a Sergio Leone spaghetti western, complete with ultra-wide framing, skintight leather chaps, and a few errant tumbleweeds for good measure — wrests control of the radio frequency from his North Korean counterparts and fools the hijackers into landing in Seoul's Gimpo International Airport instead. Remarkably, this part of the story is rooted in truth. Like everyone else in this movie, however, the director wants to frame this story on his own terms (“If I can't capture this historical moment on film, I at least want to participate in it!”), and his eagerness to control the action risks creating new conflict. Not only does this display of egomaniacal buffoonery make for “Good News”' most effective setpiece, the sheer absurdity of the situation embellished by Byun's arch framing and previously unknown flair for dry comedy, it also epitomizes the core ethos of a film in which shaping the narrative is always more important than saving the hostages. “Good News” has no compunctions about depicting its characters — even and especially the South Korean ones — as narcissistic dolts. That functional mismatch saps away at the comedy of a film clearly made to be enjoyed by a global audience. Pointed gestures toward the lingering tension between Japan and Korea — and between those two countries and the rest of the planet — are drowned out by tiresome bickering and exaggerated gags, like a meaningful conversation swallowed into the sound of an airplane engine screaming overhead. Byun's visual playfulness is likewise compelling enough to compensate for the shortcuts in his storytelling — active camerawork and inventive CGI combine with Jo Hyoung-rae's heightened cinematography to imbue the film's airplane cabins and flight control towers with a vivid sense of theatricality. Yet the director is so eager to make a spectacle out of this scenario that “Good News” begins to feel as self-insistent as its characters. Perhaps that's by design, and Byun is bending his own form towards a damning commentary on universal self-interest — even in the face of a crisis. In a rich but increasingly disappointing film where everyone is trying so hard to pass the buck, it's only fitting that viewers end up holding the bag. “Good News” will be available to stream on Netflix starting Friday, October 17.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix‘s upcoming new series Extraction is rounding out the cast with Sacha Dhawan (The Great), Ross McCall (Silo), Pip Torrens (The Crown), Sam Woolf (We Were the Lucky Ones), Michael Zananiri (Once Upon a Time in Gaza), Riyad Sliman (Ramy), Muhannad Ben Amor (Andor), Aaron Heffernan (Brassic), Jojo Macari (Those About to Die), Theo Ogundipe (Mickey 17) and Emma Appleton (Everything I Know About Love). They join the previously announced lead Omar Sy, as well as Boyd Holbrook, Natalie Dormer, Waleed Zuaiter, and Ed Speleers. From showrunner, writer, and EP Glen Mazzara, and produced by AGBO, Extraction is set in the world of the action thriller movie franchise starring Chris Hemsworth. 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming 'Monster: The Ed Gein Story' Tops Netflix's Weekly TV Ratings Charts But Is Gaining Less Traction Than 'Dahmer' The eight-episode first season follows a mercenary (Sy) who embarks on a dangerous mission to rescue hostages in Libya. Trapped between warring factions and ruthless killers, he must navigate life-or-death choices while confronting deep emotional wounds. Hemsworth stars as an Australian black ops mercenary who takes on a mission to save an Indian drug lord's kidnapped son in Dhaka, Bangladesh, but the mission goes awry when he is double-crossed. A sequel, Extraction 2, was released in 2023, with the main cast reprising their roles. The movie brings back Hemsworth's Rake, who is tasked with a new mission — rescuing the battered family of a ruthless Georgian gangster from the prison where they are being held. In addition to the Russo Brothers and Mazzara, executive producers include Angela Russo-Otstot, Scott Nemes, and Chris Castaldi for AGBO, Sam Hargrave, Eric Gitter, and Peter Schwerin, Netflix & AGBO: A Proven Partnership.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aniyah Saint-Surin was about to live her dream. A lifelong Billie Eilish fan, Saint-Surin was finally able to see the Hit Me Hard and Soft singer for the first time in concert when Eilish began her tour at Kaseya Center in Miami on Oct. 9. The tickets had come together at the last minute, and with the help of her aunt, Saint-Surin had thrown together a serviceable outfit, complete with a red bandana that had been gathering dust in the corner of her room. The clothes didn't matter — she was there to see her Billie. Saint-Surin has seen countless Eilish concerts through her phone screen, so she knew what was going to happen next. After hearing Eilish sing “Guess,” her hit collab with Charli XCX, Saint-Surin could see Eilish getting ready to run past the crowded barricade. This was what she had been waiting for, when Eilish would hop down from her stage and speed past a hoard of waiting fans, arms all outstretched for a second of contact. Eilish had just touched Saint-Surin's fingertips when everything went haywire. “Instantly, something clicked,” Saint-Surin tells Rolling Stone. Before she even realized what she was doing, she was pushing the fan away, leaving her coveted spot at the barricade — and her chance to interact with Eilish again — to loudly berate the man for grabbing Eilish so roughly. A few minutes later, she was back in her spot, shaken up but convinced no one had noticed her actions. Saint-Surin has been listening to Billie Eilish for as long as she can remember — at least six years — which for an 18-year-old, is a substantial chunk of her life. in 2019, Saint-Surin has been a self-proclaimed stan, following the Los-Angeles based singer as she went from an industry newcomer to a Grammy and Academy Award-winning powerhouse. She watched Eilish's concerts via TikToks, streamed interviews on YouTube, and of course played her music constantly. I need them!” She was still overwhelmed to be at her first ever Eilish concert, so she regaled her family with the story later that night, but went to bed thinking it would be forgotten by the time she woke up. Five days later, she's reached half a million. The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time she deserves infinite free tickets bro 😭 #billieeilish #redbandanagirl #billieeilishconcert #ae #edit What Surin didn't know was that the night of her concert, several clips of her yelling at the fan that grabbed Eilish slowly went viral online, garnering posts from Finneas and Renee Rapp. Ticket reselling company StubHub got her tickets to the next show, making sure she could finally live her dream of touching hand with Eilish. Through her tour manager, Eilish got Saint-Surin's brother a ticket to a show — and even sent Saint-Surin several pieces of merch to thank her for her actions. (The fan who grabbed Eilish has not been identified.) The viral video comes as artists have become more vocal about fan behavior at concerts can put them in danger. In a 2023 interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Eilish herself noted that when fans are excited, trying to grab her or throw things, it can get scary. “People just get excited and it can be dangerous. You're in a vulnerable position, but I've been getting hit with stuff for like years.” Now Saint-Surin is a hero online, dubbed with the moniker “Red Bandana Girl” for the red headscarf that was on her head when she went after the fan who grabbed Eilish. For her first public interview, Saint-Surin spoke to Rolling Stone about her love for Eilish, the deterioration of concert etiquette, and why it might be time for fandoms to have a reckoning in their ranks.

It all depends what mood I'm in. Like, what would I do without it? As someone who loves so many different genres, what draws you in about Billie Eilish as an artist? I've been a Billie stan for six years. It feels like I watched her grow — Well, I did watch her grow — but it's like this connection that she has with us. Call stans crazy, but I swear it's real. What really connected me to Billie's music was the way she puts her stories and experiences and traumas into something so beautiful that helps millions of other girls like me also get through obstacles in their lives. How many Billie concerts have you been to before this viral incident?Thursday was my very first time. I've watched her do this show online. But to really look at that stage and look at everybody excited around me, and I'm talking to people about her, It did not feel real. Yeah, I kept falling to the ground. Okay, so Billie has two stages, a small stage and the main stage, which is a long rectangle. So she sings “Guess” and then “Everything I Wanted” and I realized, “Wait, this is when Billie does the crowd walk.” So I rushed back to my barricade spot, and my girls saved my spot. This is every stan's dream, just to be able to have that second of contact with their favorite artists. But the second our fingers touch, Billie goes down. It didn't look right at all, because her head was down and she was smashed against the barricade. All I thought was, “You just put your hands on this little lady? Get him out of here!” And then next thing I remember, what felt like six police officers were on top of him. I don't even remember the police kind of grabbing me as well, but they were actually really nice and ended up being on my side. After the security guards questioned me, and they were very nice, I went to my spot by the barricade. They were asking if I was OK. Like in all my concert videos after that, you can hear me screaming “I can't even believe this happened! This is insane!” By the end of the concert, everyone was smiling, filling their hands with confetti and because I went by myself, I was just walking around the arena solo trying to find the exit, just yelling “I can't believe that!” to myself. The first thing I did was call my aunt, and tell her this guy just attacked Billie and that I rushed him. I called my mom and she was immediately like, “No more solo concerts. You could have gotten hurt.” I did see one video about it by the end of the night, but I thought it would be gone by morning. I was like, “Oh my goodness, all people are going to see is an angry Black woman. Many Black women before me dealt with showcasing their emotions to disrespect, even if you're trying to defend someone that you care about. So I was really worried that I would be taken out of context and treated like that. But I'm glad that people understood and I'm very thankful for the opportunity to be seen as justified, because a lot of women did not get that same grace. How do you think fandom and obsession plays a part in incidents like this? That connection with stan and artist, your favorite artists — you care so deeply about them. And they care about all of the people that support them, too. And it felt like this man just abused his power. So to forcefully grab her for no reason, just to be aggressive, you're just out of your mind. I don't play about putting hands on people and overstepping boundaries. I couldn't fathom how that all went down so it led to so much anger in me. I've never ran up on nobody before. Yes, you could call me confrontational with my words, but it was just something about that situation. And I see a lot of comments like, “You saved Billie. But I was definitely going to give that man a piece of my mind.

It's reached a certain level of creepy, like now people are crossing boundaries. I think that's something people really need to understand. I like to call them real stans, people who respect those boundaries. It's the people who aren't googling into their business and trying to find out what's going on in their personal life. When headlines come out about Billie — that's none of my business. Something I keep in mind is Billie saying something along the lines of she wishes she could tell us everything, but then it would be all over the internet. If it was only Billie stans and my girl, we'd have so much fun. But I understand that when she disappears for months, I just know my girl is probably vibing because she needed that space. And I tell myself that she'll come back again. Send us a tip using our anonymous form. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After more than 20 years of hosting country music shows on SiriusXM, beloved on-air personality and singer-songwriter Dallas Wayne has signed off — temporarily, he hopes — as he battles a blood cancer called multiple myeloma. Wayne, a mainstay on SiriusXM channels Willie's Roadhouse (61) and Outlaw Country (62) revealed via a social media post on October 14, 2025, that he received the diagnosis “a while back” and has been in treatment, but now needs to undergo an autologous stem cell transplant, which will require him to step away from the mic. “I've been undergoing treatment for some time now,” he wrote, “and while there is no ‘cure' for this type of cancer, it looks like I'm well on my way to remission. Wayne shared his news “in the spirit of transparency,” noting that “in the coming weeks, I'll be taking some time off my radio show” to undergo his upcoming procedure. “Rest assured that I'm surrounded by a team of excellent doctors and medical professionals that are taking great care of me, and I have complete faith in their expertise,” Wayne told his fans. “In the meantime,” he continued, “thank you all for your support and understanding. An autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), according to Mayo Clinic, is an intense process that “uses healthy blood stem cells from your own body to replace bone marrow that's not working properly.” It's typically performed on patients whose bone marrow has been damaged due to high doses of chemotherapy and radiation. A typical ASCT patient spends around six weeks in a hospital or transplant facility, per the International Myeloma Foundation, and the average recovery takes three to six months. Fans flooded Wayne's social media post with love, wishing him well and sharing success stories of loved ones who've undergone similar cancer treatments. Just know that every country music fan enjoy your radio shows is behind you 100%. “Dallas, I will be praying for you,” one wrote on Instagram. I really enjoy your show on Sirius XM and pray you get needed rest. I have a niece in Missouri who is 44 and fighting cancer also. Among thousands who shared their well-wishes on Facebook, one chimed in, “Battling cancer does take a team of professionals. In addition to his on-air work for SiriusXM, Wayne is also an accomplished singer-songwriter who's released 13 albums and is a member of the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame, according to Country Insider.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NBC News went through a round of layoffs on Wednesday, impacting about 150 staffers, as the network cuts costs as it prepares for the split of most of Comcast's cable networks into Versant. They represent about 2% of the NBCU News Group workforce and a single-digit percentage of NBC News, according to a source familiar with the plans. Staffers are being told that the layoffs are taking place because NBC News no longer will be providing newsgathering for two networks, not just MSNBC but CNBC. Also cited is the economic climate, as linear networks have been trimming staffs amid advertising shifts to other platforms. Radial Entertainment Sees Layoffs After Shout Studios & FilmRise Merge Donald Trump Refuses To Take ABC Correspondent's Question Because Of George Stephanopoulos' Contentious JD Vance Interview They will be able to apply for 140 openings across the newsgroup. About a dozen of the eliminated positions are being repurposed into new roles, and those laid off also can apply for those jobs. The NBC Digital News Guild, which represents staffers including reporters, editors and video journalists, has not received any official notice from management, a spokesperson said. In a statement, Susan DeCarava, president of The NewsGuild of New York, said, “What's clear: NBC management is prioritizing corporate profits at the expense of our hard-working members, without whom there would be no NBC News.” Comcast announced last year that it would spin off most of its cable networks, including MSNBC and CNBC, into a new company, later branded as Versant. The spinoff is expected to be completed by the end of the year, with MSNBC building up its own newsroom given that it no longer will have NBC News as a sister network. Those ties are expected to be severed next week, on Oct. 20. MSNBC also will be taking on a new name, MS NOW, or My Source, News-Opinion-World. In a memo to employees last week, Cesar Conde, chairman of the NBCU News Group, said that a planned NBC News subscription service will launch later this year, while NBC News will expand its sports hub as events like the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics and World Cup approach. He also said that NBC News would be launching a new marketing campaign. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. If the layoffs were due to no longer needing to provide services for CNBC and MSNBC, then shouldnt there be growth jobs available at CNBC and MSNBC to manage those same functions? Versant wasn't spun off to save legacy media, it was to manage the decline so Comcast could focus resources on new media acquisitions like CBS is doing with Bari Weiss.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However you feel about the immersive, somewhat controversial technique, it's clearly worked for Day-Lewis. He's won three Best Actor Oscars throughout his career (for My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood, and Lincoln) and has been nominated for three more. Some such as actor David Harbour have even held him up as a rare exception to their personal philosophy that Method acting is mostly just madness. To Day-Lewis, on the other hand, it's really quite simple. “You have an obligation to try to understand as far as you're humanly able to what it feels like to be inside of that experience.” The actor also pushed back against the claim that immersing yourself in a role means “you're sealed off from experiencing” your own life. It actually means “you're in a self-contained experience of your own,” he said. Ronan had never experienced his father's techniques from behind the camera before, but backed up his claim that immersion in a character doesn't mean you're fully cut off from the reality of the world around you. Club, the younger Day-Lewis said he wasn't expecting how “collaborative [Daniel] was able to be on set, despite how fully enmeshed in his character he was.” He added, “That was amazing to see and very reassuring early on in the shoot.” Peacemaker goes out on a series high with "Full Nelson" By Jarrod Jones October 10, 2025 | 11:24am There's only one movie you need to understand The Smashing Machine's Mark Kerr By Jacob Oller October 6, 2025 | 8:00am JEZEBELKim Kardashian Denies Hooking Up With Travis Barker PASTEThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far: 150-101 SPLINTERTrump Bankrupted Tons of Crypto Bros and Caused Its Biggest Wipeout Ever With One TruthSocial Post</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amid a whirlwind of shocking series cancellations at HGTV during the summer of 2025 and news of new series in the works, twin sisters Lyndsay Lamb and Leslie Davis have been noticeably quiet about the future of their show, “Unsellable Houses.” The duo remains active on social media, still running and promoting their Lamb & Co. real estate, design, and decor businesses in Snohomish, Washington. Now, one year after their show's fifth season debuted in the fall of 2024, one of the sisters has finally begun to acknowledge fans' questions about their on-air future. Throughout the summer, many of Davis and Lamb's HGTV peers made headlines as they revealed their shows were not renewed for new seasons, including Jonathan Knight's “Fixer to Fabulous,” Egypt Sherrod and Mike Jackson's “Married to Real Estate,” and “Bargain Block” with Keith Bynum and Evan Thomas. Meanwhile, in late August, HGTV announced a full slate of new and returning shows for the end of 2025 and early 2026 — but “Unsellable Houses” wasn't on the list. For months, when fans peppered Davis and Lamb's social media posts with questions about their show's future, the duo typically ignored the inquiries. But in early October 2025, Lamb has acknowledged some of her Instagram followers' comments about wanting to see the show return. On an Instagram video she posted on October 3 about creative tabletop ideas for hosting a fall meal, she replied to a fan who commented, “Beautiful! She liked one fan's comment that said, “Looks great! Will you two be back on TV? I miss watching you!” She also liked when a fellow fan replied, “me too! Davis, however, has primarly shared personal posts over the last several months, including chronicling her first trip overseas (to Denmark) this month and has not commented on or liked any inquiries about the show. In a July 2024 episode of their “Twin Win Unfiltered” podcast, the sisters said they never expected or sought out being on TV. Then she called us, and said, ‘Hey, FYI, I gave your name to a production company because I think you guys would be good on a show.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At some point during the past turbulent months, as he searched for purpose and faced the pressures of a very public divorce that engulfed both his personal and professional life, the music stopped for Raymond Ayala. In 2022, Daddy Yankee — that rare artist who has garnered both vast commercial success and respect from artists and the industry alike — surprised the world when he announced his retirement from music. He released what was supposed to be his last studio album, Legendaddy, and performed what was set to be his last tour, grossing $197.8 million and selling 1.9 million tickets, then the second-highest-grossing Latin tour in Billboard Boxscore history. Then, on Dec. 3, 2023, at the tour's final date at Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot in San Juan, he made yet another shocking revelation: “Tonight, I recognize, and I'm not ashamed to tell the whole world, that Jesus lives in me and I live for him,” he told the 15,000 fans that packed his hometown venue. He released songs brimming with positivity, traveled on missions to Africa, made impromptu appearances in churches in Puerto Rico and other Latin countries and saw firsthand the reaction to his new brand of “music with a purpose,” culminating with a Latin Grammy win for best urban song for “Bonita” (Pretty), a non-album single released in 2023. But in December 2024, Ayala's wife of nearly 30 years filed for divorce, and an initially amicable split turned sour amid a spate of legal disputes over his many businesses and assets, including his past catalog negotiations. “But it was part of the process to arrive at a total dependency on God,” Ayala now says. I'm chatting with Ayala in a private dining room at a Brooklyn hotel — his first interview with the press since he announced his conversion to Christianity — over tea and fruit. He is 49 years old, but his trim physique (later, he'll go to the gym with pal J Balvin) and youthful, unlined face display none of the travails of an artist who grew up in Puerto Rico's housing projects and whose music career was jump-started by a gunshot to the leg that ended a promising baseball run. As Daddy Yankee, Ayala is widely recognized as the man who catapulted reggaetón from underground genre to global movement, in large part thanks to his 2004 smash, “Gasolina,” and the relentless string of global hits that followed. 1s — on the Hot Latin Songs chart, among them “Despacito” alongside Luis Fonsi and his most recent, “Sonríele” (Smile), which is currently charting. 37 most listened-to artist on Spotify despite the fact that he has released only a few singles in the past two years. Now Ayala has embarked on a dramatically different second act, with Jesus as a centerpiece and the goal of releasing music that's commercially successful but is “music with a purpose,” as he calls it, rather than religious music with evangelical lyrics. “Having a life of success is different from having a life of purpose,” Ayala replies when I ask what prompted his conversion and the ensuing shift in direction. “Before, my interest was transforming the industry [through music], and that purpose had to do more with business and money, influence, success. Now my purpose is to transform lives with that same instrument. On Oct. 23, Ayala will perform as Daddy Yankee at the Billboard Latin Music Awards, his first televised performance in three years. And he will release Lamento En Baile (Mourning Into Dancing), his first album since 2022 — and his first since publicly converting – on Oct. 16. The title comes from Psalm 30:11, which says, “You have turned my mourning into dancing,” and dovetails with its first focus track, “Sonríele,” a peppy merengue brimming with optimism. It's the first track Ayala has released under DY Publishing, as well as the first step in rebuilding his catalog. Prior to that acquisition, Billboard reported that parts of his catalog had been quietly acquired around 2021 by Cinq Music and a private fund that asked not to be named, which then sold those assets to Concord. (Concord, Cinq and Ayala himself decline to comment about specifics of the deals.) “Someone like [Daddy Yankee], someone who is as prolific as he is productive, we imagine it will happen fairly quickly,” says Jorge Mejía, president/CEO of Sony Music Publishing Latin America and U.S. Latin, which continues to administer all songs written by Ayala for the world. Artists inevitably evolve throughout their careers — growth, change and reinvention are all part of the creative journey.” Ayala is releasing his new music on his own DY Records through a license deal with HYBE Latin America, which announced the signing in July in tandem with the release of “Sonríele” and is betting big on Daddy Yankee as its first major and established artist. “Obviously, partnering with [Daddy Yankee] is extremely important for us,” HYBE Latin America COO Juan Sebastián Arenas says. There's no one better than [him] to accomplish that.” Likewise, in HYBE, Ayala found a label partner that's young (HYBE Latin America launched in 2023), inquisitive and eager to break molds. This summer, Ayala, who has a big following in Asia, went to South Korea for the first time and shot the video to his upcoming single “El Toque,” incorporating elements of Korean dance. If you listen closely, it's clear the seeds of Ayala's conversion were planted in his music long ago. On 2007's “Coraza Divina” (Divine Shield), for example, an autobiographic rap set over salsa tumbao that narrates his rise from the hood, he named a higher power: “Evil realized he was the chosen child and sought to destroy him/But you know what? “Many people don't know that I converted to the Lord for the first time at 19 years old,” Ayala says. Still, in a genre rife with sexually graphic lyrics that often glorify drugs and violence, Ayala always stood out as a rapper with a conscience who delivered mostly G-rated material, but nevertheless oozed swagger and braggadocio. But clearly, the content of Ayala's music went deeper than a commercial play. It's a theme that appears again and again in his work — through to 2016, when, unbeknown to the public, he privately converted. He didn't announce it, he says, “because I had many agreements I had signed and committed to” — label deals, recordings with other artists, brand deals, a major tour — “and I had to deliver.” He's a man of habit and discipline: makes his bed every morning, works out, reads, eats healthy, goes to the studio, repeats. As the “Big Boss” of reggaetón and the urban movement itself, he couldn't conceive of not fulfilling his contractual obligations. So he kept his allegiance to Christ to himself, until that 2023 show where he told the world about his new path. “I wanted to be in peace and complete liberty.” Daddy Yankee's reentry into the world of music as an artist led by faith in Jesus initially appeared seamless. He returned with the single “Bonita,” an uptempo reggaetón fused with horns and merengue that was all about positivity and happiness. The fact was, Ayala had announced his retirement from music in 2022. “The perception was that Yankee had retired and [now] we wanted to say he hadn't,” says Gabriel Llano, head of artist services for U.S. Latin and Latin America at SoundOn at TikTok. “When he made this musical shift, we wanted users to take those songs of his with positive messages to tell their own stories.” After “Bonita,” Ayala released “Donante de Sangre,” a rap track where he addressed his conversion head-on for the first time. “After more than two decades of marriage and after many months of trying to save my marriage, which my wife and I share, today my lawyers respond to the divorce petition received [from] Mireddys,” he wrote in a letter shared to Instagram, referring to Mireddys González, his longtime wife and high school sweetheart. “I'm grateful for the time we shared, full of blessings and values, of love and with a beautiful family that will continue to be our priority.” Within weeks of the divorce announcement, on Dec. 17, Ayala filed two legal motions seeking an injunction against González and her sister Ayeicha González-Castellanos (El Cartel's secretary/treasurer), alleging they withdrew tens of millions of dollars from his business bank accounts without authorization, according to court documents. Although the cases are public, Ayala has not spoken about them — save for perfunctory comments as he's gone in and out of court in Puerto Rico — and he declined to answer questions now. “Be on top of everything, even if you have lawyers and accountants,” Ayala says. The smallest things can make a great difference.” Whatever challenges Ayala has faced over the course of his lengthy career, they've been impossible to discern from the outside. He has never even been attacked on social media — a feat in this day and age. “It's very important to be clear on what self-love is and establish limits. I learned that we sacrifice ourselves for many people, and you do it so much that you normalize it. “I've always been assertive with those outside my close circle. And eventually, Ayala learned how to make music again. “And the strength I found to record an album full of joy in the most unexpected moment of my life is what helped me regain my strength. When we're in the middle of a crisis, one of our biggest fortitudes lies in adoring and praising the Lord because it brings joy.” Despite the change in content and the change in purpose, Ayala intends to tackle the marketing and promotion of his “music with a purpose” with every tool at his disposal, something that has proved tricky in the Latin world for religious artists who previously made secular music. “From a programming perspective … it will all depend on the lyrics,” iHeartLatino senior vp of programming Pedro Javier González says. “Yankee is being smart in how he's handling it. He knows he has global impact and is looking for the best way to take the message without alienating anyone. Up to now, it's been positive lyrics that don't sound religious. “HYBE likes to send positive messages to the world, and I do see a trend coming with inspirational music, music that has undertones of faith,” he says. For Ayala, it's simply part of who he is now. “I can't simply convert and stay silent, you know? Now I'm in the same situation with a different purpose: revolutionize and reinvent.” This story appears in the Oct. 11, 2025, issue of Billboard. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lauryn Hill and D'Angelo were like twin stars birthing a new R&B universe in the late 1990s. In an emotional post paying homage to D'Angelo in the wake of the singer's death at 51 on Tuesday (Oct. 14) due to pancreatic cancer, Hill lavished praise on D'Angelo for being a beacon of light for music, and fellow Black men, while lamenting that she didn't have more precious moments with the enigmatic “Brown Sugar” star. I regret not having more time with you. Your undeniable beauty and talent were not of this world, and a presence not of this world needs protection in a world that covets light and the anointing of God,” Hill wrote. She added, “Thank you for being a beacon of light to a generation and beyond who had no remembrance of the legacy that preceded us. Though D'Angelo only released three albums in his lifetime, his beloved 1995 debut, Brown Sugar, followed by 2000's Voodoo and 2014's Black Messiah, Hill wrote that the singer's aching vulnerability and incomparable passion moved, and inspired, the culture. “You imaged a unity of strength and sensitivity in Black manhood to a generation that only saw itself as having to be one or the other,” Hill wrote. “It is my earnest prayer that you are in peace, far away from selfishness, fear and/or controlling interests,” she added. The post included a series of pictures of D'Angelo in the studio, as well as a snap of the two musicians in which D is giving one of his classic pensive, knowing looks and Hill is smiling as the pair lean their heads together. In a 2008 interview with Rolling Stone, D'Angelo reflected on his studio time with Hill, calling her “warm and sweet” and revealing that the original plan was to show up on each other's projects. “Originally, we were going to swap tunes for each other's projects because I was working on Voodoo at the same time and my keyboardist James Poyser was also working with her,” he said at the time of the producer/songwriter who has been a member of the Roots since 2009 and who has produced and written songs for a constellation of neo soul giants including Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Common and others. When Lauryn and I went into in the studio together, I laid down my vocals in the course of an hour. Hill joined an emotional chorus of friends, fans and fellow musicians who paid tribute to D'Angelo on Tuesday, a roster that included Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Tyler, the Creator, Missy Elliott, Doja Cat, DJ Premiere and many more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The star who retired from acting in 2017 spoke at a packed Screen Talk at the BFI London Film Festival, where he was joined by his director son Ronan. MIPCOM Wrap: Creator Economy Eats TV's Lunch at Cannes Confab 'Saipan' Co-Directors on Finding the Greek Drama That Makes an Irish Sports Story, Starring Steve Coogan, Universal Anemone follows a middle-aged man, portrayed by Sean Bean, on his journey into the woods, where he reconnects with his estranged hermit brother, played by Day-Lewis. Day-Lewis previously shared that he had “certain reservations about being back in the public world again” by starring in the film, but that his son “made it pretty clear that he wasn't going to do it if I didn't do it.” In a wide-ranging discussion, the star was asked on Wednesday about how he has gotten into the physicality of many of his roles, such as My Left Foot. The star also argued that criticism of method acting in recent years has at times been portrayed like a cult, saying such comments often come from people who don't really understand it. “It's almost like some special science that we're involved in, or a cult, but it's just a way of freeing yourself [for] the spontaneity when you are working with your colleagues in front of the camera, so that you are free to respond in any way that you're moved to in that moment.” Back when he went to acting school, theater was considered the “elite cultural form,” while film was seen as “dodgy,” and TV got the reaction of “really? “It always bugged the hell out of me that we were basically performing for a group of privileged people,” he said about his feelings towards such attitudes. And he shared: “I had a crush on Mary Poppins. That and Zulu were two of his favorite films when he was young. The role that changed his life when he viewed it was Dai Bradley in Kes. “It remains one of the greatest performances,” he said before expressing hos “admiration for Ken Loach.” The star also discussed working with writer-director Rebecca Miller, now his wife, on The Ballad of Jack and Rose and now his son. “There was never any question about … a conflict of interest” between family and work roles in both cases, he concluded. Both movies were “experiences that people will remember happily,” he said. Added his father: “It was a joyful experience to have this time together.” Ronan Day-Lewis highlighted how David Lynch has influenced him and how he shared with the legendary filmmaker the interest in “exploring darkness” without “existing in darkness.” Asked about funny moments in Anemone, his father said, among other things, that he found the idea of ”shitting on a priest” that is mentioned in one scene really “hilarious.” “Looking back on it now — I would have done well to just keep my mouth shut, for sure,” he told Rolling Stone. “It just seems like such grandiose gibberish to talk about. The star also shared final words of advice for young actors on Wednesday, before a farewell standing ovation. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

An AI entertainment studio backed by the likes of Google, Andreessen Horowitz, Peter Chernin's North Road Company and Michael Ovitz's Crossbeam wants to bring its generative AI expertise to traditional studios and production companies.

With human expression driving everything we do, filmmakers and creative partners who work with The Generation Company can bring their full vision to life on their own terms.” In addition to VFX and sequences, the company will also provide a team of AI specialists meant to advise creative departments like art, costume, props, and storyboarding. Earlier this year it raised more money, with Google and Crossbeam joining its list of investors, while also making its first acquisition: The tech-centric film school Curious Refuge, which teaches filmmakers how ton utilize advanced technology in their workflows.
