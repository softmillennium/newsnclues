                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Oscar-nominated actress, Penelope Milford, celebrated for her captivating performances in “Coming Home” and “Heathers,” has died at age 77. Milford was best known for her Academy Award–nominated role as Jane Fonda's free-spirited roommate in Hal Ashby's 1978 drama “Coming Home.” Milford's film career included memorable roles in “Valentino,” where she portrayed a silent film star opposite Rudolf Nureyev, and Franco Zeffirelli's “Endless Love.” Her work in “Coming Home” earned her one of four Oscar nominations for the film, alongside co-stars Jane Fonda, Jon Voight, and Bruce Dern. Maggie Smith ultimately won the Academy Award that year for “California Suite”. She joined the 1972 cast of “Lenny” and later earned a Drama Desk nomination for her performance in the long-running Civil War musical “Shenandoah.” The actress rose to prominence in both television and film after getting her start on Broadway. Metro reported that she performed opposite Richard Gere in the acclaimed play “Richard Fariña: Long Time Coming and a Long Time Gone,” and the two later dated offstage. A devout Christian Scientist, she later moved to Saugerties in 2003, where she remodeled a historic home and stayed involved in her community. Her brother, actor and musician Kim Milford, died in 1980 at age 37, as reported by The Huffington Post. She was briefly married to poet Michael Lally during the 1980s.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It feels like we've lived a thousand lives since Red, White & Royal Blue first introduced viewers to the star-crossed love story of first son Alex Claremont-Diaz (Taylor Zakhar Perez) and Prince Henry of England (Nicholas Galitzine) in 2023. We also, uh, have a new president in the White House. “We all need this kind of optimism, fantasy, and gay joy. If you're looking for hints about where the story could go, don't look at Zakhar Perez. “Because if I'm asked about it, it's going to be tough to not Tom Holland it and talk a little Spider-Man.” Strays toward Holland's loose lips aside, Zakhar Perez did expound on why the first film felt so important when the sequel was announced in 2024. Red, White & Royal Blue was number one on Amazon “in countries where it's quite literally illegal to be queer,” he said. “I think it's just as important for those a part of the community and those that are not part of the community to watch this project and just learn something, enjoy it, laugh.” Prime Video has not shared a release timeline for Red, White & Royal Wedding as of this writing, but expect to receive that save the date in the mail soon.

The movie's release will rep a little more than five years since Everything Everywhere All at Once hit theaters, that A24 title still anomaly at the specialty box office as theaters were fitting their footing roughly a year after their 2021 re-opening from Covid's closure. The movie was originally scheduled for June 12, 2026 before being unset. The Daniels' movie takes the place of a reserved hold that Universal had on Nov. 19, 2027 for an untitled event movie. The pic is scheduled to open before Disney's Frozen 3 on Nov. 24, 2027. Everything Everywhere All at Once world premiered like a house on fire at SXSW in the spring of 2022 and went on to gross $77.1M domestic, $142.8M worldwide, becoming the highest grossing A24 theatrical release ever.

Trevorrow and Joe Epstein are in talks to write. The original animated series was produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and aired on ABC from Sept. 23, 1962-March 17, 1963. There was an animated series reboot that ran from 1985-1987. The show followed George Jetson, corporate suit dad, in future world of flying cars, high-rises and moving sidewalk escalators.

One of Warners' more popular live-action takes of a Hanna-Barbera cartoon was Scooby-Doo which was released in 2002 and spawned a 2004 sequel, Scooby-Doo: Monsters Unleashed. Raja Gosnell directed both off a script by James Gunn (now Warner Bros' co-Head of DC). Freddie Prinze Jr starred as Fred, Sarah Michelle Gellar was Daphne, Matthew Lillard played Shaggy and Linda Cardellini broke out as Velma.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NBC News is clearing out its newsroom ahead of parent company NBCUniversal's impending split. It apparently couldn't let those employees go without playing a little mind game, however. Employees have reportedly anticipated this for weeks, as NBC News Group, the umbrella division that represents NBC News as well as CNBC and MSNBC, which will both be housed under new spin-off company Versant, is being split in two along with the parent company. Still, there may be some hope for laid off employees who want to stay with the company but don't want to just reapply for the same old jobs. Last week, NBC News Group Chairman Cesar Conde discussed plans to launch a new subscription product for mobile audiences and grow the company's focus on sports, Variety reports. Unfortunately, NBC News employees aren't the only newsroom staffers bracing for cuts. (A memo she sent to staff last week asking “how you spend your working hours” certainly didn't help morale.) CNN also laid off around 6 percent of its workforce earlier this year.

An AI entertainment studio backed by the likes of Google, Andreessen Horowitz, Peter Chernin's North Road Company and Michael Ovitz's Crossbeam wants to bring its generative AI expertise to traditional studios and production companies. Promise, led by Fullscreen founder George Strompolos, former YouTube executive Jamie Byrne, who most recently led creator partnerships for YouTube; and AI filmmaker Dave Clark, is launching a new division called The Generation Company, which will work with outside studios and production companies to deliver visual effects and sequences created with its tech. 'Wednesday': How a Zombie and His Creation Made It to the Netflix Series “With The Generation Company, Promise is bringing our GenAI filmmaking expertise to partners as a true creative ally, helping them achieve their vision and push ideas beyond the limits of traditional resources, timelines, and budgets,” said Byrne, the co-founder, president and COO of Promise. “For me, it's about honoring the craft I've devoted my career to while embracing new tools that expand what's possible on screen. With human expression driving everything we do, filmmakers and creative partners who work with The Generation Company can bring their full vision to life on their own terms.” In addition to VFX and sequences, the company will also provide a team of AI specialists meant to advise creative departments like art, costume, props, and storyboarding. Earlier this year it raised more money, with Google and Crossbeam joining its list of investors, while also making its first acquisition: The tech-centric film school Curious Refuge, which teaches filmmakers how ton utilize advanced technology in their workflows.

Karl Marx himself may have written that “history repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.” Still, not even the most dedicated members of Japan's Red Army Faction — a militant, “Communist Manifesto”-carrying group most famous for hijacking a JAL flight in the spring of 1970 — could have imagined their signature action would eventually be restaged as a slick and sprawling Netflix comedy combining the smirking political satire of “Burn After Reading” with the cold-blooded visual dynamism of a Park Chan-wook film. Sure, the Yodogo Hijacking Incident wasn't quite a tragedy, and “Good News” is just a bit too grounded to feel like a true farce, but the disconnect between the severity of what happened and the blitheness with which Korean director Byun Sung-hyun (“The Merciless”) has re-imagined it is striking enough to affirm Marx's point. I have to imagine that the hijackers would've been happy about that; bumbling and inept as they appear in Byun's movie, their conviction smacks of courage when compared to the spinelessness of the bureaucrats tasked with solving the crisis, all of whom care more about their own egos and careers than they do the 130 passengers whose lives are at stake. Related Stories Tim Blake Nelson Is a Multi-Tasking Brainiac IndieWire's Future of Filmmaking to Partner with SCAD on Behind Their Lens Panels at Savannah Film Festival Just droll, twisty, and stylish enough to forgive this 136-minute film for using a lot more runway than it needs to be airborne, “Good News” is a veritable caricature of middle-management — an epic parody of passing the buck. That so few of the actual facts have been changed, despite an impishly self-conflicting disclaimer that insists it was “inspired by real events” but also that “all of the characters and events portrayed are fictional,” only serves to strengthen Byun's damning portrayal of political cowardice. For all of the lip service that Byun and Lee Jin-seong's knotted script pays to the relative nature of truth, however, “Good News” initially makes it easy to separate fact from fiction. Did heavily armed hijackers commandeer a Boeing 727 as part of their plan to further a worldwide revolution against the United States and its allies? Indeed, and an opening flurry of newsreel footage helps to confirm that we aren't completely outside of history. Was their leader as handsome as “Tokyo Vice” star Show Kasamatsu, or their youngest member barely old enough to fly without parental supervision? Ditto those who manage to avoid taking the blame. But the movie only really takes flight after the line between “tragedy” and “farce” begins to blur, like when a proactive air force “double parks” a jet in front of the 727 as it stops to refuel. Funny as it is, that sequence pales in comparison to what happens later, when a young Korean Air Force lieutenant named Seo (Hong Kyung) has the bright idea of executing a double hijack. The Red Army Faction believes they're flying into Pyongyang, but Seo — in a standoff that's shot like a Sergio Leone spaghetti western, complete with ultra-wide framing, skintight leather chaps, and a few errant tumbleweeds for good measure — wrests control of the radio frequency from his North Korean counterparts and fools the hijackers into landing in Seoul's Gimpo International Airport instead. Remarkably, this part of the story is rooted in truth. Like everyone else in this movie, however, the director wants to frame this story on his own terms (“If I can't capture this historical moment on film, I at least want to participate in it!”), and his eagerness to control the action risks creating new conflict. Not only does this display of egomaniacal buffoonery make for “Good News”' most effective setpiece, the sheer absurdity of the situation embellished by Byun's arch framing and previously unknown flair for dry comedy, it also epitomizes the core ethos of a film in which shaping the narrative is always more important than saving the hostages. “Good News” has no compunctions about depicting its characters — even and especially the South Korean ones — as narcissistic dolts. That functional mismatch saps away at the comedy of a film clearly made to be enjoyed by a global audience. Pointed gestures toward the lingering tension between Japan and Korea — and between those two countries and the rest of the planet — are drowned out by tiresome bickering and exaggerated gags, like a meaningful conversation swallowed into the sound of an airplane engine screaming overhead. Byun's visual playfulness is likewise compelling enough to compensate for the shortcuts in his storytelling — active camerawork and inventive CGI combine with Jo Hyoung-rae's heightened cinematography to imbue the film's airplane cabins and flight control towers with a vivid sense of theatricality. Yet the director is so eager to make a spectacle out of this scenario that “Good News” begins to feel as self-insistent as its characters. Perhaps that's by design, and Byun is bending his own form towards a damning commentary on universal self-interest — even in the face of a crisis. In a rich but increasingly disappointing film where everyone is trying so hard to pass the buck, it's only fitting that viewers end up holding the bag. “Good News” will be available to stream on Netflix starting Friday, October 17.

Rejected by mainstream film festivals before it premiered in Edinburgh this summer and NewFest in New York in October, this taboo-busting study of a masculine camboy confronted by the pedophile teacher who many years ago desired him holds back little and offers even less that's palatable to swallow. “Blue Film,” which takes place entirely in a rented Hancock Park Airbnb in Los Angeles with only two actors, dares to go places I have not seen an American movie travel to in a while. There was an Israeli movie called “Princess” at Sundance in 2014, directed by Tali Shalom Ezer, which freaked a lot of people out. It was about a 12-year-old girl's “close relationship” with her mother's boyfriend. There was the 2011 Austrian movie “Michael,” directed by Michael Haneke protégé Markus Schleinzer, about an insurance salesman sexually abusing the 10-year-old boy locked up in his basement. Tuttle, an American filmmaker himself who received support on the project from Mark Duplass of all possible collaborators, is willing to take you to those same dark places, ones that remind you of European directors who want to shake you with their frank psychosexual provocations. It's impressive where Tuttle, this second-time feature filmmaker, goes with his surprisingly humanistic and empathetic approach to material about abuse. One where a pedophile teacher's sexual fantasy about his former student's talent show performance emerges as oddly wistful. “Blue Film” stars rising actor Kieron Moore as dom camboy Aaron Eagle (whose real name is Alex McConnell) opposite Reed Birney as his estranged middle school teacher, who reconnect over one night filled with conversations about desire, shame, and guilt. I'm not surprised festivals, allegedly such as Sundance and SXSW, looked away from it. Mainstream audiences will be alienated by this unapologetic exploration of quote-unquote aberrant sexuality, but those looking for a challenge in the vein of ‘90s films from Todd Solondz or Gregg Araki will feel seen in Tuttle's exploration of how abuse warps memory, and memory warps accounts of abuse. In asking you to feel sorry for a pedophile while making a gay man his scene partner, “Blue Film” dances on the tricky line from early abuse to later-in-life sexual behavior. When the movie begins, we see Aaron (Moore), sweaty and hairy in white briefs and tattooed top-to-toe, putting on a live stream for his submissive followers. One of his anonymous fans offers $50,000 for an in-person meet-and-greet. Financially desperate, he agrees to spend the night with the client, who greets him sheathed in a balaclava with the promise of even more money and perhaps pizza if Aaron is willing to open up about himself. That client, it turns out, is Mr. Grant, aka Hank, Aaron's long-ago teacher, and one who took a special interest in Aaron as a child. Hank, he reveals, has now turned to religion as an atonement for his own torment, but his search for meaning has not been without other attempts at or contemplations of assaulting kids, as he tells Aaron. Tuttle's script and camera pass no judgment on the characters, like when Aaron shares a bone-chilling story of childhood abuse while naked in a bathtub that may or may not be true, or when Hank also offers a sickening recounting of molestation he endured at the hands of a relative. The actors are as game as any you could imagine, working from a script that you can imagine a lot of people said “hell no” to. Birney, 71, and best known for work in television and theater (“The Humans”), invites you to feel all his hurt, even as his world is a morally disturbed one we are made to live inside for the movie's running time. As Aaron, Moore, meanwhile, conceals deep wounds of his own, while also high on the power imbalance this situation has tipped his way, where Hank wants to know if he “still loves” Aaron. “Blue Film” is confined to a single environment, after all. The DP knows his way around a tight room with just a few people, and the visual beauty of this movie (indeed, often cloaked in literal blues as night turns to dawn) helps alleviate the agonies on display. We are stuck with these two people and our discomfort with them, even though we might also feel tenderness toward them. And the parallel to that question is whether abuse can also beget more abuse, i.e. make you into a pedophile or sex offender. Hank says he knew who he was once his sexual fantasies in middle school, about his fellow same-age classmates, remained the same into adulthood. What Tuttle wants to attack here is this terrible fork-in-the-road notion that pedophilia and homosexuality stem from the same root. Still, “Blue Film” does the rare work of listening with compassion to a pedophile such as Hank, and as an audience, you can either be curious about that or just let it make you uncomfortable. But when most films either wouldn't dare go here at all, or would tell you how to feel about the material, that's rare and welcome.

The show is set to film in Los Angeles. “We are thrilled to expand the Bosch universe with this compelling origin story that showcases how one of television's most beloved detectives became the man we know today,” said MGM+ head Michael Wright. “With Cameron Monaghan and Omari Hardwick bringing these complex characters to life, and the creative vision of Michael Connelly and our talented executive producers, Bosch: Start of Watch promises to deliver the gritty, authentic storytelling that honors the franchise's legacy while opening an exciting new chapter.” Start of Watch will be set in 1991, with the 26-year-old Harry as an LAPD rookie under the tutelage of training officer Eli Bridges (Hardwick). “Amid routine calls and growing unrest, Bosch finds himself drawn into a high-profile heist and a web of criminal corruption that will test his loyalty to the badge and shape his future as the detective who lives by the code, ‘Everybody counts or nobody counts. “I'm deeply grateful to Michael Wright and the team at MGM+ for championing this next chapter in Bosch's journey with such remarkable care and integrity,” said Connelly. “Being able to see how Harry Bosch became the man we have loved for 10 seasons is a gift to me and his many fans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But even for an artist who has spent nearly two decades breaking her own records, these numbers are on another level entirely. Every single one of its 12 songs lands in the top 12 of the Billboard Hot 100 — a feat no artist has ever achieved before. And with this latest sweep, Swift has now occupied the entire top 10 of the Hot 100 three separate times. No other artist in history has done it even once. Those accomplishments alone would be enough to define most careers, but for Swift, they're just the beginning of another historic week. Across Billboard's album, song and genre charts, The Life of a Showgirl resets the record books — from streaming milestones to vinyl sales to chart longevity benchmarks. With the charts officially locked in, it's worth looking closer at just how many records this album breaks. She also makes historic starts at radio and sets a new mark for the most streamed song in a single week in the post-UGC era (2020-present). Below, we've rounded up every major Billboard chart record Swift breaks this week — and a few she extends even further — thanks to The Life of a Showgirl. This article was originally published on Billboard's Substack channel. The Life of a Showgirl earns Swift her 15th No. She breaks out of a tie with Drake and Jay-Z for the most of all time among soloists. Among all artists, only the Beatles have more, with 19. 1 albums since the Billboard 200 began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in March 1956. Showgirl earned 4.002 million equivalent album units in the United States in its opening week (Oct. 3-9), according to Billboard's data tracker Luminate, the largest weekly sum for an album since Billboard began ranking the week's most popular albums by that metric on the Billboard 200 in December 2014. Here's a recap of the top 10 biggest weeks, by units, since December 2014. Showgirl sold 3,479,500 copies in pure album sales in its first week (purchases of digital downloads, CDs, vinyl LPs and cassette tapes). That is the single largest sales week for an album since 1991, when Luminate began electronically tracking music sales. Here's a recap of the top 10 biggest selling weeks by albums in the modern era (1991-present), ranked in order by sales volume. Of Showgirl's 3,479,500 copies sold in its opening week, 1.334 million were sold on vinyl — the most sold in a single week in the modern era for an album on vinyl. Here's a look at the top 10 biggest selling weeks by albums on vinyl in the modern era (1991-present), ranked in order by sales volume. That's the most single-week streams for a song since Billboard removed all user-generated-content streams from its streaming tabulation on Sept. 19, 2020. Before that, UGC streams factored into Billboard's streaming methodology, and therefore, the Hot 100. Swift holds the records for all seven of those categories among women. “The Fate of Ophelia” earns Swift her 13th career No. She breaks out of a tie with Drake and Ariana Grande for the most leaders this decade so far. It passes two hits that each started at a prior No. 12 best: Swift's own “Shake It Off” (Sept. 6, 2014) and Mariah Carey's “Dreamlover” (Aug. 14, 1993). It also becomes Swift's record-extending 33rd top 10 at the format. She also debuts five other songs on the ranking this week, upping her career count to a record-extending 54 entries. These are all the most among women and second-most overall, after Drake. She also passes Drake for the most top five hits (23) and top 10s (42) and extends her record for the most overall entries with 188. She also extends her record for the most overall entries to 167.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At some point during the past turbulent months, as he searched for purpose and faced the pressures of a very public divorce that engulfed both his personal and professional life, the music stopped for Raymond Ayala. In 2022, Daddy Yankee — that rare artist who has garnered both vast commercial success and respect from artists and the industry alike — surprised the world when he announced his retirement from music. He released what was supposed to be his last studio album, Legendaddy, and performed what was set to be his last tour, grossing $197.8 million and selling 1.9 million tickets, then the second-highest-grossing Latin tour in Billboard Boxscore history. Then, on Dec. 3, 2023, at the tour's final date at Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot in San Juan, he made yet another shocking revelation: “Tonight, I recognize, and I'm not ashamed to tell the whole world, that Jesus lives in me and I live for him,” he told the 15,000 fans that packed his hometown venue. He released songs brimming with positivity, traveled on missions to Africa, made impromptu appearances in churches in Puerto Rico and other Latin countries and saw firsthand the reaction to his new brand of “music with a purpose,” culminating with a Latin Grammy win for best urban song for “Bonita” (Pretty), a non-album single released in 2023. But in December 2024, Ayala's wife of nearly 30 years filed for divorce, and an initially amicable split turned sour amid a spate of legal disputes over his many businesses and assets, including his past catalog negotiations. “But it was part of the process to arrive at a total dependency on God,” Ayala now says. I'm chatting with Ayala in a private dining room at a Brooklyn hotel — his first interview with the press since he announced his conversion to Christianity — over tea and fruit. He is 49 years old, but his trim physique (later, he'll go to the gym with pal J Balvin) and youthful, unlined face display none of the travails of an artist who grew up in Puerto Rico's housing projects and whose music career was jump-started by a gunshot to the leg that ended a promising baseball run. As Daddy Yankee, Ayala is widely recognized as the man who catapulted reggaetón from underground genre to global movement, in large part thanks to his 2004 smash, “Gasolina,” and the relentless string of global hits that followed. 1s — on the Hot Latin Songs chart, among them “Despacito” alongside Luis Fonsi and his most recent, “Sonríele” (Smile), which is currently charting. 37 most listened-to artist on Spotify despite the fact that he has released only a few singles in the past two years. Now Ayala has embarked on a dramatically different second act, with Jesus as a centerpiece and the goal of releasing music that's commercially successful but is “music with a purpose,” as he calls it, rather than religious music with evangelical lyrics. “Having a life of success is different from having a life of purpose,” Ayala replies when I ask what prompted his conversion and the ensuing shift in direction. “Before, my interest was transforming the industry [through music], and that purpose had to do more with business and money, influence, success. Now my purpose is to transform lives with that same instrument. On Oct. 23, Ayala will perform as Daddy Yankee at the Billboard Latin Music Awards, his first televised performance in three years. And he will release Lamento En Baile (Mourning Into Dancing), his first album since 2022 — and his first since publicly converting – on Oct. 16. The title comes from Psalm 30:11, which says, “You have turned my mourning into dancing,” and dovetails with its first focus track, “Sonríele,” a peppy merengue brimming with optimism. It's the first track Ayala has released under DY Publishing, as well as the first step in rebuilding his catalog. Prior to that acquisition, Billboard reported that parts of his catalog had been quietly acquired around 2021 by Cinq Music and a private fund that asked not to be named, which then sold those assets to Concord. (Concord, Cinq and Ayala himself decline to comment about specifics of the deals.) “Someone like [Daddy Yankee], someone who is as prolific as he is productive, we imagine it will happen fairly quickly,” says Jorge Mejía, president/CEO of Sony Music Publishing Latin America and U.S. Latin, which continues to administer all songs written by Ayala for the world. “This is not an unusual situation for us. Artists inevitably evolve throughout their careers — growth, change and reinvention are all part of the creative journey.” Ayala is releasing his new music on his own DY Records through a license deal with HYBE Latin America, which announced the signing in July in tandem with the release of “Sonríele” and is betting big on Daddy Yankee as its first major and established artist. “Obviously, partnering with [Daddy Yankee] is extremely important for us,” HYBE Latin America COO Juan Sebastián Arenas says. There's no one better than [him] to accomplish that.” Likewise, in HYBE, Ayala found a label partner that's young (HYBE Latin America launched in 2023), inquisitive and eager to break molds. This summer, Ayala, who has a big following in Asia, went to South Korea for the first time and shot the video to his upcoming single “El Toque,” incorporating elements of Korean dance. If you listen closely, it's clear the seeds of Ayala's conversion were planted in his music long ago. On 2007's “Coraza Divina” (Divine Shield), for example, an autobiographic rap set over salsa tumbao that narrates his rise from the hood, he named a higher power: “Evil realized he was the chosen child and sought to destroy him/But you know what? “Many people don't know that I converted to the Lord for the first time at 19 years old,” Ayala says. Still, in a genre rife with sexually graphic lyrics that often glorify drugs and violence, Ayala always stood out as a rapper with a conscience who delivered mostly G-rated material, but nevertheless oozed swagger and braggadocio. But clearly, the content of Ayala's music went deeper than a commercial play. It's a theme that appears again and again in his work — through to 2016, when, unbeknown to the public, he privately converted. He didn't announce it, he says, “because I had many agreements I had signed and committed to” — label deals, recordings with other artists, brand deals, a major tour — “and I had to deliver.” He's a man of habit and discipline: makes his bed every morning, works out, reads, eats healthy, goes to the studio, repeats. As the “Big Boss” of reggaetón and the urban movement itself, he couldn't conceive of not fulfilling his contractual obligations. So he kept his allegiance to Christ to himself, until that 2023 show where he told the world about his new path. “I wanted to be in peace and complete liberty.” Daddy Yankee's reentry into the world of music as an artist led by faith in Jesus initially appeared seamless. He returned with the single “Bonita,” an uptempo reggaetón fused with horns and merengue that was all about positivity and happiness. The fact was, Ayala had announced his retirement from music in 2022. “The perception was that Yankee had retired and [now] we wanted to say he hadn't,” says Gabriel Llano, head of artist services for U.S. Latin and Latin America at SoundOn at TikTok. “When he made this musical shift, we wanted users to take those songs of his with positive messages to tell their own stories.” After “Bonita,” Ayala released “Donante de Sangre,” a rap track where he addressed his conversion head-on for the first time. Then, on Dec. 2, 2024, Ayala made yet another surprise announcement. “After more than two decades of marriage and after many months of trying to save my marriage, which my wife and I share, today my lawyers respond to the divorce petition received [from] Mireddys,” he wrote in a letter shared to Instagram, referring to Mireddys González, his longtime wife and high school sweetheart. “I'm grateful for the time we shared, full of blessings and values, of love and with a beautiful family that will continue to be our priority.” Within weeks of the divorce announcement, on Dec. 17, Ayala filed two legal motions seeking an injunction against González and her sister Ayeicha González-Castellanos (El Cartel's secretary/treasurer), alleging they withdrew tens of millions of dollars from his business bank accounts without authorization, according to court documents. Although the cases are public, Ayala has not spoken about them — save for perfunctory comments as he's gone in and out of court in Puerto Rico — and he declined to answer questions now. “Be on top of everything, even if you have lawyers and accountants,” Ayala says. The smallest things can make a great difference.” Whatever challenges Ayala has faced over the course of his lengthy career, they've been impossible to discern from the outside. Through the years he's been unflappable, even-keeled, scandal-free. He has never even been attacked on social media — a feat in this day and age. “It's very important to be clear on what self-love is and establish limits. I learned that we sacrifice ourselves for many people, and you do it so much that you normalize it. “I've always been assertive with those outside my close circle. And eventually, Ayala learned how to make music again. “And the strength I found to record an album full of joy in the most unexpected moment of my life is what helped me regain my strength. When we're in the middle of a crisis, one of our biggest fortitudes lies in adoring and praising the Lord because it brings joy.” Despite the change in content and the change in purpose, Ayala intends to tackle the marketing and promotion of his “music with a purpose” with every tool at his disposal, something that has proved tricky in the Latin world for religious artists who previously made secular music. “From a programming perspective … it will all depend on the lyrics,” iHeartLatino senior vp of programming Pedro Javier González says. “Yankee is being smart in how he's handling it. He knows he has global impact and is looking for the best way to take the message without alienating anyone. Up to now, it's been positive lyrics that don't sound religious. “HYBE likes to send positive messages to the world, and I do see a trend coming with inspirational music, music that has undertones of faith,” he says. For Ayala, it's simply part of who he is now. “I can't simply convert and stay silent, you know? Now I'm in the same situation with a different purpose: revolutionize and reinvent.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Billboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>he Palace Theater in Los Angeles was an odd place for a punk show. Its stage once featured worldwide stars like Harry Houdini. For many years it was an ornate movie theater. On this night in 2023, however,  the cavernous five-story building was filled with bearded, flannel-wearing, middle-aged former punks, most of whom came to see Nineties punk titans Unwound play a reunion for the 20th birthday of the archival record label Numero Group. One of these middle-aged punks (sans the beard and flannel) was a youth swimming coach named Chris Sheppard. But it was also a question he and his bandmates had been asking themselves for months. “When we started playing the first note,” Beachboard says, “they were thrown out of the way by kids immediately moshing and dancing.” “Because I think they were like, ‘Let's go up there and support our idiot husbands up there playing their little guitars and their little keyboards. “We had a stage diver at that show,” Sheppard says. “We never played a stage tall enough to dive off of before.” Sheppard started Everyone Asked About You with his friends back in Little Rock, Arkansas, in the late 1990s when they were all teenagers. At the time, Little Rock punched well above its weight within the niche emo and hardcore scenes, anchored by bands like Chino Horde (whose guitarist, Jason White, went on to play for Green Day) and Soophie Nun Squad. After a few years, like most high school groups, Everyone Asked About You broke up and went their separate ways, never to think about the band again. That was supposed to be the end of Everyone Asked About You. Then one day in 2015, Sheppard saw a YouTube video that would blow his mind. It was a recording of a band in Japan onstage playing the songs he'd written with his friends two decades ago. CHRIS SHEPPARD MET DRUMMER LEE BUFORD at Little Rock Central High School, and the two of them formed a band called the Low End Theory, playing Unwound-inspired noise rock. Eventually they started listening to bands like Rainer Maria and Braid, bands that came to define the “Midwest emo” sound of the 1990s, a softer and more melodic style of hardcore. “What we were playing was lots of major chords. It had that pretty vibe, but the songs were fundamentally sad,” Kilgore says. Buford had noticed Hannah Vogan hanging around the benches on Kavanaugh Boulevard, a popular spot for Little Rock punk kids to congregate. He found out she went to the private school Pulaski Academy. He also found out she was taking opera lessons. Buford introduced himself, and invited her to join their band. Punk Band Ekko Astral Reissue 2024 Debut With Five Bonus Tracks He Did That: Jaleel White Reflects on Life as Urkel Punk Label Hopeless Records Heads to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame The name Everyone Asked About You came from a children's book Buford found at Books-a-Million. Their songs had names like “Paper Airplanes, Paper Hearts” and “Sometimes Memory Fails Me Sometimes.” They played their first show with the local heroes Soophie Nun Squad, a chaotic band with anywhere from seven to 12 members, depending on the night, that played a fun and wild form of punk music that wasn't anything like Everyone Asked About You's sound. The bands they regularly played with were often aggressive, dramatic, and heavy. “At the time, I wanted to be edgy and post-hardcore, post-punk kind of sound,” Kilgore says. “And then we were making this sort of twee stuff.” “When we first started, a lot of that original Little Rock old guard had moved on and gone off to college, and it was just the high school kids left there carrying it on,” Sheppard says. Their shows were always upbeat, with plenty of dancing and singing along. “I was a closeted gay kid and she was a Southern girl, and those are two perspectives that are, I think, unique within the scene that we were a part of,” Sheppard says. “And I think that's one of the reasons why I don't feel like we had any sort of traction or launch back then.” Ironically, they found that cities where there was an established “Midwest emo” scene were the toughest crowds of all. They put out a few singles and one full-length, all on vinyl, probably a few hundred copies of each, selling them through the mail or by hand at shows. Heartattack, a widely read hardcore zine, panned their record as “cutesy” and “queasy.” There was a feeling they were too late to their particular style of emo, and the scene had already moved on from twee teenage angst to a more technical, harder sound. “It had fallen a little out of vogue at that point,” says bassist Matt Bradley. Bradley became a production designer for the Santa Fe, New Mexico-based art collective Meow Wolf. They mostly fell out of touch with one another. IN 2015, A STUDENT AT KEIO UNIVERSITY in Tokyo was looking for some music that he and his classmates could play at an upcoming school festival. Sasagawa searched YouTube for old and obscure emo bands, and came across a 2012 upload of Everyone Asked About You's vinyl album. “We were also drawn to the low-fi, unpolished production — it gave their music a kind of authenticity that felt more real than anything overly polished ever could. Unbeknownst to the members of EAAY, that YouTube video Sasagawa found already had more than 100,000 views, and interest in their band was growing. That song was called “Me vs. You,” and it opens with Vogan singing the unapologetically cloying lines “Just between me and you, I think I'm in love with you/All of my waking time you're on my mind/I don't know why” over a driving drumbeat and guitar feedback. “Which is really impossible to get right in music, for me at least. “I just thought it was cool, and it was a group from my era that I'd never heard of,” Shipley tells me. Buford was skeptical, dismissive, and maybe even a little embarrassed. The Body played experimental noise and metal that is often described as “scary,” a far cry from the melodic, singsongy emo of Everyone Asked About You. “I don't think he rated the music that highly, but also, the idea that anyone would seem interested in this was pretty ludicrous,” Shipley says. Buford shared Shipley's email with his old bandmates, but they, too, wrote it off. He emailed Buford regularly, maybe once every six months or so, all while monitoring the growth in the band's video views and comments. “And then it wasn't until 2021 that I reached out to them and just was like, ‘Hey, I think that y'all are missing something here, and that this is having a moment,'” he says. “And how I knew that is just looking at the number of plays. The Rate Your Music reviews were super through-the-roof for it. And the YouTube comments, anytime you're seeing a song getting 400, 500, 600 comments — I mean, just affecting somebody enough to type 15 characters into a field, it's meaningful.” Eventually Shipley asked the band if they'd like to reunite and play the label's 20th-birthday party show with Unwound. At that point, Buford decided to get the band together on Zoom. “I was 100 percent prepared to say, ‘Absolutely not,'” Sheppard says. “I definitely was like, ‘Who the fuck wants this? “Yeah, there's some YouTube video watches or whatever, but we were not a popular band in the Nineties.” “If we were to tell this story at a bar to our friends and be like, ‘We got asked to play this big show with a bunch of our musical heroes, and we said no' — that would be a really shitty end to the story,” he says. “When we first got together to play these songs that none of us had even really thought about or listened to in that 25 years, it took me straight back there to what it was like to play them and feel those things the first time,” Kilgore says. It was a very strange experience, because I hadn't experienced anything like that in my life.” “But I'm not sure we had talked in 10 years before this.” They spent four days together rehearsing, reconnecting, and trying to find whatever it was in their music that was so captivating to the youth of today. And in February 2023, they took the stage in Los Angeles in front of the bearded, flanneled men who wondered who the hell they were, as well as the hundreds of kids who knew exactly who they were, and sang every word to every song. They've kept booking and playing more shows since then, meeting young fans — some of whom fly in from other countries just to see them. AS EVERYONE ASKED ABOUT YOU TOOK THE STAGE at Le Poisson Rouge in New York's West Village this spring, the packed club roared with delight. As the band played, their fans' dancing eventually turned into a mosh pit. Everybody enjoys music differently and you should enjoy it how you want to, but make sure you're not infringing on other people's spaces.” A cheer from the crowd, and the mosh pit turned into synchronized bouncing — pure kinetic energy — and singing loudly enough to be heard over the amplification. In fact, on this particular night, it is Canty's 18th birthday. Canty's father and bassist Isabella Mackaye's uncle are members of the legendary D.C. punk band Fugazi. When he met Birthday Girl DC during a show in Washington, he asked them if they had ever heard of Everyone Asked About You. Wilson went to watch the two bands play together in the basement of a Unitarian church in Philadelphia, a venue that has been hosting punk shows since 1993, where many of Everyone Asked About You's contemporaries played. Thirty years on, they played there to a crowd of teenagers who weren't even born when Everyone Asked About You first formed. Wilson, who lives in Philadelphia and attends shows at the church often, had never seen anything like it. “Seeing the younger people,” he says, “it was insane. “I was fully prepared for them to be dickheads,” Birthday Girl DC drummer Tess Kontarinis says, recalling her first meeting with the members of Everyone Asked About You. “We listen to a lot of bands that are not together,” Kontarinis says. “And then this band out of nowhere just reformed,” Mackaye says. “With the exact same energy that they had,” finishes Canty. “I think a big reason why they still work and are so cool is because they all went on and lived really normal lives.” The song “A Vigil,” written in response to the attack and death of nonbinary 16-year-old Nex Benedict in Oklahoma last year, features Sheppard earnestly crying out “Two-sided lies to save who from what? A knife in the gut?” On the song “We're All Losing It,” they lament the sounds of their voices, reflect about their childhood, and in unison sing, “Wish I was an easier kid/When I was younger.” Everyone Asked About You songs show up in TikToks ranging from the standard fare of people getting ready for school or dancing alone in their bedrooms to clips of Ultimate Fighting Championship matches or NBA games. And when someone is curious about more than the six seconds of a song they hear on TikTok, they go looking for more. What they discover is an entire underground scene — one not too distant in the past, yet far enough to feel completely different from contemporary culture. “Everyone Asked About You was the first emo band that I got into,” Flanagan says. “The recordings, they're fairly rough compared with a Fugazi record or something,” says Önol, the fan from Glasgow, “but they're going for it.”“Their production is they just plug in and play and then that's it,” Canty says. It's a paradox, this idea that a band of people in their forties and fifties are seen by so many teenage punk kids as the most authentic representation of youth, especially when so many of the members of the band have a hard time relating to this generation. Ultimately, what could be fueling the excitement around Everyone Asked About You is the relative obscurity and unlikeliness of it all. While Bradley doesn't see teenagers as pretentious, there is a certain amount of hip “in-the-know” attitude to this band's fandom. “There's a little bit of ‘I want to find something that nobody knows about,'” Sheppard says. “A lot of kids are looking for something more authentic and real.” “Finding something by itself or on its own that doesn't sound like it's from today.” Shipley has built his label's success on this archival culture, and sees firsthand how young people today are mining the digital record crates for lost gems. Today, Everyone Asked About You are preparing to go back out on tour this month, including a stop in their hometown of Little Rock. Meanwhile, their records continue to sell all over the world. No, but they have an opportunity to go play in Japan, and I know that we've sold a bunch of their records in Europe, and it will grow as their notoriety grows,” Shipley says. The Nineties — the “last time before the internet” — represent a time when young people may have felt more connected to one another, when small things still felt really big and important, when something as superficial as a music scene still tied young people together and played a major role in forming their values, their personalities, and their friendships in ways that would last the rest of their lives. Whether that's true or not, it's something the band's fans seem to long for — and they seem to believe the band's mere existence proves it's possible.

It's not a story I've heard that many times before.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For Mould, who emerged from indie rock the previous decade with Minneapolis' mighty Hüsker Dü, it was far from a typical gig. It was like, ‘So, Metallica bring washers and dryers out with them. Compared with his years in Hüsker Dü and the many decades after on his own, Sugar were a streaking comet in Mould's career: two albums and one EP in two years, then over and out. But within that compressed time, Sugar brought Mould, bassist David Barbe, and drummer Malcolm Travis as close to the mainstream as Mould would ever get. In addition to that Belgium festival, the band played others with headliners like the Cure, powering through sandblasters like “If I Can't Change Your Mind,” “JC Auto,” and “Your Favorite Thing,” which found a home on alt-rock radio. Now, 30 years after Sugar played their last show — and more than a dozen years after an attempted but abandoned reunion — the band has returned. The group teased something was in the works on social media last week and this week unveiled a newly recorded raver, “House of Dead Memories.” There are shows announced in London and New York, too, set for May 2026. Ironically, Sugar weren't even originally intended to be a band. Mould's first post-Hüskers album, Workbook, was critically lauded — “See a Little Light” was a college radio hit and found its way onto soundtracks — but the follow-up, the bleaker and tenser Black Sheets of Rain, received a more muted response. As they were rehearsing in Athens, Georgia, to make a Mould album, the trio were invited to play a one-off show at the 40 Watt Club there. Released in 1992, just after Nirvana's Nevermind and Pearl Jam's Ten messed with everyone's expectations of how rock could sound and sell, Sugar's debut, Copper Blue, was the right record at the right moment in the culture. “I was over in Europe in the summer of '91, playing a lot of festivals with Nirvana and Dinosaur Jr., and the table was getting set then for everything,” he says. While not quite Nevermind in terms of sales, Copper Blue introduced Mould and his raging voice and guitar to a raft of Lollapalooza-minded kids — who probably didn't know much about his previous band but loved Mould's razor-edged songs and the MTV-friendly videos that accompanied them. With Sugar's success, Mould was thrust into a world of big-league alt-rock he'd only slightly experienced before. “Whether I was in the office or doing press or writing and recording in the studio, I did not have a life beyond keeping that rocket in the sky for as long as I could. But when it's coming at you every day, that was sort of wild.” Hotline TNT's ‘Raspberry Moon' Is a Trip to Shoegaze Heaven 'This Is War': Bob Mould on Aging Indie, His Music's Legacy, and Where the U.S. Bob Mould Thrashes Toward Enlightenment on 'Here We Go Crazy' Late in 1994, Barbe told Mould he wanted to spend more time with his family, and the timing proved right for Sugar to wind down: A few months before, Kurt Cobain had killed himself. “Sugar were in Atlanta, working in the studio, and to see Kurt Loder pop up on the TV and say, ‘Kurt Cobain is dead,' it was pretty demoralizing. And I thought, ‘Wow, this business is sort of harsh. Sugar played one week of shows in Japan early in 1995 and called it a day, with Travis moving on to other bands and Barbe shifting to academia (he currently teaches music business at the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business). Sugar first resurfaced in 2011, as the 20th anniversary of Copper Blue approached. Mould, Barbe, and Travis got together and rehearsed for a possible reunion, but the musical vibe was not as inspiring as Mould had hoped. “I know a lot of people were doing it. So we got together and took a shot at it, and I think we all walked away thinking, ‘Eh, not right now.' Last fall, as he was working what would be his next record, Here We Go Crazy, Mould began to sense a surge of interest in his old band, from music business folks who sensed a market and BMG, which was planning a Copper Blue reissue and a Sugar singles collection. Mould and Barbe had toured together, playing separate sets, but a year ago, the trio reconvened once more, at Barbe's Athens, Georgia, studio to play the old material. “So we started looking at getting back together to do a few things.” When the band reformed 14 years ago, Mould had just written “House of Dead Memories,” which he never recorded but unearthed for Sugar's resurrection. Arriving next month is 1985: The Miracle Year, a collection of unreleased Hüsker Dü live recordings from that pivotal moment in the band's history. Centered around a tape of an entire set recorded at Minneapolis' First Avenue club in January of that year, and fleshed out with other recordings from 1985, the album captures the blistering roar, frenetic energy, and punchy songs that Mould, Greg Norton, and the late Grant Hart made (along with covers of Donovan's “Sunshine Superman,” the Beatles' “Ticket to Ride” and “Helter Skelter,” and “Love Is All Around,” the Mary Tyler Moore Show theme song). It's a sound that, decades later, still surprised Mould when he heard the restored tapes. “At that period, we were firing on so many cylinders at once that I never had a moment to stop and think. I didn't know how much fire we had, so to hear it close to 40 years later, I was like, ‘Jesus Christ, this is insane. As Mould has talked about and written about in his memoir See a Little Light, Hüsker Dü could be an insane experience unto itself, thanks to tension between Mould and Hart, but the time frame of the collection brought back largely positive memories. “Grant and I were in touch, but it was a complicated, complex situation. What ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story' Gets Right and Wrong Kevin Federline Worries 'Situation' With Britney Spears Is 'Racing Toward Something Irreversible' Bob Mould on the Reunion of Sugar: ‘I Want to See If People Are Still Interested' “Grant was always in charge of the art department, and it's been tough,” he says. “When a new designer comes along, I'm like, ‘Well, let me think about what Grant would have think of this.' But for me personally, it's always, ‘What would Grant do with this?' As far as Sugar, Mould says the response to their reunion announcement and “House of Dead Memories” will determine what to do beyond the two sets of concerts already set. “I don't want to get out too far in front of the skis, as they say,” he says. “People's reactions will probably guide a lot of the possibilities in front of us, whether it's more songs or more shows. I just want to see if people are still interested.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>
