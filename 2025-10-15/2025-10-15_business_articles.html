                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manufacturing is seeing renewed attention from corporate America, with Walmart among the major companies publicly reaffirming its commitment to domestic production. At CNBC's inaugural Invest in America Forum, Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said the company is increasing its investments in U.S.-made products and suppliers, describing it as part of a long-standing, strategic priority. "Investing in U.S. manufacturing and U.S. operations, sure, it's great for business, but it's also great for employment. It's great for the country, and it helps us with our supply chain being flexible and dynamic," Furner said. Nearly two-thirds of the products Walmart sells are made, grown or assembled in the United States, according to Furner. Walmart is expanding on that front, including a new beef processing facility in Olathe, Kansas, which he said is expected to create over 600 jobs. "It's a big investment, and having quality products that are sourced in a more sustainable way that can deliver to customers is really important," Furner said. Furner also pointed to specific categories where domestic production is being revived, citing a recent partnership with USAntibiotics aimed at "bringing back products like amoxicillin so that they're made here in the United States." Still, global sourcing remains essential for Walmart's operations. "We source from all around the world," Furner said. "There are things that are grown around the world that tend to do better in other climates, you know, coffee might be an example … I think there are a lot of possibilities." The heightened public focus on U.S. manufacturing comes amid trade policy uncertainty, with tariffs and interest rates remaining central to retailers' equation of how much inventory to stock and what to set prices at. "We've landed in a place where we have more rollbacks going into the fall than we had at the beginning of the year, and that's something we're proud of." Despite uncertain economic headwinds, Furner said Walmart is pushing to lower prices for consumers. "We see a resilient customer that makes really smart choices for what's right for them and their families at the time of shopping." We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla sounded the alarm Wednesday over the potential for the the U.S. to lose its competitive edge to China, but said artificial intelligence could help America maintain its lead. Speaking at CNBC's inaugural Invest in America Forum in Washington, D.C., the two executives said that while the U.S. still leads in many sectors, inconsistent policy and underinvestment is ceding ground to China. AI, they said, poses both risks and benefits for the U.S. economy. "We will likely have less people, absolutely," Scharf said. "When we look at the tools that we've implemented just for people that are coding, you see 20%, 30%, 40% improvement in coders. We haven't reduced our head count by 20%, 30% or 40%. Wells Fargo big bank peers like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are already hiring fewer people because of AI advancements. Scharf also said the financial sector is poised for major regulatory changes despite an ongoing political stalemate in Washington. "We do expect to see changes which will allow people in the industry, not just big banks and medium-sized banks, but smaller banks as well, to do more in these [local] communities." Bourla, meanwhile, expressed concern about China's growing strength in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, pointing to a surge in research and development spending, regulatory reforms and a national strategy focused on life sciences. "They [China] filed more patents this year than the U.S.," Bourla said. The gap is closing, but they probably will become [better than us] unless we get our act together." Bourla urged the U.S. to shift focus from trying to slow China's progress toward improving its own productivity and innovation. "We spend more time trying to think about how to slow down China rather than think how we can become better than them," Bourla said. "We need to have regulatory changes here. Tariffs and pricing was not helping." Pfizer recently agreed to a drug pricing deal with the Trump administration as part of a broader effort to remove long-standing uncertainties around pricing, Medicaid reimbursements and distribution. As part of the agreement, Pfizer secured a three-year exemption from pharmaceutical-specific tariffs, contingent on additional investments in U.S. manufacturing. "Tariffs and the uncertainty of drastic correction of U.S. pricing — with this deal, we are removing both uncertainties," Bourla said Wednesday. He also called artificial intelligence the next frontier for medicine, predicting that AI will revolutionize drug discovery by dramatically accelerating timelines for finding treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer. "We tried for years to find cures ... AI will make it happen," Bourla said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration, for now, from firing federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown. The order came five days after the administration issued reduction-in-force notifications to more than 4,000 federal workers. "The activities that are being undertaken here are contrary to the laws," San Francisco U.S. District Court Judge Susan Yvonne Illston told lawyers for the administration on Wednesday at a hearing where she issued the temporary restraining order. "You can't do this in a nation of laws," Illston said, according to NBC News. "And we have laws here, and the things that are being articulated here are not within the law." The judge cited comments by President Donald Trump and White House Budget Director Russell Vought that have indicated the workers were being laid off explicitly to target programs favored by Democrats. Two unions representing tens of thousands of federal workers had asked Illston to block the RIFs. The Trump administration had warned that it would lay off workers during the shutdown, and President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that the cuts were aimed at "Democrat agencies" or initiatives. Shortly before Illston issued her order blocking layoffs, White House Budget Director Russell Vought, during an interview on "The Charlie Kirk Show," said that he expected that "north of 10,000" federal jobs would be cut because of their shutdown. Illston said that the Trump administration took "advantage of the lapse in government spending and government functioning to assume that all bets are off, the laws don't apply to them anymore, and they can impose the structures that they like on the government situation that they don't like," according to NBC. "The president seems to think his government shutdown is distracting people from the harmful and lawlessness actions of his administration, but the American people are holding him accountable, including in the courts," said Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward. "The statements today by the court make clear that the President's targeting of federal workers — a move straight out of Project 2025's playbook — is unlawful," Perryman said. "Our civil servants do the work of the people, and playing games with their livelihoods is cruel and unlawful and a threat to everyone in our nation."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell on Wednesday asked the U.S. Office of Special Counsel to investigate Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for "likely" violating the Hatch Act by making a video to be shown in airports blaming Democrats for the government shutdown. The Hatch Act bars federal employees, including Cabinet secretaries, from engaging in political activity while acting in their official role. Multiple major airports have refused to show Noem's video near passenger screening lines, including Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in Cantwell's home state of Washington, as well as airports in Chicago and New York. A number of airports specifically mentioned the video's potential violation of the Hatch Act in their decision. The Office of Special Counsel is responsible for investigating potential Hatch Act violations. In a letter to acting Special Counsel Jamieson Greer, Cantwell called out Noem for "airing a partisan video message — on televisions in public airports across the country — in which she erroneously blames 'Democrats in Congress' for the current government shutdown's impact on airport 'operations' and for Transportation Security Administration ... employees 'working without pay.'" "This message is not just false; it appears to violate the prohibitions contained in the Hatch Act," wrote Cantwell, who is a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. Cantwell said recent reports indicate that DHS is using taxpayer dollars and federal assets to produce and air the video, in which Noem appears in her official capacity. "When viewed in its totality, Secretary Noem's video can only be reasonably interpreted as a partisan message intended to misleadingly malign the Trump Administration's political opponents, convince Americans to blame 'Democrats in Congress' for the ongoing government shutdown, and influence their future votes — all while omitting the fact that Republicans currently control the White House, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives," Cantwell wrote. "As the independent agency responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, I urge you to investigate this matter immediately," she wrote Greer. DHS didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Cantwell's letter. A spokesperson for Portland International Airport in Oregon told CNBC that the airport "did not consent to playing the video in its current form, as we believe the Hatch Act clearly prohibits use of public assets for political purposes and messaging."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration could slash more than 10,000 federal jobs during the government shutdown, White House budget director Russell Vought said Wednesday. "We now have an opportunity to do that, and that's where we're going to be looking for our opportunities," he said during an appearance on "The Charlie Kirk Show," which was broadcasting from the White House. Vought listed a number of government entities that could be targeted for cuts, including so-called Green New Deal programs at the Department of Energy and environmental justice efforts at the Environmental Protection Agency. He also pointed to the Commerce Department's Minority Business Development Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA. Vought also said he aims to close the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which he currently leads as acting director, within "the next two, three months." He said that the agency has "the DNA of [Democratic Sen.] Elizabeth Warren," and that it has tried to "weaponize" the law against small financial institutions. The Trump administration has warned that the shutdown, which has now stretched into its third week with no end in sight, will lead to mass firings of federal workers. The White House said it sent layoff announcements, known as reduction-in-force notices or RIFs, to around 4,200 federal employees on Friday. That number was revised slightly downward on Tuesday. But Vought, in Wednesday's talk show appearance, said he expects the number of RIFs to grow. "I think we'll probably end up being north of 10,000." The White House has shared its rolling RIF estimates in court documents as part of a federal lawsuit filed by unions representing government workers who are challenging the Trump administration's cuts. In a hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Susan Illston issued a temporary restraining order blocking the firings for now. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. "I think it'll get much higher, and we're going to keep those RIFs rolling throughout this shutdown, because we think it's important," he said. Government employees who are furloughed during the shutdown, as well as those deemed "excepted" who are still required to work, are going without pay while the lapse in federal funds drags on. President Donald Trump on Wednesday afternoon issued a presidential memorandum directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to use any remaining congressional funds to continue to pay active-duty military personnel.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>General Motors' announcement on Tuesday that its upcoming quarterly results will include a $1.6 billion charge from its electric vehicle investments is the latest in a string of troubling EV-related disclosures from big automakers. Ford CEO Jim Farley said late last month that he expects demand for fully electric vehicles to be slashed in half following the end of a federal tax credit program. His prediction came after Stellantis, the parent company of auto brands including Chrysler and Jeep, said it was scrapping its target of producing nothing but electric vehicles in Europe by 2030, and backed off ambitious targets for the U.S., notably for Chrysler. The industry, which was already facing hurdles imposed by the Trump administration, faces a hefty dose of uncertainty now that consumers can no longer take advantage of $7,500 tax credits for purchasing EVs. As automakers reset investor expectations, one name has been notably absent from the conversation: Tesla. Tesla is slated to report third-quarter results next week, and Wall Street will be eager to hear what kind of demand the company expects with the credits no longer available. Steve Greenfield, general partner at investment firm Automotive Ventures, said the retreat of legacy automakers from the segment could be good news for Tesla as its market share may start to rebound. He said in an email that the company has "very strong brand loyalty." "Chances are, most Tesla buyers will continue to stay in the brand, as they buy their next new car," Greenfield said. As the year ends, Tesla will likely face a "double whammy," Greenfield said, from reduced BEV sales and lower margins on the cars they do sell. Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment. Analysts are projecting a revenue drop in the fourth quarter and a 3.5% slide for all of 2025, which would mark the first full-year decline on record. Earlier this month, Tesla reported a 7% year-over-year increase in quarterly vehicle deliveries for the third quarter. That marked a turnaround after two consecutive quarterly declines to start the year. "It's not just a retreat of everybody else, and Tesla gets to run away with the market," said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at Alix Partners, in an interview. Consumer demand for fully electric vehicles had "already kind of flatlined a bit" even before the Republican spending bill, Wakefield added. Car buyers have been looking for a "breakthrough moment" where EVs would become cost competitive with hybrid or gas-powered models. Wakefield added that "this market needs a sense of newness," and that the new, lower-priced Model Y and Model 3 options are not exactly "earth shattering." Robbie Orvis, a senior director at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate policy think tank, told CNBC the automakers' writedowns were expected and stem entirely from policy changes beyond just the tax credits. The Trump White House has also "revoked California's waiver to set its own vehicle standards, revoked billions in funding for EV chargers and for auto plants to retool to build EVs, and is in the process of undoing vehicle tailpipe standards that would encourage the adoption of EVs," Orvis said. Tesla is experiencing its share of that pain, and it's showing up most acutely in international markets. "Chinese automakers are rapidly displacing U.S. automakers in foreign markets as they are able to offer cheaper, higher-quality new cars, particularly EVs, in markets where there is large and growing demand for these cars," Orvis said. Musk, meanwhile, continues to try and focus investor attention elsewhere. He insists the future of the company hinges on robotaxis and humanoid robotics, two markets that Tesla has yet to meaningfully crack. Musk said in March that Tesla aimed to make 5,000 of its Optimus robots this year, but key departures from the group have thrown that plan into question. In September, Musk wrote on X that "~80% of Tesla's value will be Optimus." Last year, he predicted that Optimus robots would someday turn Tesla into a $25 trillion company, which was equal to more than half of the entire value of the S&P 500 at the time of his comment. It's a story that's compelling enough for some longtime Tesla bulls and Musk fanboys.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bunge Global jumped more than 11% on Wednesday on the back of the Trump administration's threat to cut off U.S. purchases of Chinese cooking oil. The stock's year to date gains are roughly 18%. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the U.S. is considering "terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil" as a retaliatory action against Beijing's refusal to buy U.S. soybeans. The country has instead been buying the crop from Argentina and Brazil due to Trump's high tariff rates on China. Trump's threat to China comes after China's used cooking oil exports surged to record highs last year, with the U.S. accounting for 43% of the total export number. Trade tensions between China and the U.S. have escalated in recent days. Late last week, President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports. That came after China placed new export controls on rare earth minerals. China this week then moved to tighten its grip in the global shipping space by sanctioning five U.S. subsidiaries from South Korea's Hanwha Group. Bunge earlier Wednesday also gave a full-year forecast that reflects its merger with grain and oilseeds processor Viterra. The company said it expects to earn $7.30 to $7.60 per share, excluding items, while analysts polled by FactSet expected $7.39 per share. Still, that appeared to be better than many investors feared. Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland, another large American oilseed processor, also rose 1.5% after Trump's threat. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Harvey, a startup building artificial intelligence tools for lawyers, is taking that creed to college campuses. In August, Harvey said it would give six law schools access to the platform as part of a new "alliance." The next month, it onboarded 11 more law schools. "What we're trying to do is make it so they can start integrating that into their training as early as possible," Winston Weinberg, Harvey's cofounder and chief executive, said from a conference room in the company's Manhattan office. The simulations he describes aren't live yet. For decades, LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters, which both supply case law to legal professionals, blanketed law schools with free or nearly free access. Students spend years getting fluent in one system and then carry that muscle memory into practice. Inside firms, Weinberg says Harvey is stripping the drudgery from legal work, and clients are starting to notice. He compares it to the advent of email. "The biggest change it made," he said, is that "you've got to respond way faster." Weinberg thinks that Harvey's efficiency gains will prompt firms to move more work off the billable hour and onto flat-fee menus to protect their profits. Weinberg said law firms could also pass along the cost of using Harvey and other tools to their clients, a familiar move in the legal world. Many firms already include a line item on their invoices for research databases, such as LexisNexis or Westlaw, showing how many queries a matter requires. The caveat is that uptake today skews towards the big corporates and law firms, and even there, Harvey is still seen as an efficiency booster, not a requirement for practice. They've long run on enterprise tools like Lexis and Westlaw. Where they diverge is on policies around generative artificial intelligence. A few are weaving it into clinics and practice labs. Notably, the list of Harvey's launch partners was missing a few giants, Yale and Harvard among them. Company lore says the name "Harvey" is partly a nod to Harvard. He argues law schools can do far more to prepare students for the realities of practice. He has no quarrel with the traditional first-year curriculum. "I think where things actually break down," he said, "is that there is almost no hands-on stuff in the second and third year." But, in his view, a three-year legal education should more closely resemble the workplace. Harvey aims to help fix that, though its law school partnership remains light on details. If Harvey can get a foothold in law schools now, the payoff could arrive when today's second-year lawyers become tomorrow's associates and in-house counsel.</p>

Six AI startups are part of Jensen Huang's vision for human-digital workforces. Huang's wide-ranging list included OpenAI, which makes large language models, legal tech darling Harvey, and AI healthcare tool OpenEvidence. In his Citadel talk, Huang specifically highlighted Anysphere-owned Cursor. He said that 100% of Nvidia's software engineers and chip designers use Cursor. "We now have AIs for all of our engineers," he said. "Productivity gains, the work that we do is so much better." In June, Business Insider reported that Amazon was in talks with Cursor to adopt the AI coding tool internally after employees demanded it. Huang has long said that AI and "biological" employees will work together in the future. In Huang's January keynote at CES, one of the world's largest tech trade shows, he proclaimed, "The age of agentic AI is here." In a podcast last October, Huang explained how the human and AI employees would work together. He described a future where the technology giant would mass-deploy AI assistants, also called agents, across every division to improve output. Late last month, General Catalyst's CEO Hemant Taneja said that true AI integration has four non-negotiables, and one of them is planning for how humans and AI will work together. Some AI agents are going to manage humans," he said on a podcast appearance.</p>

Cathie Wood says Wall Street is overlooking AI's biggest payoff. She added that combining AI with advances in gene sequencing and CRISPR technology — a technology scientists use to selectively modify the DNA of living organisms — could spark a medical transformation. Wood said that five major technologies — AI, robotics, energy storage, blockchain, and genomics — are each entering their steep growth phase. That convergence is why healthcare could deliver massive gains for investors willing to bet early, Wood said. Smarter algorithms make gene sequencing faster; cheaper sequencing gives AI more data to learn from; and breakthroughs in gene editing can open the door to new treatments. Wood also said some of the so-called "MAG 6" tech giants — Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet — could see slower growth in the next five years. "That was a very difficult time for innovation for venture capital generally," Wood said, referring to the years when investors stuck with Big Tech. "Now we think it is truly disruptive innovation's time to shine in the market," she added. Wood did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Her firm managed over $13 billion in May, according to its most recent filing. AI is quickly reshaping the healthcare industry, and tech's biggest players are racing to stake their claims. Microsoft has been integrating AI into its cloud solutions to automate hospital operations. The company has notched a number of medical imaging partnerships powered by its AI platforms, most recently with GE Healthcare in March. Founders told Business Insider in July that AI could be the breakthrough that helps clinicians multiply their caseloads and earn extra cash without sacrificing care quality.</p>

When they first got together, he earned slightly more than she did, and the difference didn't bother either of them. After a series of promotions over 18 months, her salary tripled — and then he couldn't deal, Dhatt says. He insisted on splitting costs 50-50, leaving her with a disposable income that she wanted to spend on nice things but felt like she couldn't. When she proposed booking a luxury vacation for the two of them, for example, he insisted they go on a cheaper trip and divide the cost. Dhatt's financial success soon exposed a tension that many couples face today: What happens when she earns more than him? "When our relationship finally ended, he told me as he left that I have nothing to worry about because of my salary," she adds, which to her revealed how money was "a bigger factor" in their relationship than he'd previously admitted. Divorce rates in heterosexual couples rise significantly when a woman is more professionally successful than the man, be that in terms of fame or, more commonly, money. Perhaps even more strikingly, studies also show that the marriages most likely to endure are those that most closely fit the traditional pattern of male breadwinner and female homemaker. A 2023 report from the Institute for Family Studies found that couples in which husbands earn more than their wives have the lowest chance of divorce, and that when a man earns upwards of $38,000-a-year more than his wife, the chances of divorce are lowest. Despite recent leaps in progress toward gender equality both in the home and in the workplace, marital inequality might be the last vexing barrier to our ongoing quest for true gender parity. No doubt one of today's highest profile wage-gap relationships with a female breadwinner is Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. When the pair announced their engagement in August, Lyz Lenz, a New York Times bestselling author of a memoir about her own divorce, cut through the internet's euphoria by offering some sobering stats and reflections on her own experience. "The image they are projecting to us is that a successful woman has found a supportive partner, one who eagerly fawns over her new album cover while interviewing her for his own podcast," she wrote on her Substack. Lenz noted that women who succeed as Swift has "are often punished for it" and that she herself has been forced to pay the price of being professionally and economically ambitious. A similar pattern follows in the public sector: Women who are elected to positions like mayor or parliamentarian double the chances of their marriages falling apart. A 2023 study from Australia, for example, found that women who earn more than their male partners are also significantly more likely to be physically and emotionally abused by that partner. "When women's income exceeds that of their partners," the authors write, "the violation of a gender norm creates a strong negative effect." Scant research is available on the correlation between divorce rates and income inequality in same-sex marriages, but one paper from 2014 found that in those couples bigger earnings gaps also translate to a higher likelihood of a break-up. More than a dozen women I spoke to for this story told me that money significantly shaped their relationship or marriage. And of the women who earned more than their male spouses, the majority said that this had a detrimental impact on their relationship. Sukhy Desangh, a 41-year old management consultant, tells me she was earning more than five times what her ex-fiancé earned. He was humiliated by her being the primary earner in their household, she says. "When we were out for dinner with friends and family, he would message me to say, 'Give me your credit card and I'll pay with it.'" Several other women said that their partners felt "emasculated" by being out-earned. Two women who asked not to be named said that they felt like their ex-husbands became depressed as a result of not being the primary financial provider. "Money wasn't the only reason me and my ex broke up," says Ali, a 34-year old who works in financial services, "but it was a topic of conversation and there were many times he said he wouldn't be able to be with someone long-term who earns more than him. Women now hold more managerial positions than ever, and they bring home the bulk of household income in more families than ever. Dené Logan, a marriage and family therapist based in Los Angeles, says that for one, gender norms are set in childhood. "Men are handed a very specific template early in life: protect, provide, procreate — and their worth is tied to it," she says. With that mindset deeply ingrained, Logan adds, when a woman in a heterosexual marriage is financially and professionally successful, it can "trigger resentment" within the man — whether he knows it or not. Because of these long-standing constructs, men's sense of mission and meaning is still frequently tied up in work and money. Muriel Wilkins, an executive coach and CEO of a leadership advisory firm, agrees. "What's really happening here is a clash between progress and old expectations," she says. "Cultural norms are very sticky," says Ramit Sethi, a bestselling author and podcast host. For example, he notes, even though women in urban cities out-earn men in their 20s, dating norms about who picks up the check have been glacially slow to change. Many of the women I spoke to also said that fault lines in marriages and relationships that were initially caused by money were exacerbated by the fact that men who weren't getting paid as much were also not shouldering as much of the unpaid labor in the home. A Pew study from 2023 found that women in the US still consistently pick up more household chores and caregiving responsibilities. In those situations, wives and husbands spent roughly the same amount of time per week on household chores. "It felt like a double whammy," one woman says of her husband, who was laid off shortly after they got married. "He wasn't working, which made him angry and resentful, but then he refused to do almost anything around the house while I was earning for the both of us. "If that's not a recipe for disaster, then I don't know what is." There are, of course, exceptions to the female breadwinner trend. Brian Tan and his wife, who live in New York, have been married for two years and in a relationship for eight. After that, he switched employers and took a job which paid about double her salary. But since then, he's started working for a children's hospital and she's moved into tech. "The first is that I view it as one big pool of money. The second is that this is a pendulum that swings both ways — there was a period where I made more, then we made the same amount, then she makes more now," says Tan. "A third reason is that I'm truly proud of her, and to be genuinely proud of someone, all feelings of jealousy disappear from one's mindset; I want her to feel fulfilled and intellectually stimulated, and the fact that she gets paid a lot while doing her job is a win-win for me." One woman based in the UK who asked not to be named tells me that she has four sisters. The key to success, she said, is being open and communicating, especially when conflicts arise. Natasha, a 37-year old marketing executive, says that her family is very traditional in terms of gender norms. By earning double what her husband earns, she sometimes feels like she's simultaneously living both outside of traditional gender norms and inside of them — "a sort of double existence that can feel stressful," she says. But crucially, she's been happily married to her husband for seven years — they just had a baby. The pay differential doesn't bother him, she says. "I think that's evidence of his maturity and confidence." Another woman told me that when she first met the man who became her husband, she was earning "a thousand times" more than him. They've now been together for a decade, and she's still earning about 40 percent more than him. And he agrees: "Unless it's a problem for my wife, I'm secure enough in myself and in our relationship for it to not even be a consideration." William Conrad and his girlfriend Levi Coralynn, who are both in their 20s, have garnered an enormous social media following — he has about 1.3 million TikTok followers, she about 2.3 million— for publicly and performatively living out an atypical heterosexual relationship. Muriel Wilkins said that she does think things will eventually change, especially as Gen Zers like Conrad and Coralynn are questioning and pushing back against outdated norms. But it will take time, she said, and progress will only materialize if individual couples are prepared to confront these outdated norms head-on. "They need to redefine what success looks like in their marriage. Dené Logan put it more bluntly: "Your husband is not the patriarchy." And recognizing that distinction is key to avoiding misplaced resentment. It will come, says Wilkins, "when we stop treating money as the measure of power in a marriage, and start seeing partnership as a balance of respect, care, and shared responsibility." Equality doesn't necessarily mean sameness, says Logan, it means rewriting the story of marriage for a new era.

In a world glued to screens, Aziz Ansari is choosing the analog life. During an appearance on Tuesday's episode of the "Good Hang with Amy Poehler" podcast, the comedian spoke about his Luddite ways and why he isn't a fan of ChatGPT. I haven't had email for, like, 10 years. But I have an assistant," Ansari told podcast host Amy Poehler. And it's not just his inbox that he's abandoned. If I get really lost, I've got to either ask people or just call my wife and be like 'Hey.' Living a low-tech lifestyle has its benefits, Ansari said. "It just gives me more space to think. I was like, 'Whoa, those guys are able to get a lot of stuff done. The comedian says he is also wary of ChatGPT. It's making everyone's opinions kind of the same," Ansari said. Not only is AI prone to making mistakes, it reinforces what people already think, he added. The comedian said he once saw a commercial in which someone asked ChatGPT how to make dinner for a date. Speaking to People in September, Ansari said he knows that his ability to live offline comes with a certain level of privilege and isn't realistic for everyone. A representative for Ansari did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours. Ansari isn't the only celebrity who has spoken about preferring an analog lifestyle. In July 2023, Christopher Nolan said he doesn't carry a smartphone or use email. "If I'm generating my material and writing my own scripts, being on a smartphone all day wouldn't be very useful for me," Nolan told The Hollywood Reporter. "So I never did get into getting involved in all that because it'll take up too much of my time if I talked to everybody who is trying to get in touch with me," Parton said. In January, Christopher Walken told The Wall Street Journal that his relationship with technology is nearly nonexistent. "I only have a satellite dish on my house. So I've seen 'Severance' on DVDs that they're good enough to send me. I've never emailed or, what do you call it, Twittered," Walken said. It's not just Hollywood: In a May story, regular people told Business Insider that they swapped smartphones for dumb phones to wean themselves off their screens and social media. Some Gen Zs are even chaining their smartphones to a wall — creating a makeshift landline —and freeing themselves from the urge to scroll.</p>

Former Ford CEO Mark Fields said on Tuesday that US automakers overestimated consumer demand when they started ramping up production of electric vehicles. "Over the last couple of years, the automakers really went full bore in putting in capacity for EVs," Fields, 64, told CNBC's "Power Lunch." Fields started his career at Ford in 1989 after graduating with an MBA from Harvard Business School. He held a variety of senior leadership positions at Ford, and was the company's chief operating officer from 2012 to 2014 and its CEO from 2014 to 2017. Some of the big bets automakers made on EVs have come undone "over the last 18 months or so," Fields told CNBC. General Motors said in an exchange filing on Tuesday that it was taking a $1.6 billion charge "based on a planned strategic realignment of our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint to consumer demand." A lot of them, particularly in GM's case, boasted that they had the full lineup of EVs," Fields said on Tuesday. "And what was an advantage, at least they thought at the time, has now probably turned into a bit of an albatross as the market take-up of EVs is going to be lower, at least in the near to medium term, than they plan for," he continued. "I think it's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought," Farley said on September 30. McNeill said in an interview with CNBC on October 2 that the market can continue to "grow without subsidies." "In Europe, France and Germany in particular rolled subsidies off a couple of years ago, and what happened after that, surprisingly, was the market continued to grow," McNeill said. "That's largely because the models continue to roll out from other OEMs, much like they have here," McNeill added, using the acronym for original equipment manufacturers.</p>

A federal jury is set to hear opening statements in Manhattan on Tuesday in the fraud and conspiracy trial of two MIT-educated brothers accused in a lightning-fast, $25 million cryptocurrency heist. The daylong jury selection on Monday resulted in a four-woman, eight-man panel consisting entirely of individuals with college degrees. The openings promise to describe a complex, multi-step transaction on the Ethereum blockchain that left the brothers $25 million richer, while a trio of traders were left holding a pile of worthless, illiquid junk crypto. Prosecutors say the "first-of-its-kind" fraud scheme took months of meticulous planning and was executed in just 12 seconds on a day in April 2023. Before and after the alleged exploit, prosecutors say, the brothers typed in internet searches that included: "how to wash crypto," "top crypto lawyers," "fraudulent Ethereum addresses database," and "money laundering statue [sic] of limitations." Their defense attorneys have argued that there was no fraud at all and that they merely outsmarted some "predatory" automated trading bots. In a blow to the defense last week, US District Judge Jessica G. L. Clarke barred the Peraire-Bueno's lawyers from arguing, as she put it, "that the victims deserved this." The trial is expected to last into early November.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I chose to study computer science and information engineering in college because I didn't like interacting with people. Programming seemed perfect: I could spend all day on a computer, coding and debugging. At the time, I was happy with this choice and imagined my future would follow that path. If I became an engineer right away, the pressure on my eyes would be even greater. So my plan was simple: work somewhere else for two or three years, let my eyes recover, and then return to writing code. That's how I ended up at a café. But my boss and coworkers encouraged me to try it. So, I started studying sensory skills and how to communicate flavors. That was how I became absorbed in coffee. I worked as a barista at that café for 10 years. Outside of work, I was still involved in coffee — going to tastings, events, and classes. At first, I thought coffee was straightforward — as long as I could brew drinks that customers enjoyed and my coworkers liked, it felt like I had already learned everything there was to learn. But once I started going out and experiencing more, I realized coffee is something you can never fully master. It was partly why I left the café to join a coffee trading firm. I had met the boss in a coffee course, and he asked years later if I wanted to try working there. It is a whole supply chain — farmers, importers, roasters — and I wanted to learn more. I'm now in my third year as a quality control specialist. But upstream, the needs are different: evaluating beans, checking consistency, and thinking about market demand. When I moved, my salary dropped from nearly 50,000 Taiwan dollars a month, about $1,600, to about 35,000 Taiwan dollars. This job has broadened my perspective on the coffee supply chain. In my fourth month, I earned the internationally recognized Arabica Q Grader certification. I used to avoid human interaction, but being a barista meant I had to understand customers, chat, and connect with them. But over time, I developed ways to interact more comfortably, learned to listen, and sense how people were feeling. The nonprofit is located in a military village, and some elderly residents would come early, wait for me, and smile when I arrived. Sometimes, they stayed in the café and told me their life stories and memories, many from Taiwan's martial law years or the Japanese colonial era. This is one of coffee's meanings: It gives people a chance to gather and share their stories. Some of my engineering friends have told me they envy me for turning my interest into a job — until the topic of salary comes up, because their salaries can be two to three times mine. At this stage of life — from your twenties into your early thirties — many people are buying cars and houses. Now, I live with my parents in New Taipei City and share a mortgage with my sister for our family home. I pay about 15,000 Taiwan dollars a month toward it. To manage, I spend less on recreation, like traveling once every three or four years. Since coffee is also my hobby, most of my discretionary spending goes to coffee courses or activities. I can usually save 10,000 to 15,000 Taiwan dollars a month. I also look for ways to increase my income through side hustles, such as judging coffee competitions and teaching courses. Some people choose high-paying jobs and use their salaries to fund hobbies. Others, like me, turned their passion into work, even with less money. The first step is to imagine the kind of life you want, and then decide if your passion is strong enough to carry you there.</p>
