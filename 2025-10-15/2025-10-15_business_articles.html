                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration, for now, from firing federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown. The order came five days after the administration issued reduction-in-force notifications to more than 4,000 federal workers. "The activities that are being undertaken here are contrary to the laws," San Francisco U.S. District Court Judge Susan Yvonne Illston told lawyers for the administration on Wednesday at a hearing where she issued the temporary restraining order. "You can't do this in a nation of laws," Illston said, according to NBC News. "And we have laws here, and the things that are being articulated here are not within the law." The judge cited comments by President Donald Trump and White House Budget Director Russell Vought that have indicated the workers were being laid off explicitly to target programs favored by Democrats. Two unions representing tens of thousands of federal workers had asked Illston to block the RIFs. The Trump administration had warned that it would lay off workers during the shutdown, and President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that the cuts were aimed at "Democrat agencies" or initiatives. Shortly before Illston issued her order blocking layoffs, White House Budget Director Russell Vought, during an interview on "The Charlie Kirk Show," said that he expected that "north of 10,000" federal jobs would be cut because of their shutdown. Illston said that the Trump administration took "advantage of the lapse in government spending and government functioning to assume that all bets are off, the laws don't apply to them anymore, and they can impose the structures that they like on the government situation that they don't like," according to NBC. "The president seems to think his government shutdown is distracting people from the harmful and lawlessness actions of his administration, but the American people are holding him accountable, including in the courts," said Skye Perryman, CEO of  Democracy Forward. "The statements today by the court make clear that the President's targeting of federal workers — a move straight out of Project 2025's playbook — is unlawful," Perryman said. "Our civil servants do the work of the people, and playing games with their livelihoods is cruel and unlawful and a threat to everyone in our nation."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration could slash more than 10,000 federal jobs during the government shutdown, White House budget director Russell Vought said Wednesday. "We now have an opportunity to do that, and that's where we're going to be looking for our opportunities," he said during an appearance on "The Charlie Kirk Show," which was broadcasting from the White House. Vought listed a number of government entities that could be targeted for cuts, including so-called Green New Deal programs at the Department of Energy and environmental justice efforts at the Environmental Protection Agency. He also pointed to the Commerce Department's Minority Business Development Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA. Vought also said he aims to close the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which he currently leads as acting director, within "the next two, three months." He said that the agency has "the DNA of [Democratic Sen.] Elizabeth Warren," and that it has tried to "weaponize" the law against small financial institutions. The Trump administration has warned that the shutdown, which has now stretched into its third week with no end in sight, will lead to mass firings of federal workers. The White House said it sent layoff announcements, known as reduction-in-force notices or RIFs, to around 4,200 federal employees on Friday. That number was revised slightly downward on Tuesday. But Vought, in Wednesday's talk show appearance, said he expects the number of RIFs to grow. "I think we'll probably end up being north of 10,000." The White House has shared its rolling RIF estimates in court documents as part of a federal lawsuit filed by unions representing government workers who are challenging the Trump administration's cuts. In a hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Susan Illston issued a temporary restraining order blocking the firings for now. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. "I think it'll get much higher, and we're going to keep those RIFs rolling throughout this shutdown, because we think it's important," he said. Government employees who are furloughed during the shutdown, as well as those deemed "excepted" who are still required to work, are going without pay while the lapse in federal funds drags on. President Donald Trump on Wednesday afternoon issued a presidential memorandum directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to use any remaining congressional funds to continue to pay active-duty military personnel.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bunge Global jumped more than 11% on Wednesday on the back of the Trump administration's threat to cut off U.S. purchases of Chinese cooking oil. The stock's year to date gains are roughly 18%. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the U.S. is considering "terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil" as a retaliatory action against Beijing's refusal to buy U.S. soybeans. The country has instead been buying the crop from Argentina and Brazil due to Trump's high tariff rates on China. Trump's threat to China comes after China's used cooking oil exports surged to record highs last year, with the U.S. accounting for 43% of the total export number. Trade tensions between China and the U.S. have escalated in recent days. Late last week, President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports. That came after China placed new export controls on rare earth minerals. China this week then moved to tighten its grip in the global shipping space by sanctioning five U.S. subsidiaries from South Korea's Hanwha Group. Bunge earlier Wednesday also gave a full-year forecast that reflects its merger with grain and oilseeds processor Viterra. The company said it expects to earn $7.30 to $7.60 per share, excluding items, while analysts polled by FactSet expected $7.39 per share. Still, that appeared to be better than many investors feared. Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland, another large American oilseed processor, also rose 1.5% after Trump's threat. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Walmart is deploying millions of ambient Internet of Things battery-free sensors throughout its massive supply chain in the U.S. It's an evolution of legacy IoT and radio frequency identification technologies that promise lower costs and high scalability. The company will now have real-time insights into inventory management, knowing exactly where merchandise is located and whether it's owned by the retailer, at any moment, and covering an estimated 90 million pallets of inventory when at full scale. The ambient IoT sensors Walmart uses capture signals about temperature, location, humidity, and dwell time. These signals are linked with the company's advanced artificial intelligence systems, enabling the company to dramatically improve supply chain efficiency, inventory accuracy, and cold chain compliance. "We expect to be active in about 500 Walmart locations by the end of the year, with plans for national expansion in 2026," said Greg Cathey, senior vice president of transformation and innovation at Walmart. The rollout will cover 4,600 Walmart Supercenters, Neighborhood Markets, and more than 40 distribution centers, generating high-resolution supply chain data that feeds into Walmart's AI systems, he said. "This data provides proof of delivery, improves replenishment decisions, and lets us know where our items are in real time," Cathey said. "By combining continuous sensing with AI, we're moving from probabilistic predictions to precision decision-making." What makes the addition of ambient IoT sensors significant is it provides a new stream of data into AI systems, enabling them to be even more effective in giving Walmart greater visibility into supply chain operations. The technology initiative is already making a significant impact by eliminating some manual tasks and providing automated alerts, Cathey said. "Automated alerts now flag this information in real time, allowing associates to act faster and dedicate more time to serving customers." The enhanced visibility into the supply chain is also helping to resolve inventory discrepancies, allowing improved customer experiences. While Cathey did not disclose specific figures such as cost savings, Walmart is anticipating gains from higher supply chain efficiency, improved inventory accuracy, reduced manual tasks for associates, and the ability to get items on shelves more quickly. "Customers [will] benefit from better product availability and consistency," he said. "AI system performance is predicated on its training data. "Supply chain AI has long been fueled by inherently out-of-date data — or forecasted data that represents projections rather than reality." Ambient IoT is changing this model, Bellanger said, by fueling AI with data that reflects what's actually happening throughout the supply chain. "We have been here before; Walmart was an early adopter of RFID back in 2004 when it was supposed to provide much the same functionality," said Bill Ray, distinguished vice president, analyst and chief of research at research firm Gartner. Ray says it's important to note that the value of such IoT systems is already known. "The business models have been well studied and evaluated, when RFID was first touted as the solution to supply chain problems," he said. Gartner has been tracking Wiliot for a long time. The question was if Wiliot could reliably scale production without compromising tag performance or price, and if it could integrate with existing supply chain systems. This announcement tells us that Walmart is convinced it can, now Wiliot will have to prove it," Ray said. It lets our associates do what they do, and they can focus on doing their jobs safely and efficiently while providing continuous, real-time visibility into our supply chain." Ambient IoT got a boost earlier this year when a new business alliance was created to develop and promote an open, multi-standard ecosystem for ambient IoT manufacturers, suppliers, integrators, operators, users, and customers, based on next-generation, battery-free ambient IoT standards. By focusing on advanced communication technologies, the alliance is seeking to overcome the limitations of traditional battery-powered IoT devices, promoting more sustainable and efficient products.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Drugmaker Novo Nordisk has begun a round of layoffs in its most important market, the United States, with affected staff set to be notified between this week and next, according to an email and two sources familiar with the matter. The move comes as the Danish company behind popular weight-loss drug Wegovy looks to cut jobs globally and reduce costs in a battle with U.S. rival Eli Lilly. U.S. layoffs began on Tuesday and will continue until late next week, according to a schedule in the email. They come after an acceleration of job cuts in Novo's home market, Denmark, where it plans to eliminate 5,000 positions. Departments expected to be informed of cuts include human resources, clinical development, rare diseases, medical and regulatory, legal, ethics and compliance, marketing and sales, finance, public affairs and others, the schedule showed. Reuters was unable to confirm how many people would be affected. Novo is looking to shed 9,000 roles globally in a restructuring drive under new CEO Mike Doustdar, who took office in August. Novo did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but has said previously that the global process would take time and its "highest priority is to support our employees". The layoffs come as Doustdar tries to restore investor confidence with what he calls a tighter focus on commercial execution and on the obesity and diabetes therapeutic areas. Doustdar took the helm after a sliding share price and slowing Wegovy sales growth led to the ouster of long-time CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen. Novo's shares are up around 6% since the restructuring was announced on September 10. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock and Elon Musk's xAI are part of a consortium of investors that has agreed to purchase Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion, the companies announced Wednesday. MGX of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners and members of Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership, or AIP, will acquire 100% of the company's equity, in what will be the largest global data center deal to date, according to a release. AIP was created by BlackRock, MGX, Microsoft and Nvidia in September 2024 to accelerate investment in AI infrastructure. The Kuwait Investment Authority, xAI and Temasek have joined as additional participants. The Aligned deal marks AIP's first investment and is a step toward the group's goal of deploying $30 billion of equity capital. "With this investment in Aligned Data Centers, we further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI, while offering our clients attractive opportunities to participate in its growth," Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock and Chairman of AIP, said in a statement. AI companies have been racing to build out the infrastructure they believe they will need to meet growing demand for the technology. Data centers are the large facilities that house the hardware and equipment needed to run big AI workloads and train models. The Aligned transaction is expected to close late next year, and it is still subject to regulatory approvals and other standard closing conditions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I've spent the past two years interviewing and studying more than 60 couples and the ways they come into these conflicts. I've learned that love has little to do with it. You can love each other deeply and still allow money to erode your relationship if you're talking about the wrong issues, or not talking about them at all. People often focus on the problems right in front of them: missing a bill payment or spending over the monthly budget. But these smaller transgressions can be a symptom of a bigger issue you and your partner haven't identified yet. The happiest couples don't let these money mistakes ruin their relationship: Long ago, you and your partner may have decided to do something one way, and you've been doing it that way ever since. A good example is splitting your expenses down the middle and having separate bank accounts. But circumstances have changed, and maybe one of you earns more money, or you're having kids, and the logistics of this setup are more complicated than helpful. My advice is don't approach your partner about making big changes during a heated conflict. You don't need to make a dramatic change overnight. Instead, use incremental steps to work toward a positive shared goal. But the story you tell yourself about a situation might be completely different from someone else's. You might see your student loan debt as a challenge to overcome, while I see mine as my biggest financial regret. Shame, whether from the past or present, can trap someone into a cycle of fear and guilt. It clouds judgment and stalls progress, especially in a partnership. It might even convince someone they don't deserve a good life. As a partner, you can't wipe their shame away. Only then can you tailor your support to help them heal. Not every poor financial outcome is the result of a mistake. Sometimes, you take a step in the wrong direction. For example, holding credit card debt, even for a short time, is a frequent source of regret, even if it was necessary in the moment. Failing to let go of your partner's setbacks can damage their self-worth and confidence. The result can cause them to believe they aren't good with money, or even worse, that they don't deserve to have a say in financial decisions. But above all, never be the one to make your partner feel shame over money. Be their support and let them grow from it. Having a "never enough" mindset goes beyond money or careers. It's fueled by constant comparison, especially on social media. Set aside time to talk about your real priorities and set those as your benchmarks of contentment, not the idealized version of success you see on social media. And if you really don't feel free to spend money in your relationship, that's a conversation worth having. Rather than setting rigid spending rules (or even worse, "allowances") that fail to account for each person's household responsibilities, set a check-in number that you're both comfortable with. Strong couples know that handling money together is about values, trust, and communication. If you commit to facing the real issues together, even tough times can become building blocks for a better relationship.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration will set price floors across a range of industries to combat market manipulation by China, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC in an exclusive interview Wednesday. China has driven foreign competitors in the rare earth industry out of business over the past two decades by using its global dominance in refining and processing to slash prices, Bessent said. "When you are facing a nonmarket economy like China, then you have to exercise industrial policy," Bessent told Sara Eisen at CNBC's Invest in America Forum in Washington, D.C. "So we're going to set price floors and the forward buying to make sure that this doesn't happen again and we're going to do it across a range of industries," the Treasury secretary said, without naming specific industries the administration was looking at beyond rare earths. The U.S. also needs to set up a strategic mineral reserve, Bessent said. JPMorgan Chase is interested in working with the Trump administration to create such a reserve, he said. Rare earth magnets are also essential for civilian commercial applications like electric vehicles. The Trump administration has been working to stand up a domestic rare earth supply chain. The Department of Defense struck an unprecedented deal in July with MP Materials, the largest U.S. rare earth miner, that included an equity stake, a price floor and offtake agreement. China last week announced sweeping new restrictions on rare earth exports ahead of an expected meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump in South Korea later this month. Trump has threatened to slap China with additional 100% tariffs in response. "I wouldn't be surprised," the Treasury secretary said when asked about additional equity stakes. The Trump administration will not take stakes in nonstrategic industries, Bessent said. Shares of rare earth and critical mineral miners have rallied over the past several sessions as investors speculate on which companies might be future targets for Trump administration industrial policy.

Marc Benioff doesn't think enough companies have figured out how to adopt AI. "Customers are getting their head around how to deploy AI," Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, told CNBC host Jim Cramer on Tuesday. Earlier on Tuesday, Benoiff kicked off the Dreamforce conference at San Francisco's Moscone Center with a keynote, where he touted how clients such as Williams-Sonoma and Dutch jewelry maker Pandora have adopted Salesforce's AI products. The comments on AI adoption come as Salesforce shares are down more than 28% compared to the same time last year and around 34% compared to their peak in December 2024. The company said in August that it cut its support staff from 9,000 to 5,000 employees, thanks to the adoption of AI agents. "People don't understand that Agentforce is part and parcel of Salesforce," said Benioff. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Dario Amodei, CEO of AI lab Anthropic, are both scheduled to have chat sessions with Benoiff throughout the week, topped off with music performances from Metallica and Benson Boone.</p>

Harvey, a startup building artificial intelligence tools for lawyers, is taking that creed to college campuses. In August, Harvey said it would give six law schools access to the platform as part of a new "alliance." The next month, it onboarded 11 more law schools. "What we're trying to do is make it so they can start integrating that into their training as early as possible," Winston Weinberg, Harvey's cofounder and chief executive, said from a conference room in the company's Manhattan office. The simulations he describes aren't live yet. For decades, LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters, which both supply case law to legal professionals, blanketed law schools with free or nearly free access. Students spend years getting fluent in one system and then carry that muscle memory into practice. Inside firms, Weinberg says Harvey is stripping the drudgery from legal work, and clients are starting to notice. He compares it to the advent of email. "The biggest change it made," he said, is that "you've got to respond way faster." Weinberg thinks that Harvey's efficiency gains will prompt firms to move more work off the billable hour and onto flat-fee menus to protect their profits. Weinberg said law firms could also pass along the cost of using Harvey and other tools to their clients, a familiar move in the legal world. Many firms already include a line item on their invoices for research databases, such as LexisNexis or Westlaw, showing how many queries a matter requires. The caveat is that uptake today skews towards the big corporates and law firms, and even there, Harvey is still seen as an efficiency booster, not a requirement for practice. They've long run on enterprise tools like Lexis and Westlaw. Where they diverge is on policies around generative artificial intelligence. A few are weaving it into clinics and practice labs. Notably, the list of Harvey's launch partners was missing a few giants, Yale and Harvard among them. Company lore says the name "Harvey" is partly a nod to Harvard. He argues law schools can do far more to prepare students for the realities of practice. He has no quarrel with the traditional first-year curriculum. "I think where things actually break down," he said, "is that there is almost no hands-on stuff in the second and third year." But, in his view, a three-year legal education should more closely resemble the workplace. Harvey aims to help fix that, though its law school partnership remains light on details. If Harvey can get a foothold in law schools now, the payoff could arrive when today's second-year lawyers become tomorrow's associates and in-house counsel.</p>

Six AI startups are part of Jensen Huang's vision for human-digital workforces. Huang's wide-ranging list included OpenAI, which makes large language models, legal tech darling Harvey, and AI healthcare tool OpenEvidence. In his Citadel talk, Huang specifically highlighted Anysphere-owned Cursor. He said that 100% of Nvidia's software engineers and chip designers use Cursor. "We now have AIs for all of our engineers," he said. "Productivity gains, the work that we do is so much better." In June, Business Insider reported that Amazon was in talks with Cursor to adopt the AI coding tool internally after employees demanded it. Huang has long said that AI and "biological" employees will work together in the future. In Huang's January keynote at CES, one of the world's largest tech trade shows, he proclaimed, "The age of agentic AI is here." In a podcast last October, Huang explained how the human and AI employees would work together. He described a future where the technology giant would mass-deploy AI assistants, also called agents, across every division to improve output. Late last month, General Catalyst's CEO Hemant Taneja said that true AI integration has four non-negotiables, and one of them is planning for how humans and AI will work together. Some AI agents are going to manage humans," he said on a podcast appearance.</p>

Cathie Wood says Wall Street is overlooking AI's biggest payoff. She added that combining AI with advances in gene sequencing and CRISPR technology — a technology scientists use to selectively modify the DNA of living organisms — could spark a medical transformation. Wood said that five major technologies — AI, robotics, energy storage, blockchain, and genomics — are each entering their steep growth phase. That convergence is why healthcare could deliver massive gains for investors willing to bet early, Wood said. Smarter algorithms make gene sequencing faster; cheaper sequencing gives AI more data to learn from; and breakthroughs in gene editing can open the door to new treatments. Wood also said some of the so-called "MAG 6" tech giants — Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet — could see slower growth in the next five years. "That was a very difficult time for innovation for venture capital generally," Wood said, referring to the years when investors stuck with Big Tech. "Now we think it is truly disruptive innovation's time to shine in the market," she added. Wood did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Her firm managed over $13 billion in May, according to its most recent filing. AI is quickly reshaping the healthcare industry, and tech's biggest players are racing to stake their claims. Microsoft has been integrating AI into its cloud solutions to automate hospital operations. The company has notched a number of medical imaging partnerships powered by its AI platforms, most recently with GE Healthcare in March. Founders told Business Insider in July that AI could be the breakthrough that helps clinicians multiply their caseloads and earn extra cash without sacrificing care quality.</p>

When they first got together, he earned slightly more than she did, and the difference didn't bother either of them. After a series of promotions over 18 months, her salary tripled — and then he couldn't deal, Dhatt says. He insisted on splitting costs 50-50, leaving her with a disposable income that she wanted to spend on nice things but felt like she couldn't. When she proposed booking a luxury vacation for the two of them, for example, he insisted they go on a cheaper trip and divide the cost. Dhatt's financial success soon exposed a tension that many couples face today: What happens when she earns more than him? "When our relationship finally ended, he told me as he left that I have nothing to worry about because of my salary," she adds, which to her revealed how money was "a bigger factor" in their relationship than he'd previously admitted. Divorce rates in heterosexual couples rise significantly when a woman is more professionally successful than the man, be that in terms of fame or, more commonly, money. Perhaps even more strikingly, studies also show that the marriages most likely to endure are those that most closely fit the traditional pattern of male breadwinner and female homemaker. A 2023 report from the Institute for Family Studies found that couples in which husbands earn more than their wives have the lowest chance of divorce, and that when a man earns upwards of $38,000-a-year more than his wife, the chances of divorce are lowest. Despite recent leaps in progress toward gender equality both in the home and in the workplace, marital inequality might be the last vexing barrier to our ongoing quest for true gender parity. No doubt one of today's highest profile wage-gap relationships with a female breadwinner is Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. When the pair announced their engagement in August, Lyz Lenz, a New York Times bestselling author of a memoir about her own divorce, cut through the internet's euphoria by offering some sobering stats and reflections on her own experience. "The image they are projecting to us is that a successful woman has found a supportive partner, one who eagerly fawns over her new album cover while interviewing her for his own podcast," she wrote on her Substack. Lenz noted that women who succeed as Swift has "are often punished for it" and that she herself has been forced to pay the price of being professionally and economically ambitious. A similar pattern follows in the public sector: Women who are elected to positions like mayor or parliamentarian double the chances of their marriages falling apart. A 2023 study from Australia, for example, found that women who earn more than their male partners are also significantly more likely to be physically and emotionally abused by that partner. "When women's income exceeds that of their partners," the authors write, "the violation of a gender norm creates a strong negative effect." Scant research is available on the correlation between divorce rates and income inequality in same-sex marriages, but one paper from 2014 found that in those couples bigger earnings gaps also translate to a higher likelihood of a break-up. More than a dozen women I spoke to for this story told me that money significantly shaped their relationship or marriage. And of the women who earned more than their male spouses, the majority said that this had a detrimental impact on their relationship. Sukhy Desangh, a 41-year old management consultant, tells me she was earning more than five times what her ex-fiancé earned. He was humiliated by her being the primary earner in their household, she says. "When we were out for dinner with friends and family, he would message me to say, 'Give me your credit card and I'll pay with it.'" Several other women said that their partners felt "emasculated" by being out-earned. Two women who asked not to be named said that they felt like their ex-husbands became depressed as a result of not being the primary financial provider. "Money wasn't the only reason me and my ex broke up," says Ali, a 34-year old who works in financial services, "but it was a topic of conversation and there were many times he said he wouldn't be able to be with someone long-term who earns more than him. Women now hold more managerial positions than ever, and they bring home the bulk of household income in more families than ever. Dené Logan, a marriage and family therapist based in Los Angeles, says that for one, gender norms are set in childhood. "Men are handed a very specific template early in life: protect, provide, procreate — and their worth is tied to it," she says. With that mindset deeply ingrained, Logan adds, when a woman in a heterosexual marriage is financially and professionally successful, it can "trigger resentment" within the man — whether he knows it or not. Because of these long-standing constructs, men's sense of mission and meaning is still frequently tied up in work and money. Muriel Wilkins, an executive coach and CEO of a leadership advisory firm, agrees. "What's really happening here is a clash between progress and old expectations," she says. "Cultural norms are very sticky," says Ramit Sethi, a bestselling author and podcast host. For example, he notes, even though women in urban cities out-earn men in their 20s, dating norms about who picks up the check have been glacially slow to change. Many of the women I spoke to also said that fault lines in marriages and relationships that were initially caused by money were exacerbated by the fact that men who weren't getting paid as much were also not shouldering as much of the unpaid labor in the home. A Pew study from 2023 found that women in the US still consistently pick up more household chores and caregiving responsibilities. In those situations, wives and husbands spent roughly the same amount of time per week on household chores. "It felt like a double whammy," one woman says of her husband, who was laid off shortly after they got married. "He wasn't working, which made him angry and resentful, but then he refused to do almost anything around the house while I was earning for the both of us. "If that's not a recipe for disaster, then I don't know what is." There are, of course, exceptions to the female breadwinner trend. Brian Tan and his wife, who live in New York, have been married for two years and in a relationship for eight. After that, he switched employers and took a job which paid about double her salary. But since then, he's started working for a children's hospital and she's moved into tech. "The first is that I view it as one big pool of money. The second is that this is a pendulum that swings both ways — there was a period where I made more, then we made the same amount, then she makes more now," says Tan. "A third reason is that I'm truly proud of her, and to be genuinely proud of someone, all feelings of jealousy disappear from one's mindset; I want her to feel fulfilled and intellectually stimulated, and the fact that she gets paid a lot while doing her job is a win-win for me." One woman based in the UK who asked not to be named tells me that she has four sisters. The key to success, she said, is being open and communicating, especially when conflicts arise. Natasha, a 37-year old marketing executive, says that her family is very traditional in terms of gender norms. By earning double what her husband earns, she sometimes feels like she's simultaneously living both outside of traditional gender norms and inside of them — "a sort of double existence that can feel stressful," she says. But crucially, she's been happily married to her husband for seven years — they just had a baby. The pay differential doesn't bother him, she says. "I think that's evidence of his maturity and confidence." Another woman told me that when she first met the man who became her husband, she was earning "a thousand times" more than him. They've now been together for a decade, and she's still earning about 40 percent more than him. And he agrees: "Unless it's a problem for my wife, I'm secure enough in myself and in our relationship for it to not even be a consideration." William Conrad and his girlfriend Levi Coralynn, who are both in their 20s, have garnered an enormous social media following — he has about 1.3 million TikTok followers, she about 2.3 million— for publicly and performatively living out an atypical heterosexual relationship. Muriel Wilkins said that she does think things will eventually change, especially as Gen Zers like Conrad and Coralynn are questioning and pushing back against outdated norms. But it will take time, she said, and progress will only materialize if individual couples are prepared to confront these outdated norms head-on. "They need to redefine what success looks like in their marriage. Dené Logan put it more bluntly: "Your husband is not the patriarchy." And recognizing that distinction is key to avoiding misplaced resentment. It will come, says Wilkins, "when we stop treating money as the measure of power in a marriage, and start seeing partnership as a balance of respect, care, and shared responsibility." Equality doesn't necessarily mean sameness, says Logan, it means rewriting the story of marriage for a new era.

In a world glued to screens, Aziz Ansari is choosing the analog life. During an appearance on Tuesday's episode of the "Good Hang with Amy Poehler" podcast, the comedian spoke about his Luddite ways and why he isn't a fan of ChatGPT. But I have an assistant," Ansari told podcast host Amy Poehler. And it's not just his inbox that he's abandoned. Living a low-tech lifestyle has its benefits, Ansari said. "It just gives me more space to think. I was like, 'Whoa, those guys are able to get a lot of stuff done. The comedian says he is also wary of ChatGPT. It's making everyone's opinions kind of the same," Ansari said. Not only is AI prone to making mistakes, it reinforces what people already think, he added. The comedian said he once saw a commercial in which someone asked ChatGPT how to make dinner for a date. Speaking to People in September, Ansari said he knows that his ability to live offline comes with a certain level of privilege and isn't realistic for everyone. A representative for Ansari did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours. Ansari isn't the only celebrity who has spoken about preferring an analog lifestyle. In July 2023, Christopher Nolan said he doesn't carry a smartphone or use email. "If I'm generating my material and writing my own scripts, being on a smartphone all day wouldn't be very useful for me," Nolan told The Hollywood Reporter. "So I never did get into getting involved in all that because it'll take up too much of my time if I talked to everybody who is trying to get in touch with me," Parton said. In January, Christopher Walken told The Wall Street Journal that his relationship with technology is nearly nonexistent. "I only have a satellite dish on my house. So I've seen 'Severance' on DVDs that they're good enough to send me. I've never emailed or, what do you call it, Twittered," Walken said. It's not just Hollywood: In a May story, regular people told Business Insider that they swapped smartphones for dumb phones to wean themselves off their screens and social media. Some Gen Zs are even chaining their smartphones to a wall — creating a makeshift landline —and freeing themselves from the urge to scroll.</p>

Former Ford CEO Mark Fields said on Tuesday that US automakers overestimated consumer demand when they started ramping up production of electric vehicles. "Over the last couple of years, the automakers really went full bore in putting in capacity for EVs," Fields, 64, told CNBC's "Power Lunch." Fields started his career at Ford in 1989 after graduating with an MBA from Harvard Business School. He held a variety of senior leadership positions at Ford, and was the company's chief operating officer from 2012 to 2014 and its CEO from 2014 to 2017. Some of the big bets automakers made on EVs have come undone "over the last 18 months or so," Fields told CNBC. General Motors said in an exchange filing on Tuesday that it was taking a $1.6 billion charge "based on a planned strategic realignment of our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint to consumer demand." A lot of them, particularly in GM's case, boasted that they had the full lineup of EVs," Fields said on Tuesday. "And what was an advantage, at least they thought at the time, has now probably turned into a bit of an albatross as the market take-up of EVs is going to be lower, at least in the near to medium term, than they plan for," he continued. Auto chiefs have expressed mixed views on whether the rollback of federal EV incentives would hurt the US EV market. "I think it's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought," Farley said on September 30. McNeill said in an interview with CNBC on October 2 that the market can continue to "grow without subsidies." "In Europe, France and Germany in particular rolled subsidies off a couple of years ago, and what happened after that, surprisingly, was the market continued to grow," McNeill said. "That's largely because the models continue to roll out from other OEMs, much like they have here," McNeill added, using the acronym for original equipment manufacturers.</p>

A federal jury is set to hear opening statements in Manhattan on Tuesday in the fraud and conspiracy trial of two MIT-educated brothers accused in a lightning-fast, $25 million cryptocurrency heist. The daylong jury selection on Monday resulted in a four-woman, eight-man panel consisting entirely of individuals with college degrees. The jurors, almost all of whom are middle- or retirement-aged, will return to court on Tuesday morning, when they'll be sworn in, listen to opening statements, and hear the first government witnesses by the end of the day. The openings promise to describe a complex, multi-step transaction on the Ethereum blockchain that left the brothers $25 million richer, while a trio of traders were left holding a pile of worthless, illiquid junk crypto. Prosecutors say the "first-of-its-kind" fraud scheme took months of meticulous planning and was executed in just 12 seconds on a day in April 2023. Before and after the alleged exploit, prosecutors say, the brothers typed in internet searches that included: "how to wash crypto," "top crypto lawyers," "fraudulent Ethereum addresses database," and "money laundering statue [sic] of limitations." Their defense attorneys have argued that there was no fraud at all and that they merely outsmarted some "predatory" automated trading bots. In a blow to the defense last week, US District Judge Jessica G. L. Clarke barred the Peraire-Bueno's lawyers from arguing, as she put it, "that the victims deserved this." The trial is expected to last into early November. Sign up chevron down icon An icon in the shape of an angle pointing down.</p>

I chose to study computer science and information engineering in college because I didn't like interacting with people. Programming seemed perfect: I could spend all day on a computer, coding and debugging. At the time, I was happy with this choice and imagined my future would follow that path. If I became an engineer right away, the pressure on my eyes would be even greater. So my plan was simple: work somewhere else for two or three years, let my eyes recover, and then return to writing code. That's how I ended up at a café. But my boss and coworkers encouraged me to try it. They brewed me a cup every day. So, I started studying sensory skills and how to communicate flavors. That was how I became absorbed in coffee. I worked as a barista at that café for 10 years. Outside of work, I was still involved in coffee — going to tastings, events, and classes. At first, I thought coffee was straightforward — as long as I could brew drinks that customers enjoyed and my coworkers liked, it felt like I had already learned everything there was to learn. But once I started going out and experiencing more, I realized coffee is something you can never fully master. It was partly why I left the café to join a coffee trading firm. I had met the boss in a coffee course, and he asked years later if I wanted to try working there. It is a whole supply chain — farmers, importers, roasters — and I wanted to learn more. I'm now in my third year as a quality control specialist. But upstream, the needs are different: evaluating beans, checking consistency, and thinking about market demand. When I moved, my salary dropped from nearly 50,000 Taiwan dollars a month, about $1,600, to about 35,000 Taiwan dollars. This job has broadened my perspective on the coffee supply chain. In my fourth month, I earned the internationally recognized Arabica Q Grader certification. I used to avoid human interaction, but being a barista meant I had to understand customers, chat, and connect with them. But over time, I developed ways to interact more comfortably, learned to listen, and sense how people were feeling. The nonprofit is located in a military village, and some elderly residents would come early, wait for me, and smile when I arrived. Sometimes, they stayed in the café and told me their life stories and memories, many from Taiwan's martial law years or the Japanese colonial era. This is one of coffee's meanings: It gives people a chance to gather and share their stories. Some of my engineering friends have told me they envy me for turning my interest into a job — until the topic of salary comes up, because their salaries can be two to three times mine. At this stage of life — from your twenties into your early thirties — many people are buying cars and houses. Now, I live with my parents in New Taipei City and share a mortgage with my sister for our family home. I pay about 15,000 Taiwan dollars a month toward it. To manage, I spend less on recreation, like traveling once every three or four years. Since coffee is also my hobby, most of my discretionary spending goes to coffee courses or activities. I can usually save 10,000 to 15,000 Taiwan dollars a month. I also look for ways to increase my income through side hustles, such as judging coffee competitions and teaching courses. Some people choose high-paying jobs and use their salaries to fund hobbies. Others, like me, turned their passion into work, even with less money. The first step is to imagine the kind of life you want, and then decide if your passion is strong enough to carry you there.</p>
