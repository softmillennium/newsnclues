                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an embarrassing error, PayPal blockchain partner Paxos accidentally minted 300 trillion of the PYUSD token today. PayPal's stablecoin, which it debuted in 2023, is supposed to be redeemable at a 1:1 rate for US dollars. $300 trillion is more than double the entire world's current GDP of $117 trillion. In short, that's a really bad mistake from Paxos. At least the action did appear to be a mistake. Paxos acknowledged the issue in a post on X, assuring clients that their funds are secure and stating that it burned the excess reserves of stablecoins. The company claimed that "this was an internal technical error.” Maybe so, but internal technical errors can still wreak havoc pretty quickly when it comes to finance, especially in the fantasy worlds of blockchain and crypto.

The trial of two MIT-educated brothers accused of stealing $25 million worth of Ethereum kicked off in Manhattan federal court this week, with a prosecutor claiming that the alleged scheme questions “the very integrity of the blockchain” itself.

Anton Peraire-Bueno, 25, and his brother James Peraire-Bueno, 29, “manipulated and tampered with the process and protocols by which transactions are validated and added to the Ethereum blockchain” in order to gain access to victims' digital assets.

The Peraire-Bueno brothers, however, argue that the exploit wasn't fraud at all and was not illegal in the first place—raising a fundamental question about where the legality of the blockchain ends and criminal manipulation begins.

In a May 2024 statement, former U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York said the case brings “the very integrity of the blockchain into question.”

“The brothers, who studied computer science and math at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, allegedly used their specialized skills and education to tamper with and manipulate the protocols relied upon by millions of Ethereum users across the globe,” Williams said. “And once they put their plan into action, their heist only took 12 seconds to complete.”

The Peraire-Bueno brothers were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering last year.

Both brothers face a maximum sentence of 20 years for each count. Their trial began on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court and could last through the first week of November.

Earlier this year, the brothers' legal team filed a motion to prevent the prosecution from using their Google search history as part of the case, calling it “unfairly prejudicial.”

However, prosecutors claim the alleged crypto scheme was “meticulously planned” and took “numerous steps to conceal their identities and lay the groundwork to conceal the stolen proceeds.”

As the trial intensifies, it is unclear if the brothers will testify in their own defense.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>October 15, 2025 – The cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem stands at the precipice of a profound transformation, driven by a wave of innovative technologies poised to redefine scalability, privacy, user experience, and real-world integration. From modular blockchain architectures to the cryptographic marvels of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and the tangible impact of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs), these advancements, gaining significant traction from late 2023 through 2025, are addressing the core limitations that have historically hindered mainstream Web3 adoption. The immediate perceived impact is a concerted effort to make blockchain technology more intuitive, secure, and integrated with daily life, moving beyond speculative trading to deliver substantial utility. This matters immensely for the crypto ecosystem as it signals a maturation of the industry, shifting focus towards foundational infrastructure and user-centric design that can onboard billions of new users and unlock trillions in real-world value. While some innovations are still in nascent stages of direct tokenization, others have already demonstrated measurable impacts on associated tokens. Modular Blockchains, exemplified by projects like Celestia (TIA), are viewed as a foundational shift towards greater scalability and flexibility. The TIA token, focusing on data availability, experienced significant volatility. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are garnering distinctly bullish sentiment, anticipated to drive the next major crypto bull run. ZKP-based systems are projected to grow 35% annually, reaching $5.6 billion by 2027. Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) have seen their ecosystem surge past $16 billion in market capitalization as of late 2025, projected to reach $669 million by 2032. Experts believe 2025 will be a "breakthrough year" for DePIN, transitioning from speculative excitement to infrastructure reality. Account Abstraction and Intent-Centric Architecture are protocol-level innovations that, while not having directly associated investment tokens in the same way as L1s or specific dApps, indirectly impact the market by enhancing user experience and increasing utility. Increased adoption of these features could indirectly lead to higher trading volumes and liquidity on networks that support them, such as Ethereum (ETH), by simplifying transactions and onboarding more users. Ethereum itself experienced significant volatility, surging above $4,700 in early October 2025 due to institutional inflows, before dipping below $3,800 due to macro tensions and then rebounding. Restaking, popularized by protocols like EigenLayer, has introduced a new "yield meta," reshaping capital efficiency. EigenLayer's EIGEN token saw a dramatic 33% price increase in mid-September 2025, climbing from $1.50 to $2.09, driven by partnerships and broader risk sentiment improvements. However, EIGEN also experienced downward pressure, projected to prolong a negative trend in October 2025, with token unlocks (e.g., 36.82 million EIGEN tokens unlocked on October 1, 2025) contributing to supply. The broader market context, including a "historic deleveraging event" between October 10-14, 2025, saw an estimated $19-20 billion in leveraged positions liquidated. This was triggered by macro policy shifts, excessive market leverage, and a sharp drop in liquidity, with Bitcoin (BTC) plunging from over $126,000 to below $105,000. Modular Blockchains are met with strong positive sentiment, seen as a significant evolution from monolithic architectures. Discussions highlight their ability to enhance scalability, reduce transaction costs, and improve overall performance by separating core blockchain functions. Influencers recognize modular blockchains as setting a new standard for how crypto platforms scale and interact, emphasizing the full-stack flexibility they offer. Projects like Arbitrum, Manta Network, Celestia, Optimism, and Berachain are frequently highlighted. The crypto community views ZKPs as a revolutionary cryptographic technique poised to drive the next major bull run, with discussions frequently labeling upcoming ZKP whitelists and presales as "rare entry points" and "Ethereum moments." There's a palpable "buzz" on platforms like Crypto Twitter and Reddit, recognizing ZKPs as the "math behind the next bull run" and a "missing link" for widespread blockchain adoption. Influencers are actively championing ZKP projects, predicting they will redefine how digital societies adjudicate truth. ZKPs are crucial for scaling decentralized networks, ensuring transactional privacy, and enabling regulatory compliance, with projects like zkSync, StarkWare, and Polygon zkEVM experiencing renewed attention. There's a strong belief that DePINs will be instrumental in onboarding the next billion users into Web3. Major crypto influencers are "betting heavily" on DePINs as the "next significant hype." IoTeX aims to onboard 100 million devices and unlock trillions of dollars in real-world value on-chain by 2025. Discussions center on AA's potential to revolutionize the user experience of on-chain interactions and accelerate mass adoption by making blockchain more intuitive and accessible. Ethereum developers, including Vitalik Buterin, are actively debating achieving "long-term goal alignment" for an account system revamp that incorporates quantum resistance and transaction batching. Thought leaders consider intent-centric design one of the most critical UX and architectural shifts in Web3, highlighting its capacity to simplify onboarding, reduce errors, lower costs, and broaden adoption. This architecture is anticipated to streamline DeFi operations, enhance security, and improve user experience, with projects like Enso Finance's Intent Engine and Cow Swap already utilizing this approach. Discussions surrounding Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) are marked by a sense of urgency and preparedness. There is a strong focus on how to future-proof decentralized platforms. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has advocated for an account system revamp that includes quantum computer resistance. PQC is crucial for protecting wallet security, DeFi protocols, NFTs, digital identity, and interoperability bridges. While Restaking has gained significant traction in DeFi for capital efficiency, and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a crucial privacy technology, specific widespread social media sentiment and community discussions for these particular aspects were not prominently detailed in the research leading up to October 15, 2025. Zero-Knowledge Proofs will drive the next bull run, with ZKP-based solutions projected to process over 60% of Ethereum's Layer-2 transactions by year-end 2025, unlocking new utility for Web3. DePINs will transition from speculative excitement to large-scale application, with their global market expected to surpass $32 billion by the end of 2025, becoming a cornerstone of digital infrastructure, especially driven by AI industry demand. Intent-Centric Architecture will bring millions of new users into the Web3 ecosystem by making blockchain services feel as intuitive as regular apps, enabling new classes of AI-native protocols. In the long-term (2028 Onwards), these technologies will fundamentally reshape the internet, financial systems, and digital interactions, moving towards a more private, secure, and user-centric Web3. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), though still maturing, will become crucial for enabling privacy-preserving computation on blockchains, facilitating the handling of sensitive institutional and personal data without decryption. This capability is vital for integrating blockchain into sectors requiring strict data confidentiality and regulatory compliance. As quantum computers pose a tangible threat, all critical blockchain infrastructure and digital assets will undergo a mandatory transition to PQC, ensuring the long-term integrity and security of the digital economy. The tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWAs) is expected to accelerate, bridging traditional and digital finance. Enhanced UX/UI through Account Abstraction and Intent-Centric Architecture will be critical for mass adoption. For investors, diversification into foundational infrastructure, identifying user-centric innovations, evaluating security and privacy roadmaps, monitoring the regulatory landscape, and looking for real-world utility are paramount. A long-term investment horizon is crucial, recognizing that the full impact of these emerging technologies will unfold over several years. The advancements in modularity, privacy (ZKPs, FHE), user experience (Account Abstraction, Intent-Centric Architecture), and long-term security (PQC) are directly addressing the historical barriers to mainstream adoption. The long-term significance of these technologies for crypto adoption cannot be overstated. They are the building blocks for a future where blockchain technology seamlessly integrates into global financial and digital infrastructure. This will lead to mainstream acceptance, driven by institutional integration, improved user experience, and the tokenization of real-world assets. Final thoughts on what this means for crypto adoption: We are moving towards an era where interacting with crypto technologies will be as intuitive as using everyday apps, largely due to innovations in user experience and underlying infrastructure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Palmer Luckey's ambitious crypto-friendly digital banking startup Erebor has received conditional approval from regulators to start operations, federal officials announced Wednesday. As The Post was first to report, Luckey, the 32-year-old tech mogul known for leading the fast-growing defense firm Anduril, is among the chief backers for Erebor – which aims to aims to provide a stable option for Silicon Valley firms and tech entrepreneurs to park their money and cryptocurrency outside traditional banks. It still needs to clear a few more regulatory hurdles before it can open for business – a process likely to take several months. “Today's decision is also proof that the OCC under my leadership does not impose blanket barriers to banks that want to engage in digital asset activities,” Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gould said in a statement. “Permissible digital asset activities, like any other legally permissible banking activity, have a place in the federal banking system if conducted in a safe and sound manner,” he added. Owen Rapaport, the cofounder of crypto-monitoring company Aer Compliance, is listed as Erebor's CEO. Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.

Sources previously told The Post that Erebor will handle cash plus deposits in stablecoin, a class of digital currency with value directly pegged to a “stable” asset like the US dollar or gold. Talks about Erebor began soon after the sudden collapse in 2023 of Silicon Valley Bank and accelerated as some tech investors grumbled about crypto and crypto-adjacent startups getting “debanked” by traditional institutions during the Biden administration. Luckey is not expected to play a role in Erebor's day-to-day operations. President Trump — who got backing from Luckey and Lonsdale as well as many other tech and crypto executives during his 2024 campaign — has taken a much friendlier regulatory approach to the industry. Luckey and his allies also are seeking an alternative to traditional fractional reserve banking – where banks deploy most of their client deposits while keeping a relatively small amount in reserve at any given time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His comments followed Zach Witkoff, another WLFI co-founder, who floated plans to bring the Trump real estate portfolio onchain during a panel discussion at the Token2049 event in Singapore in early October. Tokenization refers to the process of turning traditional assets such as bonds, credit, equity – or, as in this case – real estate into digital tokens that can be bought, sold and transferred on blockchain rails. It's a model increasingly explored by global banks and asset managers as a way to unlock liquidity and broaden investor access to traditionally exclusive asset classes. Trump suggested in the interview on Wednesday that applying the tokenization model could open investment opportunities to his family's global base of supporters. He described a model where investors might contribute as little as $1,000 to gain partial ownership of a building, with added benefits like hotel perks or exclusive access. While details remain scarce, he indicated the initiative would be integrated with World Liberty Financial and its U.S. dollar stablecoin USD1. The protocol announced plans last month to roll out a debit card and retail application soon, a move that would make the USD1 stablecoin available for everyday payments, CoinDesk reported.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) is battling to hold the $4,000 level while Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA) clings to $0.65, with both charts nearing breakout zones that could decide the next altcoin rally. Cardano's price structure that began in November 2024 is reaching its apex. ADA recently retested this base after rejection at $0.95 earlier in October. Major EMAs now act as layered resistance between $0.77 and $0.84. The Parabolic SAR aligns near $0.84, reinforcing this ceiling. A drop below $0.65 could expose stronger demand near $0.55 to $0.58. A rebound above $0.77 may open targets at $0.80 and $1.00 if momentum improves. On-chain data shows consistent outflows in October, indicating that investors are moving ADA to private wallets. While this reduces selling pressure, it also narrows trading liquidity. ADA futures volume is down 34.9% on the day, and open interest has slipped 3.7% to $682 million. Long-short ratios still favor bulls, with Binance accounts showing 2.6 longs for every short. The data shows leveraged traders remain exposed even as overall positioning turns cautious. Ethereum slipped to $3,996 on Oct. 15, down about 3% in the session, testing key support within its year-long ascending triangle. The move follows heavy exchange outflows and increased liquidations across derivatives markets. The daily chart shows ETH compressed between an ascending trendline from April and descending resistance from the $4,800 peak. Price now trades near $3,950 to $4,000, where the 50-day EMA ($3,979) offers immediate support. A close below may expose the 200-day EMA at $3,546 and deeper support near $3,400. The Parabolic SAR remains overhead at $4,639, signaling that buyers have yet to regain control. Exchange data shows $65.28 million in ETH outflows on Oct. 15, consistent with the broader trend of coins moving off exchanges. This often signals accumulation but also reduces liquidity, which can amplify volatility during sharp moves. Binance accounts show a 2.4-to-1 long-short ratio, with top traders holding similar exposure. The figures show that optimism persists, but leveraged positions remain vulnerable to another dip.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SEC filings show Bitmain gave firm partially owned by Eric Trump unusually generous terms on equipment A private Chinese company is giving preferential access to its technology and providing unusually beneficial payment terms on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of specialized equipment to a firm partially owned by Eric Trump, according to industry sources and Securities and Exchange Commission records. American Bitcoin Corporation was founded in March, just two months after Donald Trump's inauguration. Eric Trump currently has a 7.5% stake in the company, SEC filings show. Created through a daisy chain of mergers, and majority owned by a company called Hut 8, American Bitcoin went public with overwhelming publicity on 3 September on the Nasdaq exchange. Filings by American Bitcoin with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that the company is purchasing more than 16,000 advanced mining machines – servers that process complex math problems to earn Bitcoin – from Bitmain. The SEC filings indicate that American Bitcoin is paying Bitmain in “pledged” bitcoin – rather than cash – which could be redeemed up to two years from now, at a current price. An industry expert said he was briefed on the American Bitcoin deals and that Bitmain was offering the company unique and favorable terms, with little money down, and such a long period of time for redeeming their collateral. Favorable treatment by Bitmain is a main ingredient of the American Bitcoin venture. In a statement to the Guardian, Bitmain said “technical cooperation” with American Bitcoin's majority owner Hut 8 was specific to one type of mining machine, and was with Hut 8 rather than American Bitcoin. Experts say American Bitcoin's special access to Bitmain's technology and financing terms raise concerns that the Chinese entity views business with the Trump sons as an opportunity to try to influence the Trump administration on a variety of issues: crypto regulation, energy, or China policy. “The disclosed terms are pretty unusual,” said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. “If the president's family was involved it brings up the obvious question of whether Bitmain is trying to get special treatment.” “This does look a bit like a sweetheart deal where the reason they are doing this is to curry some influence with the Trump administration,” he said. “This looks bad but at the same time there could be underlying facts that make it a fair deal.” A spokesperson for Hut 8, Gautier Lemyze-Young, did not dispute the financing terms involved bitcoin with a 24-month window but said the terms were agreed to “in September 2024 long before the launch of American Bitcoin”. Eric Trump did not respond to detailed requests for comment emailed to American Bitcoin and the Trump Organization, where he is executive vice-president. A former company executive who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Guardian that the Trump family involvement, announced publicly in March, was known months earlier to insiders as the mergers were organized to form American Bitcoin. “We knew well in advance that they were involved. An entirely separate Trump cryptocurrency business, World Liberty Financial, which has no ties to American Bitcoin except the Eric Trump ownership, announced in May that the United Arab Emirates would use its stablecoin in a transaction in which it made a $2bn investment involving a separate cryptocurrency exchange. But American Bitcoin stands out in part because so many threads intersect with US policy: Trump has announced a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve”, which may help drive up bitcoin's price; has loosened regulations on energy, which is key to cheap bitcoin mining; and has launched policies on China that often seem to pivot back and forth between aggressive economic confrontation and conciliation. We are one of the biggest bitcoin mining companies on Earth,” he told a conference last month, claiming the price of bitcoin would shoot to a million dollars, an eightfold increase from the present. Bitmain is not regulated by US agencies but there have been concerns about the company's technology. Last month the Republican congressman Zachary Nunn, of Iowa, pressed the treasury department to review Bitmain and another Chinese bitcoin company. In a statement to the Guardian, Nunn wrote: “American families deserve to know that our power grid, digital infrastructure, and national security aren't being compromised by foreign entities with opaque ownership and ties to hostile regimes.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Please report any issues or inconsistencies here. A former U.S. citizen who earned the moniker “Bitcoin Jesus” for his evangelism of cryptocurrency has agreed to pay the IRS nearly $50 million in back taxes in exchange for dropping its criminal case against him. Roger Ver once owned two computer companies in Santa Clara. When he renounced his U.S. citizenship, Ver owned roughly 131,000 Bitcoins either personally or through companies that he owned, according to federal prosecutors. At the time, Bitcoins traded for around $871 each and Ver was required to pay an “exit tax” on his capital gains. But prosecutors say he provided false or misleading information to the law firm and appraiser by hiding the actual number of Bitcoins he owned. The following year, an appraiser Ver hired to value his companies asked him in an email to provide the number of Bitcoins he owned when he expatriated. That appraiser copied Ver's attorney in the email, but Ver did not provide a clear answer, according to court documents. Federal public defenders in Los Angeles have accused the Trump administration of circumventing rules with the way acting U.S. Atty. Ver asked, “[c]ompletely hypothetically speaking, what would the ramifications be if I were to have had 200,000 [bitcoins] at the time of my renunciation?” The lawyer advised Ver to get an appraisal of his personally held Bitcoins from a “third party who [had] no personal interest in the tax implications of the appraisal,” according to court documents. I would just need to explain it all, and then you would affix your name to it,” Ver wrote in an October 2015 email. By November 2017, Ver had sold tens of thousands of Bitcoins on cryptocurrency exchanges for approximately $240 million in cash, according to federal prosecutors. Even though he was no longer a U.S. citizen, Ver was required to report his earnings to the IRS and pay taxes, because his companies were U.S. corporations. A federal grand jury indicted Ver in April 2024 for mail fraud, two counts of tax evasion and three counts of subscription to a false tax return. Ver agreed to pay his back taxes under an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office and the charges against him are set to be dismissed. Ver is accepting responsibility for his actions and has agreed to pay a substantial penalty,” acting U.S. Atty. “Every person, whether you're a millionaire or not, is required by law to pay taxes and we will not hesitate to hold anyone accountable.” Through his attorney, Ver said in a statement, “I am very grateful this case has been dismissed and appreciate the Trump Administration's leadership and professionalism in working towards this final resolution. I am also grateful to everyone who supported me and sought justice in my case.” The most important California stories and recommendations in your inbox every morning.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This potential public token sale would take place on Sonar, a self-hosted token launch platform created by crypto investor Jordan “Cobie” Fish, who is also a co-founder of Lido. Register now,” MegaETH's team shared on X earlier today. ICOs – which are a way for crypto projects to raise funds – are making a comeback in 2025, with MegaETH's move showing a shift toward community-focused, transparent sales to drive user engagement and ecosystem growth. While MegaETH says details of a “potential crypto-asset offering” will be announced soon, it emphasized that registration does not guarantee allocation or constitute a sale. No terms of the potential deal have been disclosed. Registration is open to anyone who completes identity verification on the Sonar platform, excluding MegaETH employees and users from prohibited areas. Individuals from the U.S. must also meet accredited investor requirements and will be subject to a 12-month lockup, MegaETH's website notes. Earlier this year, MegaETH announced plans to distribute its tokens through a new ICO model built around a soulbound NFT mint for its pioneer collection, The Fluffle. MegaETH said the NFT model was chosen to reward genuine community participation rather than speculative farming, The Defiant previously reported. “A simple points program tied to an airdrop often creates perverse incentives—especially when deployed by a blockchain—driving inauthentic behavior and ‘farming,' which raises questions about real value creation and leaves everyone dissatisfied,” the announcement noted. This latest announcement also follows MegaETH Labs' recent launch of MegaUSD (USDm), a native stablecoin developed in collaboration with Ethena Labs using its Stablecoin-as-a-Service stack. “$USDM aligns incentives across stakeholders, letting users and apps enjoy the lowest fees possible while routing scalable value back to MegaETH,” MegaETH said in a post on X on Sept. 8.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ethereum Foundation is expanding its DeFi-focused treasury management strategy with a fresh deployment of 2,400 ETH, worth some $9.6 million, and about $6 million worth of stablecoins, in a yield-bearing Morpho vault, according to an announcement on Wednesday. "Morpho is a pioneer in permissionless DeFi protocols and consistently demonstrates a commitment to Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) principles," the foundation wrote on X, explaining that both Morpho Vault v2 and Morpho Blue v1 were released under an open GPL2.0 license. Facing criticism earlier this year over its routine sales of ETH to fund its operations, the non-profit Ethereum Foundation announced a plan to move a portion of its treasury into DeFi protocols, beginning with 50,000 ETH. The foundation has since moved millions worth of funds onto platforms like Compound, an OG lending protocol, and Spark, part of the Sky (formerly MakerDAO) ecosystem. That said, it also continues to sell crypto assets for fiat on centralized exchanges to fund blockchain research and development. According to Arkham Intelligence, the Ethereum Foundation holds over $820 million worth of crypto assets, including $735 million worth of ETH, at current prices, according to The Block's ETH price page. For instance, Coinbase recently surpassed $1 billion worth of bitcoin-backed onchain loan originations using Morpho, just eight months after the service launched. Some $4.6 billion has been locked on Morpho Blue v1, a small fraction of the total Ethereum lending market, but in line with rivals like Compound, Spark, and older versions of Aave, according to The Block's data.

UK prosecutors are looking to confiscate Bitcoin worth about $6.8 billion tied to a massive fraud in China uncovered at criminal trials, as they plan a victim compensation plan to repay duped investors. 

The UK police unearthed 61,000 Bitcoin in 2018 during a money laundering investigation against two Chinese women linked to the fraud that impacted around 128,000 investors. Prosecutors are planning a victim compensation program, a lawyer said during a court hearing on Wednesday while several investors have applied to the court to claw back their money.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If Ethereum ever reaches $100,000, the ecosystem could grow into a $12 trillion digital economy. It sounds almost impossible, yet some investors are starting to wonder what would happen if Ethereum (ETH-USD) really did reach $100,000. At this level, Ethereum  would no longer be just another cryptocurrency. It would become one of the largest financial ecosystems in history. At a $100,000 price, Ethereum's current circulating supply of around 121 million ETH would be worth nearly $12.1 trillion. This is more than three times Apple's (AAPL) market capitalization and close to half the total value of gold. These are world-shifting numbers that could redefine what digital assets mean for global finance. If Ethereum reached six figures, about 36 million ETH or roughly 30% of supply would likely remain staked, which would represent around $3.6 trillion locked up in network security. At this scale, Ethereum would function as a global digital economy with its own financial infrastructure. Transaction fees, validator rewards, and the amount of ETH permanently removed from circulation through burning would all rise in U.S. dollar terms. The entire system would start to resemble a digital nation with its own monetary policy and incentives. Spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have already shown that traditional investors are willing to buy and hold ETH. If pensions, wealth managers, and retirement funds begin to treat ETH as a long-term asset class, their constant inflows could keep buying pressure high. Stablecoins and digital U.S. Treasury funds now move billions across Ethereum each day. The network burns a portion of transaction fees in every block, reducing supply over time. Meanwhile, staking continues to remove large amounts of ETH from circulation. Overall, roughly a third of all ETH locked up, therefore the available supply in markets becomes increasingly limited. When this shrinking supply meets consistent institutional demand, the conditions for higher prices become stronger. At $100,000 per ETH, the scale of Ethereum's “security budget” would be staggering. The network pays validators in new ETH and fees to keep it secure. If 100,000 ETH were issued in a year, validators would earn $10 billion. These figures show how Ethereum's economic size directly fuels its protection. At such a high price, ordinary users would not tolerate expensive transactions. These secondary systems handle most transactions for just a few cents while still using ETH to settle on the main chain. The Dencun upgrade helped by introducing “blob” data storage, which reduced costs for these networks. If ETH did climb to $100,000, it would likely be driven by several forces working together. DeFi (decentralized finance) would expand as higher prices increase the value of collateral and boost lending activity. Stablecoins would keep the system running smoothly by providing liquidity for payments and trading. A multitrillion-dollar Ethereum would attract much closer scrutiny from global regulators. Larger stakes mean higher rewards for attackers, making network decentralization and validator diversity even more important. Any sign of centralization or technical weakness could trigger sharp market reactions. Reaching $100,000 per ETH would take years of consistent growth, stable regulation, and strong technical execution. It would not happen overnight or from a single upgrade.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nigel Farage, the leader of political party Reform UK – currently riding high in opinion polls – has told an event audience that he wants to “bring crypto in from the cold” and put an immediate halt to work on a potential UK central bank digital currency (CBDC). Reform UK has just five members of Parliament but has recently consistently polled above the ruling Labour Party and opposition Conservatives, leading to growing talk of Farage as a potential prime minister. Farage took part in a fireside chat on the opening day of the ‘Digital Asset Summit 2025', an event organised in London on 13-15 October by US-based financial media, research and events firm Blockworks. During a 30-minute conversation he highlighted some the promises made in a ‘Cryptoassets and Digital Finance Bill' (or, in its own words, ‘statement of intent') published by Reform in May that set out a ‘post-Brexit roadmap to make the United Kingdom the world's premier hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation.' Farage began his career as a commodities trader in the City. “I still regard myself much more as a businessman who's in politics because things need fixing,” he said. Reform's seven-page ‘bill' included a plan for HM Treasury to create and manage a ‘Bitcoin Reserve Fund' as part of the UK's official reserves. This is following the example of the US, where president Donald Trump signed an executive order in March to create a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve' and ‘Digital Asset Stockpile'. The document also specified ‘Rapid Policy-Making Timelines', stating that ‘any government taskforce or commission on crypto is limited to 90 days (extendable by 30 days only with parliamentary approval) to prevent bureaucratic drift and keep the UK well ahead of slow EU processes.' “We're [the UK] losing reinsurance businesses off to Bermuda, etc, and this whole area of digital assets and crypto just isn't being talked about at all,” Farage said at the Blockworks event. Referring to Reform's stated plans, he said: “If we win the next general election, will put [it] into law very, very quickly, and we will effectively bring crypto in from the cold.” “When I started [working in the City], you could put a brass plaque outside your front door and say ‘commodity broker' and there were a few cowboys around,” he said. “I think a degree of regulation that gives consumers confidence is what you need. “I saw it [regulation] go massively over the top,” he continued. “So, yes, I'm all for appropriate regulation,” he said. Farage was talking on stage to Blockworks co-founder Michael Ippolito in a session titled ‘The Future of Digital Assets in the UK'. He criticised his fellow parliamentarians for a perceived lack of knowledge and interest in digital finance-related topics. They don't know anything about the space – they don't want to know anything about the space,” he said. He also aimed his fire at the Bank of England (BoE), criticising the central bank for a cautious stance over cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins. “I remember when I came out publicly saying that, actually, people should hold crypto as part of their portfolio – and that was in 2020, when I said ‘look, this [crypto] is here to stay, it's a fascinating space',” he said. “I liked it because whilst I'd campaigned for national sovereignty [from the EU] for all those years, here is personal sovereignty… you've got your own money, you're in charge.” Like Trump, who slammed a potential digital US dollar as a “dangerous threat to freedom”, Farage describing CBDCs as “the ultimate authoritarian nightmare.” “If and when we win the next election, we will automatically shut down the CBDC project, make all those working on it say ‘very sorry, chaps – you're of work'. Last month the UK government announced plans to launch a digital ID scheme and make having digital ID mandatory for anyone for working in the UK. Farage was similarly critical of this public sector initiative. HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) ‘must build systems to accept Bitcoin (and other approved crypto) for tax liabilities, using HMRC-published GBP exchange rates at the time of payment,' the document stated, adding that ‘crypto collected can be converted into sterling or added to the Bitcoin Reserve Fund.'</p>

MegaETH, an Ethereum Layer 2 project focused on enabling real-time transaction speeds, is reportedly set to hold a public ICO on Sonar, an ICO platform created by prominent crypto figure Jordan Fish, also known as Cobie.

MegaETH advances blockchain infrastructure by integrating specialized databases for efficient state handling and parallel execution. The project enables faster and more responsive on-chain applications through advanced state management technologies.

The Layer 2 project has received endorsement from prominent Ethereum figures, highlighting its potential to enhance ecosystem scalability and attract developer interest. MegaETH's emphasis on high-performance features aligns with growing interest in Layer 2 solutions that mimic centralized exchange speeds while maintaining decentralization.

Sonar facilitates public token launches for emerging crypto projects, serving as Cobie's platform for community-driven investment tools in the digital assets space.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ascrypto receives a warm embrace in Washington and token prices rise to new levels, some once-hot digital asset sectors like NFTs continue to languish. Few firms have suffered the brunt of NFTs' collapse more than NFT specialist OpenSea. By October 2023, OpenSea, the once-dominant venue for buying and selling NFTs, was bringing in just $3 million in monthly revenue, down from a peak of $125 million in January 2022, the same month the startup was valued at $13.3 billion, briefly giving its cofounders ownership stakes worth more than $1 billion. It wasn't just that people had lost interest in NFTs. OpenSea had also been abruptly overtaken by an upstart competitor, Blur, which charged zero trading fees and didn't require buyers to pay royalties to NFT creators. When OpenSea responded by loosening its own royalty policy, it drew the ire of its customers on Twitter, who said everything from “you people are foul” to characterizing it as “evil” and “a joke of a company.” As OpenSea was hemorrhaging cash and struggling for market share, cofounder and CEO Devin Finzer held a company meeting for 175 staffers on payroll. His goal: to emerge again as a smaller, nimbler startup where every remaining employee was enthusiastic about reinventing the company. Finzer offered severance packages to anyone who hadn't been laid off but also wanted out. CEO Finzer now operates often from a WeWork-like co-working space in downtown Manhattan. After trudging through a three-year bear market for digital art NFTs that may never bounce back, OpenSea is pivoting hard. Taking advantage of its customer base, which had swelled to millions of monthly website visitors, the battle-worn startup has expanded from NFTs to become a one-stop shop for trading all cryptocurrencies across 22 different blockchains. This shift means OpenSea can cash in on the memecoin craze, too. Finzer, 34, credits his wife Yu-Chi Lyra Kuo with having the idea to turn OpenSea into a trade-any-crypto application. In 2021, Kuo left the trading fund and met Finzer later that year. “I really consider her a silent cofounder of OpenSea 2.0,” says Finzer. He adds that she spent hundreds of hours working with him on everything from OpenSea's high-level strategy to technically mapping out how it would pull in trades from different blockchains. The surge will make October 2025 its biggest month in over three years. Finzer's new focus for OpenSea employs an age-old trader axiom, “Don't fight the tape.” As the soaring price of bitcoin makes headlines, crypto goes mainstream and prediction markets gain in popularity, “risk on” is the new mantra for investors. Even though slumping market values for NFTs like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, whose average floor price has fallen from around $400,000 at its peak to $32,000 today, have burned many investors, a new crop of speculators remains undeterred. In this respect, he has taken a lesson from his biggest rival Blur, a company that burst onto the NFT scene three years ago with a trader-centric approach that helped it gobble up most of the NFT trading market. His run-in with Blur also taught him something about leadership. After Blur made trading fee-free and royalty-free, Finzer responded with a series of flip-flopping fee changes that wavered between minimizing and maximizing royalties for digital creators. “For some of these things, the only way you get better is by having the thing happen and failing your way through it,” Finzer says. They flattened the startup's structure and removed all technical managers so that every engineer wrote code. He now tries to keep the company as small as possible, an approach that has become in vogue in the AI era. Roquerre didn't respond to Forbes' emails or Telegram messages requesting an interview. Yet even though today's most popular blockchains have been around for over a decade, no company has cracked the code on making it easy to trade the millions of tokens that reside on different blockchains and store the assets yourself (or in crypto parlance, self-custody). While Coinbase makes 300 tokens available to trade through its centralized exchange primary service, that selection represents a tiny fraction of all the tokens in existence. And like a traditional bank, Coinbase stores customers' assets for them. Everyday Americans typically don't think twice about that since they're accustomed to using banks, but it's deeply troubling to cryptocurrency die-hards who believe in completely owning and controlling their crypto at all times. Just ask anyone who had money on crypto exchange FTX when it collapsed. (More recently, Coinbase has started making many more tokens available to trade through its Base service, which lets people self-custody their assets and trade on decentralized exchanges.) Finzer says OpenSea's bridging feature of letting people trade across 22 blockchains is its most attractive, since there are still few places where that's easy to do. The challenges of achieving this are manifold–to do it well, a company needs to: index an ever-expanding list of tokens across an ever-expanding set of blockchain operating systems; get customers the best possible price for any given trade; make the application easy to use; create a user interface where people can discover new assets; prevent customers from getting scammed. OpenSea built a booming business years ago by making NFTs simple for anyone to purchase, and it's trying to do the same with all token trading. Finzer's goal is to make the user's experience as intuitive as it is on an app like Coinbase or Robinhood, while under the hood, aggregating people's buy and sell orders from the places where more sophisticated, tech-savvy crypto traders congregate like Uniswap. These checks are an important step required for banks and financial institutions to prevent money laundering and transfers from people in sanctioned countries. Finzer says OpenSea, which has moved its corporate headquarters to Miami, isn't legally required to do KYC checks, since it's not considered a U.S. money transmitter and never takes custody of customers' assets. He adds that OpenSea uses blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs to check digital wallets against lists of sanctioned addresses and flag any suspicious transactions for money laundering. But this compliance-light approach could easily present future risks, not only of money launderers and sanctioned-country senders slipping through the cracks, but also of future U.S. administrations bringing regulatory enforcement actions against OpenSea. Under President Biden, the Securities and Exchange Commission opened investigations into whether OpenSea and decentralized exchange Uniswap were running unlicensed securities exchanges. Finzer denies that OpenSea takes a compliance-light approach and says his company does more on compliance than “the vast majority of apps that are built on top of blockchains.” Regarding KYC checks, he says, “KYC isn't an ‘option' we're choosing to avoid; it's fundamentally incompatible with non-custodial architecture.” OpenSea's new trade-everything strategy also means Finzer is trying to straddle the distant worlds of art and pure financial speculation, a balance that seems impossible. He says he doesn't want to build a “soulless financial app,” but when you visit the “Tokens” section of the site, it feels like a gambling-centric financial app. Outside of potential regulatory issues, OpenSea may face significant competitive challenges since the barriers to entry in crypto trading are low.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The financing envelope created by this new initiative is expected to generate up to $250 million in GDP over five years. A federal program administered by regional development agencies and Canada Economic Development, Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC operates 267 non-profit offices across Canada delivering small business loans, tools, training and events. "This initiative aims to increase the support provided to the 520,000 entrepreneurs living in rural and remote areas who grow our economy”, said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions. "It leverages the complementary strengths of both organizations-BDC's financing and advisory expertise and Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC's deep local presence across the country.” "At BDC, we believe that every entrepreneur, no matter where they live, deserves a fair chance to grow their business. "This initiative with Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC allows us to do what a development bank should: go where others don't, and build bridges where gaps exist. We're unlocking potential that's been overlooked for too long. We believe that's what our economy needs right now.” "Joining forces with BDC to supercharge the opportunities and resources available to rural and remote entrepreneurs from coast-to-coast-to-coast is a powerful combination that will result in significant impact throughout the country for decades to come," said Troy Dungate, President of Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC. Additionally, we know that many entrepreneurs in rural Canada are attracted to the work because of the desirable lifestyle it creates for their families. Working together, we expect this to make positive, meaningful change in the lives of individual Canadians and our country as a whole.” This initiative with Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC builds on BDC's broader commitment to develop entrepreneurial potential in all its forms and to help grow the Canadian economy. Since launching our Community Banking initiative in November 2024, BDC teamed up with financial institutions and community lending partners that support underserved groups. By joining this network of trusted partners, Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC should help us reach even more business owners in rural and remote areas. It's about meeting entrepreneurs where they are and helping them grow. This announcement comes just before Small Business Week, a national celebration of Canadian entrepreneurship that BDC has organized for more than 45 years. About BDC: 80 years as Canada's bank for entrepreneurs BDC is a partner of choice for all entrepreneurs looking to access the financing and advice they need to build their businesses and tackle the big challenges of our time. Our investment arm, BDC Capital, offers a wide range of risk capital solutions to help grow the most innovative firms. BDC's development role means we are in a state of perpetual evolution - wherever entrepreneurs go and whatever the Canadian economy needs - we will be there to help them defy the odds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin could reclaim its all-time high of $125,100 in the coming week, but not without one more major correction, according to veteran trader Peter Brandt. “Either a huge shakeout, which would be confirmed by an ATH quickly within the next week or so,” he said, though he acknowledged there could also be a much more bearish outcome. The crypto market crashed on Friday after US President Donald Trump's announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, resulting in over $19 billion in liquidations across the market. “If anything, this weekend was a reminder you have to be so careful with leverage, and even multiples above 1.5x are dangerous,” Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards told Cointelegraph. “They do, and you need to always consider multi-year, long-term risk,” he said. Other analysts remain optimistic, citing broader macroeconomic signals as indications that fresh capital could flow into the cryptocurrency market in the coming weeks. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said in an X post on Tuesday that a buying opportunity may be presenting itself in the crypto market after US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that quantitative tightening “is over.” Quantitative easing is bullish for crypto as it encourages banks to lend more and makes borrowing cheaper for consumers and businesses through lower interest rates.
