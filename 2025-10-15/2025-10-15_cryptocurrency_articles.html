                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His comments followed Zach Witkoff, another WLFI co-founder, who floated plans to bring the Trump real estate portfolio onchain during a panel discussion at the Token2049 event in Singapore in early October. Tokenization refers to the process of turning traditional assets such as bonds, credit, equity – or, as in this case – real estate into digital tokens that can be bought, sold and transferred on blockchain rails. It's a model increasingly explored by global banks and asset managers as a way to unlock liquidity and broaden investor access to traditionally exclusive asset classes. Trump suggested in the interview on Wednesday that applying the tokenization model could open investment opportunities to his family's global base of supporters. He described a model where investors might contribute as little as $1,000 to gain partial ownership of a building, with added benefits like hotel perks or exclusive access. While details remain scarce, he indicated the initiative would be integrated with World Liberty Financial and its U.S. dollar stablecoin USD1. The protocol announced plans last month to roll out a debit card and retail application soon, a move that would make the USD1 stablecoin available for everyday payments, CoinDesk reported.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) is battling to hold the $4,000 level while Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA) clings to $0.65, with both charts nearing breakout zones that could decide the next altcoin rally. Cardano's price structure that began in November 2024 is reaching its apex. ADA recently retested this base after rejection at $0.95 earlier in October. Major EMAs now act as layered resistance between $0.77 and $0.84. The Parabolic SAR aligns near $0.84, reinforcing this ceiling. A drop below $0.65 could expose stronger demand near $0.55 to $0.58. A rebound above $0.77 may open targets at $0.80 and $1.00 if momentum improves. On-chain data shows consistent outflows in October, indicating that investors are moving ADA to private wallets. While this reduces selling pressure, it also narrows trading liquidity. ADA futures volume is down 34.9% on the day, and open interest has slipped 3.7% to $682 million. Long-short ratios still favor bulls, with Binance accounts showing 2.6 longs for every short. The data shows leveraged traders remain exposed even as overall positioning turns cautious. Ethereum slipped to $3,996 on Oct. 15, down about 3% in the session, testing key support within its year-long ascending triangle. The move follows heavy exchange outflows and increased liquidations across derivatives markets. The daily chart shows ETH compressed between an ascending trendline from April and descending resistance from the $4,800 peak. Price now trades near $3,950 to $4,000, where the 50-day EMA ($3,979) offers immediate support. A close below may expose the 200-day EMA at $3,546 and deeper support near $3,400. The Parabolic SAR remains overhead at $4,639, signaling that buyers have yet to regain control. Exchange data shows $65.28 million in ETH outflows on Oct. 15, consistent with the broader trend of coins moving off exchanges. This often signals accumulation but also reduces liquidity, which can amplify volatility during sharp moves. Binance accounts show a 2.4-to-1 long-short ratio, with top traders holding similar exposure. The figures show that optimism persists, but leveraged positions remain vulnerable to another dip.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SEC filings show Bitmain gave firm partially owned by Eric Trump unusually generous terms on equipment A private Chinese company is giving preferential access to its technology and providing unusually beneficial payment terms on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of specialized equipment to a firm partially owned by Eric Trump, according to industry sources and Securities and Exchange Commission records. American Bitcoin Corporation was founded in March, just two months after Donald Trump's inauguration. Eric Trump currently has a 7.5% stake in the company, SEC filings show. Created through a daisy chain of mergers, and majority owned by a company called Hut 8, American Bitcoin went public with overwhelming publicity on 3 September on the Nasdaq exchange. Filings by American Bitcoin with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that the company is purchasing more than 16,000 advanced mining machines – servers that process complex math problems to earn Bitcoin – from Bitmain. The SEC filings indicate that American Bitcoin is paying Bitmain in “pledged” bitcoin – rather than cash – which could be redeemed up to two years from now, at a current price. An industry expert said he was briefed on the American Bitcoin deals and that Bitmain was offering the company unique and favorable terms, with little money down, and such a long period of time for redeeming their collateral. Favorable treatment by Bitmain is a main ingredient of the American Bitcoin venture. In a statement to the Guardian, Bitmain said “technical cooperation” with American Bitcoin's majority owner Hut 8 was specific to one type of mining machine, and was with Hut 8 rather than American Bitcoin. Experts say American Bitcoin's special access to Bitmain's technology and financing terms raise concerns that the Chinese entity views business with the Trump sons as an opportunity to try to influence the Trump administration on a variety of issues: crypto regulation, energy, or China policy. “The disclosed terms are pretty unusual,” said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. “If the president's family was involved it brings up the obvious question of whether Bitmain is trying to get special treatment.” “This does look a bit like a sweetheart deal where the reason they are doing this is to curry some influence with the Trump administration,” he said. “This looks bad but at the same time there could be underlying facts that make it a fair deal.” A spokesperson for Hut 8, Gautier Lemyze-Young, did not dispute the financing terms involved bitcoin with a 24-month window but said the terms were agreed to “in September 2024 long before the launch of American Bitcoin”. Eric Trump did not respond to detailed requests for comment emailed to American Bitcoin and the Trump Organization, where he is executive vice-president. A former company executive who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Guardian that the Trump family involvement, announced publicly in March, was known months earlier to insiders as the mergers were organized to form American Bitcoin. “We knew well in advance that they were involved. An entirely separate Trump cryptocurrency business, World Liberty Financial, which has no ties to American Bitcoin except the Eric Trump ownership, announced in May that the United Arab Emirates would use its stablecoin in a transaction in which it made a $2bn investment involving a separate cryptocurrency exchange. But American Bitcoin stands out in part because so many threads intersect with US policy: Trump has announced a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve”, which may help drive up bitcoin's price; has loosened regulations on energy, which is key to cheap bitcoin mining; and has launched policies on China that often seem to pivot back and forth between aggressive economic confrontation and conciliation. We are one of the biggest bitcoin mining companies on Earth,” he told a conference last month, claiming the price of bitcoin would shoot to a million dollars, an eightfold increase from the present. Bitmain is not regulated by US agencies but there have been concerns about the company's technology. Last month the Republican congressman Zachary Nunn, of Iowa, pressed the treasury department to review Bitmain and another Chinese bitcoin company. In a statement to the Guardian, Nunn wrote: “American families deserve to know that our power grid, digital infrastructure, and national security aren't being compromised by foreign entities with opaque ownership and ties to hostile regimes.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Please report any issues or inconsistencies here. A former U.S. citizen who earned the moniker “Bitcoin Jesus” for his evangelism of cryptocurrency has agreed to pay the IRS nearly $50 million in back taxes in exchange for dropping its criminal case against him. Roger Ver once owned two computer companies in Santa Clara. When he renounced his U.S. citizenship, Ver owned roughly 131,000 Bitcoins either personally or through companies that he owned, according to federal prosecutors. At the time, Bitcoins traded for around $871 each and Ver was required to pay an “exit tax” on his capital gains. But prosecutors say he provided false or misleading information to the law firm and appraiser by hiding the actual number of Bitcoins he owned. The following year, an appraiser Ver hired to value his companies asked him in an email to provide the number of Bitcoins he owned when he expatriated. That appraiser copied Ver's attorney in the email, but Ver did not provide a clear answer, according to court documents. Federal public defenders in Los Angeles have accused the Trump administration of circumventing rules with the way acting U.S. Atty. Ver asked, “[c]ompletely hypothetically speaking, what would the ramifications be if I were to have had 200,000 [bitcoins] at the time of my renunciation?” The lawyer advised Ver to get an appraisal of his personally held Bitcoins from a “third party who [had] no personal interest in the tax implications of the appraisal,” according to court documents. I would just need to explain it all, and then you would affix your name to it,” Ver wrote in an October 2015 email. By November 2017, Ver had sold tens of thousands of Bitcoins on cryptocurrency exchanges for approximately $240 million in cash, according to federal prosecutors. Even though he was no longer a U.S. citizen, Ver was required to report his earnings to the IRS and pay taxes, because his companies were U.S. corporations. A federal grand jury indicted Ver in April 2024 for mail fraud, two counts of tax evasion and three counts of subscription to a false tax return. Ver agreed to pay his back taxes under an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office and the charges against him are set to be dismissed. Ver is accepting responsibility for his actions and has agreed to pay a substantial penalty,” acting U.S. Atty. “Every person, whether you're a millionaire or not, is required by law to pay taxes and we will not hesitate to hold anyone accountable.” Through his attorney, Ver said in a statement, “I am very grateful this case has been dismissed and appreciate the Trump Administration's leadership and professionalism in working towards this final resolution. I am also grateful to everyone who supported me and sought justice in my case.” The most important California stories and recommendations in your inbox every morning.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin plunged, Ethereum followed, and panic spread across almost every major altcoin. Yet, if there's one thing every experienced investor knows—these violent shakeouts often mark the beginning of the next big run. And right now, three names are catching that attention. One of them is already live in the App Store and building real-world utility. Let's go through the top 3 altcoins to watch after this crash. Digitap ($TAP) is quietly becoming a hot story in crypto. The reason is simple—Digitap has an entire live financial ecosystem, available today on both the App Store and Google Play. It's the world's first omni-bank, combining crypto and traditional finance under one roof. Inside the app, users can open multi-currency IBAN accounts, order Visa-backed cards, and manage both fiat and crypto balances seamlessly. This makes Digitap a safe haven during liquidation events. When exchanges freeze withdrawals or traders panic-sell, Digitap users can still convert assets instantly. But it's not just the app that's getting a lot of attention. The native token, $TAP, powers all transactions, card rewards, and in-app staking. A fixed portion of ecosystem revenue goes directly into buybacks and token burns, reducing supply and supporting long-term price stability. That's a 22% increase coming in the next round—and with over 57 million tokens already sold, early investors are rushing in before the next stage closes. Digitap is already a functioning fintech platform with real adoption, a working app, and revenue mechanics that protect holders even when the market collapses. That's why many see $TAP as one of the most resilient and fundamentally strong altcoins in 2025. Here's how it works: Giggle runs on the BNB Smart Chain, keeping transaction fees low and speeds high. That wallet supports the development of AI-assisted learning tools, gamified educational content, and programs targeting underserved regions around the world. All funds are on-chain and traceable, ensuring transparency—something rare even among traditional NGOs. What makes Giggle special is its mix of meme-coin energy and real-world impact. Every trade helps fund free education while keeping the community engaged through trading volume. With a market cap near $100 million, it's still early days for GIGGLE. The third altcoin on this list needs no introduction—Solana (SOL). Even during the recent market crash, Solana held up much better than most altcoins, recovering faster than Ethereum and maintaining strong ecosystem activity. In the past year, Solana generated $2.85 billion in ecosystem revenue, spanning from DeFi platforms to trading and even AI-based applications. That's more than Ethereum produced in its early growth phase, and it shows how diverse and powerful the Solana economy has become. Even more interesting—multiple Solana ETFs are now pending SEC approval. Once those get the green light, institutional investors will gain direct access to Solana exposure, which could bring billions in new liquidity. Anything under $200 could be viewed as a strategic entry zone ahead of the ETF wave. Each of these three projects offers something unique. When the next market cycle begins, investors will look for real utility, revenue-backed models, and live products.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's according to analysts who say last week's brutal sell off, which wiped out around $19 billion in leveraged positions from the broader crypto market, was driven by technical factors rather than a fundamental breakdown in Bitcoin's store-of-value thesis. “The crash on Friday was mostly due to technical reasons related to leverage in perps markets, so nothing has fundamentally changed in the thesis for Bitcoin as a store of value,” Carlos Guzmán, analyst at research firm GSR, told DL News. Last week's crash came as investors fled risk assets following US President Donald Trump's latest tariff threats. The precious metal's performance has raised questions about whether Bitcoin truly belongs in the same conversation as gold when it comes to hedging against government dysfunction and macro uncertainty. JPMorgan analysts coined the debasement trade as a bet against governments' ability to manage their finances. Basically, investors pull away from sovereign debt and fiat currencies, fearful their value will erode as governments address massive debt burdens by simply printing more money. In the US, Trump's assault on Federal Reserve independence have sown doubts about whether Treasuries will continue to enjoy their status as the world's main risk-free asset. Even Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase CEO and a historic gold bear, has said it is “semi-rational” to hold some of the yellow metal. For Guzman, however, Bitcoin's latest crash may tarnish its reputation as a hedge against inflation. “Bitcoin has been in this awkward position where its main value proposition is as a store of value and protection against debasement, but it tends to trade with tech stocks instead of gold,” he told DL News. “Last Friday's crash may be viewed as lending support to the latter view.” “As the market matures and a greater proportion of Bitcoin trades in large, regulated, onshore venues, crypto-native liquidation cascades will have less impact,” he said. “There is increasing performance asymmetry in favour of Bitcoin,” he said. Although Dragosch suggests investors shouldn't use global money supply to predict Bitcoin price, there has been a long-running relationship between the two. “Bitcoin has been undershooting global money supply, but I think that the long-run relationship between Bitcoin and global money supply will reassert itself,” Dragosch told DL News. For now, Bitcoin remains caught between two identities: the digital gold narrative that believers have been promoting, and the reality of a volatile asset still prone to violent selloffs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This potential public token sale would take place on Sonar, a self-hosted token launch platform created by crypto investor Jordan “Cobie” Fish, who is also a co-founder of Lido. Register now,” MegaETH's team shared on X earlier today. ICOs – which are a way for crypto projects to raise funds – are making a comeback in 2025, with MegaETH's move showing a shift toward community-focused, transparent sales to drive user engagement and ecosystem growth. While MegaETH says details of a “potential crypto-asset offering” will be announced soon, it emphasized that registration does not guarantee allocation or constitute a sale. No terms of the potential deal have been disclosed. Registration is open to anyone who completes identity verification on the Sonar platform, excluding MegaETH employees and users from prohibited areas. Individuals from the U.S. must also meet accredited investor requirements and will be subject to a 12-month lockup, MegaETH's website notes. Earlier this year, MegaETH announced plans to distribute its tokens through a new ICO model built around a soulbound NFT mint for its pioneer collection, The Fluffle. MegaETH said the NFT model was chosen to reward genuine community participation rather than speculative farming, The Defiant previously reported. “A simple points program tied to an airdrop often creates perverse incentives—especially when deployed by a blockchain—driving inauthentic behavior and ‘farming,' which raises questions about real value creation and leaves everyone dissatisfied,” the announcement noted. This latest announcement also follows MegaETH Labs' recent launch of MegaUSD (USDm), a native stablecoin developed in collaboration with Ethena Labs using its Stablecoin-as-a-Service stack. “$USDM aligns incentives across stakeholders, letting users and apps enjoy the lowest fees possible while routing scalable value back to MegaETH,” MegaETH said in a post on X on Sept. 8.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York federal prosecutors and the DOJ's National Security Division filed a civil forfeiture complaint against the funds, which are the alleged proceeds and instruments of fraud and money laundering schemes directed by a Cambodian businessman. They were allegedly accessed through private crypto “wallets” with keys in the possession of the businessman, Chen Zhi. He is a Cambodian conglomerate chairman whom U.S. prosecutors accuse of laundering crypto to hide its source. “As alleged, the defendant directed one of the largest investment fraud operations in history, fueling an illicit industry that is reaching epidemic proportions,” U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr. for the Eastern District of New York said in a statement. Chen allegedly orchestrated Prince Holding Group's profits through Cambodian compounds that carried out crypto investment schemes. “This is an individual who allegedly operated a vast criminal network across multiple continents involving forced labor, money laundering, investment schemes, and stolen assets – targeting millions of innocent victims in the process,” FBI Director Kash Patel said, referring to Chen. “Justice will be done and I'm proud of the men and women of the FBI who executed this mission faithfully.” The alleged scam workers in the compounds often developed relationships with victims through messaging or social media apps. The DOJ claimed they operated under violent threats while in the facilities, which were surrounded by high walls and barbed wire. Some of the scammers were subjected to torture and were beat, which Chen knew of, according to prosecutors. “Today's action represents one of the most significant strikes ever against the global scourge of human trafficking and cyber-enabled financial fraud,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a joint statement. The DOJ noted that Chen and other Prince Holding Group executives used their political influence in multiple foreign countries to protect their scheme, bribing public officials to avoid law enforcement. The chairman, who is facing conspiracy charges for wire fraud and money laundering, would face at most 40 years in prison if he is convicted. The Department of the Treasury has also sanctioned Chen and designated Prince Holding Group as a transnational criminal organization.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ethereum Foundation is expanding its DeFi-focused treasury management strategy with a fresh deployment of 2,400 ETH, worth some $9.6 million, and about $6 million worth of stablecoins, in a yield-bearing Morpho vault, according to an announcement on Wednesday. "Morpho is a pioneer in permissionless DeFi protocols and consistently demonstrates a commitment to Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) principles," the foundation wrote on X, explaining that both Morpho Vault v2 and Morpho Blue v1 were released under an open GPL2.0 license. Facing criticism earlier this year over its routine sales of ETH to fund its operations, the non-profit Ethereum Foundation announced a plan to move a portion of its treasury into DeFi protocols, beginning with 50,000 ETH. The foundation has since moved millions worth of funds onto platforms like Compound, an OG lending protocol, and Spark, part of the Sky (formerly MakerDAO) ecosystem. That said, it also continues to sell crypto assets for fiat on centralized exchanges to fund blockchain research and development. According to Arkham Intelligence, the Ethereum Foundation holds over $820 million worth of crypto assets, including $735 million worth of ETH, at current prices, according to The Block's ETH price page. For instance, Coinbase recently surpassed $1 billion worth of bitcoin-backed onchain loan originations using Morpho, just eight months after the service launched. Some $4.6 billion has been locked on Morpho Blue v1, a small fraction of the total Ethereum lending market, but in line with rivals like Compound, Spark, and older versions of Aave, according to The Block's data.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If Ethereum ever reaches $100,000, the ecosystem could grow into a $12 trillion digital economy. It sounds almost impossible, yet some investors are starting to wonder what would happen if Ethereum (ETH-USD) really did reach $100,000. At this level, Ethereum  would no longer be just another cryptocurrency. It would become one of the largest financial ecosystems in history. At a $100,000 price, Ethereum's current circulating supply of around 121 million ETH would be worth nearly $12.1 trillion. This is more than three times Apple's (AAPL) market capitalization and close to half the total value of gold. These are world-shifting numbers that could redefine what digital assets mean for global finance. If Ethereum reached six figures, about 36 million ETH or roughly 30% of supply would likely remain staked, which would represent around $3.6 trillion locked up in network security. At this scale, Ethereum would function as a global digital economy with its own financial infrastructure. Transaction fees, validator rewards, and the amount of ETH permanently removed from circulation through burning would all rise in U.S. dollar terms. The entire system would start to resemble a digital nation with its own monetary policy and incentives. Spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have already shown that traditional investors are willing to buy and hold ETH. If pensions, wealth managers, and retirement funds begin to treat ETH as a long-term asset class, their constant inflows could keep buying pressure high. Stablecoins and digital U.S. Treasury funds now move billions across Ethereum each day. The network burns a portion of transaction fees in every block, reducing supply over time. Meanwhile, staking continues to remove large amounts of ETH from circulation. Overall, roughly a third of all ETH locked up, therefore the available supply in markets becomes increasingly limited. When this shrinking supply meets consistent institutional demand, the conditions for higher prices become stronger. At $100,000 per ETH, the scale of Ethereum's “security budget” would be staggering. The network pays validators in new ETH and fees to keep it secure. If 100,000 ETH were issued in a year, validators would earn $10 billion. These figures show how Ethereum's economic size directly fuels its protection. At such a high price, ordinary users would not tolerate expensive transactions. These secondary systems handle most transactions for just a few cents while still using ETH to settle on the main chain. The Dencun upgrade helped by introducing “blob” data storage, which reduced costs for these networks. If ETH did climb to $100,000, it would likely be driven by several forces working together. DeFi (decentralized finance) would expand as higher prices increase the value of collateral and boost lending activity. Stablecoins would keep the system running smoothly by providing liquidity for payments and trading. A multitrillion-dollar Ethereum would attract much closer scrutiny from global regulators. Larger stakes mean higher rewards for attackers, making network decentralization and validator diversity even more important. Any sign of centralization or technical weakness could trigger sharp market reactions. Reaching $100,000 per ETH would take years of consistent growth, stable regulation, and strong technical execution. It would not happen overnight or from a single upgrade.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nigel Farage, the leader of political party Reform UK – currently riding high in opinion polls – has told an event audience that he wants to “bring crypto in from the cold” and put an immediate halt to work on a potential UK central bank digital currency (CBDC). Reform UK has just five members of Parliament but has recently consistently polled above the ruling Labour Party and opposition Conservatives, leading to growing talk of Farage as a potential prime minister. Farage took part in a fireside chat on the opening day of the ‘Digital Asset Summit 2025', an event organised in London on 13-15 October by US-based financial media, research and events firm Blockworks. During a 30-minute conversation he highlighted some the promises made in a ‘Cryptoassets and Digital Finance Bill' (or, in its own words, ‘statement of intent') published by Reform in May that set out a ‘post-Brexit roadmap to make the United Kingdom the world's premier hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation.' Farage began his career as a commodities trader in the City. “I still regard myself much more as a businessman who's in politics because things need fixing,” he said. Reform's seven-page ‘bill' included a plan for HM Treasury to create and manage a ‘Bitcoin Reserve Fund' as part of the UK's official reserves. This is following the example of the US, where president Donald Trump signed an executive order in March to create a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve' and ‘Digital Asset Stockpile'. The document also specified ‘Rapid Policy-Making Timelines', stating that ‘any government taskforce or commission on crypto is limited to 90 days (extendable by 30 days only with parliamentary approval) to prevent bureaucratic drift and keep the UK well ahead of slow EU processes.' “We're [the UK] losing reinsurance businesses off to Bermuda, etc, and this whole area of digital assets and crypto just isn't being talked about at all,” Farage said at the Blockworks event. Referring to Reform's stated plans, he said: “If we win the next general election, will put [it] into law very, very quickly, and we will effectively bring crypto in from the cold.” “When I started [working in the City], you could put a brass plaque outside your front door and say ‘commodity broker' and there were a few cowboys around,” he said. “I think a degree of regulation that gives consumers confidence is what you need. “I saw it [regulation] go massively over the top,” he continued. “So, yes, I'm all for appropriate regulation,” he said. Farage was talking on stage to Blockworks co-founder Michael Ippolito in a session titled ‘The Future of Digital Assets in the UK'. He criticised his fellow parliamentarians for a perceived lack of knowledge and interest in digital finance-related topics. They don't know anything about the space – they don't want to know anything about the space,” he said. He also aimed his fire at the Bank of England (BoE), criticising the central bank for a cautious stance over cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins. “I remember when I came out publicly saying that, actually, people should hold crypto as part of their portfolio – and that was in 2020, when I said ‘look, this [crypto] is here to stay, it's a fascinating space',” he said. “I liked it because whilst I'd campaigned for national sovereignty [from the EU] for all those years, here is personal sovereignty… you've got your own money, you're in charge.” Like Trump, who slammed a potential digital US dollar as a “dangerous threat to freedom”, Farage describing CBDCs as “the ultimate authoritarian nightmare.” “If and when we win the next election, we will automatically shut down the CBDC project, make all those working on it say ‘very sorry, chaps – you're of work'. Last month the UK government announced plans to launch a digital ID scheme and make having digital ID mandatory for anyone for working in the UK. Farage was similarly critical of this public sector initiative. HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) ‘must build systems to accept Bitcoin (and other approved crypto) for tax liabilities, using HMRC-published GBP exchange rates at the time of payment,' the document stated, adding that ‘crypto collected can be converted into sterling or added to the Bitcoin Reserve Fund.'</p>

MegaETH, an Ethereum Layer 2 project focused on enabling real-time transaction speeds, is reportedly set to hold a public ICO on Sonar, an ICO platform created by prominent crypto figure Jordan Fish, also known as Cobie.

MegaETH advances blockchain infrastructure by integrating specialized databases for efficient state handling and parallel execution. The project enables faster and more responsive on-chain applications through advanced state management technologies.

The Layer 2 project has received endorsement from prominent Ethereum figures, highlighting its potential to enhance ecosystem scalability and attract developer interest. MegaETH's emphasis on high-performance features aligns with growing interest in Layer 2 solutions that mimic centralized exchange speeds while maintaining decentralization.

Sonar facilitates public token launches for emerging crypto projects, serving as Cobie's platform for community-driven investment tools in the digital assets space.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite Capita initially stating there was “no evidence of customer, supplier or colleague data having been compromised,” the company and its pensions subsidiary were found to have exposed data about the  pensions it handles, Capita's own staff and customers from other organizations Capita supports. The scale of this breach and its impact could have been prevented had sufficient security measures been in place,” stated John Edwards, the Information Commissioner. Following media reports that staff were locked out of their accounts, Capita confirmed a cyberattack had taken place on April 3, 2023. It issued a statement to the governmental Regulatory News Service stating that “immediate steps were taken to successfully isolate and contain the issue.” This claim appears to contrast with the ICO's findings. It is a crime under British financial laws, in particular Section 89 of the Financial Services and Markets Act, to publish misleading statements to the market. No regulators have made such a finding in Capita's case. A spokesperson for Capita told Recorded Future News: “We did take some immediate steps to contain the issue, as has been acknowledged by the ICO. The malicious JavaScript file had generated a “Priority 2” alert in Capita's endpoint detection and response (EDR) software. Capita then manually took three separate devices offline on March 28 after noticing suspicious activity. The ICO listed a range of security failings, including an understaffed Security Operations Centre (SOC), which usually only had only one analyst on per shift; and the lack of automated response and decent escalation protocols. The attack was ultimately claimed by the Black Basta ransomware group, which posted what it alleged were documents stolen from Capita's internal systems. The listing subsequently disappeared from Black Basta's extortion site, a move that often indicates an extortion fee has been paid or is being negotiated. Capita has not commented on whether it made such a payment. “When a company of Capita's size falls short, the consequences can be significant,” said Edwards. As our fine shows, no organisation is too big to ignore its responsibilities.” In a statement on Wednesday, Capita's chief executive said: “Following an extended period of dialogue with the ICO over the last two years, we are pleased to have concluded this matter and reach today's settlement.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ascrypto receives a warm embrace in Washington and token prices rise to new levels, some once-hot digital asset sectors like NFTs continue to languish. Few firms have suffered the brunt of NFTs' collapse more than NFT specialist OpenSea. By October 2023, OpenSea, the once-dominant venue for buying and selling NFTs, was bringing in just $3 million in monthly revenue, down from a peak of $125 million in January 2022, the same month the startup was valued at $13.3 billion, briefly turning its cofounders into billionaires. It wasn't just that people had lost interest in NFTs. OpenSea had also been abruptly overtaken by an upstart competitor, Blur, which charged zero trading fees and didn't require buyers to pay royalties to NFT creators. When OpenSea responded by loosening its own royalty policy, it drew the ire of its customers on Twitter, who said everything from “you people are foul” to characterizing it as “evil” and “a joke of a company.” His goal: to emerge again as a smaller, nimbler startup. Finzer then offered severance packages to anyone who hadn't been laid off but also wanted out. “What was really tough was that a lot more people than I expected–some really good people–took that package,” he says today, looking downward, voice groggy, likely from his seven-day-a-week work schedule. CEO Finzer now operates often from a WeWork-like co-working space in downtown Manhattan. After trudging through a three-year bear market for digital art NFTs that may never bounce back, OpenSea is pivoting hard. Taking advantage of its customer base, which had swelled to millions of monthly website visitors, the battle-worn startup has expanded from NFTs to become a one-stop shop for trading all cryptocurrencies across 22 different blockchains. This shift means OpenSea can cash in on the memecoin craze, too. Finzer, 34, credits his wife Yu-Chi Lyra Kuo with having the idea to turn OpenSea into a trade-any-crypto application. In 2021, Kuo met Finzer and gave up running the trading fund. “I really consider her a silent cofounder of OpenSea 2.0,” says Finzer. Kuo doesn't have an official role at the company, but like many CEOs' partners, she has had an outsize impact on its direction. The surge will make October 2025 its biggest month in over three years. Finzer's new focus for OpenSea employs an age-old trader axiom, “Don't fight the tape.” As the soaring price of bitcoin makes headlines, crypto goes mainstream and prediction markets gain in popularity, “risk on” is the new mantra for investors. Even though slumping market values for NFTs like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, whose average floor price has fallen from around $400,000 at its peak to $32,000 today, have burned many investors, a new crop of speculators remains undeterred. In this respect, he has taken a lesson from his biggest rival Blur, a company that burst onto the NFT scene three years ago with a trader-centric approach that helped it gobble up most of the NFT trading market. His run-in with Blur also taught him something about leadership. After Blur made trading fee-free and royalty-free, Finzer responded with a series of flip-flopping fee changes that wavered between minimizing and maximizing royalties for digital creators. “For some of these things, the only way you get better is by having the thing happen and failing your way through it,” Finzer says. They flattened the startup's structure and removed all technical managers so that every engineer wrote code. He now tries to keep the company as small as possible, an approach that has become in vogue in the AI era. Roquerre didn't respond to Forbes' emails or Telegram messages requesting an interview. Yet even though today's most popular blockchains have been around for over a decade, no company has cracked the code on making it easy to trade the millions of tokens that reside on different blockchains and store the assets yourself (or in crypto parlance, self-custody). While Coinbase makes 300 tokens available to trade through its centralized exchange primary service, that selection represents a tiny fraction of all the tokens in existence. And like a traditional bank, Coinbase stores customers' assets for them. Everyday Americans typically don't think twice about that since they're accustomed to using banks, but it's deeply troubling to cryptocurrency die-hards who believe in completely owning and controlling their crypto at all times. Just ask anyone who had money on crypto exchange FTX when it collapsed. (More recently, Coinbase has started making many more tokens available to trade through its Base service, which lets people self-custody their assets and trade on decentralized exchanges.) Finzer says OpenSea's bridging feature of letting people trade across 22 blockchains is its most attractive, since there are still few places where that's easy to do. The challenges of achieving this are manifold–to do it well, a company needs to: index an ever-expanding list of tokens across an ever-expanding set of blockchain operating systems; get customers the best possible price for any given trade; make the application easy to use; create a user interface where people can discover new assets; prevent customers from getting scammed. OpenSea built a booming business years ago by making NFTs simple for anyone to purchase, and it's trying to do the same with all token trading. Finzer's goal is to make the user's experience as intuitive as it is on an app like Coinbase or Robinhood, while under the hood, aggregating people's buy and sell orders from the places where more sophisticated, tech-savvy crypto traders congregate like Uniswap. These checks are an important step required for banks and financial institutions to prevent money laundering and transfers from people in sanctioned countries. Finzer says OpenSea, which has moved its corporate headquarters to Miami, isn't legally required to do KYC checks, since it's not considered a U.S. money transmitter and never takes custody of customers' assets. He adds that OpenSea uses blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs to check digital wallets against lists of sanctioned addresses and flag any suspicious transactions for money laundering. But this compliance-light approach could easily present future risks, not only of money launderers and sanctioned-country senders slipping through the cracks, but also of future U.S. administrations bringing regulatory enforcement actions against OpenSea. Under President Biden, the Securities and Exchange Commission opened investigations into whether OpenSea and decentralized exchange Uniswap were running unlicensed securities exchanges. OpenSea's new trade-everything strategy also means Finzer is trying to straddle the distant worlds of art and pure financial speculation, a balance that seems impossible. He says he doesn't want to build a “soulless financial app,” but when you visit the “Tokens” section of the site, it feels like a gambling-centric financial app. OpenSea is expected to release its own cryptocurrency soon, following in the footsteps of rival crypto trading apps, though Finzer declined to give details. Outside of potential regulatory issues, OpenSea may face significant competitive challenges since the barriers to entry in crypto trading are low.</p>

The best altcoins to buy now are drawing new capital as Bitcoin reclaims momentum and market optimism returns. BTC is holding above $108,000 with bullish technicals, and traders are watching closely for a breakout that could trigger widespread altcoin inflows. Bitcoin Hyper is rapidly gaining traction as a Layer 2 solution on Bitcoin's base layer, leveraging Solana's speed to introduce smart contract capabilities. At the same time, Maxi Doge is dominating the meme coin conversation with a bold 1000x leverage narrative and aggressive presale strategy. Both projects are surging ahead of their next pricing milestones. Bitcoin's technical indicators suggest growing support for a bullish breakout. If BTC can breach the $117,000 level, analysts expect a swift move toward the $124,000 to $126,000 zone – a range that marked June's high. These factors are leading investors to anticipate a dovish pivot by the Fed, which has historically supported crypto rallies. As the Bitcoin ecosystem looks to scale, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as one of the best altcoins to buy now. It introduces Layer 2 functionality using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) – bringing fast payments, smart contracts, and dApp capabilities to Bitcoin's base chain. With BTC lacking native programmability and scalability, Hyper offers a modular solution that bridges two dominant networks: Bitcoin and Solana. So far, Bitcoin Hyper has raised over $23.6 million in its presale. Its roadmap includes audited security, a decentralized app layer, and long-term treasury funding. If the project achieves wider adoption as a Bitcoin Layer 2 hub, more aggressive models place its value closer to $0.1557 – over 12x from the current presale price. As altcoin attention shifts toward real infrastructure plays, Hyper continues to rise on shortlists of the best altcoins to buy now. While Hyper focuses on speed and utility, Maxi Doge is approaching the market from a very different angle. The project is framed around a buffed-up doge mascot that lifts weights and trades with 1000x leverage, targeting high-risk meme investors who previously drove coins like Dogecoin and Pepe to billion-dollar valuations. The presale currently sits at $0.000263, just above its launch price of $0.00025. More than $3.6 million has been raised so far. Maxi Doge's tokenomics are structured across 50 pricing stages, with the final presale stage reaching $0.0002745. With inflation cooling and the Fed likely to ease, risk assets are again in favor. Dogecoin has bounced back from $0.14, returning to a $0.20+ range. In that context, Bitcoin Hyper and Maxi Doge represent two distinct but timely opportunities. The next crypto to explode news points to China Renaissance, a Beijing-based Chinese investment bank, reportedly raising 600 million dollars for a major BNB-focused treasury.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andrew Nusca is the editorial director of Brainstorm, Fortune's innovation-obsessed community and event series. My old newsroom colleague Jack Clark, now a co-founder of high-flying AI startup Anthropic, recently shared some thoughts on artificial intelligence that I found enlightening. “What we are dealing with is a real and mysterious creature, not a simple and predictable machine,” he wrote in an essay published Monday. With AI showing ever more capability—and crucially, agency—Clark says he's both optimistic and “deeply afraid” of what that means for the future. But we humans have some work to do, too. “We need to spend a bit less time talking about the specifics of the technology and trying to convince people of our particular views of how it might go wrong … and more time listening to people and understanding their concerns,” he wrote, adding: “The rest of the world, which will surely want—and deserves—a vote over this.” The take: About $15 billion worth of Bitcoin. Prosecutors say the man who once held the crypto allegedly oversaw a massive fraud operation based in Cambodia. “Pig butchering,” as it's known, wherein the perpetrators build trust with victims to convince them to “invest” and ultimately hand over their hard-earned crypto.) His conglomerate has been labeled by the Treasury Department as “one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organizations” for allegedly trafficking hundreds of people and forcing them to work in its facilities. The 37-year-old remains at large and faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted. Gather round, children, to remember a time when large language models were warm, upbeat…even funny. It was a generation ago—18 whole months in the land of AI. But widespread concerns (read: lawsuits) about AI chatbots taking advantage of the mental health of some users led to a more defensive (read: boring) personality posture. That will change in a few weeks, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says, when its ChatGPT will be updated to allow for more, well, spirited interactions. “Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases,” he wrote in a social media post. Altman added that once OpenAI rolls out age-gating “more fully,” it will loosen its chatbot restrictions enough (in a rather Meta-like move) to allow for “erotica for verified adults.” Dubbed “Pixnapping,” the threat requires first downloading a malicious app. But that wayward app doesn't require system permissions to read the data that any other installed app displays on the screen, according to Ars Technica. Because the attack involves capturing pixels on your display and mapping them to letters, numbers, or shapes.) It's not hard to imagine what else can be stolen with such an attack: Text messages, emails, passwords, proprietary financial information. And because of Pixnapping's relative speed, even your two-factor authentication codes are at risk. Though the vulnerability is certain, Google says it has yet to see it occur in the wild. The company partially fixed the issue with a September patch, but another, scheduled for December, is necessary to cover its full extent. Browse and purchase products from within ChatGPT. Its “Crescent Island” GPU is tailored for inference. —Oura is now worth $11 billion, according to the smart ringmaker's latest fundraise. Forty percent of Windows PCs still run on it. Select Spotify vodcasts come to the Hollywood streamer next year. They now align with PG-13 movie ratings, it says. —“Custom shoppable TV screensavers,” coming soon to a DirecTV near you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The financing envelope created by this new initiative is expected to generate up to $250 million in GDP over five years. A federal program administered by regional development agencies and Canada Economic Development, Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC operates 267 non-profit offices across Canada delivering small business loans, tools, training and events. "This initiative aims to increase the support provided to the 520,000 entrepreneurs living in rural and remote areas who grow our economy”, said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions. "It leverages the complementary strengths of both organizations-BDC's financing and advisory expertise and Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC's deep local presence across the country.” "At BDC, we believe that every entrepreneur, no matter where they live, deserves a fair chance to grow their business. "This initiative with Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC allows us to do what a development bank should: go where others don't, and build bridges where gaps exist. We're unlocking potential that's been overlooked for too long. We believe that's what our economy needs right now.” "Joining forces with BDC to supercharge the opportunities and resources available to rural and remote entrepreneurs from coast-to-coast-to-coast is a powerful combination that will result in significant impact throughout the country for decades to come," said Troy Dungate, President of Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC. Additionally, we know that many entrepreneurs in rural Canada are attracted to the work because of the desirable lifestyle it creates for their families. Working together, we expect this to make positive, meaningful change in the lives of individual Canadians and our country as a whole.” This initiative with Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC builds on BDC's broader commitment to develop entrepreneurial potential in all its forms and to help grow the Canadian economy. Since launching our Community Banking initiative in November 2024, BDC teamed up with financial institutions and community lending partners that support underserved groups. By joining this network of trusted partners, Community Futures/SADC+CAE/CBDC should help us reach even more business owners in rural and remote areas. It's about meeting entrepreneurs where they are and helping them grow. This announcement comes just before Small Business Week, a national celebration of Canadian entrepreneurship that BDC has organized for more than 45 years. About BDC: 80 years as Canada's bank for entrepreneurs BDC is a partner of choice for all entrepreneurs looking to access the financing and advice they need to build their businesses and tackle the big challenges of our time. Our investment arm, BDC Capital, offers a wide range of risk capital solutions to help grow the most innovative firms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin could reclaim its all-time high of $125,100 in the coming week, but not without one more major correction, according to veteran trader Peter Brandt. “Either a huge shakeout, which would be confirmed by an ATH quickly within the next week or so,” he said, though he acknowledged there could also be a much more bearish outcome. The crypto market crashed on Friday after US President Donald Trump's announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, resulting in over $19 billion in liquidations across the market. “If anything, this weekend was a reminder you have to be so careful with leverage, and even multiples above 1.5x are dangerous,” Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards told Cointelegraph. “They do, and you need to always consider multi-year, long-term risk,” he said. Other analysts remain optimistic, citing broader macroeconomic signals as indications that fresh capital could flow into the cryptocurrency market in the coming weeks. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said in an X post on Tuesday that a buying opportunity may be presenting itself in the crypto market after US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that quantitative tightening “is over.” Quantitative easing is bullish for crypto as it encourages banks to lend more and makes borrowing cheaper for consumers and businesses through lower interest rates.
