                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A low-fat vegan diet that doesn't limit calories or carbohydrates could help people with type 1 diabetes reduce insulin use and insulin costs, according to new research by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine published in BMC Nutrition. Insulin is a hormone that helps move glucose (sugar) from the blood into muscle and liver cells to be used as energy. People with type 1 diabetes must take insulin because their body doesn't produce enough. Some people with type 1 diabetes may need to take additional insulin, because they have insulin resistance, a condition in which cells don't respond well to insulin and glucose remains in the blood. Insulin resistance is strongly influenced by dietary fat, which can inhibit glucose from entering the cells. Total insulin costs decreased by 27%, or $1.08 per day, in the vegan group, compared to no significant change in the portion-controlled group. The 2024 study found that a vegan diet also led to an average weight loss of 11 pounds, improved insulin sensitivity and glycemic control, and improved cholesterol levels and kidney function in people with type 1 diabetes. The inflation-adjusted cost of insulin increased by 24% from 2017 to 2022. As insulin prices continue to rise, people with type 1 diabetes should consider a low-fat vegan diet, which can help improve their insulin sensitivity and reduce the amount of insulin they need, potentially saving them hundreds of dollars a year."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Older adults, especially those living with health conditions, who hold positive views about aging are more likely to engage in vigorous physical activity, according to a study led by the University of Surrey. Surrey researchers found that how an individual's outlook on aging - whether they see it as a time of growth or decline - is a significant correlate of their physical activity levels. The research, published on Healthcare, analysed data from 1,699 UK residents aged 50 and over, and found that positive views on aging were linked to a greater likelihood of engaging in vigorous activity. People with a higher number of non-communicable diseases - such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease - were more likely to engage in vigorous physical activity if they had a more positive view of aging. Our research suggests that a positive outlook on aging could act as a psychological buffer, helping individuals stay active despite health challenges. Addressing people's beliefs about aging may be just as important as addressing their physical health needs, which should be considered when designing public health strategies to promote a healthy and active lifestyle." The researchers propose that public health campaigns and interventions should support older people to maintain a positive attitude towards physical activity, even if they experience illness or long-term conditions. So, promoting positive views on aging can be important not only to promote health, but also to improve the quality of life in older people who experience one or more health conditions. These efforts could help older adults reframe aging not as a period of inevitable decline, but as a life stage where it is still possible to maintain an active and engaged lifestyle. "The ultimate goal is to create a society where an active and engaged later life is not only possible but expected, even in the presence of health challenges."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Polyethyleneimines (PEIs) are extensively researched as non-viral vectors for gene and medication delivery because of their capacity to condense nucleic acids into nanoparticles known as polyplexes.1 However, their clinical translation has been hampered due to low transfection efficiencies.3 The type of polyplex formation, which regulates cellular absorption and intracellular release, is an important element in managing transfection. Effective delivery systems require polyplexes that are sturdy enough to avoid premature nucleic acid release, while remaining weak enough to release the payload at the appropriate time and position within the cell.4 Understanding the intermolecular interactions and conformational changes involved in polyplex synthesis and stability is critical for enhancing PEI-based delivery platforms. According to Mustafa et al., attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy is ideal for this application.5 This article shows how ATR-FTIR can be utilized to characterize polyplex production using linear and branching PEI architectures. Mustafa et al. provide a detailed discussion of their procedures. Polyplexes were generated at N/P ratios ranging from zero to three in 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). To confirm the spectrum interpretation, additional samples were generated at increasing sodium chloride concentrations (50-250 mM) to test for electrostatic interactions. All spectra were background removed, baseline corrected, and normalized. Figure 1 shows ATR-FTIR spectra of DNA with increasing N/P ratios for LPEI and BPEI. With LPEI, the asymmetric phosphate stretching band at 1222 cm-1 shows a noticeable frequency shift as N/P rises, showing strong electrostatic binding to the DNA backbone. This frequency shift also signals a conformational change in the DNA structure, from B to Z. Moderate alterations were found in the nucleobase ring stretching region (1400-1500 cm-1) and carbonyl band (1680 cm-1). These modifications imply that LPEI interacts weakly with DNA nucleobases. The spectra of BPEI-based polyplexes exhibited no shift at 1222 cm-1, but a considerable intensity decrease and splitting of the 1680 cm-1 band, indicating interactions with nucleobases via intercalation, without major disruption of the phosphate backbone. Figure 2 shows that increasing NaCl reduced LPEI binding by around 70 %, consistent with electrostatic interactions. This study shows that ATR-FTIR with the ConcentratIR2 accessory may successfully distinguish between binding modes in PEI-DNA polyplexes. These findings serve as a foundation for developing more successful non-viral gene delivery technologies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Surveys of more than 1,000 Italian patients and clinicians uncover why oral steroid use remains widespread in asthma care, revealing gaps in guideline adherence, patient education, and access to advanced biologic therapies. Study: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients with asthma: how far is clinical practice from the guidelines? Results from surveys of patients and doctors. A recent Frontiers in Allergy study examined usage patterns and barriers to adherence to oral corticosteroid (OCS) treatment guidelines for asthma in Italy. To do so, surveys were conducted with healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients. Asthma affects an estimated 262 million people worldwide, with the highest incidence seen in children under nine. Globally, its prevalence has increased by about 15% between 1990 and 2019. In Italy alone, around 4 million people live with asthma, including approximately 200,000 with severe asthma (SA), a group that represents a substantial burden on healthcare resources and costs. The management of SA often requires the use of long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs). Existing guidelines recommend the use of OCS only as a last option due to severe adverse effects, such as growth impairment in children and iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency. Despite this, OCS medications are commonly prescribed in asthma treatment. However, patients have their concerns, and research shows that about 44% of adults report worries about OCS use, sometimes leading them to reduce or discontinue treatment without medical supervision by HCPs. Therefore, a gap exists between clinical practice and guidelines, which needs to be examined. To address the knowledge gap between guidelines and clinical practice concerning asthma treatment, the Respiriamo Insieme Association in Italy, in collaboration with Sanofi, conducted two surveys among HCPs (survey 1) and patients (survey 2). Survey 1 comprised seven closed-ended questions (six multiple-choice and one rating scale) and gathered insights into the OCS prescribing practices, barriers to proper use, potential overuse patterns, and adherence to current guidelines. Survey 2 explored patients' perspectives on awareness and involvement in treatment decisions, usage patterns, treatment adjustment and monitoring, education provided by HCPs, management of adverse events (AEs), and safety practices concerning OCS use. A duration of more than 21 days was preferred by 14% of HCPs, and the remaining opted for longer treatment durations. Ninety-nine percent of HCPs said that either more than 6 months of OCS use per year or 2 or 3 cycles per year was necessary to classify a patient as OCS-dependent. The remaining 1% thought a single cycle was enough. Concerning the annual cumulative corticosteroid use, 28% reported never keeping track of the total OCS dose for their patients, 40% reported doing this, 24% did this occasionally, and the remaining 8% based their calculations on prescribed OCS doses. Twenty-seven percent of HCPs thought the maximum safe daily dose was 7.5 mg/day, while 43% put this at 5 mg/day. This was closely followed by using biologic therapies (37%). More than half of the HCPs thought that a multidisciplinary approach is crucial to prevent adverse effects of OCS, and about 44% recommended monitoring visits for bone densitometry every two years. Around 47% of SA patients used OCS more than once, for at least two cycles per year, compared with 27% of non-SA patients. Forty-seven percent of SA patients and 24% of non-SA patients used OCS once a year or more without a valid prescription. In about 71% of SA patients, the physician involved them in the decision to take OCS, compared to 43% for non-SA patients. Among the SA patients, 41% were informed about potential side effects, while 57% reported not being referred to a specialist. Most patients did not receive a bone health assessment. The study also found that about 40% of patients self-administered OCS at least once per year without a prescription, often due to fear of exacerbations or difficulty accessing healthcare. This reflects the ease of access to OCS without a prescription in Italy. A much higher proportion of SA patients acquired OCS without a valid prescription, relative to non-SA patients. The findings show a significant discrepancy between guideline recommendations and clinical practice, and OCS use remains very high in Italy. Reducing unnecessary OCS use through biologic therapies could also help lower healthcare costs. A key limitation of the study was the inability to distinguish between respondents from pediatric and adult care settings. This may have led to misinterpretation of notable differences in OCS use between adults and children. Finally, the results may not be generalizable to other populations as the study was conducted on a selected set of Italian HCPs and patients. The study underscores the persistence of high OCS use despite guideline recommendations, highlighting the need for coordinated education, standardized monitoring, and integrated psychological and specialist care to reduce unnecessary OCS exposure in severe asthma management.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rapid and urgent action on food is needed if the UK is to reboot its flagging economy, save the NHS billions, ensure national food security, and meet climate commitments, according to a new report. It says if we do not act now, change will be forced upon us by increasing pressures and the UK will lurch from crisis to crisis, including from food price shocks, climate disasters and weakening economic productivity. Acting now however, allows the UK to decide its own future, and must include three core transformations: more resilient farming, smarter land use, and healthier diets. The report is published as renewed attention is being given to global food system transformation, including through the EAT-Lancet Commission's latest report released earlier this month. Through these three transformations we can reduce pressure on the NHS and help people lead healthier and more economically active lives. "Pressures from climate change, global shocks and poor diets mean significant change to our food system is inevitable over the next 50 years. However, if we act now, we still have time to shape our future, and positively impact national security, national health, economic growth and climate change. Our window to act is narrow though - if we do not, change will be forced on us by crisis," added Professor Ward. Meanwhile, poor diets cost the economy £268 billion a year in direct healthcare costs as well as indirect costs such as low economic activity, and 7.2 million people now live in food-insecure households - an increase of 80% in just three years. Adding to these challenges, the UK is vulnerable to supply chain disruptions, since it is dependent on imports for 50% of vegetables and 85% of fruit, despite these being essential to healthy diets. The Roadmap calls for transformation in three key areas: The authors set out 10 priority actions, urging the government to work in partnership with farmers, food companies and local authorities. We call on all parties, public institutions, industry and civil society to unite to drive forwards the transformations highlighted in this Roadmap. "The AFN Network+ has brought together a powerful community of research leaders and stakeholders across UK agri-food, third sector organisations, policymakers and agri-food industry professionals to tackle this challenge and now delivered a clear roadmap for change. "Our investment has resulted in a legacy of insights which will help shape future land use and food strategy, supporting the UK's path to net zero." The Roadmap for Resilience: A UK Food Plan for 2050 was developed by the AFN Network+, drawing on insights from across its community of more than 3,000 members.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first full-length structures of two heat shock chaperone proteins in a complex reveal the key structural region regulating their function, according to a new study from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The chaperone complex binds misfolded proteins and gives them another chance to fold correctly. This process is essential for cells because improperly folded proteins tend to aggregate, potentially causing a diverse array of diseases. However, the mechanism by which these two major heat shock chaperone proteins, Hsp40 and Hsp70, bind each other and misfolded peptides was unclear. The findings were published today in Molecular Cell. "Heat shock chaperone proteins form the first line of defense against protein misfolding and aggregation, a precursor to many diseases," said corresponding author Charalampos Babis Kalodimos, PhD, St. Jude Department of Structural Biology chair. We showed how these two particular heat shock chaperone proteins come together, revealing a previously unknown set of mechanisms explaining how they work in tandem, and how they can malfunction." Charalampos Babis Kalodimos, Department of Structural Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Heat shock chaperone proteins are essential in most organisms, with similar versions present from bacteria to humans. Bacterial Hsp40 and Hsp70 are known to help misfolded proteins correctly refold, with decades of research into their function as chaperone proteins. The human versions of these proteins are also linked to several diseases. However, exactly how Hsp40 and Hsp90 bind a client protein and each other was unknown, because no one had been able to overcome the technical hurdles involved in capturing the massive full-length structure. Instead of using a single approach, the St. Jude scientists combined cryogenic electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and X-ray crystallography data to finally solve the bacterial complex's structure. "Most importantly, we captured the full-length structures of the active and inhibited states, bound to an incorrectly folded protein," Kalodimos said. By assembling them together, they've given us a new model of how the Hsp40 and Hsp70 complex really functions." Mutations in a specific region of Hsp40 are associated with an array of ailments, including many neurodegenerative diseases, but how those mutations disrupt normal functions was unknown. The region is rich in highly conserved amino acids called glycines and phenylalanines, though their exact functions were unclear. The structures revealed that this region of Hsp40 binds a client protein first, then a particular phenylalanine binds to the substrate binding site on Hsp70. "But then, by having structures of the complex in multiple states, we also saw how the complex releases client proteins." Afterward, Hsp40 leaves Hsp70 and is then available to bind another misfolded protein, starting the process again. "Using that knowledge, we have a starting place to look for therapeutic interventions to compensate for disease-causing mutations, to exploit as drug targets in cancers or inspire next-generation antibiotics."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a compelling Genomic Press Interview published today in Genomic Psychiatry, Dr. Najaf Amin unveils transformative insights that fundamentally reshape international understanding of depression genetics. The Oxford University Associate Professor, ranked among the top scientists globally in genetics and the top women in science worldwide, shares ground breaking discoveries that promise to revolutionize how researchers across continents approach major depression. With over 350 peer-reviewed publications and an exceptional h-index of 125, Dr. Amin has positioned herself at the vanguard of molecular epidemiology, challenging long-held paradigms about depression pathogenesis through innovative multi-omics approaches that extend far beyond traditional genetic frameworks. The interview, published as part of the Innovators & Ideas series, reveals how Dr. Amin transformed early career setbacks into scientific breakthroughs that now influence research laboratories from Europe to Asia. Her journey from Pakistan to becoming one of Oxford's leading molecular epidemiologists exemplifies the power of perseverance in advancing global medical knowledge. When traditional genome-wide association studies failed to produce significant results for depression, Dr. Amin pioneered alternative approaches that have since yielded extraordinary discoveries benefiting researchers and patients worldwide. Dr. Amin's identification of the RCL1 gene mutation represents a watershed moment in depression research, opening entirely new avenues for understanding the disorder's biological mechanisms. This discovery connects primate-specific interlaminar astrocytes to depression pathogenesis, providing researchers worldwide with novel therapeutic targets previously unexplored. Her work challenges the conventional view of depression as primarily a neurotransmitter imbalance, instead revealing it as a systemic disease involving multiple bodily systems. The scope of her contributions extends beyond single gene discoveries. Leading the most extensive published studies on epigenomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiome in major depression, Dr. Amin has identified 124 metabolites associated with the disorder, with 49 being entirely novel discoveries. These findings, published in prestigious journals including Nature Communications and JAMA Psychiatry, provide the international scientific community with crucial biomarkers that could revolutionize diagnosis and treatment approaches globally. This conceptualization transforms how researchers worldwide approach the condition, encouraging investigation of immune system disturbances, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction, oxidative stress, and metabolic perturbations. Her integrative approach, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and single-cell analysis, provides unprecedented molecular insights that benefit laboratories across continents pursuing personalized medicine approaches. This holistic view influences treatment strategies globally, moving beyond one-size-fits-all models toward personalized interventions tailored to individual biological markers, life histories, and environmental contexts. The implications extend to public health policies worldwide, as her research demonstrates why depression contributes to higher morbidity and mortality through its effects on multiple physiological systems. The narrative of overcoming significant personal and professional obstacles, including navigating academia as a brown woman from a developing country, resonates with scientists worldwide facing similar barriers. Her mentor, Professor Cornelia van Duijn, played a pivotal role in transforming these setbacks into opportunities for growth. This relationship exemplifies the importance of mentorship in fostering scientific excellence across cultural and geographic boundaries. Dr. Amin's observation that she must invest "at least twice the effort" of many European counterparts to achieve comparable outcomes highlights persistent inequities requiring international attention and reform. This comprehensive approach promises to benefit healthcare systems worldwide by enabling more effective prevention and intervention strategies. The research particularly emphasizes understanding how discoveries apply across diverse populations, ensuring that advances in depression genetics benefit people regardless of geographic location or ethnic background. Dr. Amin's work on rare variants demonstrates that population-specific genetic factors require consideration in developing truly global solutions to depression treatment. Dr. Najaf Amin's Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today's most influential scientific breakthroughs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The brain's mechanisms for repairing injuries caused by trauma or degenerative diseases are not yet known in detail. Now, a study by the University of Barcelona describes a new strategy based on stem cell therapy that could enhance neuronal regeneration and neuroplasticity when this vital organ is damaged. BDNF is a protein that is synthesised mainly in the brain and plays a key role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. Several studies have described its potential to promote neuronal survival and growth, findings that are now extended by the new study. The skin cells must first be reprogrammed to become induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and then differentiated to obtain neuronal cultures." This study confirms the beneficial effects of this growth factor in neuronal cultures derived from human stem cells, the same cells that are used in cell therapy to treat, for example, stroke in animal models. When these neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are modified to continuously overexpress the BDNF protein, "we obtain more mature and active neuronal cultures, without altering the normal organization of their connections or the functional networks," explains researcher Alba Ortega.The study focuses on the more functional aspects of neuronal regeneration, such as neuronal activity and axon generation, which are directly involved in the integration of cells that are transplanted into the brain. "In addition, cells that produce BDNF are able to attract axons — the extensions that allow communication between neurons — more efficiently. BDNF's ability to attract growing axons has been described previously. Now, the team shows this effect for the first time in neurons derived from human stem cells using a microfluidic chip system. This innovative technology — with two chambers that isolate populations of neurons with or without the ability to produce BDNF — makes it possible to grow populations of neurons communicating through small channels and thus observe precisely how they interact with each other. Neurodegenerative diseases and neuronal injuries, which are increasingly frequent in the population, are one of the major challenges for healthcare systems. As the endogenous regenerative capacity of the human brain is very limited, lesions only partially recover and affected patients are often left with motor and cognitive sequelae. In this context, there is an urgent need to design strategies that complement these endogenous brain mechanisms with human stem cell-based therapies to promote neuronal repair, functional integration and more efficient recovery. In this regard, the team plans to transfer these results to animal models, a line of research developed for some time in this laboratory to improve human stem cell therapy in ischaemic stroke lesions affecting the cerebral cortex. The application of preclinical advances in patients will mark a turning point in the treatment of many neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are still many obstacles to implementing stem cell-based therapies and avoiding potential side effects (tumour generation, etc.). Some international clinical trials based on stem cell transplantation for the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease (in Japan, Sweden and the United States) are showing promising results. "Although there are many challenges, progress in Parkinson's clinical trials shows that we are closer than ever to applying these therapies safely in patients with stroke or other neurodegenerative diseases," the experts conclude.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may ameliorate liver inflammation and modulate immune responses. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of combining TCM with pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN) α-2b and its impact on myelosuppression adverse effects. This study included 117 HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients who started initial antiviral therapy at Xiamen Hospital of TCM between June 2018 and January 2023. This study retrospectively analyzed etiological indicators, liver biochemical indicators, and blood routine tests before and after treatment. After 24 and 48 weeks of treatment, the observation group demonstrated significantly superior outcomes to the control group in quantitative reduction of hepatitis B surface antigen, the serological conversion rate of HBeAg, and the reduction in HBV DNA quantification (P < 0.05). Real-world findings demonstrate that adjunctive TCM significantly enhances the antiviral efficacy of peginterferon α-2b in HBeAg-positive CHB patients while concurrently mitigating treatment-limiting myelosuppression. This combination strategy may represent a clinically valuable approach to optimizing interferon-based therapy for CHB.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When doctors analyze a medical scan of an organ or area in the body, each part of the image has to be assigned an anatomical label. If the brain is under scrutiny for instance, its different parts have to be labeled as such, pixel by pixel: cerebral cortex, brain stem, cerebellum, etc. The process, called medical image segmentation, guides diagnosis, surgery planning and research. In the days before artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), clinicians performed this crucial yet painstaking and time-consuming task by hand, but over the past decade, U-nets ⎯ a type of AI architecture specifically designed for medical image segmentation ⎯ have been the go-to instead. However, U-nets require large amounts of data and resources to be trained. "For large and/or 3D images, these demands are costly," said Kushal Vyas, a Rice electrical and computer engineering doctoral student and first author on a paper presented at the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Society, or MICCAI, the leading conference in the field. "In this study, we proposed MetaSeg, a completely new way of performing image segmentation." In experiments using 2D and 3D brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, MetaSeg was shown to achieve the same segmentation performance as U-Nets while needing 90% fewer parameters ⎯ the key variables AI/ML models derive from training data and use to identify patterns and make predictions. The study, titled "Fit Pixels, Get Labels: Meta-learned Implicit Networks for Image Segmentation," won the best paper award at MICCAI, getting recognized from a pool of over 1,000 accepted submissions. Instead of U-Nets, MetaSeg leverages implicit neural representations ⎯ a neural network framework that has hitherto not been thought useful or explored for image segmentation." An implicit neural representation (INR) is an AI network that interprets a medical image as a mathematical formula that accounts for the signal value (color, brightness, etc.) While INRs offer a very detailed yet compact way to represent information, they are also highly specific, meaning they typically only work well for the single signal/image they trained on: An INR trained on a brain MRI cannot typically generalize rules about what different parts of the brain look like, so if provided with an image of a different brain, the INR would typically falter. "INRs have been used in the computer vision and medical imaging communities for tasks such as 3D scene reconstruction and signal compression, which only require modeling one signal at a time," Vyas said. "However, it was not obvious before MetaSeg how to use them for tasks such as segmentation, which require learning patterns over many signals." "We prime the INR model parameters in such a way so that they are further optimized on an unseen image at test time, which enables the model to decode the image features into accurate labels," Vyas said. This special training allows the INRs to not only quickly adjust themselves to match the pixels or voxels of a previously unseen medical image but to then also decode its labels, instantly predicting where the outlines for different anatomical regions should go. "MetaSeg offers a fresh, scalable perspective to the field of medical image segmentation that has been dominated for a decade by U-Nets," said Guha Balakrishnan, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Rice and a member of the university's Ken Kennedy Institute. "Our research results promise to make medical image segmentation far more cost-effective while delivering top performance." While MetaSeg can be applied to a range of imaging contexts, its demonstrated potential to enhance brain imaging illustrates the kind of research Proposition 14 ⎯ on the ballot in Texas Nov. 4 ⎯ could help expand statewide.
