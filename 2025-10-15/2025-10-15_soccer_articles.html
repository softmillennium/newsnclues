                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trinity Rodman, one of the scoring stars of the Olympic gold medal run in Paris last year, is returning to the U.S. women's national soccer team in time for its match at Rentschler Field Oct. 26. But she has returned to her pro team and was called up to the 26-player USWNT roster announced Wednesday by coach Emma Hayes. “There has been a big gap from July until now and we've watched many club games. Stratford's Alyssa Naeher, who retired after an history-making career as America's goalkeeper, will be honored before the game at Rentschler at 4 p.m., following the U.S. men's deaf national team's friendly match against Germany, which starts at 1 p.m. But Rodman has five goals in 11 games since returning to the Spirit. “When she came in in April, I think she really felt she was in a good place, but the reality was having so much adrenaline got us through that game,” Hayes told reporters on a Zoom call Wednesday. “But afterwards, that reality hit home that there were some issues in her back that were unresolved and, collectively with club and country, we took the time to say, look, we've got to get it right for the long term. And I think that club and country collaboration has really put her in the position she's in right now.” CT's Alyssa Naeher posts third straight shutout as US women's soccer team clinches gold Over her career, Rodman has played 47 games with USWNT, scoring 11 goals. Hayes gave many of her European pro players a break from action during the summer, but has reassembled most of her top players for this game in East Hartford, in which she will probably have 23 active. Forwards: Michelle Cooper, Catarina Macario, Trinity Rodman, Yazmeen Ryan, Emma Sears, Ally Sentnor, Alyssa Thompson. ‘Pathetic' no more, Hartford Athletic soccer team finally brings home the trophy</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Massachusetts Democratic leaders on Wednesday questioned, if not outright scoffed at, President Trump's threat that he could “take away” the 2026 World Cup matches scheduled to be played in Massachusetts over public safety concerns in Boston, and instead suggested the Republican should pull out a map. “First of all, he's talking about the crime rate in Boston. The World Cup is going to be played in Foxborough, so he should check his geography before he does anything else,” Massachusetts House Speaker Ron Mariano told reporters Wednesday at the State House. “So I don't know what basis he's got to make a statement like that.” Trump said Tuesday that if he felt there were “unsafe conditions” in Boston, he would ask FIFA president Gianni Infantino to move the matches to another location. There are currently seven matches scheduled to be played at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough next year. Eleven U.S. cities — plus others in Mexico and Canada — are under contract with FIFA to play host to the tournament, meaning Trump has no direct control over where matches are played. Trump on Tuesday suggested that Infantino “wouldn't love” to move matches, “but he'd do it very easily.” “We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup matches. “There's no ability to take away the World Cup games,” said Wu, who is running unopposed for another term in November's election. “There's no real threat when it comes to saying cities are so unsafe that they can't host the Games.” Massachusetts House leaders have proposed setting aside at least $10 million for costs related to hosting the 2026 World Cup matches as part of a supplemental spending bill. State Representative Aaron Michlewitz, the chamber's budget chief and a North End Democrat, said Boston is one of the country's safest major cities and framed Trump's comments as reacting to “a video or two” showing crime in Boston. “What does one have to do with soccer games being played in Foxborough? Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox said cars and unruly crowds have been descending on intersections across the country for the past few years, and called it a “culture trend” fueled largely by social media.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tuesday was the second time Trump has threatened to take away World Cup games from US host cities on the basis of their political leadership or opposition to his policies. However, it's important to note that this suggestion of moving games is not something Trump has suggested organically, of his own volition. On 25 September in an Oval Office event, a member of the White House press corps asked Trump about cities that have demonstrated against Trump's use of federal agencies for immigration and crime crackdowns. The reporter mentioned Seattle and San Francisco as two cities that have seen demonstrations, and pointed out that both cities are World Cup hosts (though San Francisco is not a host city, but part of the San Francisco Bay Area that will host games at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara). “I guess, but we're going to make sure they're safe,” Trump said. Later Trump said that Chicago would be safe for the World Cup after he sends in federal agencies in a similar manner as Washington DC. We'll move it around a little bit,” Trump said. Three weeks later, on 14 October, Trump was asked about another host city, Boston, even though the games themselves will be held in suburban Foxborough, Massachusetts. Towards the end of that day's press event, a reporter asked Trump about a recent “street takeover” in Boston that saw police officers attacked and a police car set aflame, and if the concerns raised by the incident could result in the revocation of hosting duties for next year's expanded 48-team soccer tournament. “We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. “Their mayor is not good … She's radical left, and they're taking over parts of Boston. Street takeovers, a social media-driven phenomenon that sees large crowds of people gather on city streets late at night to perform stunts in cars, have been a repeated nuisance in American cities since the Covid-19 pandemic shutdowns. However, the gatherings are generally not seen as being tied to any particular political ideology, nor have they been touted as a large-scale safety concern for World Cup attendees. “If someone is doing a bad job, and I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni [Infantino], the head of Fifa, who is phenomenal, and say let's move it to another location,” Trump said on Tuesday. Though the deal involves a public government, it is essentially a private business deal, and the US president does not have authority to cancel it on his own. That could include withholding federal funding from the cities as he has for various other aspects of American life. It could also include an appeal to Fifa president Gianni Infantino, who has carefully cultivated a close relationship with Trump since the US president's return to office. The clause essentially states that by agreeing to be a World Cup host city, Seattle also agrees to do a number of different (and often expensive) things to increase public safety, including the deployment of additional security measures and transportation methods, plus the assumption of various financial liabilities. Fifa could in theory point to that clause as reasoning for revoking Seattle's status as a World Cup host city if it feels like safety standards are woefully behind. Any World Cup is a gigantic logistical affair, let alone one spread across three countries and 16 host cities featuring more teams than ever before. It's hard enough for Fifa to create the match schedule and oversee teams' travel. It's easy to assume it would be the subject of legal action on behalf of the host city as well. So far, it has been mostly promotional and/or threatening in nature. Trump convened a World Cup task force earlier this year headed by Andrew Giuliani, with a stated mission of “facilitat[ing] comprehensive planning, organization, and execution of the largest sporting events in the history of mankind.” The federal government also has a role in approving visas for visitors from other countries, but processing times for those have ballooned to such a level that many fear that they won't have visas approved in time for the games themselves. One can presume that FBI agents and potentially those from Homeland Security and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) will be dispatched to World Cup host cities with the stated intention of providing an additional layer of security on top of local police. So far, Fifa president Gianni Infantino has said nothing publicly about Trump's threat. Fifa vice-president Victor Montagliani, a Canadian, was far more direct speaking at a London conference in early October, responding to Trump's comments about Seattle and San Francisco. A Fifa spokesperson told Politico “Safety and security are of the utmost importance at all FIFA events worldwide and it is ultimately the government's responsibility to decide what's in the best interest of public safety. We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to fulfill all necessary requirements for a successful 2026 World Cup.” Outside of Fifa, Wu responded to Trump's threat by pointing out that much of Fifa's host city agreements are “locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it. “We're in a world where for drama, for control, for pushing the boundaries … ongoing threats … are issued to individuals and communities who refuse to back down and comply or be obedient to a hateful agenda.” Only in cases of extreme and/or unexpected health and safety concerns, war, or other political disturbance. Indonesia does not maintain formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has broadly supported Palestine. Indonesia later hosted that year's U-17 World Cup after Peru pulled out of hosting. Likely because he has made that topic a feature of his administration. It is the guise under which he has deployed the national guard, Ice, and other federal agencies to Washington DC, Chicago and other cities. The fact that safety is a genuine and justified concern at any major gathering of people – especially one as vast as the World Cup – makes it an easy line to fall back on for his administration. When Washington has intervened in many other aspects of American life, the targeted institutions have often complied or tried to negotiate. It remains to be seen if Fifa or the IOC will take that path – if indeed Trump decides to pursue this at all.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Driving through the Highway 99 tunnel in Seattle could be pricier during next summer's FIFA World Cup. Commissioners heard Tuesday that their staff are evaluating potential increases of 50 cents and $1 that would be imposed between June 1 and July 15, 2026, the period in which six World Cup contests are scheduled at Lumen Field in downtown Seattle. Doing nothing is an option too, said Carl See, the commission deputy director. There will be training locations and fan zones in the state, too. RELATED: Photos: Seattle celebrates fútbol in trial run for 2026 World Cup State lawmakers earmarked roughly $24 million in the current transportation budget for World Cup-related expenses. Those dollars will come out of the tunnel toll revenue account. Lawmakers assumed that sum could be covered from a temporary toll rate increase but didn't mandate one. Roughly 47,000 vehicles travel through the tunnel each day based on a July 2024 analysis. They are collected in both directions as one exits the tunnel. Drivers pay an extra 25 cents per trip with the Pay By Plate option, in which they register their license plate on a Good To Go! There is a $2 fee tacked on if you pay by mail. What will be studied are potential increases of 50 cents per trip and $1 per trip that would be imposed at all times, including on weekends. In December, staff will present the commission with projections of how much money might be generated from those assessments and how many drivers might choose to use local roads and Interstate 5 to avoid higher tolls. See cautioned that he didn't want to “overpromise” what data would be delivered. If approved, this would be the first such temporary toll-rate hike, he said. Given the short six-week duration and uniqueness of the sporting event, it will be hard to model for every possible factor with precision, he said. If the commission decides to proceed with a one-time temporary toll rate increase, it would conduct a rate-setting process including gathering public input on potential rate options.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's suggestion that he could move 2026 World Cup games out of U.S. cities he deems unsafe rippled through soccer and political circles in late September. It sparked a wide range of reactions, many tinged with confusion, because the U.S. government had no official role in choosing World Cup host cities; and it does not have any explicit authority to relocate World Cup games. Nonetheless, Trump's comments elicited responses from host city mayors and World Cup organizers. Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell ripped Trump's “ignorance,” and said in a statement: “We're working every day to make the World Cup a safe, welcoming, and fun experience.” The following is a rundown of what else has been said and whether games could actually be moved. The reporter continued: “You have a number of cities that are pushing back against your immigration and deportation, as well as your crime initiatives.” Trump interjected again: “I don't think they're very much pushing back at all.” The reporter went on: “But some of those cities have World Cup games. Trump cut him off yet again: “They're gonna be very secure.” “It will be safe for the World Cup,” he said, despite both Memphis and Chicago also being uninvolved. He then went on another tangent about JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, who has accused Trump of deploying National Guard troops to Democrat-controlled cities in an effort to exert “authoritarian” control ahead of next year's midterm elections. Trump concluded: “If any city we think is gonna be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup … we won't allow it to go to [those cities], we'll move it around a little bit. When repeating his remarks in another Oval Office media session, Trump said he would call in a personal favor with FIFA president Gianni Infantino. The World Cup is owned and operated by FIFA, soccer's global governing body. Trump, therefore, cannot unilaterally cancel those contracts and move games to other cities. The contracts, some of which have been obtained via public records requests, do require cities to implement robust security and public safety measures. If FIFA deems a city unsafe, it could, potentially, terminate the agreements and relocate matches. “Public safety officials, including our Republican-appointed Police Board, are working daily to ensure the games in Kansas City are safe for all,” Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas told The Athletic in a statement via a spokeswoman. In December will bring the World Cup Draw to Washington, D.C., largely so that Trump can be involved. Trump, in theory, could leverage this relationship and push Infantino to pull games out of cities whose mayors resist him, which is what he insinuated in his Oct. 14 remarks. After the initial suggestion, FIFA did not give a statement, but in responding to a query from Politico following Trump's doubling-down, a FIFA spokesperson said, “Safety and security are of the utmost importance at all FIFA events worldwide and it is ultimately the government's responsibility to decide what's in the best interest of public safety. We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to fulfill all necessary requirements for a successful 2026 World Cup.” Trump's other potential lever is the $625 million in security funds that Congress allocated to World Cup cities this summer. That money will be split proportionally — not equally — among the 11 U.S. host cities, depending on their needs. The cities will submit their costs and requests for reimbursement, according to Andrew Giuliani, head of the White House's World Cup task force. It's unclear if Trump, who chairs the task force, could potentially politicize and withhold some of that funding. Trump has clashed with Democratic mayors throughout his second term over immigration policy and other topics. After his federal takeover of D.C., he has threatened to send troops to Chicago and other cities, even as many mayors and governors say that crime is not out of control and federal assistance is not necessary or welcome. The World Cup host cities in left-leaning states with Democratic mayors that Trump could target would include Seattle, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Boston. Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas and Kansas City are also led by Democrats. The U.S. men's national team is due to play its group games in L.A. and Seattle. At this stage, eight-and-a-half months out from the World Cup opener, finding new host cities would be unrealistic. It would be extremely difficult for a 12th city to cram all that planning into eight months. FIFA set the World Cup schedule, complete with dates and locations, in 2024. According to one person briefed on the planning efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose details, FIFA has previously told local organizers that it will not be relocating games. “The facts are clear: violent crime is down 20% in Seattle. We are making record-breaking progress on police hiring with nearly 130 officers hired this year. My proposed 2026 budget also makes additional investments in safety preparations for the World Cup, including new removable vehicle barriers at Pike Place Market and Seattle Center campus. “While we are doing our part to make safety improvements ahead of hosting games, the Trump administration has made our city less safe by withholding critical funding for counterterrorism tools. While the City's lawsuit has successfully released a portion of this funding, President Trump's words about safety don't align with his administration's actions. A spokesperson for Harrell had previously told KOMO News: “While the president continues to peddle baseless, divisive, and empty threats, our administration is doing the hard work to prepare for this opportunity. We're advancing plans with FIFA and local partners to ensure Seattle is a destination and that we make the most of this special event.” Hana Tadesse, a spokeswoman for the Seattle World Cup host committee, wrote in a statement to The Athletic: “We are committed to ensuring a safe, welcoming, and memorable experience for fans, players, visitors, and residents alike. Since being selected by FIFA as a host city, we've worked closely with them, the White House Task Force for FIFA World Cup 26, community partners, and law enforcement, and are confident in our planning and coordination in advance of next summer's matches. Seattle looks forward to shining on the world stage and hosting an event that is not only spectacular, but safe for all.” Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who has previously said that “Boston will not back down” from the Trump administration amid legal threats over immigration policies, initially said in response to a question about Trump's World Cup comments: “We are very excited for the summer that Boston will have next year. It's going to be an incredible show of what our city's made of as we welcome people from all over the world [for the World Cup and other events]. With Boston specifically targeted in Trump's latest threat, Wu simply said, “Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions.” Planning for World Cup is already underway, and we are fully committed to delivering an unforgettable tournament that this country, and this region, will be proud of well beyond 2026.” Philadelphia Soccer 2026 said in a statement to The Athletic: “We appreciate President Trump's commitment to safety and security for this global event, and we share that same commitment, as do our colleagues across the nation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Along with Haji Wright, who scored both goals Tuesday against Australia, Balogun has given the U.S. soccer team a desperately needed scoring threat. So why do people in the sport often say that scoring a goal is the hardest thing to do? It surely can't be that difficult to run forward, have a teammate pass you the ball, and shoot it in. Three years is a long time to wait for answers. But as next year's tournament draws closer, the new American squad may have finally found them. He carried his strong club form with Coventry City of England's second division into Tuesday's 2-1 win over Australia, scoring both U.S. goals with style. » READ MORE: Haji Wright led the USMNT's comeback win over Australia to close out October Ricardo Pepi is another, though he hasn't shown it for a bit. Hopefully he'll return for next month's games, including a matchup vs. Paraguay at Subaru Park. The 24-year-old Brooklyn native has scored goals in two of the Americans' four games so far this autumn, taking his career total to seven tallies in 21 national team appearances. Both numbers would likely be bigger if not for shoulder and ankle injuries over the last 12 months. » READ MORE: The USMNT seems on course to do something it hasn't done in nearly a quarter century He delivered an early payoff with a goal in the 2023 Concacaf Nations League final, and scored twice in last year's Copa América group stage — one of the only U.S. players who wasn't a flop in the tournament. But then came those injuries, halting his momentum and the national team's. We'll never know how much better things could have gone at this year's Nations League final four had Balogun been there. “Last year was frustrating, being out for so long with a shoulder injury, but all I can do is just focus on the present and focus on what I can control,” Balogun said. And for me it's about building momentum, consistently being a part of the team, and being available — the most important thing for any athlete is to be available.” When he said that, no one thought to ask if he knew that phrase was popularized by another former New Yorker years ago. But then again, Balogun was six months from being born when Bill Parcells departed the Jets in January 2001. » READ MORE: Cristian Roldan is back with the USMNT, and it feels like he never left “Well, what I like the most is that he is scoring,” he said earlier this week, a line that even soccer critics might like. “When they score is what I like the most in a striker. » READ MORE: Folarin Balogun's goal earns the USMNT a creditable 1-1 tie with Ecuador Alas, it did not come from a chorus of those critics wishing to thank him. [He] has a little bit of everything that I like.” “He's taken his opportunities, and that's all you can ask for [from] a No. 9,” said fellow New Yorker Tim Weah, referring to a striker's traditional jersey number. And he would know, as a former forward who now plays as one of those wingbacks for the U.S. and Italian club Juventus. Nor is it a coincidence that the assist for Balogun's goal vs. Japan came from Christian Pulisic, and the one for his goal vs. Ecuador on Friday came from Malik Tillman. Their dynamism and creativity sets up Balogun to be at his best, and that's a big part of why they're now atop the attacking midfield depth chart. » READ MORE: After missing last month's USMNT gmaes, Brenden Aaronson hoped to make an impression this time “I feel like the manager gives us that freedom to just do what we want up there, and I think that shows in the way we play,” he said. But we're good enough players to figure it out, and he believes in us.” He has spent his entire professional career in Europe, only able to visit the United States for national team games and too-rare vacations. “I love being back here — especially in New York, my favorite city,” he said. U.S. fans in Philadelphia might have to forgive Balogun next month for his choice of city. But they know as well as his team that right now, he's on the way to the greatest trip home of all. » READ MORE: Philadelphia's six-year wait to host the USMNT again will end next month</p>

The program will play a three-game series in October against Portugal and New Zealand, and head coach Emma Hayes has named a 26-player roster for the upcoming matches. Two of the three games will feature retirement celebrations for Alex Morgan and Alyssa Naeher as the group aims to build off their previous meeting, a 3-0 win over Canada, in July. "We are extremely excited to get back together with the team," said Hayes. "There has been a big gap from July until now and we've watched many club games. The expanded roster is to help manage player minutes and match load with the upcoming NWSL playoffs set to begin in November, and Hayes will only name 23 players on matchdays. The lengthy absence was due to a back injury, and she has since returned to play with her club, Washington Spirit. Rodman scored the game-winner in her last USWNT appearance, a 2-0 win against Brazil. Gotham FC midfielder Jaedyn Shaw also marks her return to the senior team after featuring with the U-23 team since April. While Hayes is narrowing down her pool of players ahead of FIFA Women's World Cup qualifiers in 2026, there are still players earning first-time callups. Second-year San Diego Wave defender Kennedy Wesley was named to the roster and could make her senior debut over the three friendlies after spending time with the U-23 program earlier this year. Also returning to the roster are several Americans who play abroad. Five players, midfielder Lindsey Heaps, defender Emily Fox, forward Catarina Macario, midfielder Lily Yohannes, and goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, were given the summer window off. Alyssa Thompson joins the roster from Chelsea FC, her first call-up since moving to Europe. Each player is currently playing in the UEFA Champions League.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA has issued a statement after US President Donald Trump threatened to change the host cities for next summer's World Cup. However, despite the competition being just nine months away, Trump has warned that he could intervene and change the host cities. He claims he could contact FIFA President Gianni Infantino to pressure Democrat-run cities to take a tougher stance on crime. At a cabinet meeting on Sunday, he said: “If somebody is doing a bad job and I feel there are unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location.' In response, a FIFA spokesperson told POLITICO: “Safety and security are of the utmost importance at all FIFA events worldwide. "We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to fulfill all necessary requirements for a successful 2026 World Cup.” Trump's latest comments are now the second time he has threatened to change World Cup venues. Lisa Gillmor, the mayor of Santa Clara, California, said: “Any suggestion that Santa Clara is unsafe is simply not based in fact. Another official from a host city added that the agreements over which locations would stage matches were finalised back in 2017 and 2018. FIFA has also adopted a 'dynamic pricing' system for the tournament, allowing ticket prices to rise sharply in response to higher demand. And weather conditions could also pose a logistical challenge, with extreme heat likely to force later kick-off times. James is a sports journalist who specialises in football and Formula 1. Throughout his career, he has interviewed international footballers and rising Olympic stars. In his spare time, he has the misfortune of being a season ticket holder at Manchester United.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Where do you even begin when talking about a legendary career like the one Angel City FC and USWNT superstar forward Christen Press has had? Today was the day plenty of women's soccer fans likely saw coming, but were absolutely looking to avoid. Even now, if you listen hard enough, you can probably hear a swelling of ‘la-la-la-la-la-‘ with hands over ears, hoping that if they don't hear the words, then it can't make it true. Unfortunately for the game, it is true, as Christen Press has announced her retirement from soccer, with these final two games in the NWSL 2025 season, being her last. Football has given me everything, and I will miss being on the pitch so very much. Thank you to my family, friends, teammates, coaches, and community for this beautiful ride. I promise we will continue to reimagine sports in this next life! In a statement, Angel City FC CEO and Co-Founder Julie Uhrman said “Christen retires as one of the most decorated and respected forwards in U.S. soccer history, a pioneer whose legacy is woven into the very fabric of our club. As Angel City's first signing, Christen's contributions to the club have been unparalleled. On behalf of everyone at Angel City, we thank Christen for everything she has given to the sport, our club, and future generations of athletes and fans.” She played a critical role in helping the National Team win back-to-back World Cup titles (2015 and 2019) as well as helping secure Olympic Bronze in the 2021 Olympic Games. Press is a Hermann Trophy winner from her time at Stanford University, where she set multiple scoring records. She has played in four different leagues, WPS, NWSL, FA WSL, and Sweden's Damallsvenskan. In the WSL she featured in 14 matches for Manchester United where she scored four goals, but most will know her for her time in the NWSL, where she has played for Chicago Stars, Utah Royals, and most recently her hometown team Angel City FC, where she became the club's first signing back in 2022, acting as an ambassador for the club's mission of equity and inclusion. Beyond her on-field achievements, Press has been a driving force in athlete advocacy and the evolution of women's sports. A creative, technically precise, high work-rate forward who made the game look easy at times. With just one last home match remaining in the 2025 NWSL season, expect the Los Angeles soccer legend to make it a day to remember, with what will likely be a packed BMO full of fans, family, friends, admirers and those who gained inspiration from Press all showing up to say their goodbyes, and thank her for the honor of being able to watch her approach this game not just with immense talent and ability, but with incredible dignity and strength.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The penultimate international break of 2025 may have robbed us all of club football action, but it at least made the 2026 World Cup picture a little clearer. England, Egypt, Algeria, Ghana, South Africa, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Cape Verde punched their tickets for the showpiece event in North America in October, with the latter set to make its first appearance at the global football tournament. That brings the confirmed party guests up to 28 nations, with another set of fixtures in November expected to yield a few more RSVPs. While FIFA's official world rankings provide a useful gauge of where each country stands in the international game, it doesn't exactly account for nuance. While fellow World Cup qualifiers from Africa might be higher in FIFA's ranking—Algeria (38th), Egypt (35th), Senegal (18th)—the Elephants are the reigning Africa Cup of Nations champions, which gives them an edge in this context. Ivory Coast just pipped Gabon to the top of qualifying Group F courtesy of a 7-0 win over Seychelles and a 3-0 victory against Kenya in October. In North America, they will be hoping to progress from the group stages for the first time in their history. While Ecuador can be proud of that placement, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was helped by the underperformance of other South American nations. In fact, while La Tri are undefeated in their last seven games, they have only won one, albeit an impressive 1-0 victory over Argentina. That might be an overly optimistic way of looking at the team's run of results, but it still reads well, and it includes games played in a tournament setting. The Stars and Stripes finished the October break with a draw against Ecuador and a victory against Australia, two teams that will also be playing in next summer's tournament. With Ecuador finishing second in CONMEBOL qualification ahead of Brazil, Uruguay, and Colombia, that 1-1 stalemate doesn't look as problematic either. It's not exactly Earth-shaking form, but the Stars and Stripes are starting to look solid while approaching their co-hosting duties. Japan has been disappointing since sealing World Cup qualification in March, with just two wins in six matches from June onwards. However, on Tuesday, the Samurai Blue came back from 2-0 down to secure a 3-2 friendly win over Brazil. Of course, it's easy to point to that result coming in an essentially meaningless game, but it demonstrates the team's resilience, and Brazil still put out a strong XI. For Japan, it's now about fine-tuning ahead of the World Cup in June, and more results like the one against the Seleçao Canarinho will set it up nicely for North America. Uruguay has demonstrated a notable level of consistency in the last two international breaks, going undefeated in four games and winning three. However, with teams surrounding Uruguay performing at a similar level in the last few months, and the level of competition it faced not as strong—Peru (48th), Chile (57th), Dominican Republic (142nd), and Uzbekistan (54th)—it falls a place to 16th. Still, if La Celeste wants to establish a dark horse reputation for themselves heading into the tournament, like they have in years past, they will need some better results. Norway stormed into September's B/R power rankings, and it looks intent on staying there on the way to its first World Cup appearance since 1998. Despite having the lowest FIFA ranking of any team listed here, they should not be underestimated. Without the Manchester City striker, Norway could only manage a 1-1 draw with New Zealand. Manager Ståle Solbakken will be frantically placing an order for bubble wrap. Manager Rudi Garcia has brought a spark back to the Belgian men's national team. The Frenchman has guided the Red Devils to five wins in eight matches in charge, and they sit on top of World Cup qualifying Group J with a game in hand over North Macedonia. Despite North Macedonia playing at a standard well above their 63rd-place FIFA world ranking, the fact that the Red Devils couldn't crack them over two qualifying games—including a 0-0 draw in October—will be a mild concern. With two matches to go, Italy is still trailing Norway in qualification Group I. The Azzurri will surely fancy their chances should it come to that, but it's an extra layer of jeopardy they would undoubtedly rather not have to deal with. Italy has not qualified for a World Cup since the 2014 edition in Brazil, and being on the outside looking in once again will surely be too much to bear for the nation's football-mad fans. Thankfully, Italy is on a good run of form, picking up five consecutive wins and scoring 18 in the process. Mexico is having a serious Gold Cup hangover. No wins in four games since lifting the trophy is a hugely disappointing run, with their co-hosting duties approaching. Among those results was a crushing 4-0 home loss to Colombia in October. While still the most promising among the host nations in terms of possible success, Mexico needs to turn things around with a little over six months to go. After no wins in six from November 2024 to the end of August 2025, some alarm bells were sounding for Colombia. However, World Cup qualification was sealed in September, and Los Cafeteros have now won three of their last four while scoring 13 in the process. James Rodriguez is still performing international miracles at the age of 34, scoring once and providing four assists in those fixtures. Meanwhile, Luis Diaz's hot start to life with Bayern Munich will give the South Americans even more hope for a long stay in the neighboring northern continent. Croatia keeps plugging away, picking up decent results to keep them top of UEFA qualification Group L. While only three points separate Croatia from Czechia in second, the former has a game in hand, which at least provides some margin for error on the road to the World Cup. Granted, that's difficult to achieve on the international stage, given issues with establishing chemistry and the difficulty of squeezing a raft of talent into XI spots. There's a lot of work to do between now and June if Brazil wants to reestablish its previously feared reputation. By rights, Morocco should be much higher in the international power rankings. Outside of the African Nations Championship—a tournament that European-based players don't participate in—the Atlas Lions have lost just once since January 2024. However, the strength of opponents has to be factored in, with Morocco not often tested by low-ranked African nations. After a woeful run of form that saw Germany go winless in four matches from late March to early September (including three defeats), things are looking up for the Die Nationalelf. With World Cup qualification looking in peril after a shocking opening-game loss to Slovakia, Germany has rattled off three consecutive wins to top Group A on goal difference. That sets them up nicely heading into November's crucial qualifying games, where Slovakia will be waiting in the final, likely decisive matchup. Still, just eight goals scored in four qualifying games will be troubling, especially since half of those came in a 4-0 victory over 96th ranked Luxembourg. Take it back a little further, and the Netherlands has 20 goals in its last five games, with only three conceded. In October, the Dutch defense didn't surrender a goal. For a nation that always seems to have an enviable collection of stars, the Netherlands has never won a World Cup final, despite reaching the tournament's climactic game three times. With manager Ronald Koeman finding the secret to international scoring success while maintaining a stingy back line, the Oranje might again manage a deep tournament run. France had the chance to seal 2026 World Cup qualification with a win on Monday. While Ukraine ensured that wouldn't be possible after notching a 2-1 victory over Azerbaijan, France didn't hold up its end of the bargain, either. Les Bleus stumbled to a 2-2 draw against world No. However, manager Didier Deschamps might come under scrutiny for his tactics and team selection in the subsequent stalemate, when a win could have eased the pressure on his side significantly. If not for Dominik Szoboszlai's strike, A Seleçao would have confirmed their spot in the 2026 World Cup. However, they will now have to wait until November. In addition to that disappointment, Portugal slips in the B/R power rankings because its results simply aren't convincing at the moment. While Cristiano Ronaldo found the goal (and then another) that took him to the top of the all-time World Cup qualifying top scorer list, his remarkable exploits are not enough on their own for Portugal to rely on. Although qualification for the World Cup had already been secured at that point, it succumbed to a 1-0 defeat against Ecuador in September. The 1-0 victory over 49th-ranked Venezuela that followed in October wasn't entirely convincing. La Albiceleste did secure a 6-0 win against Puerto Rico on Tuesday, but beating the 155th-ranked team isn't much to be pleased about. Following a disappointing defeat in Ecuador and with little else to boast about from their recent outings, Argentina has slipped after more impressive results from another nation. England has steamed into second with the Thomas Tuchel train hitting full speed. A 3-0 friendly victory over Wales without Harry Kane was a welcome result for U.K. bragging rights, but the 5-0 win over Latvia was significantly more important. England is the only European nation to confirm a berth in the competition so far, doing so with six wins from six in Group K and no goals conceded. Tuchel's tenure started with a concerning lack of goals, but the German has well and truly opened the attacking floodgates. For a team that has been so reliant on its talismanic No. Tuchel has been ruthless in his selection, relying on players who are showing their best form rather than counting on reputation, and it's paying off. Spain simply looks unshakable at the top of B/R's international football rankings. If you ignore the penalty-shootout loss to Portugal in the Nations League final, La Furia Roja haven't been defeated since a March 2024 friendly against Colombia, in which usual starters were rested. In October, Spain brushed aside Georgia and put four past Bulgaria with no reply, putting it comfortably atop Group E and within touching distance of automatic World Cup qualification.</p>

President Donald Trump said he may call FIFA's president to suggest World Cup games be moved out of Boston if he believes there are safety concerns in the city. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu responded after President Donald Trump threatened to pull FIFA World Cup games out of the city next year. "Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions," she said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. Boston is currently set to host seven matches when the World Cup comes to North America next summer. The slate includes five group-stage games, one Round of 32 fixture and the first quarterfinal on July 9. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu speaks during a Democratic election night party, Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2022, in Boston, Massachusetts. Trump made the suggestion that he would have games moved out of Boston while speaking to reporters on Tuesday while discussing an incident that happened in the city this week when a group of people took over one of the city's streets in a violent display. According to the Boston Police Department, over 100 people were involved in the takeover that involved street racing just after 2 a.m. on Oct. 5. Officers found people trying to attack police cruisers with fireworks, cones, poles and other items. One police cruiser was destroyed by flames and needed to be towed away from the area, officials said. I love the people of Boston. You know, some are extremely low IQ. Trump added he would call FIFA President Gianni Infantino to have the games moved. "The answer is yes, if somebody's doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location,' and he would do that. And this is the right time to do it." Maura Healey addressed the violent incident in Boston on Tuesday. Trump announced the FIFA World Cup 2026 draw will take place at The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 22, 2025. (Right) Boston Mayor Michelle Wu on Aug. 28, 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump says he has the authority to "take away" 2026 World Cup soccer matches scheduled in Boston if he feels the city is unsafe. Suggesting that parts of Boston had been "taken over" by recent unrest, Trump criticized mayor Michelle Wu and said on Tuesday, Oct. 14, that Boston – which is set to stage seven matches at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough during next summer's tournament – could have its games relocated with a phone call to FIFA president Gianni Infantino. "If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who's phenomenal – and I would say, ‘Let's move into another location,' and they would do that," Trump said. Trump's remarks came during a White House appearance with Argentine President Javier Milei, days after Boston police reported multiple arrests tied to a late-night street gathering that turned violent. Boston was one of 11 U.S. cities, along with three in Mexico and two in Canada, selected three years ago to host matches for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Making changes to plans already in place just eight months before the tournament kicks off June 11 would create severe logistical hurdles. "We could take them away," Trump said. But your mayor is not good." Wu's office issued a statement that read: "Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions." Trump also suggested that he would consider moving the 2028 Summer Olympics out of Los Angeles for similar reasons.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At 36, Press has cemented her legacy as one of U.S. soccer's all-time greats. Christen Press, one of the most celebrated players in U.S. women's soccer history, is officially hanging up her cleats. At 36, the two-time World Cup champion and Angel City FC forward announced her retirement from professional soccer, sharing the emotional news in an interview with "Good Morning America" that aired Wednesday. "I'm retiring from professional soccer, and I've decided that this is my last season and my last few games," Press said. I have so much grief, a part of me, a piece of me, I'm losing her." Over the course of her remarkable career, Press earned 155 caps and scored 64 goals for the U.S. Women's National Team, helping lead the squad to two FIFA Women's World Cup titles. Known for her speed, technical precision and calm under pressure, Press became a defining figure of the USWNT's golden era. As a trailblazer for equity in women's sports and a founding member of Angel City FC, Press helped shape the next generation of women's soccer in Los Angeles. Despite a determined comeback and return to the pitch last season, she said her decision to retire came from wanting to choose her moment, not have it chosen for her. "But I realized that time's never going to come and I can play, and my body can keep going. And I think it was really important for me to make this decision for myself before that became a different reality." Press will play her final Angel City home game this Sunday, fittingly, not far from where her journey first began. Soccer, Press added, has always been a family affair. Her father, a former college football player, was the first to spark her love for the game. "And I think because of that, it became so important to my mom to have that connection between my dad and I." That same week, she scored a game-winning goal against Spain. "My dad was upstairs watching the game on his iPad, and he ran downstairs to my mom to show her the goal," she recalled. And I think in some ways it gave her a little peace." Earlier this year, she and former teammate and longtime partner Tobin Heath revealed that they are married, after quietly tying the knot years earlier. "There was a time where a lot was off limits and Tobin and I's approach was wanting to keep our relationship sacred and out of the public eye," she said. "We actually have been married long before this year. And you know, my manager, my family [were] just as surprised as you were, but everyone knew that I was in [a] committed relationship." "It's authentic, because it is just the same conversations we often are having here at the house," she said. As she is about to step off the field for the last time, Press said she feels grateful for her career, her family, and the city that raised her.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colin Udoh reveals the role he played in 'helping' Nigeria secure a World Cup play-off place after their 4-0 win over Benin. South Africa's 3-0 win over Rwanda that booked them a place in the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico was not only a strong footballing performance but also a symbol of the resilience that coach Hugo Broos has instilled in the team. Bafana Bafana faced a self-made crisis heading into the final game, as they trailed Benin by two points at the top of Group C. After relinquishing top spot by having their March win over Lesotho overturned for fielding the ineligible Teboho Mokoena, they dropped two more points in a 0-0 draw with Zimbabwe on Saturday. However, Benin 's 4-0 defeat by Nigeria left Bafana with a fighting chance: Victory over Rwanda was all they needed to progress. That match led to the departure of his predecessor, Molefi Ntseki, and the Belgian's subsequent appointment as head coach. Almost five years later, he has delivered on his mission to overhaul Bafana Bafana's belief in their own abilities -- with his focus on youth paying off. I couldn't understand it," Broos told ESPN in 2021 after making early progress in changing the results and culture of the team. "So then I started to see who was playing. There were so many players of 27, 28, 29 years old. "I said: 'Yes, that's right, but if you do not play the younger players, then when are they going to have experience?' "So, therefore, I started also with young players who had quality. That process has now paid dividends, with a dominant performance led by young players who were cool, calm and collected from the first whistle to the last. Bafana led 2-0 at halftime, courtesy of a long-range Thalente Mbatha strike and a curling finish by Oswin Appollis, before Evidence Makgopa's 72nd-minute header sealed the win that saw South Africa qualify for their fourth World Cup -- and their first since they hosted the tournament in 2010. Broos, alone, cannot take credit for the development of players such as Mbatha, Appollis and Makgopa -- Orlando Pirates stars in their mid-20s -- but the former Cameroon head coach, who won the 2017 AFCON against all odds, was a driving force for South Africa's nationwide shift in attitudes towards young players. Then at Baroka FC, Makgopa had not been fancied to lead the line at international level, but Broos took a chance on him and it paid off. Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns -- the two dominant clubs in South Africa over the past decade -- also deserve their fair share of credit. Sundowns have invested heavily under the ownership of Confederation of African Football president Patrice Motsepe, who bought a controlling stake in 2003 and then the remaining shares the following year. Off the back of a disappointing spell in charge of Bafana Bafana, a reinvigorated Mosimane led Sundowns to their first CAF Champions League title in 2016 -- only the second by a South African club; Pirates previously won it in 1995. None could quite match the financial might of Sundowns, but Pirates improved their talent development and recruitment structures -- and their streamlined squad has closed the gap on a Sundowns side now struggling with fatigue and player discontent after the FIFA Club World Cup, a tournament that saw them impress on the global stage but face struggles keeping their players away from prying eyes elsewhere in the world. Broos has often encouraged Bafana Bafana players to move overseas, but facing an injury crisis heading into a decisive qualifier, he started with an entirely locally-based XI. South Africa started five Sundowns players -- Ronwen Williams, Khuliso Mudau, Aubrey Modiba, Mokoena and Thapelo Morena -- five Pirates players -- Mbatha, Appollis, Makgopa, Nkosinathi Sibisi and Sipho Mbule -- and one from TS Galaxy, Khulumani Ndamane. That, alone, speaks volumes of the quality in South Africa's club football. What is new -- first and foremost -- is the apparent end of the days when South African players were viewed as too comfortable and pampered to win when the going got tough.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thomas Tuchel has completed his first task as England manager with ease as the Three Lions became the first European side to qualify for the 2026 World Cup on Tuesday. After a perfect qualifying record of six wins and 18 goals without conceding from six games, the hard work for the German now begins in burdening great expectations in tough conditions next year in the United States, Mexico and Canada. AFP Sports looks at the challenges ahead for Tuchel and his team if they are to end a 60-year wait to win a major men's tournament. Tuchel's bold decision to leave out Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden from his squad this month underlined his desire to find the best collective unit rather than a collection of the best players at his disposal. But if the Nottingham Forest midfielder is to cement his place alongside Declan Rice, it would likely leave only one starting spot available for Bellingham, Foden and Cole Palmer. It will take a far braver call for Tuchel to leave out some of his star names when it comes to naming his World Cup squad. Chelsea's Palmer and Real Madrid right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold were also missing this month due to injury and will expect to be on the plane across the Atlantic come June. Tuchel accepted from his first day in the job that anything other than winning the World Cup will be regarded as a failure. England came as close as they ever have since 1966 to ending their trophy drought during his predecessor Gareth Southgate's tenure, losing two European Championship finals. By splashing out on a proven winner in the former Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain boss on a short-term contract, the English Football Association are banking on Tuchel to turn a supremely talented generation from nearly men into winners. However, the 52-year-old will be stepping into the unknown for his first tournament as an international manager in challenging conditions. England have rarely thrived in the sweltering heat they can expect in many host cities next summer. Moreover, a number of Tuchel's key men will head into the tournament on the back of 12 months without a break after their role in the Club World Cup last summer. However, that has not prevented the forthright Tuchel from speaking his mind. He branded the Wembley crowd "silent" during Thursday's 3-0 friendly win over Wales and claimed his players deserved more from the fans. The travelling support for Tuesday's 5-0 win in Riga over Latvia were quick to hit back, telling Tuchel they would "sing when we want". England's rocky road to the Euro 2024 final was beset by an uneasy relationship with fans on the ground in Germany. Southgate was pelted with beer cups after a 0-0 draw against Slovenia in the group stages. Tuchel can ill afford such a toxic relationship to add an unwanted distraction to his quest to deliver England's first ever major trophy on foreign soil.
