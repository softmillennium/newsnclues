                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The author has become somewhat notorious in physics circles for groan-inducing takes. That's not to say everything she has produced is bad, because it's not, but she has taken a hard turn into audience capture and speaking over-confidently far out of her area of expertise. Given the format I'm not sure it's actually designed to be submitted for publishing or if it's just formatted in academic paper style and uploaded to arXiv for some other reason. Note that virtually anyone can register for and upload a document to arXiv, so this being on arXiv.org doesn't imply anything specific. Sounds like she is doing Youtube to earn some bucks off it, then? Usually, you'll stir up a controversy or make bold claims to create engagement, which in turn pleases "the algorithm". Lately she's been dabbling with soft support for well known grifters like Eric Weinstein, though last I heard she stopped short of actually endorsing his theories. She's a very well paid member of the anti-science ecosystem. Basically, screaming that "They don't want you to hear THIS" is extremely profitable. She's a very well paid member of the anti-science ecosystem. Might pass arxiv pre-published stage but definitely not a peer-reviewed one. Perhaps you can just assume a radius where the electon self-repulsion energy equals its own mass, by m = E/(c^2). Also, the reference to “known links between the solutions of Yang-Mills theory and those of gravity” (Y-M equations describing charge and EM field) seems to speculatively imply that charge-related information is encoded in the geometry of spacetime, alongside gravitational effects No experience, didn't actually do any fact checking, makes claims we are supposed to just believe and call it science.Second video doesnt seem to have any content from the book either.Color me surprised.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seattle University President Eduardo Peñalver — credited with “a legacy of growth and innovation” — is leaving to become president of Georgetown University, the two Catholic Jesuit institutions announced Wednesday. During his tenure, Seattle U. launched a “Technology Ethics Initiative,” designed to “convene and inspire productive discussions about the role of transformative technologies for a just society.” The initiative is led by political science professor Onur Bakiner, whose current research examines AI governance models. Last year, the university welcomed Father Paolo Benanti, an advisor to Pope Francis on artificial intelligence and technology ethics, as a distinguished visiting professor. Peñalver moderated a conversation between Benanti and Microsoft President Brad Smith for employees on the company's campus in Redmond, Wash. Like many institutions, Seattle U. has experienced increased enrollment demand in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines. “This was not an easy decision,” Peñalver said in a message to the university community, “but one I make with gratitude for all that we have accomplished together and confidence in the university's continued momentum. While I am excited about the opportunity to continue my work in Jesuit higher education at such a pivotal moment, I am also sad to be leaving Seattle University and the Pacific Northwest, which will always be my home.” He also clerked for former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, and prior to Seattle U., was dean of Cornell Law School. Peñalver will succeed Interim President Robert Groves, who has led Georgetown for the past year after former President John DeGioia stepped down from his role in 2024 to recover from a stroke.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A U.S. Border Patrol video featuring antisemitic lyrics went viral on X on Tuesday after far-right users discovered it had been posted to Facebook and Instagram. The 13-second video appears to have been posted to Instagram in August, but was pinned in the Reels section of the official Border Patrol page, making it more visible to a wider audience. The video only gained widespread attention late Tuesday on X, where far-right extremists celebrated a signal that was clearly intended for them. The Instagram video had 3.4 million views when Gizmodo viewed it Tuesday night. The lyrics were criticized at the time for being antisemitic, though Jackson defended his words, insisting he didn't intend for them to be offensive. The video starts with footage of someone adjusting a bodycam before viewers see Border Patrol agents walking around with guns. Gizmodo saved a copy of the Border Patrol video before it was taken down from Instagram and Facebook. DHS didn't respond to questions from Gizmodo on Wednesday morning. One commenter replied, “based song choice,” which was liked by the Border Patrol account. Other commenters on X marveled at how mainstream their far-right and antisemitic ideas were becoming, with one person writing, “This movie is taking a strange turn. And while it's accurate to describe the shift as “strange,” it was entirely predictable after President Donald Trump was inaugurated for a second time in January. Musk later denied he was making Nazi gestures, but many of his supporters clearly took it as a sign that they could drop the mask. Steve Bannon, a former top advisor to Trump, made the same salute not long after. Trump himself has also said some extremely antisemitic things, including when he used the term “shylock” at a rally in July. In fact, there's an entire Wikipedia page devoted to collecting examples of Trump's antisemitism. U.S. Border Patrol is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which has been posting far-right extremist content since Trump took office for a second time. In a tweet on Tuesday, DHS posted just one word, “Remigrate,” a term more popular in Europe among the far-right that refers to ethnic cleansing through deporting non-white people. DHS also posted a video that included the words “Save America” in a typeface that's clearly meant to evoke Nazi-era imagery. The dog whistles from DHS are blaring foghorns at this point DHS has frequently posted fascist propaganda using copyrighted material without permission, something that sometimes gets the content removed from the major social media platforms. The people of DHS often know they're the bad guys, like when they responded to questions from John Oliver's HBO show by talking about the “heroism” of Darth Vader. The late-night host was asking about a video posted by Gregory Bovino—the new face of anti-immigrant operations in the U.S., with his frequent appearances on TV—where Vader is destroying rebel forces labeled with things like “gang member,” and “fake news.” And if you spend all day, every day saying racist and antisemitic things, people have to start taking you at your word. Agencies under DHS, like ICE, are currently harassing and arresting people for looking Latino. Ironically, DHS said back in April that social media would be screened for “antisemitism” by any foreign nationals in the country. In reality, DHS was looking for anyone who opposed the war in Gaza, falsely equating such a position with antisemitism. The U.S. State Department announced Tuesday it had canceled the visas of six people who had written negative things about Charlie Kirk. Antisemitism runs deep in the modern Republican Party. Politico published leaked texts from the Young Republicans on Tuesday, which included messages like “I love Hitler.” Vice President JD Vance defended the texts and dismissed criticism as “pearl-clutching.” And guys like Vance know their audience. They can be dismissed as shitposters, but they're some of the most vile racists on the planet, and they're becoming normalized in ways that would've been unthinkable even a decade ago. Americans who are opposed to Trump plan to stage nationwide protests on Saturday, Oct. 18, for what's being dubbed another No Kings rally. Republicans have tried to characterize the upcoming protests as hate marches, falsely insisting they would be full of “Hamas supporters.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Wednesday that the reason the government hasn't opened yet is because of the upcoming demonstrations, a claim that makes no sense whatsoever. The No Kings rally, which is likely to include a wide variety of Americans who are opposed to Trump's fascist takeover of the country, has a website that allows people to find their nearest demonstration.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When a colleague with vital information is away — whether on vacation or in a different time zone — the rest of the team must delay progress until that person responds. Ashutosh Garg and Varun Kacholia, the co-founders of Eightfold — an AI recruiting startup last valued at $2.1 billion — believe that advances in LLMs and data privacy technologies can help solve some aspects of this costly problem. Earlier this year, they launched Viven, a digital twin startup with a mission to grant employees access to crucial information from teammates even when those colleagues are unavailable. Viven develops a specialized LLM for each employee, effectively creating a digital twin by accessing their internal electronic documents such as email, Slack, and Google Docs. “When each and every person has a digital twin, you can just talk to their twin as if you're talking to that person and get the response,” Ashutosh Garg told TechCrunch. One major hurdle is that people just can't share everything with anyone who asks. According to Ashutosh Garg, Viven's technology solves that complex problem through a concept known as pairwise context and privacy. But perhaps the most important safeguard is that everyone can see the query history of their digital twin, which acts as a deterrent against people asking inappropriate questions. Viven is already in use by several enterprise clients, including Genpact and Eightfold. The legendary investor assured Ashutosh Garg that nobody is doing this and agreed to invest. “When Ashutosh came to me and described the product, the big aha for me was: there's this horizontal problem across all jobs of coordination and communication, which no one is automating,” Ashu Garg told TechCrunch. But just because there are no direct competitors now doesn't mean that other companies won't build digital twins for companies in the future. Ashu Garg said that Anthropic, Google's Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and OpenAI's enterprise search products have a personalization component.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liberate, an AI startup automating insurance operations, has raised $50 million in a round led by Battery Ventures as it looks to scale its agentic deployments across carriers and agencies globally. The insurance industry has been navigating a difficult stretch, with rising operational costs, legacy system constraints, and increasing customer expectations. Specifically in the non-life segment, global premium growth is projected to slow through 2026, driven by heightened competition, weaker rate momentum, and new cost pressures, including tariffs, per a recent report by Deloitte. While some carriers experimented with AI, many early efforts stalled due to fragmented data and inflexible workflows. Behind the scenes, a network of reasoning-based AI agents connects to insurers' existing systems, gathering context and generating responses that Nicole delivers — all without human intervention. These include quoting policies, processing claims, and updating endorsements, among other routine functions. The agents can also operate over SMS and email, allowing insurers to interact with customers across different channels while automating more of their day-to-day workflows. Singh co-founded Liberate after nearly four years at Metromile, the car insurance firm owned by Lemonade, where he worked across both back-office operations and technology. The technology uses reinforcement learning tailored for long, regulated insurance conversations. Each interaction is auditable and includes human-in-the-loop safeguards to meet compliance requirements, the startup said. Over the past year, Liberate has scaled from 10,000 monthly automations to 1.3 million automated resolutions, Singh stated. Since AI systems can still make mistakes and are not foolproof yet, Liberate uses an internal tool called Supervisor to monitor all interactions between its agents and customers. “The advantage of servicing only one industry, and within that servicing only three specific use cases, is that you can put a lot more guardrails in place,” the executive noted. The AI agents enable 24/7 sales operations, allowing customers to buy insurance even at midnight or early in the morning — times when human agents typically are not available, Singh said. Its voice AI-powered omnichannel experience and ability to fully automate tasks by integrating into existing systems were key factors that drew investors to back the company at a larger scale. “Mapping the process, modeling it, and making sure that all the systems connections are in place, well tested, and appropriately designed so that you can complete the task, not just communicate, is what Liberate is doing,” Marcus Ryu, a general partner at Battery Ventures, told TechCrunch. The Series B funding will be used to expand Liberate's reasoning capabilities and support broader deployment across insurers. The startup has raised $72 million to date and currently employs around 50 people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sustainability: News about the rapidly growing climate tech sector and other areas of innovation to protect our planet. Seattle startup Electric Era today unveiled a sleek, interactive EV charging device that uses artificial intelligence to converse with drivers as they're juicing up their vehicles. The company builds electric vehicle charging systems that are typically deployed at convenience stores and other businesses. The modern-looking new unit — dubbed RetailEdge — can provide information on a vehicle's charging status, suggest how much power is required to reach the next destination, give information on loyalty points earned at a partnering business, and even tell jokes. “This is a next generation charging dispenser that does more than just charge cars. RetailEdge incorporates in-house-designed hardware and software, including bilingual AI technology that can integrate with business partners' existing systems. “We are a uniquely capable team of designing very low cost products that have heightened product capabilities,” he said. Electric Era launched in 2019 and distinguished itself by pairing its DC fast-charging systems with giant batteries to help deliver and store power needed by recharging EVs. Lee said he expects those numbers to at least double by the end of next year. Today's announcement comes as EV charging infrastructure continues expanding despite policy headwinds. Republican leaders recently canceled tax credits for EV purchases, but charging stations are proliferating. “The charging map is also being filled in by restaurants and retail stores, which increasingly see [charging] cords as a way to attract customers,” Bloomberg reported — which is the sector targeted by Electric Era. The startup will keep selling its original charging units alongside RetailEdge. Lee described his products as “cost competitive” but didn't share specifics. The region has been hard hit by thieves targeting not only charging sites but also utility and telecommunications infrastructure. Lee said his team is “constantly lobbying” state leaders to pass laws that protect this sort of essential infrastructure. AWS re:Invent connects you with global leaders, builders, and innovators.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Photographer Qingrong Yang was visiting Yundang Lake near his home in Fujian province, China, when he captured the stunning scene in the photo above. Read on to see more of this year's jaw-dropping award winners. Marine conservation photojournalist Shane Gross waited for several weeks to capture this rarely seen peppered moray eel behavior on D'Arros Island, Amirante, Seychelles. These three were scavenging for dead fish when Gross spotted them and snapped a photo. He spotted this black-tailed rattler on the road at night outside of Fort Davis, Texas. While hiking in the Lepini Mountains of central Italy, teenage wildlife photographer Andrea Dominzi stumbled upon abandoned machinery in an area once logged for beech trees. Framed as though the beetle is looking out over the disturbed patch of forest, tells a poignant story of habitat loss and hope for renewal. Wildlife photographer Dennis Stogsdill had spent days searching for wild cats in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, when a call came over the radio. A caracal—a medium-sized wild cat known for its impressive leaping ability—had been spotted at Ndutu Lake. When Stogsdill arrived, he found the cat hunting lesser flamingos and took this striking photo of the hunter proudly displaying its catch. Nature photographer Georgina Steytler spent years looking for the gum-leaf skeletonizer caterpillar, also known as the “mad hatterpillar.” While exploring Torndirrup National Park in Western Australia, she noticed eucalyptus trees with skeletonized leaves—a sign that the animal had been grazing there. Once she found her subject, she took this backlit image showcasing its bizarre headgear, made up of the old head capsules it keeps every time it sheds its skin. Wildlife and nature photographer Luca Lorenz snapped this photo of a curious harbor seal popping its head above water off the archipelago of Heligoland, Germany. Post-doc researcher and wildlife photographer Quentin Martinez found this group of lesser tree frogs during a rainy night on Kaw Mountain in French Guiana. These vibrant frogs had gathered for a breeding event, producing short, shrill calls to attract mates. This species breeds only during heavy rainfall, assembling in huge numbers to mate for just a few hours. It took Heever a decade to capture this perfectly framed image of a brown hyena standing before the dilapidated ruins of an abandoned mining town in Kolmanskop, near Luderitz, Namibia. Brown hyenas are the rarest hyena species in the world, and their nocturnal, solitary nature makes them challenging subjects to photograph. They are known to pass through Kolmanskop on their way to hunt Cape fur seal pups or scavenge for carrion that washes ashore along the Namib Desert coast. Dogs can exhibit obsessive behaviors around their favorite toys, new research suggests. This annual contest celebrates photographers who will do almost anything—even slather themselves in petroleum jelly—to capture nature's best shots. A surprisingly simple trick is helping scientists make succulent leaves shine brighter than ever, giving these favorite houseplants a new glow. Birds of a feather may flock together, but in the Camargue region of France, migratory pink flamingoes age slower than resident flamingoes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, F5 said it now “believes its containment actions have been successful,” after first discovering the hackers in its network on August 9. The U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre warned on Wednesday, following F5's disclosure, that hackers could “enable a threat actor to exploit F5 devices and software.” CISA said in an email on Wednesday that it has ordered civilian federal agencies under an emergency directive to patch their systems by October 22, citing the security risks. F5 is the latest tech company in recent years to have been hacked by government hackers, including Microsoft — by China, and Russia, at least twice; cloud and enterprise technology firm Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and several other companies as part of the broader Russian cyberattack on the software maker SolarWinds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cybersecurity and networking company F5 disclosed that a “highly sophisticated” nation-state threat actor infiltrated its internal systems this summer, stealing portions of the company's BIG-IP source code and details about software vulnerabilities. The company said it believes its containment efforts have been successful and that it has seen no new unauthorized activity. F5 shares were down more than 3% in early trading Wednesday. Some of the breached files contained configuration details for a small percentage of customers, the company said, and those customers are being notified directly. F5 said it has no evidence that the attackers accessed CRM or financial data, or tampered with its software supply chain. The company also said the attackers did not reach its other major product lines, including NGINX, F5 Distributed Cloud Services, or Silverline. While F5 products themselves have been targeted in the past — including a vulnerability in 2020 and the “Velvet Ant” malware campaign uncovered in 2024 — this appears to be the first publicly disclosed breach of F5's internal systems. Separately, F5 announced Wednesday that Michael Montoya resigned from the company's board and became its chief technology operations officer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Without much fanfare, Apple has unveiled three new flagship products today via a press release—no special event, no prerecorded show. All of the devices are available for preorder today and go on sale October 22. It's built on the 3-nanometer process, with a 10-core GPU and a neural accelerator in each core, which Apple claims improves performance in GPU-based AI workloads and provides four times the peak GPU compute performance over the M4 chip. Graphics performance in general is 30 percent higher than the M4, and the 10-core CPU offers 15 percent faster multithreaded performance. (Apple claims this is the “world's fastest CPU core.”) The 16-core Neural Engine has also been enhanced, which should mean Apple Intelligence and other AI tasks (like transforming a 2D photo to a spatial scene) should be faster. Apple says there's a 30 percent increase in unified memory bandwidth, allowing larger AI models to run on the device, but it also helps deliver better performance for the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine. You still have two sizes to choose from: 11 or 13 inches. Both of them feature fast charging—you can get 50 percent in 30 minutes when using a compatible charger—though annoyingly, Apple only includes a 20-watt USB-C power adapter in the box. Both feature Apple's N1 networking chip that debuted in the iPhone 17, which includes Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread. Over its predecessor, you'll see a 3.5X boost in AI performance, 1.5X faster 3D rendering with ray tracing, up to 1.2X faster video transcode performance in Final Cut Pro, and 2.3X faster AI video upscaling performance in DaVinci Resolve. The 256- and 512-GB models use 12 GB of unified memory now, twice as much as before, and the faster memory bandwidth means everything gets a speed boost. They're just as thin as before, feature Apple's Tandem OLED display technology, and can hit 1,600 nits at peak brightness. Speaking of the screen, Apple says there's a new capability for these iPads to drive external displays at up to 120 Hz; if you already have a 120-Hz screen, a new Adaptive Sync feature will ensure the lowest possible latency between iPad and monitor. Interestingly, Apple did not completely revamp its MacBook Pro lineup with the M5 chip. The base version starts at $1,599, like before, but if you max out all of the upgrades, it can cost as much as $3,369. There are three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI, an SDXC slot, a headphone jack, and the MagSafe charging port. Widely regarded as a miss with consumers, Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset is back but with no major changes to the hardware. Well, there's a new head strap: the Dual Knit Band. It's included in the box, and Apple says it's soft and cushioned, allowing for a comfier fit. The headset is now powered by the M5 chip, which enables faster performance, sharper details throughout visionOS 26, and better battery life. Battery life is now two and a half hours of general use, as opposed to just two hours on the original Vision Pro. That extends to three hours with video playback. It's arriving right before Samsung is expected to unveil its Android XR mixed-reality headset, Project Moohan, which will hopefully come with a lower price tag.

Several cell providers have hopped on the 5G home internet service bandwagon, with T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon offering service in select areas across the United States. Now, a new player is entering the fray: Mint Mobile. Unsurprisingly, MINTernet operates on T-Mobile's nationwide wireless network, offering unlimited 5G service. In this case, Mint Mobile says that once you consume over 1TB of data within your billing cycle, "network speeds vary and may be reduced." Regarding the speeds you can expect, the "Broadband Facts" label for MINTernet indicates that typical download speeds will range from 133 to 415 Mbps, while uploads should reach a maximum of around 55 Mbps. MINTernet costs $40 per month if you opt for the introductory 3-month offer, and this price is contingent upon paying the entire cost upfront ($120). However, if you already have a Mint phone plan (or intend to add one at the time of signup), your monthly cost drops to $30 ($90 upfront). Considering that MINTernet runs on T-Mobile's 5G network, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that my first run-in with its 5G home internet service ended in disaster in 2022. However, I revisited the service in 2024 with much better results, averaging over 600 Mbps for downloads and over 50 Mbps for uploads. T-Mobile Home Internet costs $50/month with autopay, so if you tick the right boxes, MINTernet will save you up to $20/month.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. After teasing a new product launch on X earlier today, Apple has just announced the 2025 refresh to its 14-inch MacBook Pro lineup, now equipped with the shiny new M5 chip. It's largely an iterative update, with the new chip nicely slotting in for yesteryear's M4 in an otherwise largely unchanged package. There are no design tweaks or exciting features to speak of. The battery is once again quoted to last 24 hours in video playback, and you still only get Wi-Fi 6E. However, the SSD is 2x faster compared to last gen, and you can now spec it up to 4 TB, twice as much as previous gen. It's clear that Apple is entirely focused on what's inside, the latest generation of its homegrown M-series silicon — M5. The M5 chip is built on TSMC's N3P node and has a faster GPU that can deliver 1.6x more FPS in games, 20% faster multi-core CPU performance, and 1.7x quicker render times in Blender — all versus the M4. Apple even says it's 86x more powerful than Intel-based Macs in AI applications. Keep in mind that, just like M4, the base M5 isn't available on the 16-inch models as they start out with a Pro chip (so, presumably M5 Pro). The device is available to pre-order right away, with general availability beginning next week on October 22. On the other hand, the mixed reality headset now has a new Dual Knit headband, also available for purchase separately for $99. Therefore, M5's improvements in performance, battery life, and AI-powered workflows are present on the Vision Pro and iPad Pro as well.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple's Vision Pro is getting its first big upgrade since its release, and just like all the products Apple announced today, everything centers on the M5 chip. A new 10-core GPU architecture will also enable ray tracing and very likely make gaming feel even more immersive, particularly when it comes to rendering light and shadow. On top of that, the M5 will bump the Vision Pro's refresh rate to 120Hz, helping to reduce ghosting and make watching pretty much any experience involving lots of motion look even smoother. If you're worried about AI performance, the M5 will also perform better on that front. Apple says native AI experiences like Personas and spatial video run 50% faster, which may not be the most important metrics in the world, but they will be a boon to those who don't like waiting around for things to load. As you might expect from Apple silicon, the M5 sounds like a step up generation-to-generation, but it's not just about performance; the chip is also bringing much-needed battery improvements. That last one is especially important considering that the Vision Pro is still positioned as the best headset for long-form content thanks to its premium display. Speaking of wearing the Vision Pro for hours at a time, Apple is also introducing a new Dual Knit Band that has both upper and lower straps. That might not sound like the most mind-blowing upgrade, but having used the previous Vision Pro myself, I predict that extra support will go a long way, especially since the headset weighs between 600 and 650 grams. The band will also be sold separately for $99. One thing you won't be getting in this generation is a discount. That's a heck of a lot of money for a headset, but if you're in the market for a very expensive toy and have the cash to spare, this Vision Pro is shaping up to be the best, most performant one you can buy. I'll give you one guess what's delaying Apple's home robot. The iPad Pro with M5 and that same beautiful OLED display should make its way to consumers soon. Apple is reportedly working on several new pairs of AirPods, but there's still no word on one highly anticipated sequel. There's a new Apple TV set-top box on the way that may or may not help this rebrand make sense.</p>

Cupertino just launched its 5th-generation Apple silicon, the M5 chip, with the company saying that it has embedded a neural accelerator in each GPU core, allowing it to run AI workloads much faster. With the introduction of Neural Accelerators in the GPU, M5 delivers a huge boost to AI workloads,” Apple Senior Vice President of Hardware Technologies Johny Srouji said. “Combined with a big increase in graphics performance, the world's fastest CPU core, a faster Neural Engine, and even higher unified memory bandwidth, M5 brings far more performance and capabilities to MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Apple Vision Pro.” The company says that it has four times the peak GPU performance when it comes to AI processing over the M4, and that it offers up to 45% better graphics quality, plus third-generation ray tracing capability. Apple's press release mostly focuses on the chip's better performance in artificial intelligence workloads, but we're also hopeful that these numbers will translate to a better gaming experience on the Mac. Unfortunately, we don't know how the chip will perform compared to its competitors from AMD and Nvidia in the 14-inch MacBook Pro, as we haven't seen benchmarks yet. Those who are already on Apple M3 or newer should wait for third-party benchmarks to appear, just so they know if the M5 is worth upgrading to or if they should wait a couple more years.

A handheld Xbox has been rumored since at least the Xbox 360 era, where gaming forums were rife with speculation that Microsoft was about to face off against Nintendo's DS and Sony's PSP. If there was ever anything to the rumor, nothing came of it—until now, 20-odd years later, with Xbox's first genuine foray into portable gaming. The Redmond giant isn't diving in solo, though—rather than its own dedicated device, Microsoft has partnered with Asus to deliver two distinct units, the entry-grade ROG Xbox Ally at $600, and the more powerful ROG Xbox Ally X at a somewhat staggering $1,000. These aren't so much Xbox handhelds as Xbox-branded handhelds, though, adding recognizable iconography onto what might otherwise be the next generation of Asus' own portables. The team-up delivers top-tier portable play—but a frequently confusing experience. They're not Microsoft's answer to the Nintendo Switch 2, a bespoke console letting you seamlessly enjoy home-quality gaming on the go. Nor are they a take on the Steam Deck, a portable built around the Xbox ecosystem rather than your Steam library. Despite sporting the same signature “X” icon button as on an Xbox controller, these are handheld gaming PCs in Xbox drag, with all the good and bad that entails. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Both X-ROGs run a full version of Windows 11, with the Xbox app for PC's new “full screen experience” as the default user interface. Because these are PCs at heart, though, even if you're using the same Xbox account as on your Xbox Series X or Series S, your game library on the X-ROGs will only show titles included in the Xbox Play Anywhere program. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Unfortunately, Microsoft is also crow-barring AI features in, with a new Gaming Copilot assistant (also coming to the desktop PC Xbox app). It's pitched as “your personal gaming sidekick,” recognizing what's happening onscreen and responding to voice inquiries for help on parts you're stuck on. It speaks in one of four “personalities,” including a cringey “heroic”—it's detestable, but thankfully optional, so I quickly deactivated. Will a future system update break your games? And, while you can swap to a full Windows desktop view at any time—and even connect a mouse if you don't fancy battling through Windows' endless menus and submenus with the X-ROGs' thumbsticks or touchscreens—finding exactly what setting may need fiddling with when you just want to play a game can be a chore. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, because the X-ROGs are fundamentally regular PCs, they're a lot more versatile than Nintendo's or Valve's efforts. Better still, the Xbox app aggregates all games installed on the system into one library view, regardless of where they originate. You can even turn your ROG Xbox into an ersatz Steam Deck by running Steam in Big Picture mode (although some of its controller key bindings may not work). All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. While I've gotten a few mods running on my Steam Deck over the years, its Linux underbelly makes things trickier. On the X-ROGs, I've been able to use mods as easily as on my main gaming desktop, with no second-guessing if they'll actually work. It's a great feature that's facilitated by having standard Windows as the base. But wait, there's a third UI player in the mix: Asus' own Armoury Crate SE software. This allows you to instantly switch power profiles, create custom control inputs, or set frame rate limits. However, fully open Armoury Crate and you'll find an array of far deeper controls, from granular system settings to tweaking color profiles of the LED rings that sit under each thumbstick. After a week with the X-ROGs, I'm finally familiar with where functions live, but the learning curve is steep, and having essentially three central interfaces—Xbox, Windows, Armoury Crate—for a single device is ridiculous. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. On this at least, the X-ROGs are no different from Asus' original ROG Ally or 2024's ROG Ally X, or even other Windows-based gaming handhelds, such as the Lenovo Legion S Go. Hopping between multiple UIs doing variations of the same thing has become a kind of jank that feels baked into the entire product category. However, the Xbox branding here is likely to attract players who, while perhaps more committed than “casual” gamers, still want a slick, pick-up-and-play experience from a handheld. Both the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X are significant improvements on Asus' predecessors. In fact, these might be two of the best handheld gaming PCs I've ever used—although the use case for each ends up being quite different. At a glance, the X-ROGs might seem separated only by colorways. The ROG Xbox Ally comes in white with multi-colored A/B/X/Y face buttons, while the ROG Xbox Ally X opts for all-black with gray buttons. They look and feel distinctly premium, as you'd expect given their prices. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Ergonomics are superb, with angular grips feeling more like holding a conventional Xbox controller than the brick-with-a-screen of many handheld PCs. All inputs are within reach, from the traditionally asymmetrical thumbsticks to the textured shoulder buttons and satisfyingly chunky triggers. At the rear sit two macro buttons with customizable inputs. Despite being nominally heavier than a Steam Deck's 669 grams—the Xbox ROG Ally weighs in at 670 grams, the Ally X at 715 grams—the masterful design means they sit better in the hand and are more comfortable to use for long play periods. Both models also use the same screen, a 7-inch, 1920 x 1080p, 16:9 IPS touchscreen panel with a 120-Hz refresh rate and 500-nit brightness. Buyers will want to get a screen protector—it's made of Gorilla Glass Victus, but given how often you'll poke or swipe the screen to navigate the system, added protection feels necessary. When it's not covered in finger smudges, this is a great, sharp display at its default settings, and its performance can be further tweaked in Armoury Crate, either manually or with quick-sets tailored to specific gaming genres. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, at the prices these handhelds are coming in at, it's hard not to feel a bit shortchanged that the screen isn't OLED, even on the higher-priced ROG Xbox Ally X. These are essentially the same screens as on Asus' previous ROG Ally, and despite both X-ROGs offering a higher resolution and refresh rate, the Steam Deck OLED‘s perfect black levels and ability to deliver HDR does still give it a slight edge. Some differences are small—the Ally's triggers incorporate Hall effect tech, while the Ally X uses Microsoft's Impulse Triggers for more nuanced haptics. Both feature two USB-C ports at the top—and you can charge through either—but the Ally's are both USB 3.2 Gen 2 (with DisplayPort 1.4 output and Power Delivery 3.0 support), while the Ally X has one USB 4 port with Thunderbolt 4 compatibility, and one USB 3.2 Gen 2 (both with DisplayPort 2.1 out), giving more versatility. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The Ally packs in an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor, 16 GB LPDDR5-6400 RAM, and a 512-GB SSD—no slouch, but wildly outclassed by the Ally X. The flagship model's Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme chip is an absolute beast, and it's backed up by 24 GB LPDDR5X-8000 RAM and a 1-TB SSD. Installing Forza Horizon 5 on both, the Ally impressed initially, still meeting requirements for the game's “High” quality preset. Plugging the Ally in, maxing its power profile to the 20-watt “Turbo” setting in Armoury Crate, and boosting just about every other possible metric improved things, reaching a high of 48 fps—eminently playable, but nothing amazing.

On the Ally X, however, Forza ran at a smooth 60 fps straight away, off battery. Again, lifting the frame cap to 120 fps, even the Ally X never quite hit that magic number, but it did hover around 78 to 85 fps, while plugging in and setting the console to its 25-watt Turbo max saw it occasionally crest over 90 fps. Similar performance differentials were observed on other demanding AAA games installed on each handheld, including Gears of War: Reloaded, Avowed, and Halo Infinite—the Ally struggled while the Ally X handled everything I threw at it. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The basic Ally can shine with less technologically demanding games, though. Hollow Knight: Silksong hits a consistent 120 fps, while some retro classics and indies installed via Steam—Final Fantasy IX, Dredge, and Owlboy among them—all ran without a hitch. Both X-ROGs use standard M.2 2280 factor SSDs, though, so they should be easily upgradable, and both support microSD cards too—again better for smaller, less demanding games to be installed on. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. There's one other workaround for performance throttles or storage issues, though: cloud gaming, which is surprisingly well implemented here. Testing out Bethesda's DOOM: The Dark Ages through Xbox Cloud Gaming (other platforms such as Nvidia's GeForce Now are also accessible), it connected quickly, played without a single drop-out, and ran at a consistent 60 fps on both X-ROGs. I don't know what witchcraft Xbox has been doing backstage, but this is the best cloud gaming I've ever encountered. Whatever and however you're playing, battery life is impressive for both X-ROGs. Even though the Ally X again has an advantage—packing an 80-Wh battery versus the Ally's 60-Wh—I regularly got around six hours' play out of both units between charges, depending on the game. Cloud gaming saw barely any drain on either, about 7 percent per hour, but locally installed Forza or Gears slurped up around 30 to 35 percent of a full charge on both X-ROGs in around 45 minutes. Even that's far less draining than I expected, rendering both units surprisingly viable for longer play. Both X-ROGs stand out in the increasingly crowded field of handheld gaming PCs, thanks to strong design, comfort of use, and cross-platform versatility that outpace most of the competition. Neither model is perfect, but for its first venture into the handheld space, Microsoft gets a lot right in its partnership with Asus. If you want a reasonably powerful gaming PC that can run small to mid-size games with ease, and even some more demanding ones in a playable if not astounding state, the ROG Xbox Ally is a great choice—especially if you're happy to turn to cloud gaming for the most demanding titles. If you want uncompromising performance and high-end capabilities, though, the ROG Xbox Ally X is a clear winner. It breezes through everything the baseline Ally does, and delivers authentic AAA gaming to boot. In doing so, it's clearly, unabashedly targeting the “hardcore” gamer—and it's going to financially bleed them for the privilege. Those prices are by far the biggest obstacle for either model, but if you're able to splash out on a high-end handheld, these can take portable gaming to the next level.
