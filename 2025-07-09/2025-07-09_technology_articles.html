                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Olivia is not, in fact, a human being, but instead an AI chatbot that screens applicants, asks for their contact information and résumé, directs them to a personality test, and occasionally makes them “go insane” by repeatedly misunderstanding their most basic questions. As a result, virtually any hacker could have accessed the records of every chat Olivia had ever had with McDonald's applicants—including all the personal information they shared in those conversations—with tricks as straightforward as guessing the username and password “123456." On Wednesday, security researchers Ian Carroll and Sam Curry revealed that they found simple methods to hack into the backend of the AI chatbot platform on McHire.com, McDonald's website that many of its franchisees use to handle job applications. Carroll and Curry, hackers with a long track record of independent security testing, discovered that simple web-based vulnerabilities—including guessing one laughably weak password—allowed them to access a Paradox.ai account and query the company's databases that held every McHire user's chats with Olivia. Carroll says he only discovered that appalling lack of security around applicants' information because he was intrigued by McDonald's decision to subject potential new hires to an AI chatbot screener and personality test. “I just thought it was pretty uniquely dystopian compared to a normal hiring process, right? And that's what made me want to look into it more,” says Carroll. “So I started applying for a job, and then after 30 minutes, we had full access to virtually every application that's ever been made to McDonald's going back years.” When WIRED reached out to McDonald's and Paradox.ai for comment, a spokesperson for Paradox.ai shared a blog post the company planned to publish that confirmed Carroll and Curry's findings. “We do not take this matter lightly, even though it was resolved swiftly and effectively,” Paradox.ai's chief legal officer, Stephanie King, told WIRED in an interview. “We're disappointed by this unacceptable vulnerability from a third-party provider, Paradox.ai. One of the exposed interactions between a job applicant and “Olivia.” Carroll says he became interested in the security of the McHire website after spotting a Reddit post complaining about McDonald's hiring chatbot wasting applicants' time with nonsense responses and misunderstandings. He and Curry started talking to the chatbot themselves, testing it for “prompt injection” vulnerabilities that can enable someone to hijack a large language model and bypass its safeguards by sending it certain commands. There appeared to be no multifactor authentication for that Paradox.ai login page. With those credentials, Carroll and Curry could see they now had administrator access to a test McDonald's “restaurant” on McHire, and they figured out all the employees listed there appeared to be Paradox.ai developers, seemingly based in Vietnam. They found a link within the platform to apparent test job postings for that nonexistent McDonald's location, clicked on one posting, applied to it, and could see their own application on the backend system they now had access to. That's when Carroll and Curry discovered the second critical vulnerability in McHire: When they started messing with the applicant ID number for their application—a number somewhere above 64 million—they found that they could increment it down to a smaller number and see someone else's chat logs and contact information. WIRED got in touch with two applicants via their exposed contact information, and they confirmed they had applied for jobs at McDonald's on the specified dates. That means the data could be used by fraudsters impersonating McDonald's recruiters and asking for financial information to set up a direct deposit, for instance. “If you wanted to do some sort of payroll scam, this is a good approach,” Curry says. The exposure of applicants' attempts—and in some cases failures—to get what is often a minimum-wage job could also be a source of embarrassment, the two hackers point out. “I have nothing but respect for McDonald's workers,” he says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I launched a steam demo of my programming game last month (you can find it in my HN profile if you are curious), and without having to do any marketing of my own built up about 1000 wishlists in a month just thanks to getting traffic from similar but more well known titles like Exapunks. I believe the actual reason is that Steam has a near monopoly on PC game distribution, and you'll get a lot of hate from consumers if you distribute on competing platforms (Epic) but not Steam.Taking it a step further - 30% of revenue seems absurdly high for what Steam offers (see the app store for a similar racket), and I hope Valve faces much stiffer competition in the future so they're forced to bring down their cut. Taking it a step further - 30% of revenue seems absurdly high for what Steam offers (see the app store for a similar racket), and I hope Valve faces much stiffer competition in the future so they're forced to bring down their cut. Maybe 15% if you employ enough people for support or audits. At 10.8 billion profit in 2024 with less than 500 employees, it seems like a racket. My maximum new game price is $20 and I would need a compelling argument to break it. If a game is $1 today, it will be $1 again in the future. Even people who are pretty frugal buy clothes they never wind up wearing.I must admit though that I bought a Steam Deck instead of a Nintendo Switch precisely because I had a big backlog of Steam games which I could play instead of buying new games for the Switch. I played through Persona 5 Royal and now I'm enjoying Death End Re:Quest which might be a trash game to you but it scratches my itch. I played through Persona 5 Royal and now I'm enjoying Death End Re:Quest which might be a trash game to you but it scratches my itch. Back in the 80s when games were expensive, a backlog was unthinkable. Sure, I did but games I didn't play much because I didn't like them, but there was no such thing of an unopened, unplayed game for me If I spent 120 hours grinding VN scenes and RPG encounters in every $60 game I played, my backlog would never end. Finishing the game and seeing Royal announced with expanded content a few months later felt a bit like this: https://tenor.com/view/saul-goodman-trash-can-gif-25675857 For one thing,  the game does not make you make any hard choices when it comes to the VN content. It is so freakin' long that playing it on New Game Plus is unthinkable so you feel compelled to max out everyone's social rank in one run,  which isn't that hard but makes a long game even longer.I have the same complaint which I have with most turn-based games (a genre I love because I really enjoy having a big party) in that there are many mechanics,  such as status effects,  buffs and debuffs, that really don't matter. There are plenty of turn-based games that do something interesting (where you make a deck and get 3 random action cards,  where you have to be careful not to cast healing spells on your enemies or attacks on your friends,  where a lot of your scaling comes from customizing combos in Neptunia,  where you knockback enemies and they carom like pool balls in DER:Q) but you can make an AAA game that doesn't add anything to FF7 and gamers and game reviewers will accept it.An answer we've been chewing on is an anti-Persona answer in the sense of a much shorter (30m-12h) game where you really do need to make multiple playthroughs with or without NGP to really experience it all.

I watched a talk on Steam and independent authors' revenue, and it's a tremendous tax on top of an environment where it's so difficult to build a good product, generate revenue, and grow to begin with. And then complain about the price of games, too.And predominantly my most vocal users are teenagers, and running communities where they want to interact with the developers is just such a tremendous liability because you almost have to parent their behavior.It's just an awful environment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Cowabunga, motherf*ckers.” Twisted Metal is back on July 31 and its latest trailer is everything fans want from the show and so much more. Not only will John (Anthony Mackie) and Quiet (Stephanie Beatriz) be involved, but a whole slew of unforgettable and terrifying Twisted Metal characters too. You'll see them roll called in the new trailer, which features ludicrous action, massive explosions, and Ludacris himself, at least on the soundtrack. If you haven't seen Twisted Metal and are thinking, “There's no way the show can be that fun,” I assure you it is. We haven't seen season two yet but season one did a fantastic job of balancing that over-the-top, batshit insanity with a just human enough story of people fighting back against the system. Last time, that was run by Neve Campbell's Raven, and now it seems the stand-in will be Anthony Carrigan's Calypso. Which kind of completely flips the energy, does it not? All in all, despite a strong audience response and this season two renewal, you get this feeling like Twisted Metal is eventually going to get swept up in the unending deluge of streaming shows that come and go. Fingers crossed this season lives up to the first, and we get to see the story play out for much, much longer. Showrun by Michael Jonathan Smith (Cobra Kai) and with executive producers such as Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (Deadpool), Twisted Metal returns for season two on Peacock on July 31. Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what's next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. Anthony Mackie and Stephanie Beatriz finally start the action-packed vehicle battle royale in season two, out July 31. Anthony Mackie returns to star in season two of Peacock's post-apocalyptic video game adaptation, arriving July 31. The video game adaptation features Captain America star Anthony Mackie, Stephanie Beatriz, and is coming summer 2025. We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.</p>

We're scouring the hottest sales at all retailers for the best Amazon Prime Day deals on gaming GPUs, CPUs, desktop PCs, laptops, monitors, and even hard drives, among other items, and collecting those here for you, live. We aren't just selecting deals willy-nilly, either; our domain experts are curating a list of the best value items, often based on our in-depth reviews, benchmarks, and extensive historical pricing analysis to ensure that when we say it's a great deal, it truly is. We'll be updating this deals live blog to help you find the best ways to save money on gear that can upgrade your PC and your entire tech life. The 4TB QLC-based P310 NVMe SSD has hit an all-time low price this Prime Day. The QLC-based drive boasts excellent performance of up to 7,100 MB/s. Equipped with the Phison E27T controller, the drive also has excellent thermals and won't be in danger of throttling, making it excellent for usage in a multitude of systems. An all-time low price for this mid-range gaming monitor. It also comes with AMD FreeSync and several other features designed to give you an advantage over your opponents in every match. HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. If you have headphones (and come on, most of us do) for your PC, you know how much desk space they can take up. And most headphone stands only make the problem worse by adding their footprint to your table. It clips onto the side of my desk and rotates 180 degrees so I can hang my headphones under the desk or facing outward. EURPMASK Rotating Headphone Stand: was $12.99, now $7.69 at AmazonThis headphone stand clips on to your desk so your headphones can hang off of the side rather than taking up valuable table real estate. One thing I've noticed about the EURPMASK is that it is long enough to hold not one, but two headsets. So I can hang a couple of pairs there and really keep my desk neat. The Lian Li DK-07X is a motorized standing desk that features support for dual E-ATX PC systems. Or, naturally, if you only need one PC in your desk, you can have more fans and drives in a single configuration. Other features include built-in cable organization, wireless charging pads, and multiple USB ports. Get an enormous 49-inch OLED monitor with 144Hz refresh rate, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, and more. I've recently moved house and my first thought for the new office was "I need to work on my cable management", seriously it was! I love a messy desk, it shows the thought process of a hundred projects and it makes me feel happy. But I also don't want to trash my new home. So how can I have all my 3D printers, PCs, lights, audio / video equipment etc but minimize the clutter?I needed some help and these three products did indeed help me. We kick off with the ubiquitous cable / cord management kits. These kits come with adhesive holders for all manner of wires. A few more lock the cable / wire in place. There are also some connectors for cable ties, wire wrapping and sleeves to group wires together so they look less messy. Everything you need to tame the mess of wires that lurks behind your desk. Instead of these, I use reusable cable ties and Amazon has a load on sale for Prime Day. These hook and loop cable ties will hold up to six inch thicknesses of cables and we get a pack of 60 to tidy up our lives! Sixty reusable cable ties for under $6 is a great deal. This kit contains six, 15.7 inch lengths that are self-adhesive and can be used on walls, under desks and behind cabinets. Stick it to the wall, under your desk and tidy those cables. We've been tracking the best 4TB SSD deals on offer, notably drives that cost around $0.05 per GB of storage, so why not take a look at 2TB models too? Turns out you can get a smaller 2TB driver for less than half the price, making buying two more cost-effective than buying one 4TB drive, if you have the space, of course. The 16-inch Alienware X16 R2 gaming laptop is now at all-time low pricing. This laptop comes packing a 16-core Intel Core 7 155H CPU and last-gen RTX 4070 GPU with 8GB of VRAM, but that's a solid amount of horsepower considering this price point. The QHD+ panel has a blazing 240 Hz refresh rate and 3ms latency. The system also comes with 16GB of DDR5-7467 memory and a 1 TB SSD. Yes, this laptop has a previous-gen GPU, but it is more than worth the asking price, so we expect these to fly off the shelves in short order. This tiny magnetic, USB-charging flashlight is great for PC building and other everyday tasks – and it's on sale for just $14 I picked up the OLIGHT IMINI 2 mini flashlight a few months ago on impulse, because it looked well designed and cost around $20, but now it's down to just below $14, and I'm tempted to pick up a couple as gifts. The simplicity of its design and its built-in USB-A plug for charging makes it fun to use – just pull the back off and it turns on, and the magnet lets you easily mount it anywhere you need a little extra light, like inside a steel PC case while you're fiddling with fan or RGB wires or looking for that screw you dropped. The OLIGHT IMINI 2 EDC Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight: now $14 at Amazon (was $20)At just 2.17 inches long, this flashlight is rated to 50 lumens, and it sports a magnetic back with a USB-A plug for charging. The OLIGHT IMINI 2 is also small enough for your keychain, is designed to live with your keys, and includes two silicone covers for the USB port and a little carabiner clip. But the flashlight portion is only held to the charging port via a magnet, and I feel like (for me, at least) it would fall off and get lost before too long. It's not going to replace a full-sized flashlight, but it's very handy when you need something more fun and convenient (at least in some ways) than your smartphone's flashlight. If you're on the hunt for a great SSD, this Samsung 990 EVO Plus SSD 2TB is down to its lowest-ever price, just $113 thanks to a massive 36% discount. That makes it better value than the 4TB model at $0.05 per GB. With speeds of 7,250MB/s (read) and 6,300MB/s (write), it's also very snappy compared to cheaper 2TB alternatives. Get a 2TB EVO Plus for the lowest-ever price of $113, with PCIe Gen 5 technology, HMB, and Turbowrite 2.0. We've got a run down of every drive on the market with a breakdown of speeds, price, and cost per GB. Hoto's snap-together tool kits are great for keeping cramped workspaces tidy, and they're nearly 30% off During Prime Day, though, all three kits are on sale for $20 off, plus an additional "brand promotion" coupon of 10%, taking them down to $71 each. That's still expensive, but significantly less so, especially if you plan to pick up two or three of these kits rather than just one. Hoto's slim rotary tool sports a 4V brushless motor, variable speed up to 22000 RPM, and 38 accessories to compete with your old Dremel. Like the other kits, it also comes in a magnetic snap-together shell that keeps your accessories all together and connects to the other tool kits. With three speeds, a built-in light, and 20 bits, the Hoto Drill Pen is built for working with 3D Prints, wood, acrylic, and even metal. The Hoto mini electric screwdriver has 56 bits for just about any small project or repair, and a maximum torque rating of 0.5 N⋅m at 250 RPM. It's good for working with small electronics, servicing laptops, and building PCs, but you may want something larger with a bit more power for tough-to-loosen thumb screws. If you're wondering what the difference is between the three devices, other than their bits, it comes down to torque and RPM. Not everyone will need all three, but they're designed for very different tasks. If you're in the UK looking for a Prime Day deal on a graphics card, well, the RTX 5070 has just fallen below £500, thanks to this 5% saving on the MSI RTX 5070 Shadow 2X, dubbed as such because it comes with two fans, now just £499 at Amazon. This two-fan card from MSI will fit in pretty much any build thanks to its compact size. I've been furiously printing with the Anycubic Kobra 3 V2 combo, and it's currently $100 off, just $399 I've been using this printer for a couple of months now, and I've been very happy with it as my first 3D printer, so much so that I ordered the larger Kobra 3 Max, which is also on sale for $449 without the multi-color AMS module. The Anycubic Kobra 3 V2: now $399 at Amazon (was $499)The Anycubic Kobra 3 V2 combo is a bed-slinging 3D printer with a 255×255×260 mm (10x10x10.2 inches) build volume and print speeds up to 600 mm/s. It also comes with an AMS (automatic material system), a box that holds four spools of filament that are automatically fed to the printer. My experience with the Anycubic Kobra 3 V2 as a 3D printing novice has been solidly positive. The automatic bed leveling has worked every time for me. And while I have had a few failed prints here and there, as well as some lifting at the corners, I put most of that down to inexperience (and the fact that my air conditioner blows across the outer edge of my printer bed). Switching colors during a print wastes a fair amount of filament, as the extruder needs to purge the nozzle area. So prints with lots of colors in different layers will create a lot of printer "poop" and also be significantly slower. Still, if you're really excited about complex multi-color prints, you can pick up a second AMS from Anycubic and connect two to the Kobra V3, for 8-color printing. But personally, I have yet to use more than two or three colors in a print. If you're looking for a great gaming headset that both sounds good and will make you sound good, our favorite wireless headset is currently on sale at 25% off. The Xbox and PS5 versions of Razer's BlackShark V2 Pro wireless headset are currently priced at $149.99 at Amazon — down $50 from the retail price of $199.99. The BlackShark V2 Pro is a wireless over-ear gaming headset with both 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth connectivity (though, not simultaneous audio-mixing), 50mm titanium dynamic drivers, and a comfortable, lightweight build that you can wear all day. While the EQ needs a little tuning out of the box, once you've done some tweaking the headset sounds great for both music and gaming, and it also comes with several pro-tuned game presets for popular titles such as Fortnite and Apex Legends. All EQ tuning saves directly to the headset, so your sound tweaks will be available whether you're listening on your PC, console, or phone. The standout feature on the BlackShark V2 Pro is its detachable "HyperClear Super Wideband" mic, which is a 9.9mm condenser mic that will make you sound fantastic. No need to pick up a standalone gaming mic with this headset! It may have been released three years ago, but Razer's DeathAdder V3 Pro is still one of my favorite mice — and my favorite Razer mouse — ever. And it's currently on sale for just $86.44 at Amazon (in black), down 42% from its retail price of $149.99. The DeathAdder V3 Pro is a lightweight wireless gaming mouse with a fantastic shape, Razer's Focus Pro 30K optical sensor, and up to 90 hours of battery life. It weighs just 63g and is perfect for a range of gamers. The DeathAdder V3 Pro is a lightweight wireless gaming mouse with one of the best shapes we've ever tested — a right-handed ergonomic shape that makes the mouse feel like an extension of your arm. It's a fairly simple, stripped down mouse otherwise, with five programmable buttons, a notched scroll wheel, and two forms of connectivity: 2.4GHz wireless and wired (USB-C). It fits perfectly in your hand and weighs just 2.22 ounces (63g — 64g in white), has tactile, clicky optical switches, and gets up to 90 hours of battery life. If you're looking for the ultimate in PC gaming performance, it's hard to beat the Alienware Area-51 with RTX 5090 GPU and Intel Core Ultra 9 285K CPU. Alienware Area-51 (RTX 5090, Core Ultra 9 285K): was $6099, now $5199 at DellThis tricked-out configuration of the Alienware Area-51 sports an RTX 5090 GPU, Core Ultra 9 285K CPU, 64GB of RAM, a 4TB SSD, and a 1,500W power supply. We reviewed a similar configuration of the Alienware Area-51 (but with a 2TB SSD) back in April and were blown away by its performance. So, if you're looking for the ultimate in PC performance, this deal is hard to beat. We haven't seen many graphics card deals from Amazon itself this Prime Day, but Newegg has a couple aggressive discounts on a pair of RTX 50-series graphics cards. As long as you're OK getting your savings back as a Newegg gift card, you can get an RTX 5060 or an RTX 5070 for less than MSRP—a rare event in today's graphics card market. First up, Newegg will give you $50 back on one of Asus' Prime GeForce RTX 5060 cards, taking it from $339.99 to an effective $289.99. This is among the lowest prices we've seen on an RTX 5060 card so far, and it's a solid pick for 1080p gaming so long as you can live within its 8GB of VRAM. The RTX 5060 already has modest power requirements, so Asus' triple-fan cooler should keep this card plenty cool and quiet. The GeForce RTX 5060 8GB is a solid graphics card for 1080p gaming, and its Blackwell architecture gives gamers access to Nvdia's full range of DLSS 4 upscaling and framegen features. ASUS' Prime card has a nice triple-fan cooler that's rarely seen in cards around Nvidia's $300 MSRP, and this Newegg deal goes $10 lower than that. If you have a higher-resolution, higher-refresh-rate monitor and you're looking for a Blackwell upgrade, it's worth checking out MSI's Ventus 3X OC take on the GeForce RTX 5070 12GB. MSI's triple-fan Ventus 3X OC version of this card should keep things cool and quiet. Stack a $20 rebate and $70 back on a Newegg gift card, and this card comes out to $20 under Nvidia's $550 MSRP for this card, making it one of the cheapest RTX 5070s we've seen so far. The RTX 5070 brings a strong triple threat to the midrange of the GPU market: enough raster and ray-tracing performance at 1440p to natively push high-resolution monitors, plus Nvidia's superior DLSS 4 upscaling and unique multi-frame generation capability. This MSI Ventus card is a good catch if you can grab MSI's own rebate and don't mind spending $70 of Newegg bucks at some point in the future. The Dell S3222DGM has long sat atop our list of best gaming monitors. This 32-inch, 2560 x 1440 display has an epic contrast ratio of 3,700:1 and a speedy, 165 Hz refresh rate. It also has excellent build quality and vibrant color. Now, the Dell S3222DGM is on sale for $263 at Best Buy, down from $329. Dell S3222DGM, 32-inch 2K 165 Hz Monitor: now $263 at Best Buy (was $329)This is the lowest price we've seen in a while. Overall, this is a great combination of price, performance and quality. At this low price, it may be time to buy. This powered, USB 3.0 hub has a whopping 10 Type-A ports, each with its own toggle switch. It's also extremely well-built with attractive blue power lights and toggle switches that have a sturdy, clicky feel. For Prime Day, the HB-BU10 is now $37.99, reduced from $44.99 at Amazon. At that price, it's quite a bargain and well worth the spend. Using the HB-BU10, I can connect every peripheral on my desk and then-sone, including my webcam, external SSDs, USB speaker, microSD card reader and Yubikey security key. But the toggle switches are what make this hub really stand out. I just turn off the speaker and turn on the wireless dongle for my wireless headset, no going into Windows settings to switch audio devices. I can also use the toggle switches with microcontrollers such as a Raspberry Pi Pico that normally need to be unplugged and replugged to reboot. Gaming laptops are usually the stars of the show, but there are plenty of productivity-focused laptops on offer during Prime Day. The Samsung Galaxy Book 5 Pro 360 is 18% off for Prime Day. This 13-inch MacBook Air uses Apple's latest chip, M4, without a fan for silent operation. The 13-inch MacBook Air is a competing Arm-based device with Apple's M4 processor. OLED monitors are gaining popularity due to their perfect blacks and superior contrast, so we've rounded up the best OLED panels we've seen so far for Prime Day, and of the six, we've chosen the Alienware AW3423DWF to highlight as a lower-cost option. The Alienware AW3423DWF is a great panel that continues to impress despite its age, and it's $100 off for Prime Day. We tested this panel thoroughly in our in-depth review, finding it to have wonderful motion processing and SDR and HDR color performance, ultimately awarding it five stars. If you want an OLED monitor with almost no downsides, this might be the ultimate Prime Day deal. We've clocked our five-star rated, "near-perfect" Alienware 360Hz 1440p QD-OLED AW2725DF at $300 off, making it just $599 and a steal this Prime Day. It delivers knockout HDR performance for movies and games alike, features 0.03ms response times, and rocks a futuristic design on the back. This is already an easy recommendation, now at its reduced price, we're almost begging you not to miss it. As you can see from our testing, this monitor shines in benchmarking; the only downsides we could find were no internal speakers and no 3.5mm headphone jack. But at $300 off, we're quite happy to put those quibbles aside. You can get a super fast external storage device sale this Prime Day, but for that you'll have to opt for an SSD. You can also get a slower yet more capacious and affordable hard drive that hits the spot at a sweet deal, too, bringing us to your two options. The WD 5TB Elements portable external HDD hits the spot with 5TB of storage for a mere $115, a nice savings for Prime Day. Naturally this won't be the fastest drive out there due to its spinning platters, but it'll get the job done for bulk storage. The Crucial X10 is a lightning-fast portable SSD with sequential read speeds up to 2,100 MB/s. The Crucial X10 is a lightning-fast portable SSD with sequential read speeds up to 2,100 MB/s. You can opt for faster SSD storage, but the upcharge is steep. The company also has 1TB, 6TB, and 8TB models on offer at stellar prices, which you can read about here. Grab yourself a $1,000 saving on this Gigabyte Auros gaming PC at Newegg. For $2,999, you get an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, RTX 5080, 64GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 2TB NVMe SSD. We'd have like to have seen a bit more storage in a $3k rig, but this is still an epic saving. There are some astonishing processor savings at Amazon for Prime Day right now. Two standouts include these AMD Ryzen 9000 CPUs, with discounts of up to $215. This is the perfect processor for those building a powerful workstation. If you want to save even more, then check out this AMD Ryzen 5 9600X, now just $165 at Amazon, an all-time low price. The AMD Ryzen 5 9600X comes with six cores and 12 threads, with a maximum boost speed of 5.4GHz and 32 MB of L3 cache. Get plug-and-play compatibility with any USB-capable device and speeds of up to 1,050MB/s. Get a whopping 37% off this external solid state drive from Samsung, perfect for professionals working with media or even as a backup drive. Perfect for picking up an extra SSD or a new case! Factor in that saving and you're looking at getting the card for just $789, which is as good as it gets for the 5070 Ti. You can get a 5070 Ti for $829 from Amazon without a gift card, so the saving is less but you're saving hard cash, rather than in store credits. Buy the 5070 Ti at Newegg and get $110 of store credit after you've made your purchase. This is perfect if you want to complement your new card with an upgrade to your SSD, PC case, or even a monitor. Want a slimmer saving but in cold hard cash? I recommend the Zotac 5070 Ti at Amazon, now $829, a $170 saving. The SteelSeries Arena 9 are our top pick for best PC speakers when it comes to surround sound. With 5.1 configuration and 300 watts of power they are a truly wall-shaking solution to your gaming setup. We've seen them for less, but it's unlikely this price will be beaten during the Prime Day week. We loved these speakers in our Arena 9 review, specifically because they're very powerful and offer fantastic audio with true surround sound. Aside from how much space any 5.1 system takes up, our only ever gripe has been the price, which makes this 34% saving all the more alluring. That's definitely the case with this gaming PC from CyberPowerPC, which is one of the cheapest ways to get your hands on an RTX 5070. This system is currently 15% off for Prime Day, saving you $300. The CyberPowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC features an RTX 5070 and an Intel Core i9-14900KF, paired with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD. This is enough power to let you play the latest titles at 1440p and enjoy your favorite VR games. For $1,680, the Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC comes armed with an RTX 5070 paired with Intel's fastest gaming chip, the Core i9-14900KF. The system is also equipped with 32GB of RAM that will keep things snappy even during multi-tasking, and a 2TB SSD. I have a feeling this one will sell out quickly. At least two Tom's Hardware editors own the HOTO NEX 01 Pro screwdriver which has 33% off for Amazon Prime Day HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. Charging is via USB-C and from each full charge you get around 1000 screws. I am one of the staff members who owns this screwdriver, and I've built many IKEA cabinets and recently built an arcade cabinet using this great screwdriver. This is a deal that I can personally stand behind, because I bought the Hollyland Lark M2 Wireless Lavalier Microphone back in December 2024, and it wasn't this cheap! With noise cancelation, long-range Hollyland Lark M2 microphones are an excellent choice for conference calls, content creation, and interviews. To control the microphones, there is a single button that turns on / off noise cancellation. For more features there is an accompanying Android / iOS app that enables individual control of audio levels, and noise cancellation. The Hollyland Lark M2 Wireless Lavalier Microphones come with a kit bag full of extras. When not in use, the two microphones and the receiver are contained in a plastic case with onboard LiPo battery charging, just like Airpods. When you are done with them, throw them in the charging case and they will charge ready for the next interview. Paired with a good set of headphones, you have an excellent platform for content creation. I genuinely love these microphones, they are much easier to use than clunky wired mics, and I can use them across many different devices without the need for drivers. Amazon Prime Day has brought us a massive sale on the Samsung 9100 Pro SSD range. Ideal for gaming, computing, or workstations, they're some of the most premium hard drives around. Ideal for gaming or workstations, this 9100 Pro from Samsung has read speeds of up to 14,800MB/s and is a hefty $150 off, down to its lowest-ever price of $399. For a small amount extra on each model you can also get one with a heatsink if you want to optimize your cooling. As noted, these 9100 Pro drives are some of the fastest we've ever tested. A 10 inch 12K mono LCD ensures that your resin prints come out crisp and perfect. In the box you get a super high resolution (12K!) The build plate is laser-carved for excellent bed adhesion and the Fresnel Collimating Light Source emits a uniform beam of light for better print accuracy. Elegoo are experts in resin 3D printers, and we've tested the older Saturn 2 8K and awarded it the Editor's Choice award back in 2022. Grab yourself a bargain gaming laptop with this ROG Strix G16, down to its lowest-ever price of $1,359. This Strix G16 comes with GeForce RTX 4060, Intel Core i9-14900HX, 16GB DDR5-5600, 1TB PCIe SSD, Wi-Fi 6E, and Windows 11. Now Prime Day has started there are laptops galore, so it really pays to peruse for a bargain if you've got the time. With the stroke of midnight PT, Amazon Prime Day has now gone live in the U.S., stay tuned as we start tracking deals across PC hardware, components, and beyond. I've been eyeing an OLED gaming monitor for years, and Samsung now has two great options with hefty savings for Amazon Prime Day. Its new OLED G8 is now almost a third off in the UK. You can score the 27-inch model for £799 instead of £1,099, a 27% saving, or grab the larger 32-inch model for £849 instead of £1,199. If you want a bit more monitor for your money, there's an even bigger saving on the larger 32-inch model. There are definitely still some cheaper 4K OLED monitors in the UK, but this is the best price we've seen yet on Samsung's premium offerings. That gets you a Gigabyte GeForce RTX 5070 WINDFORCE OC SFF 12G Graphics Card, which is discounted by 19% from its usual price of £619. You can also save big on this MSI RTX 5070 Ti. This deal, which gets you £160 off, brings the card within £10 of MSRP. You also get the 76MB L3 cache and support for DDR5 memory. This Zen 5 processor has 12 cores for a total of 24 threads. An unlocked multiplier means you can manually overclock the chip. As you can see, it stacks up very well in our CPU testing hierarchy, check out the benchmarks below: Good morning, sports fans, and welcome to the start of Amazon Prime Day in the UK - deals switched over at midnight, and there are some handsome hardware savings to be had in the early running. Stephen here to take you through some of the early savings. It's a great time to pick up an all-purpose gaming mouse — Razer's Basilisk V3 Pro is currently on sale for $91.63 at Amazon (was $159.99). This wireless gaming mouse features an ergonomic, contoured right-handed shape, 11 programmable buttons, and a dual-mode tilt wheel (though, unlike the tilt wheel on the Logitech G502 X Plus, the Basilisk V3 Pro's is software- and not hardware-based). The Basilisk V3 Pro is an ergonomically-shaped all-purpose wireless gaming mouse with 11 programmable buttons, a dual-mode tilt wheel, and Razer's FocusPro 30K optical sensor. While there's a newer version of the Basilisk V3 Pro out — the Basilisk V3 Pro 35K, which features Razer's newest FocusPro 35K optical sensor — this is still a fantastic deal. The mouse features tri-mode connectivity (2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth, and wired via USB-C), up to 90 hours of battery life, and supports up to an 8,000 Hz wireless polling rate via Razer's HyperPolling Wireless Dongle (sold separately). It's on the larger side, but it's still a very comfortable mouse, with textured, grippy sides, a well-placed buttons, and tactile, clicky optical switches. Read our full review of the Basilisk V3 Pro here.— Sarah However, this Prime Day has seen even deeper cuts — in fact, these are the lowest prices we've ever seen for the current family of AirPods. At $89, the AirPods 4 are entering impulse buy territory, and they are great-sounding earbuds for people who don't need a lot of fancy features to enjoy their music. Apple's entry-level Bluetooth earbuds have 5 hours of runtime, which can be boosted by another 30 hours with the included USB-C charging case. The AirPods 4 with ANC bring Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, Transparency Mode, and a Qi Wireless charging case. For $119, you get Active Noise Cancellation, Transparency Mode, Adaptive Audio, and a USB-C charging case that also supports Qi wireless charging. Logitech's G735 wireless gaming headset isn't the only lightweight white wireless headset on the market, but it is exceptionally comfortable and very pretty. The G735 is part of Logitech's Aurora line, which launched in 2022 at a premium price — the G735 retailed for $229 at launch and currently retails for $259.99, but it's currently on sale for just $129.99 at Amazon. Logitech's G735 is a lightweight, comfortable wireless gaming headset with a detachable boom mic, dual wireless audio mixing, and pretty pastel dual-zone RGB lighting. It features simultaneous dual wireless connections, which means you can listen to and mix audio input from both a 2.4GHz wireless and a Bluetooth source at the same time. It also comes with a detachable boom mic and features replaceable earpads (Logitech sells different colors, for those who want to mix it up). It's an extremely lightweight headset, weighing just 9.6 ounces (273g), and offers up to 56 hours of battery life with the lighting turned off. Inside, it sports 40mm dynamic drivers with a frequency response range of 20 - 20,000 Hz. If you're looking for a gorgeous and responsive all-around gaming mouse, Logitech's G502 X Plus is currently on sale for just $114.99 at Amazon — down 36% from its current retail price of $179.99 (though it was $159.99 at launch), and close to the lowest price we've ever seen it at. The flagship gaming mouse features Logitech's Hero 25K optical sensor, 13 programmable controls, a dual-mode scroll wheel that switches easily between tactile and free-scrolling modes, and an eight-zone LED strip that makes it one of the prettiest mice we've ever tested. The Logitech G502 X Plus gaming mouse is close to its lowest price ever — this comfortable, all-purpose gaming mouse features 13 programmable controls, a dual-mode scroll wheel, Logitech's Hero 25K sensor, and an attractive, customizable RGB lighting strip with 8 seamlessly blended zones. The G502 X Plus is a large, comfortable gaming mouse with an ergonomically contoured right-handed shape. Read our full review of the Logitech G502 X Plus here. The price of SSD storage continues to stay low, surprisingly, in the face of economic turbulence, so you can still score some great deals on big 4TB SSDs. 4TB SSDs are on sale for $0.05 per GB, or even as low as $0.06 per GB for a premium Samsung SSD. We have a much larger list of both 4TB and 8TB SSDs over in our tracking deals post, which you can view here. Our resident Wi-Fi expert, Brandon Hill, has dug up several great Prime Day deals that will enable you to upgrade your wireless network to either Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7, depending on your budget. The TP-Link Archer AXE75 combines excellent performance and value in a Wi-Fi 6E router. The AXE75 Wi-Fi 6E router is now at $120, a nice savings of $30. This router blasts out up to 574 Mbps of bandwidth on the 2.4 GHz band and 2,402 Mbps on the 5 and 6 GHz bands. It also features four Gigabit LAN ports and a USB 3.0 port, allowing you to connect a shared storage device to the network. It also supports the OneMesh standard, which makes expanding your network with satellite devices to extend range a snap. It really doesn't get much easier than OneMesh, where you can simply plug in a networking device and get it working with zero networking hassle. The TP-Link Deco BE23 is a dual-band Wi-Fi 7 router that features three nodes and covers up to 6,500 square feet. Each node features 2.5 GbE ports and supports wired backhaul. This entry-level Wi-Fi mesh setup includes three devices that support MLO, just not on the 6 GHz band. You can check out Brandon's in-depth analysis of these deals here. For students, the MacBook Air (read our review) offers a slim profile, battery life so good you won't need to charge between classes, and strong performance without a fan, so your machine stays silent. This 13-inch MacBook Air uses Apple's latest chip, M4, without a fan for silent operation. Both MacBook Airs come in the same silver, starlight, midnight, or new sky blue colors.While Apple Intelligence isn't the most useful tool yet, at least it means these laptops start with 16GB of RAM alongside 256GB of storage. For those looking for a desktop, the Mac Mini offers a bit more power with the same M4 chip thanks to an active cooling fan. But it makes up for that curious design decision with lots of ports and quiet operation. For those looking for a desktop, the Mac Mini offers a bit more power with the same M4 chip thanks to an active cooling fan. But it makes up for that curious design decision with lots of ports and quiet operation. It also sports a fast 1ms response time and AMD FreeSync tech. An all-time low price for this mid-range gaming monitor. It also comes with AMD FreeSync and several other features designed to give you an advantage over your opponents in every match. This monitor is also built for use with other monitors — the three-sided borderless design eliminates the thick bezels found on many panels, thus allowing you to stack up side-by-side displays so you can use up to three panels with minimal bezel nastiness to distort your view. This monitor is at an all-time low pricing, and we don't know how long the deal will last. While not quite the best price we've ever seen on it, this Cooler Master MasterLiquid 360L Core 360mm cooler is 15% off and now just $85 at Amazon. If you're looking for a great CPU cooler that can shift heat from your processor, then this is a great bet. This is a great price on a really excellent all-in-one CPU cooler that will fit AMD Ryzen AM5/AM4 and Intel's LGA 1700/1200 sockets. Don't just take our word for it though. We're continuing to see good deals (and perhaps even better deals) at Amazon rivals like Newegg, including these Samsung EVO Plus SSD's, available in 2TB and 4TB models with hefty savings on both. The Samsung 990 EVO Plus 4TB is now available at an all-time low price, boasting speeds of up to 7,250 MB/s, a five-year warranty that covers an impressive 2,400 TB of writes, and PCIe Gen 5x2/4x4 hybrid functionality. Save even more money with Samsung's 2TB version of the 990 EVO Plus, with the same 7,250 MB/s speeds and a saving of $37. The latest Steam hardware survey indicates most players only have between 100GB to 249GB of free storage space on their hard drives, barely enough for a couple of AAA games in 2025. Amazon Prime Day hasn't even started yet, but it's already proving enormously fruitful for CPU savings from both AMD and Intel. We're tracking discounts of up to 58% on some models, with prices starting at just $66. If you want to save even more money, there's a fantastic Ryzen 5 9600X that's 41% off, now just $165. This is the perfect processor for those building a powerful workstation. The AMD Ryzen 5 9600X comes with six cores and 12 threads, with a maximum boost speed of 5.4GHz and 32 MB of L3 cache. Curious as to how these stack up to other great CPUs on the market, here's our extensive testing data from years of CPU benchmarking. We've been hungry for some RTX 50-series laptop deals in the run-up to Amazon Prime Day, and we finally have our first one, and it's a great one at that! Right now, you can grab $400 off the list price of this Alienware Aurora 16-inch 120Hz Gaming Laptop. Best Buy is hosting it's own Black Friday in July sale to rival Prime Day, and has stolen a march on Amazon with this an other laptop deals that are really quite excellent. Speedy SSDs get all the flashbulbs and attention, but the humble hard drive continues to chug along today in an untold number of desktop PCs, NAS, and various other bulk storage applications. That's because you simply can't beat the pricing for the sheer amount of capacity that you get for an HDD. This drive is specifically for PC use with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, 190MB/s top speed from its desirable CMR tech, and a two-year warranty. The BarraCuda is geared specifically for desktop HDD use, so its tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. The drive also uses the premium Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology, and not that cheap, performance-killing Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) tech found on bargain basement drives. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity trumps speed every time. The HS-01 has become my go-to smart soldering iron, and for good reason. Its not compact, but it is designed for travel thanks to an aluminum chassis and protective lid that keeps the soldering tip free from damage or debris. So no accidental keypresses when you are concentrating on soldering. The soldering iron heats up in seconds, and it can hit 420C (788F) with ease. I've soldered up countless projects with it, including a full Zilog Z80 computer kit, and a hexagon shaped PCB with slow color-changing LEDs. The HS-01 didn't skip a beat, it just worked. But Fnirsi has also given us a selection of six soldering iron tips that slot into the HS-01. From fine needle points used in surface mount soldering, to much broader tips used to lay vast amounts of heat into large ground planes or for speaker wires that greedily wick away heat. Bambu Lab has some great deals on the A1 3D printer for UK readers! But what if you don't want or need such an expensive and quite rightly one of the best 3D printers? We gave the A1 4.5 stars and an Editor's choice award because it was fast, intuitive, inexpensive and it comes with a direct drive extruder, useful for flexible filaments like TPU. Saving £130 on this great 3D printer is a really good deal. It may look simple, but this printer packs every automation necessary to plug in and print. This is the same Bambu Lab A1, but you also get a multi-color/material printing system for more advanced prints. Amazon has a couple of excellent UK deals on Crucial's P310 right now. With speeds of up to 7,100MB/s, it's perfect for running as your OS boot drive, the foundation of a budget build, or as a handy storage expansion/upgrade for your existing PC. With a whopping 21% off, the 4TB model is a great saving and the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model. Gaming laptop deals on Amazon UK are fairly scarce right now, but I have found this rather nifty Acer Nitro V16, now 17% off and £829 instead of £999. A similar spec Dell G15 5530 will set you back £1,049 on Amazon, as will the HP Victus 15-inch, both of which come with the same RTX 4050. There's also a 4060 option, but you won't find any savings on that right now, so it's much more expensive. We reviewed this laptop's forebear, the Acer Nitro 16, back in 2023. Since then, Acer has updated it with the aforementioned 8040 series Ryzen processors. With the uprated processor and this excellent deal, it's a pretty handy gaming laptop if you want to beat the Prime Day rush. While not totally solved, OLED burn-in concerns are minimal these days, and Samsung's OLED G6 is an alluring 25% off at Amazon right now, less than £600 for a 27-inch display. This deal is so good that it actually makes that 360Hz refresh rate option cheaper than the same resolution screen with just 240Hz, which you can still expect to pay £680 for. The lowest-ever price we've seen ahead of Prime Day, save some £200 (25%) on this Odyssey OLED G6 replete with HDMI 2.1, 360Hz refresh rate, HDR10+, and more. If you want to save even more money, Philips' excellent gaming offshoot Evnia is flogging its own 27-inch QHD OLED monitor for just £499. You'll get the same 1440p resolution, 360Hz refresh rate, response time, and connectivity. While the savings might not be as juicy as the Samsung, you'll save another £100 for a monitor with ostensibly the same spec sheet, only with a slightly less appealing brand and less eye-catching design. Prime Day doesn't officially kick off until midnight, but there are already some good early deals. This NZXT H6 Flow mid-tower PC case with panoramic class and 3 x 120mm fans (included) just hit its lowest ever price, a full 24% off and now just £76.44 instead of £99.99. We reviewed NZXT H6 Flow RGB and loved its impressive thermal results and the fact that it's very easy to build in. While that's modest for a case of this size, it's not a huge issue in the age of the M2 VNMe. This excellent mid-tower case comes with a panoramic glass panel and three 120mm fans. A four-star Tom's Hardware pick at full price, it's now fully 24%/£23 off for a limited time, the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model. Move fast, it's a limited run deal with constrained stock. Check out some of the benchmarks from our H6 Flow testing, including thermal and acoustic performance. As you can see, it's a little louder than some alternatives from Hyte under load, but outperformed both cases significantly in terms of thermal performance, with notable GPU cooling and a rather spiffy average. Snag a Samsung's award-winning 49-inch Odyssey OLED G9 monitor for only $959 at Amazon It has a dense resolution that measures in at 5120 x 1440px and a refresh rate that can get as high as 240Hz. This huge gaming monitor features a curved, 49-inch OLED panel. It also has a USB hub for connecting peripherals.

Grok made at least 100 posts using the phrase “every damn time” within a one-hour span on Tuesday evening. Because the fragile PC brigade fears anything that doesn't parrot their sanitized narrative.

Nvidia on Wednesday became the world's first company to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable company ever. By reaching the $4 trillion market capitalization, Nvidia not only left behind such tech giants as Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft, but also the vast majority of semiconductor companies. Intel, once an investors' darling, is now valued at $101.26 billion. Such a huge difference between the market capitalization of Nvidia and its industry peers underscores the unique position that Nvidia holds in today's high-tech ecosystem. The company supplies AI GPUs to virtually all of the AI leaders, including Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, OpenAI, and xAI, just to name a few. So far, only Microsoft Azure has warned that it would slow down the expansion of its data centers. Other companies are well on track to expand their AI clusters to hundreds of thousands or even millions of Nvidia GPUs in the coming years, so the sky is blue for Nvidia. Observers believe that investors' optimism about Nvidia stems from three factors. Firstly, they expect the AI sector to continue growing in the coming years, which will ensure growing sales of AI hardware. Secondly, Nvidia is expected to sustain its leading position on the market as so far, no company has unveiled hardware that can match the performance and scalability of Nvidia's GPUs for AI training and inference.

A 17-inch laptop is pretty large when stacked up against other laptop screens, but monitors tend to be almost twice that size or in some cases, even larger. Monitors be ultra-wide, display up to 4K, and showcase a larger field of view. Plus, you can get more flexibility with your choices of keyboards and mice. Then when you consider accessories like headphones, microphones, webcams, drawing tablets, and more, it just isn't feasible to use them all with just a laptop. Laptops only have maybe one or two USB ports, and you're going to need much more than that. That's why a docking station is an absolute must for laptop users. You can create a robust work station for yourself at your desk with several displays, a separate keyboard and mouse, and spectacular speakers like you would do with a desktop PC, but without restricting yourself to only ever using your computer right there at your desk. Amazon has it for a pretty significant discount at the time of writing. Right now, it's down 58% to just $110, saving you a whole $150. Once plugged in, you can connect to more peripherals and accessories through its six other ports. The USB-C hub can help you avoid having a messy desk covered in tangled wires as all the connections can meet together in just one place. The docking station has a small, square design that takes up hardly any room at all. For a limited time, you can grab yourself this HP docking station for the reduced price of just $110 (-58%).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Headlining Samsung's summer Unpacked event is the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Having tried every single Z Fold since the original came out in 2019, I was not prepared to see such a year-over-year leap from the Z Fold 6 to the Z Fold 7. I spent maybe the first five minutes palming the Z Fold 7 with awe—Samsung really made its Z Fold as thin and light as a regular flagship bar phone. The son of a gun really did it! To make the Z Fold 7 even more like a bar phone when closed, Samsung increased the cover screen to 6.3 inches and widened it to a 21:9 aspect ratio, which consequently also widens the inner folding screen to 8 inches (diagonal) since it's double the external one. The result is a phone that's not so skinny when closed, which was a major criticism of Samsung's book-style foldables since the original, and is more suitable for regular-sized app content. It's great to not feel like you're gripping a TV remote anymore. The “armor” aluminum is stronger (though it's still very likely the phone will snap in half without much pressure) and the cover screen and rear glass back are both made with tougher Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 and Gorilla Glass Victus 2, respectively. The inner folding screen is thinner than it was on the Z Fold 6, but Samsung says it added a titanium plate to provide structural rigidity and made the glass surface itself 50% thicker. I'm all for it, but we'll have to wait for some real-world tests before we can be sure the Z Fold 7 doesn't suffer its own #bendgate. Making the screen does come with a downside: S Pen stylus support is gone. Samsung says its research showed few people bought and used the stylus with previous Z Folds. As part of making the Z Fold 7 more “Ultra”-like, the phone has Qualcomm's most powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chip and 12GB of RAM. A thinner phone usually comes with the tradeoff of a smaller battery, though the chipset's better efficiency can offset that. Where Samsung really stepped up is the triple-lens camera system. To achieve better image quality for both photos and video (now supports 10-bit HDR), Samsung says it tweaked the ProVisual Engine for better low-light performance and reduced noise during video. I'll be the judge of that when I get a Z Fold 7 review unit for testing; Samsung's demo area was well-lit and staged to make photos and videos look their very best. Samsung isn't rushing to jam too many AI features like other phone makers. To make better use of the bigger screen, Google's Gemini AI chatbot can be opened in several views, including as a panel in split view or as a pop-up window over content. The AI chatbot is also multimodal, meaning it can switch between understanding what it sees through the camera, what you say to it via voice, and what you type on the screen via a text prompt. Other AI niceties include drag-and-drop support for AI-generated content and an Audio Eraser tool that you can use to remove noise like wind or traffic from videos. Circle to Search, one of the most practical AI uses on a phone, can now show gaming tips when you're playing games. So the Z Fold 7 seems to have it all, right? The reality is that book-style foldables—at least ones from Samsung—are unlikely to get cheaper. Samsung has had six years to make the Z Fold more affordable, but it's only increased in price. If that's not a proposition you care for, then keep walking. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present. Follow along with the Gizmodo crew as we cover all the foldables and wearables Samsung announces at its summer Unpacked event. Google's AI chatbot could be the secret sauce to making smartwatches exciting again. Don't call the Glyph Matrix a gimmick, okay? Apple's folding iPhone isn't even real yet, but it already has a very thin bar to meet. The off-kilter camera design has a lot of people bothered.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the past few years, Samsung has released two foldable phones at its Unpacked event. Samsung has once again sought to make its phones thinner, though the new models are thinner than last year's iterations. The new Z Flip7 FE is priced at $899 to attract people looking for a new form factor under the $1,000 price mark. Samsung's new foldable flagship, Z Fold7 is a bit lighter than its predecessor, with the measuring scale topping out at 218 grams (compared to the Fold6's 239 grams). The phone is powered by Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. Samsung claims that it has made the phone more durable by putting in a restructured hinge and hinge housing. Its display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2. The company is now using a 200-megapixel main camera with a f/1.7 aperture, compared to the 50-megapixel camera on last year's model. Samsung has added some AI powers to its photo editing software. You now get a Photo Assist function, which moves, erases or enlarges objects, and adjusts angles automatically. Like its bigger sibling, the Z Flip7 is also thinner this year, and comes with a larger cover screen — a 4.1-inch super AMOLED display — as well as an enlarged main display (6.9 inches). Samsung is adding DeX support to the Flip series for the first time, so you can plug the phone into a monitor and use a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse to get a workstation-like experience. The new phones also come with a new feature, called Now Bar, on the cover screen, that looks similar to iOS' Live Activities. Another feature called Now Brief presents a summary of traffic, reminders, events, and fitness insights. You'll also get music and video recommendations based on your existing subscriptions. All the new Z Flip and Z Fold phones will get support for Gemini Live's camera and video AI features, which enable users to take pictures or videos to ask the AI bot questions. The new Samsung devices will also get an upgraded version of Google's Gemini assistant, which now has an AI mode for Q&A-style conversations. The Galaxy Z Flip7 and the Galaxy Z Fold7 go on pre-order today, and will be generally available on July 25.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google announced on Wednesday that it's rolling out Gemini to Wear OS watches, nearly two months after teasing the move back in May. The tech giant is also adding new Circle to Search capabilities by integrating its AI Mode search experience directly into the feature and adding support for gaming-related queries. Gemini is rolling out to watches from Pixel, Samsung, OPPO, OnePlus, and Xiaomi that are running Wear OS 4+ over the coming weeks, the company says. Users will be able to ask Gemini questions like, “For how long should I roast sliced vegetables, and at what temperature?” when busy cooking with messy hands. Or, a user could ask, “Do I need an umbrella today?” when heading out the door. Additionally, users can utilize Gemini to complete tasks across multiple apps. Google notes that users can ask Gemini to remember important details such as “Remember I parked on level 4, spot 27” or “Remind me to go grocery shopping after work.” Launched last year, Circle to Search allows users to initiate a Google search by circling, highlighting, scribbling, or tapping on something they see on their screen. Now, users will be able to use AI Mode's advanced reasoning to dig into complex topics and ask follow-up questions, all without switching apps. From there, users can scroll to the bottom and tap “dive deeper with AI Mode” to ask follow-up questions and explore more about the visual search. The company is also making it easier to use AI Mode in Google Lens, as it's now available through the Google app on both Android and iOS. In addition, Google says users can now use Circle to Search when gaming on mobile. Google also announced that it's making AI Overviews more helpful, as responses are now better formatted and easier to read. The tech giant notes that AI Overviews now break down key information and include more visuals. Prior to joining the publication in 2021, she was a telecom reporter at MobileSyrup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As generative AI reshapes industries, one of its most important yet invisible challenges is retrieval, the process of fetching the right data with relevant context from messy knowledge bases. The San Francisco-based startup, co-founded by CEO Ghita Houir Alami and CTO Nicolas Pipitone, has raised $4.2 million in seed funding to help models retrieve relevant data quickly, accurately, and at scale. The round was led by Initialized Capital, with participation from Y Combinator, Transpose Platform, 22 Ventures, a16z Scout, and a long list of angels, including operators from OpenAI, Hugging Face, and Front. ZeroEntropy joins a growing wave of infrastructure companies hoping to use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to power search for the next generation of AI agents. Competitors range from MongoDB's VoyageAI to early fellow YC startups like Sid.ai. “We've met a lot of teams building in and around RAG, but Ghita and Nicolas's models outperform everything we've seen,” says Zoe Perret, partner at Initialized Capital. Yet the ZeroEntropy founders believe that for many AI apps, this layer is fragile: a cobbled collection of vector databases, keyword search, and re-ranking models. ZeroEntropy offers an API that manages ingestion, indexing, re-ranking, and evaluation. “Right now, most teams are either stitching together existing tools from the market or dumping their entire knowledge base into an LLM's context window. The first approach is time-consuming to build and maintain,” Houir Alami said. At its core is its proprietary re-ranker called ze-rank-1, which the company claims currently outperforms similar models from Cohere and Salesforce on both public and private retrieval benchmarks. More than 10 early-stage companies building AI agents across verticals such as healthcare, law, customer support, and sales are already using ZeroEntropy, she adds. Born and raised in Morocco, Houir Alami left home at 17 to pursue engineering education in France, attending École Polytechnique, a prestigious military and mathematics-focused institution. She moved to California two years ago to complete a master's in mathematics at UC Berkeley, where she deepened her interest in building intelligent systems. Before founding ZeroEntropy, Houir Alami dabbled in building an AI assistant—her take on a conversational agent—before ChatGPT became mainstream. Yet, she hopes it doesn't stay that way for long. “There aren't many women in DevTools or AI infra,” she said. “But I'd tell any young woman interested in technical problems: don't let that stop you.

Artificial intelligence and the hardware that powers it, is at the heart of a fallout in Pennsylvania, where electricity prices have risen dramatically for wholesalers and consumers due to surging demand. Following the launch of ChatGPT in 2023 and the explosion of competitor tools and chatbots in the months that followed, the regional transmission organization, PJM, saw a surge in demand for power as major tech companies scoured the country looking for spare grid capacity to run AI and build new data centers to support them. AI can demand a lot of power, so much so that Elon Musk is shipping an entire power plant to the US. This couldn't have come at a worse time, as in 2022, PJM had paused new power plant connections after it faced a huge influx of applications for new renewable projects, which required more engineering oversight before they could be connected to the grid. PJM's power management covers 13 states in total, including Virginia, which plays host to the so-called "Data Center Alley," a small region with the highest density of data centers in the world. It's the huge demand from that region and elsewhere in its coverage that PJM blames on its inability to supply power at affordable rates. Last year's annual capacity auction for energy capacity saw prices increase by over 800%, and with an impending auction for this year, those prices are expected to rise again. It's lead to a projected 20% rise in consumer energy prices across Pennsylvania and other PJM-covered territories this summer. “We need speed from PJM, we need transparency from PJM and we need to keep consumer costs down with PJM,” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro told Reuters. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. PJM's response to the crisis has been to cap energy prices at $325 per megawatt-day, and it has fast-tracked connections of more than 50 power projects that should help augment its existing capacity, but many of those won't come online until the early 2030s. Despite these aims, PJM estimates that the demand issue may only worsen. In the near term, with concerns about blackouts, the Trump administration has also ordered two oil and gas plants that were planned to close in May, to remain open through the summer.

NVMe SSDs are the norm these days, but it's rare to find one that balances price, performance, and long-term value like this. Normally hovering around $176, it's now available for just $113.99 during Amazon's Prime Day sale—a massive drop on a 2TB drive that can stand its ground against top-end models. That's shaving off around 36% from its list price, making this the lowest price we've tracked for this model since its release last year. Get a 2TB EVO Plus for the lowest-ever price of $113, with PCIe Gen 5 technology, HMB, and Turbowrite 2.0. We've already reviewed the 990 EVO Plus 2TB and found it to be excellent for mixed workloads. We found Samsung's claim of read and write speeds to be pretty much spot on. And since it's built on Samsung's latest V-NAND and controller tech, you're also getting lower idle power draw, making it perfect for laptops or compact builds. The 990 EVO is also one of the first consumer SSDs to support both PCIe Gen 4x4 and Gen 5 with 2 lanes, meaning it's made for today with tomorrow in mind. Furthermore, the Samsung Magician software adds another layer of polish, offering real-time health monitoring, firmware updates, and performance tuning. There's honestly not much to complain about here; write speeds under sustained load may dip if you're hammering it with giant 8K video files, but unless you're a professional editor doing daily raw exports, that won't matter. Oh, and did we mention that its controller is coated with nickel to keep thermals under control? If you want a lot of storage, speedy read/write throughput, and future PCIe 5 readiness without the pro price tag, Samsung's 970 EVO Plus is a clear standout. Content creators moving around large files, or gamers installing dozens of large titles, will feel the benefit of the 2TB size, while enjoying powerful performance at a not-so-powerful price. We recommend this drive for both console and PC users looking to bump up their systems with a meaningful upgrade.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite announcing a $50 million pledged to fund RUTFs earlier this summer, the Trump administration's deep cuts to foreign assistance have wreaked havoc on RUTF distribution globally, and the State Department hasn't placed orders with leading suppliers this year. Experts say the disruptions will result in more children dying from hunger. Considered one of the greatest innovations in preventing deaths from hunger since they were invented in the 1990s, RUTFs increase success rates treating childhood malnutrition from 25 percent to over 90 percent, according to Action Against Hunger. On July 1, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) officially closed, leaving the State Department to administer some of its initiatives while wholly killing countless others. Throughout the radical dismantling of assistance programs, though, leaders like secretary of state Marco Rubio have insisted that certain lifesaving efforts would not be abandoned. Despite those assertions, critical programs have already been jettisoned, and some experts say the fatality toll from the cuts will be up to 14 million preventable deaths. While the Trump administration has reinstated its RUTF contracts from 2024 after initially cutting them in March, US-based providers like MANA Nutrition and Edesia are still waiting for new orders from the US government. MANA's warehouses are still overflowing with product, up to three times the average amount of back stock the company keeps in case of acute emergencies. “It's been sold to the US government,” says MANA cofounder David Todd Harmon. Rhode Island–based Edesia has been filling 2024 orders for its RUTF product, Plumpy'Nut, at a slowed-down pace. “For six months, we haven't been shipping anything. That means there are millions of children who are not getting what they need, and we can't catch up fast enough to reach them,” Salem says. Edesia had to lay off 10 percent of its staff in March as USAID was dismantled; Salem says that it took “many, many, many weeks” for the company to receive partial payment owed by the US government, and that it is still owed money for 2024 orders. “I believe Marco Rubio when he said, ‘We want to continue these programs,'” Salem says. “Still, we have not had an order in the fiscal year.” “The Administration is working with Edesia and other partners to broaden its partnership network, potentially adding more US-based companies, while also improving shipping efficiency and cost-effective procurement.” Salem noted that the State Department has not communicated any of this with Edesia, and called its statement to WIRED “not accurate, as of today.” She says she remains “extremely hopeful” about the situation. “People might have expected that other countries would step up and fill in the gap. We've seen the opposite,” says Action Against Hunger associate director Heather Stobaugh. Some private donors are helping; MANA, for example, has received $250 million in donations from a philanthropist over the past several years, which allowed it to move forward with plans to expand its warehouse space even amid the turmoil. Since most travel by foot, some simply cannot make the journey. “Now mothers have to travel a long distance with their children,” he says. When these families do reach their destinations, the RUTF supply is dwindling; after traveling all that way, they are no longer guaranteed access to the prescription foods needed to stave off death and further illness. “I grew up as a child who needed nutritional support,” he says, noting that assistance from the United States has been viewed as a major force for good in the region. People are still hoping they'll wake up and the orders will be reversed.” Stobaugh says that the broader funding cuts have made this crisis even more acute. They're not strong enough to fight off common childhood illnesses,” she says.

In the northern hemisphere, it's hard to not spend the winter in a state of slumbering sloth, just waiting for sunshine and good times to start again. Conveniently, Prime Day fitness tracker deals (all four days of them) drop right in the middle of summer, which makes this a great time to pick up the smartwatch or smart ring that you just didn't have the cash for at Christmas. This year, you have four whole days to shop the Amazon deals, but if you don't want to take that much time, I've highlighted the sales on some of our favorite fitness trackers and smart rings. Perhaps our list of the best Amazon Prime Perks can convince you to sign up. As you might expect with my job, I am frequently asked what fitness tracker to get, and this year, more often than not, I have told people to just buy an Oura Ring 4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) . You don't have to wear it on your wrist, the battery life is longer than most trackers, and Oura issues interesting, meaningful software updates regularly. The updated app looks great, and multiple Google integrations make the Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) easier to use than ever. It still doesn't have blood oxygen sensing due to a patent dispute, but it's otherwise a solid fitness tracker. The watch uses an accelerometer and machine learning to check if you have breathing disturbances at night. The Series 10 is also thinner, lighter, easier to wear, and charges faster than previous models. I have personally convinced many parents in my life to buy the Fitbit Ace LTE (7/10, WIRED Recommends) for their kids. It's a Fitbit, so it works even if one parent is Android and the other is Apple (if so, why? Fitbit Arcade incentivizes my kids to keep their watches on and charged, and I like Google's included kids' safety features. Garmin is known for its Forerunner series of running watches. It may be cheap, but the Amazfit Active 2 (6/10, WIRED Reviewed) is no slouch on the sensor front with a photo plethysmography (PPG) sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, barometric altimeter, ambient light, and temperature sensor to track your sleep, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation. It also boasts tons of workout modes, long battery life, and 5 ATM water resistance. While it's not the most exciting Apple watch, the SE series is a cheapest way to try out an Apple fitness tracker. The SE uses watchOS 11, which can connect to the Vitals app, which makes it easy to check your heart rate and respiration in a dashboard without hunting through the Health or Fitness apps. It has the last S8 chip, which is what the Series 8 has, and features like Crash Detection to call your emergency contact and emergency responders if you've been in a car accident. The Ultrahuman Ring Air (7/10, WIRED Recommends), though, comes with an included “lifetime subscription,” meaning you'll have full access to your data and analytics when you pick one of these up. It's the first time the price has dropped this low too, so if ever there was a time, it's now. Most Garmin watches aren't likely to win any beauty prizes—they're chunky, with an emphasis on the technical over aesthetic. It's Garmin that looks more like, well, a nice watch. You can even get it with a leather band.
