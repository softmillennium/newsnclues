                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. In June 2023, I wrote a critical op-ed (“Dear David Zaslav: Gutting TCM Will Not Help You Win Filmmakers Back to Warner Bros.”) right after the Warner Bros. Discovery CEO presided over layoffs amounting to 80 percent of the staff. So it might come as some surprise that I'm now feeling bullish about the news that Zaslav and Warner Bros. co-heads Mike DeLuca and Pam Abdy will retain creative control over TCM as Warner Bros. One will be the Studios and Streaming group, a business that oversees film and TV production, with Zaslav retained as CEO. This group carries most of WBD's $38 billion in debt. CNN, TNT, and the entire portfolio of networks owned by WBD will go here. TCM will serve as a kind of bridge between the two new companies, with distribution and operations handled by Global Networks, while creative direction will be steered by DeLuca and Abdy at Studios and Streaming, as they are doing now. It's the only network to have such an arrangement. Not only does that make sense, it's good news. Further, a source at WBD confirms to IndieWire that TCM will continue to have its operations based in Atlanta and that “things at TCM are basically staying exactly as they are today.” The TCM layoffs were regrettable but not unusual: Many media companies are finding them necessary to survive. Some months later, longtime VP of enterprises and strategic partnerships Genevieve McGillicuddy returned to oversee the TCM Classic Film Festival, an event which she started and grew into one of Hollywood's most beloved annual gatherings. Zaslav listened, probably with help from DeLuca and Abdy. Today, TCM is an essential platform for today's leading filmmakers to share, on camera, their favorite films from the network's lineup. Beyond Spielberg, Scorsese, and Anderson, there was Guillermo del Toro (who waxed rhapsodic about Alfred Hitchcock's “Suspicion” and John Ford's “The Quiet Man”), Francis Ford Coppola (talking about “The Magnificent Ambersons”), and Ron Howard (sharing how much his small-screen father Andy Griffith's heel turn in “A Face in the Crowd” means to him). These have been vital ways to connect the dots between cinema past and present. Most TCM initiatives continue under Zaslav's leadership: The wine program, the publishing line (of which this writer was once an author), the cheeky intros by hosts Ben Mankiewicz, Alicia Malone, Dave Karger, Jacqueline Stewart, and noir czar Eddie Muller. Now there's also an expanded presence for TCM on the once-again-renamed HBO Max. Earlier this year, New York City hosted a day-long pop-up version of the TCM Classic Film Festival. Being short-staffed undoubtedly resulted in a few instances of the network airing different titles than were listed, most notably the 1932 Kay Francis vehicle “Jewel Robbery” when the Barbara Stanwyck Western “40 Guns” was supposed to air instead. Just two weekends ago, I found myself so compelled by their lineup that I watched an entire evening of TCM: “Double Indemnity” and “Chinatown” introduced by Mankiewicz in conversation with Nathan Lane at New York City's United Palace theater, followed by “Sorry, Wrong Number” and Eddie Muller giving a rich, appreciative take that pinpointed that film's unique Lynchian mood. Discovery needed to telegraph that its leadership was invested in filmmaking and filmmakers. Bringing in filmmakers to be part of TCM was a savvy move. The funny thing is, by all accounts, Zaslav is also genuinely sentimental about the network and said to even have it on at his office quite often.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a petition to compel arbitration submitted to Los Angeles County Superior Court on Wednesday (July 9) and obtained by Billboard, the Jackson estate identifies Frank Cascio as the man behind an alleged $213 million extortion attempt reported last fall. Articles at the time said the estate had brought an arbitration demand against an accuser, at that point anonymous, who was trying to secure a financial windfall despite inking a binding settlement years earlier. Diddy Juror Denies That Celebrity Status Influenced Verdict: 'We Would Have Treated Any Defendant… Filling in some gaps in that account, Wednesday's petition says Cascio launched a “shakedown” of the Jackson estate when the HBO docuseries Leaving Neverland amplified years of child sexual abuse claims against the deceased pop superstar in 2019. According to the estate, Cascio and his associates “decided it was their turn to profit from making specious accusations against their dear friend” despite having been staunch defenders of Jackson for more than 30 years. Cascio also disclaimed the swirling abuse claims in My Friend Michael. As the petition puts it, Jackson's estate “reluctantly” agreed to pay Cascio a settlement in 2020 — which previous reporting has tallied at $3.3 million — without admitting any wrongdoing and in exchange for a promise that any future disputes would be decided in confidential arbitration. But Cascio allegedly violated that agreement last year by threatening to file a public lawsuit unless he and his associates were paid $213 million more. Those alleged threats led the Jackson estate to bring a private arbitration demand for extortion, which remains pending before the mediation firm Signature Resolution. Now, the estate says Cascio's newly retained celebrity attorney, Mark Geragos, is once again threatening to bring a public lawsuit unless they satisfy a fresh demand of $44 million. Geragos did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday. Jackson, who died suddenly in 2009, was never convicted or held legally liable on any accusation of child molestation. But he's still dogged by such allegations: Two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, are continuing to pursue civil lawsuits alleging Jackson sexually abused them as children, and they laid out the accusations in disturbing detail in Leaving Neverland. The estate has generated more than $3 billion since Jackson's death, and it maintains that his accusers are simply seeking to profit off an artist who cannot defend himself because defamation law does not extend to dead individuals. That case has since settled confidentially, and Leaving Neverland is no longer available on HBO's streaming platforms. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

Sydney Sweeney was “shocked” by the creative turn for “Euphoria” Season 3. All we know so far is that Season 3 will have a time jump, with the core cast including Zendaya, Jacob Elordi, and Alexa Demie now being out of high school. “Goodness,” Sweeney said when asked what viewers can expect from Cassie. “I can say that it's going to be a wild ride. I was definitely very shocked by the turns of Cassie's life. HBO drama chief Francesca Orsi previously said the third season was expected to air in 2025. Filming is set to take place across an expected nine months. Showrunner Sam Levinson shared with Elle that the third season will be “film noir”-style centered on Zendaya's Rue as she “explores what it means to be an individual with principles in a corrupt world.” The show's time jump will set Season 3 approximately five years after the events of Season 2, taking the characters out of high school. Zendaya is also slated to direct an episode in Season 3. It feels like I'm with my OG family,” Sweeney said. Sweeney previously said in 2024 that she was grateful for the long pause between Seasons 2 and 3. “I actually like it because there's so much room for growth for both me as a person and also Cassie as a character,” Sweeney said. Sweeney's co-star Zendaya agreed, saying, “It will be fascinating to see and understand these characters outside of the context of high school and how all the stuff that we saw when they were kids and they were in high school affects the adulthood they have and who they become in a much bigger world. It's important because there's only so much high school drama you can deal with.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ahead of the album's release, High Moon Records has shared a new track from the record, a cover of Otis Redding's “I Can't Turn You Loose.” You can check it out below. Per the album liner notes, “I Can't Turn You Loose” was first recorded in 1967 and stayed on the group's setlist “as late as the end of 1968,” later “turned sideways to become ‘Turn Me Loose' on A Whole New Thing.” Sly & The Family Stone drummer Greg Errico commented of the demo recording, “I think it was one of the early ones in development, and you're trying different things out. When they signed to Epic Records later in '67, Romanello put the tapes into storage, where they would remain for 35 years. The tapes were rediscovered by Sly & The Family Stone archivists Edwin and Arno Konings and restored by Grammy-nominated producer Alec Palao.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As EntertainmentNow previously reported, many fans were incredibly forgiving as Clarkson apologized for cancelling her first “Studio Sessions” show at The Colosseum at Caesar's Palace on July 4. Others expressed frustration over losing money on airfare and hotel, but show organizers said concert tickets would be refunded for those who can't attend at a later date. “We have been working 24/7 to make Studio Sessions the most intimate and extraordinary experience with and for my incredible fans,” Clarkson wrote in a social media post that night. “I am beyond grateful that you always show up for me and I am devastated to have to postpone tonight and tomorrow's opening at Caesars.” An insider told Page Six on July 8 that Clarkson “cannot risk damaging her cords further – she's on thin ice,” explaining, “She belts out every single note. “Kelly is fighting some serious hidden battles that very few people are privy to,” the insider shared, adding, “it's a source of emotional and therefore physical distress for her.” As of July 8, Clarkson was still expected to move forward with her scheduled Las Vegas concerts the following weekend, but had not posted since her apology and cancellation notice four days prior. Clarkson, who hosts NBC's popular daytime talk show “The Kelly Clarkson Show,” missed nearly two weeks of tapings in March, citing a “personal matter,” and had several celebrity guest hosts fill in for her. In early 2024, as she was celebrating the release of her album “Chemistry,” she told People that being able to channel the pain and growth she experienced during her divorce into her music felt like a form of therapy. “That sounds very therapy, but that's because I love therapy, and I think it's important to have those tools to navigate your life and relationships.”</p>

Before joining X, Yaccarino had spent several decades working in advertising and marketing, most notably serving as chairwoman of global advertising and partnerships at NBCUniversal from 2011 to 2023. She left that post to join X, brought in to oversee the arguably impossible task of injecting some kind of stability into the social media platform, and stem the exodus of major advertisers, after Musk purchased it in 2022. Stability, however, was hard to come by as old Twitter guardrails were cast aside and X quickly flooded with bots, misinformation, and offensive posts (some from Musk himself). It is, in its way, a fitting cap to Yaccarino's tenure that she announced her resignation the day after Grok — the chatbot developed by Musk's AI start-up xAI, which purchased X in March — suddenly began spewing hate speech about Jewish people and publicly identified itself as “MechaHitler.” “Now, the best is yet to come as X enters a new chapter with @xai,” Yaccarino wrote in her resignation post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two years after Jasmine Roth's daughter Hazel underwent surgery to address pediatric sleep apnea, she says her five-year-old is doing “amazing.” Now the HGTV star wants to raise awareness about the condition in hopes of helping other parents realize the importance of early detection and intervention. Roth, who's raising Hazel and 10-month-old daughter Darla with her husband Brett, shared an update on her oldest daughter's health with MediaPlanet's Future of Personal Health in early July 2025, noting that Hazel struggled with sleeping from the time she was six months old. “I didn't even know kids could have sleep apnea, so it wasn't on my radar at all,” she told the outlet, adding, “We had sleep consultants try to help us, but we never figured it out. According to Mayo Clinic, sleep apnea in children is different than in adults, who typically develop it due to obesity and experience daytime sleepiness as a result. Roth told Future of Personal Health that the ENT they saw said Hazel's “adenoids and tonsils were swollen” and that she would likely need surgery due to sleep apnea. “That was the first time we heard kids could have sleep apnea,” Roth recalled. “It sounded like a really big deal to us, so we actually opted to do a sleep study first before the surgery. Hazel underwent tonsil and adenoid reduction surgery at Children's Hospital of Orange County in California in November 2023, and though Roth shared on social media that it was nerve-wracking for the family to go through at the time, she told Future of Personal Health that Hazel's “recovery was quick, and it's been a game-changer for her.” She has no issues — just goes to sleep, sleeps through the night, and wakes up in the morning, which anybody with a child knows is a big deal.” Roth wishes more parents knew about pediatric sleep apnea, having gone without answers — and lots of sleepless nights — for over two years. Roth advised parents, “Don't assume it's normal if your child is a year old and they're not sleeping through the night. Don't ignore it and just say, ‘Oh, they're a bad sleeper.' “Developmentally, our children need sleep to grow and change,” she continued. Roth has been busy filming a fifth season of “Help! A season premiere date has not been announced yet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: After turning Night at the Museum into one of the most successful family film franchises of the 21st century, 21 Laps has begun development on a reimagining for 20th Century Studios, enlisting Tripper Clancy to write the script, sources tell Deadline. Shawn Levy and Dan Levine will produce for 21 Laps, with Emily Morris overseeing the project for the company. A frequent collaborator of 21 Laps, Clancy has also worked with the company and Netflix as co-EP of the series I Am Not Okay With This, as well as in developing Bolivar, a hybrid TV series based on the beloved children's book with Kumail Nanjiani and Emily Gordon. Originating back when 20th Century Studios was 20th Century Fox, the Night at the Museum franchise adapts the 1993 children's book by Milan Trenc, where a night watchman at a natural history museum sees his job descend into chaos when exhibits come to life after dark. Supporting cast over the course of the trilogy included Robin Williams, Owen Wilson, Steve Coogan, Amy Adams, Hank Azaria, Dan Stevens, and Rebel Wilson. Following Disney's acquisition of Fox in 2019, the studio moved to further expand the franchise with Night at the Museum: Kahmunrah Rises Again, an animated feature produced by Levy for Disney+, which premiered in 2022. A WGA Award winner, Clancy is best known for writing each installment in the Die Hart franchise, starring Kevin Hart, for Roku and Amazon. To date, he's also co-created a Varsity Blues reboot for Quibi, developed the novel The Art of Fielding with Mike Tollin as a miniseries for Netflix, written for Pixar, and penned the buddy action comedy Stuber on spec, selling it to Fox with Goldstein & Daley producing as well as Kumail Nanjiani and Dave Bautista starring. He is represented by Verve, Kaplan/Perrone, and Gregg Gellman at Morris Yorn. Coming off a record-breaking 2024 with Deadpool & Wolverine, which became the highest-grossing R-rated movie in history with a worldwide gross exceeding $1.3 billion, 21 Laps' upcoming slate includes the fifth and final season of Netflix's Stranger Things, which premieres later this year. Most recently, the company has announced feature adaptations of Grady Hendrix's short story “The Blanks” and Freida McFadden's psychological thriller Never Lie for Netflix, as well as a Madonna limited series for the same streamer, where 21 Laps has a long-term deal. They named Robert Atwood Head of Television in April. As a director, Levy's next project is Star Wars: Starfighter, starring Ryan Gosling, which he's also producing. Pic goes into production this fall and will be released theatrically on May 28, 2027. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Come And See‘s reputation now precedes itself, in particular with young, more online cinephiles, that notoriety wasn't created overnight. In tomes like Birgit Beumers' A History Of Russian Cinema or Peter Rollberg's exhaustive The Historical Dictionary Of Russian And Soviet Cinema, Come And See appears as a blip, rarely occupying more than a paragraph. Even though it was well-received, the 1985 film does not warrant special note; it's seen mostly as a stepping stone towards filmmaker Elem Klimov's role as a bureaucrat. This is in part because it was not as much of a departure from the rest of the Soviet industry as a modern audience might think. Yet, because of its formal stringency, Come And See has come to be seen (in the last decade especially; it currently sits at number three on Letterboxd's Top 250 narrative features of all time) as totemic, one of the world's best war movies—if not the best ever. Club‘s Scott Tobias noted that the film acts as something of a “Russian cousin” to Apocalypse Now—a kind of ultimate anti-war statement by the Soviets in the way that Apocalypse Now was for Americans. Perhaps unwittingly, the equivalence also highlights the more problematic perspectives of each, which quietly saddle both works with contextual baggage. The SS soldiers are debauched, cackling, drunken murderers, laughing and jumping with joy as they fire machine guns into a barn church that they've set ablaze with an entire village's population inside. This is not the cold, mechanical genocide often portrayed in media about the Nazis, but one that terrifyingly takes joy in its own libidanal cruelty. Witnessing this massacre robs Flyora of any last semblance of being a child, his face permanently molded by the apocalyptic horrors. Come And See is intended to have a similar effect on viewers, leaving them forever changed by what they've seen. A quick search on YouTube reveals innumerable videos—from accounts with names like Cinema Rules, James VS Cinema, and My Egyptian Dad Reacts—of people filming themselves watching Come And See for clicks. Counterintuitively, it also helped that Janus was in the midst of Come And See‘s theatrical re-release when COVID struck, allowing the film (now more available than ever) to take on new life as something experienced by way of other people's reactions. If Come And See is now a poster child for “shock” films, then it should be noted that everything that falls into that loose category, one often defined more by reputation than intention, all have overt political inclinations. From the Mondo movies that initially defined this “genre,” to Pier Paolo Pasolini's anti-fascist masterpiece Salò, Or The 120 Days Of Sodom, to the similarly De Sadian A Serbian Film (which also became a focal point for reaction content on the earlier days of YouTube, working as a primer for Come And See‘s current position), films which intend to shock contain attacks on sensibilities. Come And See‘s shock is historic: The film is inspired by Belarusian writer Ales Adamovich's own experience as a teenage partisan in WWII, along with his own archival research towards understanding the genocide committed on his homeland through the Nazi Lebensraum, which sought to permanently displace and ethnically cleanse non-Aryans from Eastern Europe. Red letters appear: “628 Byelorussian villages were burnt to the ground, along with all their inhabitants.” The horrors we have seen are but a glimpse of their full scale. This historical fact, however, has also been co-opted for more sinister purposes. The myth of Dresden's death toll being over 100,000 (instead of 25,000—the higher number often used to make equivalences to those killed in Hiroshima) is perpetuated in the American consciousness by Kurt Vonnegut with his novel Slaughterhouse-Five, in which he claims that 135,000 people were killed in the firebombings, a number he drew from the Holocaust denier David Irving. While the numbers in Come And See are accurate, they can similarly be used to limit perspective on the war to a dangerous degree. In Russian historiography, the country is always perceived as under threat of total destruction by outside invaders. This is in part because of geography, with how the vast majority of the country's population lives on the relatively flat (and easy to invade) western plains, but it also does have precedents in history that have been restaged for mass entertainment: Teutonic invaders destroy medieval Russian towns in Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky much the same as Nazis do in Come And See. On one end was the internationalist camp, which sought to continue its vanguard revolution and foment similar socialist uprisings across the world. This also coincided with threats first from capitalist, then fascist nations, which cemented a militarist mentality in the country, which has retroactively come to be known as “siege socialism.” Come And See, while foregoing portraying valor in combat, still fits into this ideology. We have moved through time, and the soldiers are still running through the forest, seemingly endlessly—the war, it would seem, is never over. This is how the Soviet state as a militarist entity saw itself, albeit with the ultimate goal of spreading communism. After the collapse, that socialist militarism turned into an ultra-nationalist one, leading to Balkanized conflict after Balkanized conflict, with the children of former comrades killing each other in trenches all across eastern Ukraine. But, unlike how scenes from Apocalypse Now have been co-opted to make points counter to what the film is trying to say (think the young Marine recruits in Jarhead cheering to the “Ride Of The Valkyries” sequence), Come And See is instead a film masquerading as purely anti-war through its formal conceits, which distract modern audiences from its militarist context. That is to say, despite its recent perception and popularity, Come And See should not be viewed as the be-all-end-all of war films, but as a single, specific, and culturally contextual perspective on World War II. Its visceral experiment in conveying the horrors of war is successful, but maybe too successful given how that has led to the film being reduced to something upsetting that content creators can react to. In 2025, 40 years since its release, its images have stark resonances, the blighted environment and mass death perpetrated by the Nazis calling to mind contemporary images of Gaza. Is anything closer in the present to the image of villagers being herded to their deaths in Come And See than the IDF and American contractors using an aid distribution site as a killing field for Palestinian civilians? Yet now, perhaps more than at any point in the film's history, it is important to also recognize the patriotic leanings of Come And See, given how the far-right has taken a strong global foothold. Understanding that Come And See is able to be both things at once—simultaneously a film so horrifying in its portrayal of war that it becomes a viral sensation and one whose ultimate point is the necessity of its home country's militarism—lays bare the contradictory ideologies that have created some of the worst mass violence of the present day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Veteran Broadway actor Emily Skinner will join Bridgerton star Luke Newton in the upcoming Off Broadway production House of McQueen, a new play about the late, famed fashion designer Lee Alexander McQueen. As Deadline reported exclusively yesterday, Darrah Cloud's House of McQueen will begin previews August 19 at the new Off Broadway Manhattan venue The Mansion at Hudson Yards, with an official opening set for September 9. Skinner is one of Broadway's most prominent musical stars (House of McQueen is a play, not a musical) having made her debut in 1997 in Jekyll & Hyde. Subsequent Broadway credits include Side Show, James Joyce's The Dead, The Full Monty, Dinner at Eight, Billy Elliot, Prince of Broadway, The Cher Show, New York, New York and, most recently, last year's Suffs. Directed by Sam Helfrich, House of McQueen, according to the synopsis, “will take guests through Lee's layered individual experience, from his early days as an emerging designer, to later building one of the most important fashion houses in the world, and ultimately his tragic passing in 2010. Within the performance, intimate relationships with key ﬁgures in his life ranging from mentor Isabella Blow to blood relatives will be explored surrounded by a highly produced landscape complete with ﬂoor-to-ceiling LED panels designed to shift environments on stage.” House of McQueen will be produced by Rick Lazes, with Gary James McQueen, nephew of the late designer, serving as creative director.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For years now, virtually every national tragedy — natural or manmade — is accompanied by a barrage of right-wing conspiracy theories. The flash floods that killed over 100 people, including at least 27 campers and counselors at a summer camp for young girls, have become fodder for online conspiracies and harassment that are being fomented by online trolls, right-wing influencers, and even Republican lawmakers. As she has in the wake of past natural disasters, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Fla.) suggested that the floods were the result of human-engineered weather modification — a baseless conspiracy that claims processes like cloud seeding can produce catastrophic weather events. Greene wrote on X that she would be introducing legislation “that prohibits the injection, release, or dispersion of chemicals or substances into the atmosphere for the express purpose of altering weather, temperature, climate, or sunlight intensity. Retired Gen. Michael Flynn — Trump's former national security adviser turned QAnon influencer — also promoted conspiracy theories suggesting that the floods were the result of cloud seeding. “We have to place a bigger spotlight on this,” Flynn wrote on X, “and anyone who calls this out as a conspiracy theory can go F themselves. Ask any Vietnam Vet who was sprayed with agent orange if the [U.S. Government] sprays stuff from above!” Republican congressional candidate Kandiss Taylor, wrote on X: “FAKE WEATHER. The online rush by right-wingers to attach conspiracies to practically every event of public note has created another grim reality for the families of victims, survivors, first responders and local officials: death threats. According to a Tuesday report from Wired, the cloud seeding company Rainmaker has been caught in a wave of threats, and one Oklahoma weather radar station was vandalized and damaged, allegedly by a right-wing vigilante group that had bought into the conspiracies.

In the modern political landscape, those who bravely venture into broken and battered American communities in the aftermath of a disaster cannot focus on their lifesaving work, but must instead expend energy fending off attacks and accusations from their own elected officials.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Under the partnership deal, founders Erin Kelly-Burkett and Michael John Burkett will step back from the label while forgiving $3.5 million in unrecouped balances for Fat Wreck artists. Thirty-five years ago, in their one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco, college student Erin Kelly-Burkett and punk frontman Michael John Burkett invited 10 friends to celebrate their new record company's first seven-inch single. “We had Burgie beer and sat around in this big pile with markers,” Kelly-Burkett recalls. “I ended up doing a lot of the mail-order by myself in our kitchen. I didn't expect to really make any money off it. On Wednesday (July 9), Kelly-Burkett and Burkett, the NOFX singer known as Fat Mike, will step back from Fat Wreck Chords, the label they founded in 1990 – a move made possible by a new partnership with fellow indie punk label Hopeless Records. In a unique arrangement, Hopeless will acquire Fat Wreck's catalog of master recordings, while Fat Wreck will leave its more than 100 artists debt-free by wiping out their unrecouped balances (according to Burkett, the total amount of unrecouped balances being forgiven totals $3.5 million). “Say Louis sold it, and he sold the Fat Wreck Chords logo, any label or any other person could put out other bands on the label. “We'll be working with them on a ton of different things. They'll be as involved as they want to be,” adds Louis Posen, who founded Hopeless – home of All Time Low, New Found Glory, Avenged Sevenfold and others – a year after directing a video for NOFX's “Bob” in 1992. Fat Wreck Chords, which began as a means for Fat Mike to put out NOFX's music, has, over the years, released albums by landmark punk bands such as Rise Against, Against Me! It's a punk-rock label where we've never got sued in 35 years,” Burkett says. “There were a couple of audits, but they didn't lead to anything. The former couple, who divorced in 2010 after 18 years of marriage, wanted to ease out of day-to-day label-management duties while finding a way to “give back to the bands and have them participate in this partnership deal,” Kelly-Burkett says. The Fat Wreck duo had conversations with a few other labels, she adds, but quickly chose Hopeless because Posen was “not wanting to change this 35-year legacy that we've built.” Overhead is more than $1 million annually, according to Burkett, including employees, insurance and warehouse space. “There is something to be said for volume,” says Burkett, whose band NOFX retired last October, “and we put out a lot of records over 35 years.” Kelly-Burkett adds: “Punk rockers love their vinyl, they love their collectibles, they love their one-of-a-kind. With today's announcement, the labels will release new albums by well-known Fat Wreck bands: Bad Cop/Bad Cop's Lighten Up; a NOFX rarities album, A to H; and Strung Out‘s Exile in Oblivion. “It was important we didn't announce, ‘Oh, there's a partnership and acquisition,'” Posen says. “We wanted to have new releases and show this is an active partnership.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The brazen AI-fueled con that fleeces lovestruck fans and has Hollywood finally fighting back. In November, Margaret climbed into her Toyota Camry, left her husband of 10 years at their comfortable brick home in the rural South and drove an hour to a hotel where — she was sure — Kevin Costner was coming to meet her. By this point, Margaret, 73, had spent months making weekly bitcoin deposits for Costner totaling about $100,000. He had messaged her that he was using the money to set up a new production company where she would eventually work for him. Margaret knew that some people would find it odd that an Oscar winner and the star of Yellowstone would need financing help from a retired office manager whom he'd met on Facebook, but Margaret wasn't exactly a nobody. In one photo he sent, the actor leaned against the wooden headboard of a bed in a white T-shirt, holding a piece of paper that read, “it's really me Kevin Costner I love you so much MARGARET i can't wait to meet you MARGARET.” 'And Just Like That' Team Offers Up Explanation as to Why Character Was Seemingly Killed Off Twice 'Superman' First Reactions: "A Terrific Start for the New DC Studios" There was some discussion of flying Margaret out to L.A. before they settled on a hotel in her home state as their meeting place. By the time she got in her car, Margaret had already had her suitcases packed for weeks, ready for the moment when she and Costner would finally be together. “Her thing is, ‘I just want somebody to love me,' ” says Margaret's sister, Carol, in one of many phone conversations we would have over a period of several weeks this spring and summer as her worries about Margaret grew. (Both women's names have been changed to protect their privacy). As she stared at the photo, all the warning signs that Margaret had been willfully avoiding over all these months of buildup and bitcoin payments began to creep into view. Online scams take many forms, but the ones weaponizing celebrity fandom are getting intense notice in Hollywood right now. With scammers aided by such rapidly evolving tools as AI, cryptocurrencies and messaging apps that make it easy to disseminate fakes and operate undetected, stars and talent agencies find themselves in an escalating game of Whac-A-Mole, hiring companies to scan the web for fakes and getting those accounts shut down. Some 400 performers, including Scarlett Johansson, Common and SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher, have signed on to support legislation making its way through Congress called the No Fakes Act, which seeks to create protections for artists' voices, likenesses and images from unauthorized AI-generated deep fakes. “Celebrities just have so many images out there,” says Nick Berta, a supervisory special agent in the FBI's economic crimes unit. “The ease with which scammers can use their tools to manipulate voice and audio and video, it's very difficult for [public figures] to protect themselves.” The scammers prey upon the goodwill and implicit trust their victims have for their favorite artists, with grifters increasingly using celebrity likenesses not only for romance scams like the one that targeted Margaret but also for fake investment opportunities, false product endorsements and bogus political messaging. “The enemy behind this is super-skilled,” says Erin West, a former prosecutor from Santa Clara, California, who specializes in high-tech crimes. “The psychological hold they have over people is like nothing I've ever seen. Those figures don't even include people like Margaret, who will never tell law enforcement what happened to them out of shame, fear of their scammers or the tiny lingering hope that, just maybe, they'd had a real relationship with a movie star. To better understand how celebrity scam victims like Margaret are ensnared, I decided to make myself look like an ideal target, creating a fake social media profile of a woman I named Linda. I used AI to age up one of my selfies and invented a beloved dead husband named Bob and a scruffy terrier mix named Milo. I then followed a bunch of pop culture accounts. Within 90 minutes, an account named Keanu_Reeves68667 was DMing me, wanting to know how long I'd been a fan (“Since Speed,” I answered). Within two hours, four more Keanus had slid into my DMs, as had two Kevin Costners, a Charlie Hunnam and a Jonathan Roumie, the actor who plays Jesus on the Christian TV series The Chosen. Although I followed accounts for Dolly Parton, Oprah Winfrey and Sandra Bullock, most of the scammers who targeted me over the next six weeks were impersonating male stars over 50 — Reeves is 60, Costner 70 and Roumie 51 — which experts say is the demographic of celebrity most likely to be imitated in these types of scams. Criminals, an efficient group, exploit the broadest gender stereotypes of peoples' ideal partners. She's probably located in another country, might be in need of some sort of help and definitely thinks his golf trophies are impressive. “Yes, the vast majority of people would be highly skeptical that this really famous person is responding to them,” DeLiema says. You cast your net broadly, see who falls into it, work really hard to build trust and hope that you can move from them just responding to them being willing to give you money. The real Keanu Reeves pays Loti a few thousand dollars a month to find his imitators and to get companies like TikTok and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, to shut them down. The company performs this same service for other types of public figures, like four-star generals, athletes and CEOs, and Loti also has a free version that will do five takedown requests a month. Most of us don't have a problem on the scale of major public figures, but if we're on the internet, we're vulnerable to our likenesses being used nefariously, in scams, porn or unethical advertising. That's because of a combination of factors, the chief one being that pretty much everybody everywhere on Earth likes Keanu Reeves. Reeves has no real social media accounts and isn't known for sharing much about himself publicly. In one subgenre of fakery, Reeves appears to hold up a T-shirt with political messaging on it, sometimes pro-left, some pro-right. In one doctored image, he seems to be endorsing Donald Trump. Reeves is so ubiquitous as scam bait that when Becky Holmes, a U.K.-based publicist, wrote a book about online scammers, she titled it Keanu Reeves Is Not in Love With You. “He cares very much about how his fans are treated, and he's very invested in trying to solve this problem,” Arrigoni says, sharing a dashboard of how Loti is working for Reeves as we're talking. In the 30 minutes that Arrigoni and I are on Zoom, the dashboard shows that Loti has gotten TikTok to shut down a few Reeves impersonators. Earlier in the day, it got some accounts booted from Facebook. Arrigoni doesn't normally talk this transparently about his clients, who tend to be highly private people, but we've ended up on this Zoom after I had a surreal phone conversation with Reeves' publicist, Cheryl Maisel, who introduced us. While I was on the phone with Maisel, whom I've known for 20 years of covering her clients, an Instagram account claiming to be her (called “cheryl_maisel_inttr”) DMed my fake account offering to connect me with Reeves on Telegram. “Your continuous encouragement means a lot to Keanu Reeves and the team and I want you to know that your support does not go unnoticed,” cheryl_maisel_inttr said. The real Maisel, who, like her client, is not on social media, has a more direct communication style. Reeves doesn't just pay to have Loti shut down fake Keanus, he also pays the company to shut down fake Cheryls and those impersonating other people in his circle. It typically takes a social media platform about 48 hours to handle their takedown orders, and in that brief window, scammers can do a lot of damage. At roughly the same time in June that the real Reeves was on a red carpet promoting the John Wick spinoff Ballerina and holding hands with his romantic partner, artist Alexandra Grant, Keanu_Reeves68667 was trying to get me to buy a $600 fan club membership card so Reeves and I could “meet in person for sure.” “I can tell you now Linda we could be best partner [sic] if you get your membership card,” he said in a voice that sounded like a Bill and Ted-era Reeves crossed with an NHL broadcaster (Reeves grew up in Toronto). When I invented a daughter I would need to check with before Zelle-ing him money for the membership card, he deployed a technique commonly used by abusers, saying that I should keep our relationship secret. “I don't think letting your daughter know about our relationship is the best thing now, Linda. You need to keep our conversations away from your families [sic]. A reverse Google image search revealed that it was posted all over the internet. Margaret's fantasy man was not coming to whisk her away from her life, and the dawning awareness of that was crushing. It was too late to drive home, and Margaret spent the night at the hotel, beating herself up for having been so stupid. In the vulnerable weeks that followed, someone reached out who said she wanted to help Margaret, a person claiming to be Costner's 41-year-old daughter, Annie. A new scammer who found Margaret because of her Costner fandom? Another hallmark of modern scams is that once one scam has worked on you, your information is shared with other scammers. At a certain point, Margaret seemed to have more male friends in Hollywood than George Clooney. Country singer Scotty McCreery also got in her inbox. “I don't tell Margaret anything to tickle her ears. But she acts like I'm jealous of her because my life is not about to change. I learned from talking to West, the California prosecutor, that the Keanu Reeves scammer I was communicating with as Linda was likely a non-native English speaker using AI voice technology to impersonate Reeves. He is probably a victim himself, likely based in Southeast Asia. When he went to the job interview, human traffickers would have kidnapped him, confiscated his passport, brought him across the border into Myanmar, Cambodia or Laos and imprisoned him in a compound, where he works 16-hour days reading from scripts written by experts in human psychology. “This is industrialized scam,” says West, who has created an international law enforcement coalition called Operation Shamrock to try to shut down these types of large-scale frauds. Once I learned that many of these scammers are themselves victims of human trafficking, and that it's happening on such an industrial scale, I began to look at Keanu_Reeves68667 differently. But he was still on Telegram and starting to get agitated with me for taking so long to buy my membership card. Over a period of days, as his messages began to peter out, I wondered what was happening to Keanu_Reeves68667 on the other side of the world. Had he decided I was a waste of his time? Was he getting in trouble for not meeting a quota? Meanwhile, as Keanu_Reeves68667 drifted away, other, nicer, newer Keanus were DMing me every day. Were any of these actually Keanu_Reeves68667 with a new account? But as I considered following him to Telegram, I couldn't stop thinking about the weird, cyclical trap we were all in. Isn't there anybody who can end this cycle before another person loses her life savings? “Meta could make all of this stop instantly,” believes West. “I would love to see a situation where these celebrities pressure Meta, and not just for their own images,” she says. “They should stand up and say, ‘Take our faces down. Don't make us complicit in stealing money from people. Industry sources say artists are increasingly worried about the issue. “There is a growing awareness and a growing concern about the marked increase in AI content featuring talent,” says Alexandra Shannon, head of strategic development at CAA, which is working on a likeness management tool in partnership with YouTube that the companies plan to make available for the general public. “We feel strongly that there have to be rules and regulations in place for everybody.” Multiple agent and publicist sources say that they have had difficulty getting Meta to honor takedown requests for their clients in a timely fashion. Since the start of the second Trump administration, Meta has leaned more toward freedom of expression and away from content moderation, but the company says it is continuing to aggressively combat scams and is testing the use of facial-recognition technology to detect and prevent celeb-bait on its platforms. X, industry sources say, is pretty much useless when it comes to takedown requests but also matters less, the thinking goes, because many consumers expect it to be full of junk. On Facebook or Instagram, many people assume the images of celebrities that they're seeing are real. In May, Instagram removed an AI-generated video depicting Jamie Lee Curtis only after she made a public appeal directly to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Curtis said she had been trying for weeks through Meta's formal request process to get Instagram to take down the ad, which manipulated footage from an MSNBC interview she did about January's Los Angeles-area wildfires to make it appear that she was endorsing a dental product. After the ad had been up for at least six weeks, she tagged Zuckerberg in a post that read, “I have gone through every proper channel to ask you and your team to take down this totally AI fake commercial for some bullshit that I didn't endorse … I've been told that if I ask you directly, maybe you will encourage your team to police it and remove it.” Within a day, the post was down. She had tried to send him money at one point, but her bank flagged a charge as likely fraud and stopped it. A review of an email chain between the two of them doesn't seem very intimate — it's mostly Roumie calling Margaret “honey,” asking how she slept and whether she has bought the Apple gift cards he asked for. But Margaret believes that her relationship with Roumie is blossoming. And she's told Carol she's not allowed to talk to her about it, that Roumie's management team wants it kept secret, “because he plays Jesus.” Though she was raised Southern Baptist, Margaret has started studying Catholicism, which is what Roumie practices, and she says he sends her a prayer every day. Since Carol has been urging Margaret to accept that the people she's communicating with are not who they claim to be, the sisters have been growing apart. Other family members either live far away or are choosing to avoid conflict and don't bring up the weird online celebrity boyfriend thing. “She was always my big sister that I looked up to,” Carol says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jenna Ortega‘s Wednesday Addams may hate being celebrated as the hero after saving Nevermore Academy in season one, but that doesn't mean she won't “die trying” to save her best friend in season two. While it may be the first time Wednesday has “ever willingly returned to a school,” as Morticia Addams (Catherine Zeta-Jones) points out in the newly released trailer for season two of Netflix‘s Wednesday, Ortega's character has her reasons.

Armed with her signature razor-sharp wit and deadpan charm, Wednesday is also plunged into a new bone-chilling supernatural mystery,” the season two logline reads.
