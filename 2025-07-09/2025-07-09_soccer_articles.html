                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino has said several of his players are drawing European interest after their performances in the Gold Cup. With several of the team's biggest stars missing, a number of relatively inexperienced players stepped in to fill prominent roles. "I go back to January when we made a roster to play two games against Costa Rica and Venezuela," Pochettino said on the U.S. Soccer Podcast. "I look now, nearly six months after and plenty of the players that were involved were very involved today in the Gold Cup." Pochettino continued: "That is why I think today, working for one month, I think Diego Luna or Patrick Agyemang or Max [Arfsten] or Sebastian [Berhalter] or Luca [de la Torre] that play in MLS, different European clubs are paying a lot of attention." Derby County has already reportedly agreed to sign Agyemang from Charlotte FC. De la Torre is in the middle of a season-long loan at San Diego FC from Celta Vigo, with his future unclear beyond 2025. Berhalter and Luna have also seen their names linked with European teams, though no club has come forward with a bid as of yet. In addition to earning interest from abroad, Pochettino said several players now have the belief that they can make the World Cup roster next summer. And that is because January camp was really important to see the players, see how they behave, personalities, character and, of course, quality on the pitch."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HOUSTON — For 23 fleeting minutes here at NRG Stadium on Sunday night, the U.S. men's national team was back atop CONCACAF. It was beating Mexico, 1-0, in the Gold Cup final, and rising past expectations, toward a regional summit. But in the end, it succumbed to a better team — El Tri, which came back to win 2-1 and claim Mexico's 10th Gold Cup title. Edson Álvarez's 77th-minute goal, awarded after a dramatic VAR review, was the difference. An hour and a half earlier, before some of 70,925 fans here could even settle into their seats, the U.S. was ahead. Patrick Agyemang won a free kick on the right. Chris Richards hunted it, and nodded a world-class header over Mexican goalkeeper Luis Malagón, onto the crossbar, and narrowly over the line. The head referee, Mario Escobar, noticed it and whistled for a goal. Richards wheeled away in celebration, with a finger to his ear, as U.S. teammates erupted. Throughout a fascinating first half, though, Mexico's quality began to show. Álvarez, 16-year-old Gilberto Mora and Marcel Ruíz began to run the show. The U.S. struggled to cope with their movement in midfield, and struggled to get out of its defensive shell when possession changed hands. From Richards' goal until first-half stoppage time, the Americans didn't take a single shot. Tyler Adams got caught between him and Alexis Vega. U.S. right back Alex Freeman got caught in “no-man's land,” and didn't recover quick enough to Ruíz. Ruíz slid a clever reverse pass to Raúl Jiménez, who finished like the most accomplished player in the field — which he was. In fact, the Americans never truly lost their footing. They limited Mexico to very few legitimate looks at goal. But they failed to create much of anything going forward. Several players showed their inexperience under the “pressure” and “stress” that head coach Mauricio Pochettino promised this game would bring. The USMNT, with no true wingers, offered essentially zero vertical threat. But Álvarez got the last laugh, with his diving header off a flicked free kick. It had come a long way, from the brink of crisis to this final, but it couldn't quite clear the last — and tallest — hurdle. Less than four weeks ago, the Americans were reeling. After a 4-0 capitulation to Switzerland, their fourth straight loss, “everyone basically counted us out,” defender Tim Ream later said. In the sanctity of locker rooms and meal rooms, though, on flights and training fields, throughout their last true tournament before the 2026 World Cup, they jelled. Richards and others also used that word, family. Ream felt like he'd added “20 more kids” to his. Over 3 million people tuned into their quarterfinal, and didn't see Christian Pulisic or Weston McKennie; but did see Luna and a group of likable underdogs who, as Pochettino said, were “desperate” to “represent our country, and … fight for our flag, for our shirt.” They came to Houston with some expectations already met. “I think there's been a lot of success this summer, with how the team's grown,” Richards said Saturday. “But me personally,” he continued, “I like to win trophies — especially against Mexico.” When Pochettino gathered players and staff before training this weekend, he recounted a trophy-lifting dream he'd had the night before. And he told them, per Freese: “We did not come here to be a second-place team.” Their problem, though, was that they came with second-place talent. They came with a six-game unbeaten streak against Mexico in official matches, but without Pulisic and McKennie, without Sergiño Dest and Antonee Robinson, without several architects of the streak, players who could equal Mexico's Álvarez and Jiménez. And besides: “Streaks are meant to be broken,” Jiménez said Saturday in Spanish. “And we think tomorrow is a great day for us to break [this one].” They became the first team to successfully defend a Gold Cup title since their Mexican predecessors went back-to-back in 2009 and 2011. They will head into North America's home World Cup next summer as the outright kings of the continent once again.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For a pair of U.S. men's national team stars hoping to test themselves in European competition next season it is good news; for another, it means further uncertainty. That means the club, where U.S. midfielder Tanner Tessmann plays and where U.S. goalkeeper Matt Turner is reportedly headed to, will remain in the French top flight after all next season – and crucially take their place in the 2025-26 UEFA Europa League. Back in the U.K., Lyon's reprieve could be potentially unsettling news for U.S. defender Chris Richards and his Crystal Palace teammates. Richards, who is fresh from a standout showing in the Concacaf Gold Cup – he also scored twice, including in the final vs. Mexico – must wait and see what level of European football his London club will now be allowed into next term. By virtue of winning the FA Cup, Palace should gain entry into the Europa League, but due to multi-club ownership rules for teams in the same competition, that may not be so straightforward. Their qualification raised uncertainty over Palace's participation in the European competition, due to U.S. investor John Textor and his company, Eagle Football, having involvement in both clubs. UEFA had postponed its decision on Palace's European fate until after the appeal on Lyon's relegation, and that call is still pending. If Palace are barred from the competition, then Nottingham Forest — who qualified for the UEFA Europa Conference League after finishing seventh in the Premier League and were ironically Turner's parent club while he was on loan and winning the FA Cup as a backup at Palace — would take their place. Palace, who say Textor has never had decisive influence on their operation (in an effort to maintain their spot in the Europa League alongside Lyon), would probably then drop into the Conference League, effectively swapping places with Forest. That outcome would mean Richards at the very least being able to play in UEFA's third-tier club knockout competition. The Birmingham, Ala., native could hope for as impressive a run in the Conference League as fellow Gold Cup participant Johnny Cardoso enjoyed last term. While Lyon's appeal win is an undisputed win for the French club, Turner is still waiting for official confirmation of his move from Nottingham Forest to the Groupama stadium. Turner was part of Mauricio Pochettino's squad at the Gold Cup but did not play a minute, with New York City FC's Matt Freese selected ahead of him throughout. On Tuesday, the veteran, who was first-choice under Pochettino's predecessor Gregg Berhalter and started at the 2022 World Cup, posted on Instagram that it had been a “challenging” time. “Challenging summer in so many ways, but I hold my head high knowing I was part of this special group. I'm re-energized and excited for what the future holds, but until then, I'm on DnD [do not disturb].” Lyon's future overall, at the very least, is looking up. He has also worked as a news and sport journalist for the BBC and hosts a podcast in his spare time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's also the first time Kylian Mbappé, who joined Real Madrid last year, is facing his former club in PSG after a contentious final season that featured a transfer saga. It isn't going so well, to say the least. One reason: Real Madrid is playing without two new defenders. Dean Huijsen is suspended after he received a straight red card in the closing minutes of their 3-1 win against Borussia Dortmund in the quarterfinals. Trent Alexander-Arnold is also sidelined after reportedly suffering an injury during a practice session before the PSG match. Xabi Alonso's first games as the new coach have come during this tournament. Meanwhile, PSG has remained a well-oiled machine since their Champions League win at the end of May. They appear primed to reach the Club World Cup final against Chelsea. Fabián Ruiz already has a brace after his second goal in the 24th minute, and PSG has taken a commanding, 3-0 lead against Real Madrid. PSG is off to a flying start against Real Madrid with Ballon d'Or frontrunner Ousmane Dembélé scoring a goal in the 9th minute. The reigning Champions League winners have struck early behind a goal from Fabián Ruiz (6'). Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has made two impressive saves already in the first five minutes, saving shots against PSG's Fabián Ruiz and Nuno Mendes. The PSG-Real Madrid match is available to live stream for free on DAZN. Kylian Mbappé is in the starting lineup against his old club, playing alongside Gonzalo García, the 21-year-old who scored four goals in five Club World Cup matches for Real Madrid. PSG's Ousmane Dembélé, a Ballon d'Or favorite, is in the starting lineup against Real Madrid. The match is being played at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Real Madrid 3, PSG 2: Kylian Mbappé scores a brace, Gonzalo García adds another Club World Cup goal and Real Madrid topples PSG in added time in a thriller. I'll even say Mbappé scores the game-winner against his former club. PSG 2, Real Madrid 1: Young Désiré Doué leads PSG into another final, starring for the Parisians as Real Madrid comes up short again after their shock Champions League exit earlier in the spring, with Kylian Mbappé struggling to do damage against his former team. Here are the betting odds, through regular time, from BETMGM: Yes, Mbappé is listed as a starter for Real Madrid against his former club PSG. It is his first start during this Club World Cup, after coming off the bench in Real Madrid's last two Club World Cup matches since returning from a stomach flu. Yes, Dembélé is listed as a starter for PSG against Real Madrid. Dembélé recently recovered from a quadriceps injury, and has worked his way back as a substitute off the bench like he has for PSG's last two Club World Cup matches. PSG coach Luis Enrique refused to be drawn into comparisons between his Champions League-winning squad and the team that previously featured Kylian Mbappé, ahead of Wednesday's Club World Cup semi-final clash with his former star's new club Real Madrid. "This is a question about the past and I'm not here to talk about the past, I'm only thinking about the future," Luis Enrique told a press conference when asked if his PSG are a better team now without Mbappe than when they had the France captain in their squad before his free transfer to Real Madrid last year. PSG will again have to contend with brutal conditions in New Jersey, with an afternoon kickoff in scorching heat after temperatures in Tuesday's semi-final between Chelsea and Fluminense soared past 95 degrees with over 54% humidity, prompting a National Weather Service warning. "Playing against Real Madrid will be a special match, no doubt about it. At the same time, we like playing these kinds of games because it means you've done your job well and you're in a position to play in a semi-final," he said. The Club World Cup final is on Sunday, July 13, at MetLife Stadium. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.</p>

President Donald Trump confirmed on Tuesday that he will be in attendance for the FIFA Club World Cup final on Sunday, as the tournament hosted by the United States will conclude at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Speaking to reporters at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the president confirmed his plans to attend the championship. President Donald Trump speaks during a FIFA task force meeting in the East Room of the White House, May 6, 2025. "I'll be going to the game," Trump said. His appearance this weekend in East Rutherford comes as no surprise, as Trump has been a constant fixture at sporting events throughout his first and second term, including most recently at UFC fights and Super Bowl LIX in February. The president also announced in March that he would be establishing a White House task force in anticipation of the Club World Cup and the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be predominately hosted by the U.S. Canada and Mexico will also play host to several matches. President Donald Trump delivers remarks as he hosts Juventus FC, an Italian professional soccer team in the Oval Office at the White House on June 18, 2025. In May, Trump announced that Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, was appointed executive director to ​​manage and oversee daily operations. Carlos Cordeiro, a FIFA senior advisor, was also named as a senior advisor on the task force. I've known him for a long time. He's a highly competitive golfer, really good. I want to congratulate you and your family and your father, your great father who is the greatest mayor in the history of New York," Trump said of Giuliani in May following the task force's first official meeting. Club World Cup corner flags are seen after a semifinal match between Fluminense FC and Chelsea FC at MetLife Stadium on July 8, 2025. Chelsea FC secured its place in the final following a 2-0 victory over Fluminense in the semifinal on Tuesday. The Premier League team will face the winner of Wednesday's semifinal match between Paris St-Germain and Real Madrid.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. men's national team striker Damion Downs has signed with Southampton on a four-year deal, the English Championship side announced on Tuesday. Downs was part of Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT squad at the Concacaf Gold Cup, with his big moment coming in the quarterfinal win over Costa Rica. Downs joins Southampton from German club FC Koln, where he scored 11 goals and helped the team win Germany's second division and earn a promotion to the Bundesliga. But instead of playing in Germany's top flight division next year, the 21-year-old forward will now aim to help Southampton get back to the Premier League after being relegated this past season. "Obviously promotion is the number one, and for me personally I just want to score as many goals as possible, help the club and help the team," Downs said. Born in Germany, Downs moved to the U.S. as a one-year-old. He'll now share another connection to Pochettino as the USMNT manager led Southampton during the 2013-14 Premier League season. "I knew it (that Pochettino managed Southampton), we talked a little bit. Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino joins the U.S. Soccer Podcast for an exclusive interview as he reflects on the latest international window, including the USA's gritty run in the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup that ended Sunday night with a 2-1 loss to rival Mexico in an electric match in Houston, Texas.

In conversation with host Alejandro Bedoya, Pochettino talks about his first year as head coach of the USMNT (2:55) and highlights his team's growth over a 40-day camp, emphasizing the importance of player development and team cohesion (5:05). Pochettino speaks on the USMNT's breakout stars from this year's tournament (11:27), the cultural diversity of American cities (19:21)and what he hopes people take away from watching U.S. Soccer next summer in the FIFA World Cup (21:27).

Later, we hear straight from some of the players who led the USMNT to the program's 13th Gold Cup Final. We caught up with Tyler Adams, Matt Freese, Patrick Agyemang, Chris Richards and captain Tim Ream right after the match at NRG Stadium for their instant reactions (23:59).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MetLife Stadium in New Jersey is set to host an epic FIFA Club World Cup semifinal today, July 9 as Paris Saint-Germain takes on Real Madrid for a spot in Sunday's Cup final. PSG and Real Madrid came into the newly expanded tournament as the top dogs, and with Madrid's Kylian Mbappé facing his former team for the first time at MetLife, it is sure to be a showdown like no other, and perhaps a bit tense for the Frenchman who is the club's all-time leading goal scorer. The FIFA Club World Cup semifinal matchup between PSG vs. Real Madrid today, July 9, will kick off at 3 p.m. Pre-match coverage will begin at 2:30 p.m. on several streaming services. The FIFA Club World Cup semifinal today, July 9, between PSG and Real Madrid is at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. It will also stream on DIRECTV, Hulu, SlingTV, Fubo and YouTube TV. TUDN and Unimas will also stream the game in Spanish. The PSG vs Madrid matchup can also be viewed on TNT and TruTV, although may not appear in some regions. Kylian Mbappé, the mega star who boasts 124 million followers on Instagram, will likely play today, July 9, in the PSG vs Real Madrid matchup. The French prodigy is fit and has trained ahead of today's match, according to Athlon Sports. Mbappé did not play in Real Madrid's opening three games due to a bout of gastroenteritis, according to USA Today, but scored an overhead kick against Dormund in the 3-2 win in the quarterfinal. Overall, the teams have each won twice when they played head-to-head, with one draw. This year's FIFA Club World Cup expanded from eight clubs to 32, but despite that, Real Madrid has had quite a legacy when it comes to tournament wins. Over 20 years, Madrid has five tournament wins: 2022, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2014. Barcelona takes the second spot with wins in 2015, 2011 and 2009. The FIFA Club World Cup final is taking place at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The FIFA Club World Cup final starts at 3 p.m. Chelsea has advanced to the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup final with newcomer João Pedro striking twice in a 2-0 win over Fluminense at MetLife Stadium on Tuesday, July 8.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Heading into the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, I figured we were basically looking at two different competitions. I feared that they would grab at least seven quarterfinal spots, then play what appeared to be sedate exhibitions against each other for large sums of cash. My pre-tournament hope was that at least two non-European teams would reach the quarterfinals. In the end we got three, with Al Hilal taking down Manchester City in a wild and wide-open round-of-16 matchup, Fluminense pulling off a successful "score early, then hold on for dear life" routine against Inter Milan, and Palmeiras surviving a battle of attrition against countrymate Botafogo. Then Fluminense outlasted Al Hilal to reach the semifinals as well. It has taken until the finals for this to become an all-Europe affair, thanks to Chelsea's 2-0 semifinal win over Fluminense. As I wrote before the round of 16, everything negative thing the critics have said about this tournament is basically true, but connecting the world of club soccer and providing more opportunities for underdog clubs to pull one over on a brand name is in itself a very good thing. Players such as Al Hilal's Marcos Leonardo and Botafogo's Alexander Barboza were able to make names for themselves on a huge stage, old stalwarts such as Fluminense's Thiago Silva and Benfica's Ángel Di María turned back the clock, and younger big-club guys such as Borussia Dortmund's Jobe Bellingham and Real Madrid's Gonzalo García took advantage of prime opportunities. How Fluminense defeated Al-Hilal 2-1 to reach the Club World Cup semi-finals. We saw plenty of big names putting up big numbers in recent weeks: Bayern Munich's Harry Kane and Manchester City's Erling Haaland, for instance, combined for six goals and two assists in a tidy 620 minutes of work. But they didn't exactly have a lot to prove heading into the proceedings. Defender stats are always open to massive interpretation. Some of the best defenders in the world are great interventionists, while some even better defenders are so good at positioning that they rarely have to intervene at all. In this case, (A) Botafogo's defense had to work harder than almost anyone, nearly dragging the team to the quarterfinals despite an attack that scored only three goals in four games, and (B) all context aside, only two players have made more than 74 defensive interventions (ball recoveries, tackles, interceptions, clearances, blocked shots, blocked crosses or aerials won in the defensive third): Al Hilal's Kalidou Koulibaly (85 in five games), the former Chelsea man who came up big in about a hundred different ways in the round-of-16 upset of Manchester City, and Barboza, who made 96 interventions in only four games. He genuinely left it all out on the pitch. My primary concern for the 19-year-old when he signed with Borussia Dortmund last month was that the expectations would be skewed; he was excellent at doing whatever Sunderland needed in their thrilling promotion push last season, and he definitely has the Bellingham edge in terms of temperament. Let's just say that Jobe didn't exactly tamp down expectations with his early play. Despite playing only 228 minutes and missing BVB's quarterfinal loss to Jude's Real Madrid because of yellow card accumulation (Bellingham edge! He also won half of his 16 duel attempts and made 15 defensive interventions. Now, he hasn't actually played a match in Dortmund yet, but his tenure there is starting appropriately well. One of Morocco's heroes in the 2022 World Cup and a one-time standout for Sevilla, Bounou left for Saudi Arabia in 2023. That might have put him out of sight and mind for many, but the 34-year-old can still stand on his head sometimes. He gave up only one goal from 15 shots on target in the group stage, and he saved a late Federico Valverde penalty to preserve a tie against Real Madrid. But his best performance might have come while giving up three goals: Manchester City absolutely peppered his goal in the round of 16, attempting 30 shots and putting half of them on goal, but he made 11 saves, and based on the post-shot xG value of the shots City put on target (3.7), he genuinely prevented extra damage. Summer small-sample competitions give goalkeepers a chance to make memorable contributions, and between Bounou's work and that of Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois (3.0 goals prevented in his past four games), Benfica's Anatoliy Trubin (1.5 goals prevented in an upset of Bayern) and Inter Miami's Oscar Ustari (3.2 goals prevented in four games), we've seen our fair share of them. His future at Bayern is uncertain -- the injury-prone 29-year old managed only 1,281 Bundesliga minutes last season and was rumored to be exploring options in Saudi Arabia or elsewhere. But this tournament has been a reminder of just how technically brilliant Coman can be. In 250 minutes over four games, Coman scored two goals with two assists -- entering the semifinals, only Haaland and Coman's Bayern teammate Michael Olise had more combined G+A -- and attempted a relentless 15 1v1s, winning nine (he was 2-for-4 in the box). He even made three pass interceptions, second on the team behind two central defenders (Jonathan Tah and Josip Stanisic). You just couldn't take the ball off of him. When healthy, Coman is still pretty incredible to watch with the ball at his feet. Di María has had a legendary career with club(s) and country; together with another 37-year-old, defender Nicolás Otamendi, he helped Benfica defeat Bayern and nearly take down Chelsea in the knockout rounds as well. How much can be taken from the hot streak that Gonzalo Garcia is on in the Club World Cup for Real Madrid. And if they do so, the MVP might not end up being Jude Bellingham, Vinícius Júnior, Kylian Mbappé, Courtois or any of the other known stars. A rare academy product who might actually break through in Madrid, García enjoyed a breakout season for Real Madrid Castilla this year but had scored only once for the senior team, against Leganes in the Copa del Rey. But he has produced either a goal (four) or assist (one) in every match of the competition to date, and he has proved dangerous with both his head and feet. (Strangely, they missed 2023-24 forward Joselu more than expected.) But with 20-year-old Arda Güler creating quite a bit of the former and García providing a ton of the latter, a couple of youngsters might end up becoming awfully vital for Xabi Alonso's first Blancos squad. OK, yes, this list has been reserved primarily for players with something to prove. It wasn't intended to be a best-in-the-world list. But I'm pretty sure Hakimi is the best right back in the world by a margin larger than any other best player at any other position. He entered the Club World Cup with nothing whatsoever to prove, especially after PSG's Champions League title victory, but entering the semis he was in the top 20 in the competition in goals (three), shots on goal (five), assists (one), chances created (seven), total touches (468) and pass completions (324), and he was top-30 in progressive passes (34) and ball recoveries (19). He never, ever stops, and his dribbling and assist on PSG's clinching goal against Bayern in the quarterfinals was otherworldly. A brilliant stoppage-time strike and PSG double their lead with nine men! Depending on how generous you are, he took out between three and five Bayern defenders in a single parry. With former bigger-club stars such as Bounou, Koulibaly, Rúben Neves, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, Renan Lodi and João Cancelo leading the way -- and a payroll rivaling that of just about team outside of Europe's most elite -- Al Hilal weren't exactly plucky underdogs in this competition. He scored four goals, including two in the upset of Manchester City and a tying shot against Fluminense in the quarterfinals. Leonardo enjoyed two breakout seasons with Brazil's Santos (plus a great run for Brazil at 2023's U-20 World Cup) as a teenager before spending one season at Benfica, then making his big-money move to Saudi Arabia. That might have limited his chances to make a huge name for himself, but when the opportunity presented itself this summer, he took full advantage. Neto's first season at Chelsea was fine as long as you perhaps ignore the size of his transfer fee (€60 million from Wolves). Bouncing between the starting lineup (36 starts) and the bench (12 substitute appearances) and logging lots of minutes on both wings (plus some time at center forward), he scored nine goals with eight assists in 3,151 minutes in all competitions. That's not "€60 million transfer fee" output, but it's solid. Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. But Neto has been more than solid in the Club World Cup. Like Neves, Cancelo and others, he has had to deal with the news of Portugal teammate Diogo Jota's death, and that could affect his participation moving forward, but he has been brilliant for a team that needed it. They were shockingly in last place in league play, with eight points from 16 matches, when he joined, but they played at a top-seven level from there. His memorable pregame speech before the quarterfinal win over Al Hilal was maybe his most lasting contribution to this tournament, but in Flu's first five matches, he also made 55 defensive interventions (15th in the competition) and won 79% of his aerial duels while his defense allowed just three goals. You couldn't hold this tournament at a grand scale without the giant European clubs that were in the draw, and FIFA obviously had to promise lavish amounts of money for those teams (and everyone else) to make sure everyone was properly involved and motivated. This competition also came at an awkward time for the European teams, with their season having ended a few weeks earlier and, in a way, both fatigue and rust becoming factors. Fans of the Brazilian clubs in this competition traveled en masse to the U.S., and they were all rewarded to some degree. Botafogo beat Champions League winners PSG in the group stage at the Rose Bowl in a match they'll be talking about for years. Inter Miami's stay in the tournament ended with an unceremonious pounding at the hands of PSG, but they also beat Porto -- a team that reached the Champions League knockout rounds just one season ago -- and drew with a sprightly Palmeiras. Monterrey, meanwhile, drew with Champions League runner-up Inter Milan and put a lot of stress on Borussia Dortmund late in an eventual 2-1 loss in the round of 16. LAFC and Pachuca both wasted some opportunities to prove themselves, but the Seattle Sounders acquitted themselves relatively well despite being placed in the Group of Death with PSG, Atletico Madrid and Botafogo. Among African teams, Esperance proved to be rather outmatched -- even if their fans weren't -- but both Al Ahly and Mamelodi Sundowns were relatively unfortunate not to advance. Al Ahly generated an xG differential greater than +1.0 in two draws, while the Sundowns produced the ninth-best xG differential in the competition and even outplayed Borussia Dortmund for large swaths of an eventual 4-3 loss. Boca and River Plate both played well for two matches before collapsing in the third, but both South Korea's Ulsan HD and Japan's Urawa Red Diamonds were mostly overmatched. Regardless, lots of teams took full advantage of the opportunities at hand, and it made this a pretty fun competition to follow. For me, the most memorable match of the competition was probably Botafogo's win over PSG, in which Barboza and a physical Botafogo defense ruthlessly kept PSG out of dangerous areas for most of the match. PSG attempted 16 shots but only one was worth more than 0.12 xG, and only two were attempted within nine meters of the goal. Botafogo defenders were unafraid of making physical contact in dangerous areas, nearly giving away a penalty and committing seven fouls in the attacking third, but they also gave up only one shot on target from the resulting free kicks. The Brasileiro is a stingy league -- the average shot is worth just 0.126 xG (for comparison, Premier League teams averaged 0.156 xG per shot this past season) -- and while it's fair to wonder about the overall level of attacking talent in the league, Brazilian teams in this competition also proved that there is a high level of organization in those defenses. Strong, physical, organized defense can still be an equalizer on a huge stage. Manchester City, by the way, ranked 29th in xG allowed per shot. Poor transition defense was a huge part of their disappointing European campaign this past season, and as Al Hilal proved in the round of 16, the return of Rodri to City's lineup didn't automatically cure everything that ailed them. (The addition of two expensive attack-first midfielders in Rayan Cherki and Tijjani Reijnders might not prove to be a cure-all either, even if it makes City's attack even more delightful.) Honestly, Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca's lengthy rant about storm delays was at least a little odd and served as a reminder that the volatile weather that we've grown accustomed to in the U.S. isn't something those in Europe are as familiar with. That said, weather has been an issue from start to finish. Quite a few matches were delayed, and, well, holding a tournament in the United States in June and July means you're going to deal with utterly oppressive amounts of heat, humidity or both. Bayern, for instance, played midday matches outdoors in Cincinnati, Charlotte and Miami, plus an evening game in Miami, before finally getting an indoor quarterfinal match. It played an obvious role -- Vincent Kompany attempted to rest stars Harry Kane and Michael Olise, among others, in the final group-stage match against Benfica, and their resulting 1-0 loss meant they finished second in their group and had to face PSG in the quarterfinals. The Club World Cup was generally regarded as a dry run for next year's World Cup in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Now, you're basically signing up for epic heat by playing summer matches in outdoor venues in Miami, Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara and even Kansas City (and honestly, Boston, New York and Philadelphia aren't exactly pleasant at that time of the year). But if you're going to take any lessons from these past few weeks, at the very least giving most of earlier-in-the-day matches to venues in the less volatile host cities in the West -- Vancouver, Seattle, Los Angeles, the Bay Area -- would probably be a smart idea.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nigeria as a nation loves football with more than two-thirds of the population taking an active interest in the sport. The Magpies are building and growing each year since the club's takeover in 2021 and won a first trophy in 70 years last season, beating Liverpool to lift the League Cup at Wembley. People in Nigeria will be paying attention to Newcastle, with some followers placing wagers via the betway app to boost excitement around games. This article will run through the different strategies fans can utilise to make informed betting decisions. The Magpies have regularly finished in the European places in recent seasons and so will be likely be tipped to finish in and around the top six this campaign. You should also take the time to look at how fancied Newcastle are and quickly analyse whether Eddie Howe's side are favourites heading into certain fixtures to give you an idea of how to bet. The Mapgies kick the season off away at Aston Villa and then host Liverpool before a trip to newly-promoted Leeds United at Elland Road and so it's actually quite a difficult start. Then Newcastle take on Wolves, Bournemouth and Arsenal and so it will be interesting to see how the side fares in the opening six matches and how many points are on the board heading into October. Newcastle are in a strong position and will be looking to bolster the team heading into the new season. Anthony Elanga looks set to move to St James' Park from Nottingham Forest and young winger Antonio Cordero has already joined from Malaga. The club are also said to be in talks with Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who left Everton at the end of June and can be picked up for nothing, while also taking an interest in Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi and Manchester City playmaker Jack Grealish. It's wise to listen to the transfer rumours as you can start to gauge just how much quality Newcastle may possess in the Premier League this upcoming season so that you know what's what when making predictions via the betway app. All transfers will be confirmed by official club channels and social media platforms which can be accessed by fans in Nigeria, while television broadcasts and newspapers will also keep you updated on who is arriving to sign for the Magpies. It is important to note that Newcastle qualified for the Champions League after finishing fifth last season and these extra matches can have a direct impact on how the team performs in the Premier League. Getting back to domestic action after trips away which included flights to the continent can be tough and performances may suffer. Now, Newcastle manager Eddie Howe is never going to reveal his starting XI heading into a game. However, the boss will address the media at a pre-match press conference before every league fixture and confirm which players have been sidelined through injury or suspension and who could be on the return to fitness. So, for example, if Sandro Tonali picks up an injury, you can look at the squad list and work out which central midfielder is most likely to come in and replace the Italian. From there, you can then compare the side to the opposition and make an educated guess on how Newcastle could perform. While your focus will be on Newcastle if you are choosing to wager on the Magpies, it is vital you also pay attention to the opposition ahead of each game. Looking at the opposition is key as a solid run of form or straight defeats will quickly tell you a great deal about the team. Overall, there are a number of strategies Nigerian football enthusiasts can follow when betting on Newcastle. From checking out the odds and fixtures to tracking transfers and team news, there are plenty of resources available to ensure you are able to wager from a place of authority.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Luna had a standout tournament and improved his chances to make the U.S. roster for next year's FIFA World Cup team. And could they find it in time for next year's FIFA World Cup? Now, after the USMNT finished as runners-up in this year's CONCACAF Gold Cup tournament, the answers are starting to take shape. Although the U.S. fell 2-1 against Mexico in the final, the absence of some usual players allowed an opportunity for newer faces to make their case for inclusion on next summer's World Cup roster. None stood out more than the 21-year-old midfielder Diego Luna, whose effort and spirit — along with three goals in six Gold Cup games — won him praise from fans, teammates and his coach. It has been a life-changing run for Luna, who before this run was best-known as the leading scorer on the MLS team Real Salt Lake. And it all started with a broken nose. Fifteen minutes into a January game, as Luna sprinted to defend against a Costa Rican player, he took an elbow to the face. It would have been understandable for Luna to leave the game. It was a friendly, not a competitive match, and waiting for him at home was his day job with Real Salt Lake, whose preseason training schedule had already begun. USA midfielder Diego Luna (#10), with a broken nose after taking an elbow to the face, celebrates a goal with USA's midfielder Brian Gutierrez during a match against Costa Rica on Jan. 22. This was only Luna's third game with the U.S. national team, and his first-ever start. His gutsy return to the match won high praise from USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino, who afterward told the TNT broadcast crew, "[Luna] said, 'please, Coach, let me keep playing,'" Pochettino said. The experience was "life-changing," Luna told reporters in June. "It added an opportunity for me to come back to more camps and show the type of grit and the hunger that I have to play for and represent my country," he said. Luna played in all eight games this summer, six of them as a starter. When he didn't score, his effort was still noticeable as he sprinted after loose balls and fearlessly challenged opponents. Pochettino came on as coach last year, when U.S. Soccer fired former coach Gregg Berhalter after a disappointing early exit from the Copa América tournament. The one-time Tottenham and Chelsea manager, Pochettino arrived with an impressive record of developing young talent. Doing that within the U.S. system was a priority for him, he said, as was reigniting a sense of pride and fight. "That attitude, hunger, desire, everything, and then, for sure, the talent … that is what we expect from our athletes," Pochettino said. 21-year-old midfielder Diego Luna, whose effort and spirit — along with three goals in six Gold Cup games — won him praise from fans, teammates and his coach. The motivation comes from his upbringing, Luna says, especially his father, Alberto, who moved around the U.S. in pursuit of a career in soccer, first as a player, then as a coach. "My parents have worked very hard for me when I was younger. Hard days for them and tough times," Luna told reporters before the Gold Cup. "Diego is not fazed by anything," team captain Tim Ream, the 37-year-old defender, said. "He just has something about him, that chip on his shoulder."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea star Pedro Neto is determined to lift the Club World Cup in honour of his late Portugal team-mate Diogo Jota. Tragically, Liverpool forward Jota and his brother Andre Silva passed away last week following a car accident in Spain. Neto, who shared a close bond with Jota from their time together at Wolves and as part of the victorious Portugal squad in the UEFA Nations League final last month, is now eyeing Club World Cup glory with Chelsea after their 2-0 victory over Fluminense in New York on Tuesday, propelling them into Sunday's final. "It's been really difficult in the last few days and I just want to leave a message that this final is for him and his brother," Neto told reporters. "I want to dedicate this final to him and his family and show my support in these difficult times for them." The Brazilian, who recently completed a £60million switch from Brighton, wasted no time in showcasing his talent, stepping in for the suspended Liam Delap. The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13. Fans can watch every match live and for free by signing up to DAZN. "Joao is such a good player," Neto said about his new colleague. Chelsea's only moment of concern came when the score was 1-0, as a penalty was given against them for a handball by Trevoh Chalobah. The match marked Chelsea's 63rd game of a gruelling season that kicked off last August, played under scorching conditions with temperatures reaching 34C during the game. Neto is now keen to end the season on a high note. "I think the results speak for themselves and show how hard we've been working. "We hope to finish in the best way."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US president Donald Trump has confirmed he will attend Sunday's Fifa Club World Cup final in New Jersey. The news came a day after Fifa, world football's governing body, announced it has opened an office in New York's Trump Tower. The United States is hosting the first edition of an expanded Club World Cup and will be a co-host for next year's World Cup, along with Canada and Mexico. Chelsea will face either Paris St-Germain or Real Madrid in the Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium, which will also host next year's World Cup final. Trump, who attended the Super Bowl in February, is chair of a taskforce he established to oversee preparations for each tournament. Infantino has assured fans they will be welcomed to the US, despite Trump's immigration crackdown and a travel ban on 12 countries. Trump has had a greater presence in sport during his second term, becoming the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl and announcing in May that Washington DC will host the 2027 NFL Draft. Trump has also attended several UFC events, including last month's showcase in New Jersey, and has said the White House will host a UFC event next year.

Chelsea forward Pedro Neto wants to win the Club World Cup in memory of his Portugal team-mate Diogo Jota. Jota, the Liverpool striker, died last week along with his brother Andre Silva following a car crash in Spain. Neto now has a chance to win another trophy having helped Chelsea beat Brazilian side Fluminense 2-0 in New York on Tuesday to reach Sunday's Club World Cup final. “It's been really difficult in the last few days and I just want to leave a message that this final is for him and his brother,” said Neto. “I want to dedicate this final to him and his family and show my support in these difficult times for them.” Playing against his first professional club, Pedro curled in a superb opener on 18 minutes after Neto's cross had been blocked. “Joao is such a good player,” Neto said of his new team-mate. Chelsea's only real moment of alarm came with the score 1-0 when a penalty was awarded against them for handball against Trevoh Chalobah. It was overturned following a VAR review and the Blues went on to close out victory in a professional manner. The downside was an ankle injury suffered by midfielder Moises Caicedo in the latter stages but the club are hopeful it is only bruising and he will be fit to feature on Sunday. Neto now wants to finish the campaign on a high. “I think the results speak for themselves and show how hard we've been working. “We hope to finish in the best way.” Watch every Fifa Club World Cup game free on DAZN.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He only flew in from a Brazilian beach last week, does not look any the worse for it and has already paid back a significant chunk of his £60m transfer fee after blasting Chelsea into the final of the Club World Cup with two brutal finishes against his boyhood club. This was a scintillating way for one of the newest faces in Enzo Maresca's attack to mark his full debut. Fluminense made João Pedro but the Brazilians were broken by one of their own in the heat of New Jersey and could have no complaints about going out. Chelsea were much the better team during a one-sided semi-final, even if they were complaints about the reversal of a first-half penalty awarded after an inadvertent handball by Trevoh Chalobah, and will probably not be worrying about fatigue affecting their Premier League campaign given that the financial rewards of their time in the US have been accompanied by sporting benefits. They will also be encouraged by João Pedro's willingness to put his foot through the ball demonstrating that he will add more than guile and craft against deep defences after joining from Brighton. He has barely featured since his red card against Flamengo last month and was overlooked again with Liam Delap serving a one-game ban. There was a late runout for Jackson here but his rawness was evident when he slashed wide when through on goal. Otherwise Chelsea will not be afraid to move on. This is a quirky event, to put it kindly, and there is something faintly amusing about the fourth-best team in England being one win away from being crowned world champions. The transformative effect on their finances cannot be stressed enough. They have already made over £80m from making it this far – almost three Delaps – and will be approaching £100m if they lift the trophy. Caicedo tried to play on but the pain was too much. Losing him would be a big blow, particularly with Roméo Lavia and Dário Essugo both missing here. Chelsea, who were also without Levi Colwill in defence, dealt with temperatures hitting 35C at kick-off and pushed Fluminense back from the start. There was no place for Noni Madueke, who continues to be linked with Arsenal. Pedro Neto switched to the left and Christopher Nkunku, who is playing with renewed purpose, caused problems by drifting in from the right. It was not a surprise when Chelsea went ahead thanks to an error from Thiago Silva in the 18th minute. The former Chelsea centre-back was too casual when he cleared a cross from Neto. Having showcased his link-up play during his cameo against Palmeiras, this time he set himself and ripped a dipping, swerving shot past Fábio. Their intensity dipped before half-time and Fluminense stirred. Marc Cucurella cleared off the line from Hércules. They made attacking changes at the start of the second half and almost equalised when Everaldo shot straight at Robert Sánchez moments after coming on. But there was more space for Chelsea on the break. They countered through Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernández, who released João Pedro with a superb pass. The Brazilian still had a lot to do. This time João Pedro cut inside, opened up his body and used his right foot to send a rising drive in off the underside of the bar. Chelsea continued to dominate, Nkunku twice going close. The final promises to be far more taxing but world domination is within reach.</p>
