                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent study in the Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior, published by Elsevier, evaluated the feasibility of Nutri, a user-centered digital platform designed to support personalized, evidence-based diet goal setting during routine primary care visits for patients with type 2 diabetes. Findings show that primary care providers (PCPs) who used the system consistently, found it usable and satisfactory, and that patients were able to engage with the intervention effectively. Sixteen PCPs and 30 of their adult patients with diabetes or prediabetes participated in the study. Nutri synthesized patient dietary recall data using a rules-based expert system, prioritizing key dietary issues and guiding collaborative goal setting between provider and patient within a standard primary care visit. Patients, most of whom were from underserved communities, engaged with the intervention successfully, with 81% reporting that they set a diet goal with their provider and over half initiating that goal within one week. Lead author Marissa Burgermaster, PhD, assistant professor of population health at Dell Medical School and assistant professor of nutritional sciences at the College of Natural Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin, said, "PCPs are on the front lines of diabetes care but often lack the time and training for effective nutrition counseling. Nutri integrates into the visit workflow and supports shared decision-making, making it easier for providers and patients to set actionable dietary goals." The study provides a strong foundation for a future large-scale trial to evaluate Nutri's effectiveness in improving diet quality and clinical outcomes. Researchers note that digital tools like Nutri may help close nutrition care gaps, particularly in low-resource settings, by making dietary counseling more efficient, accessible, and personalized.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic malignancy characterized by BCR-ABL1 gene fusion. The immune microenvironment, implicated in relapse and drug resistance, poses significant challenges towards CML treatment. Identifying immune microenvironment changes at the single-cell level may therefore aid in the development of personalized targeted therapies for CML. In a new study published in the Genes & Diseases journal, researchers from Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan University, Chongqing Medical University, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), and Huazhong University of Science and Technology conducted multi-level single-cell sequencing to systematically map the bone marrow T cell atlas and the interaction between bone marrow cells and T cells in CML patients. A comparison of the bone marrow cells from healthy and CML donors showed an increase in the CD8 T cell population along with a decrease in the CD4 T cell population in CML patients, indicating that CML induces enhanced T cell toxicity and an immunosuppressive state. Further analysis of gene expression revealed distinct alterations in both cell populations between the CML and healthy groups. Of these, the proportional distribution of CD4 naive, CD8 terminal effector (TE), and CD4 TE cells varied between the CML and healthy bone marrow samples. Single-cell T cell sequencing and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing showed i) a decrease in TCR diversity in CML; ii) an expansion of CD8 TE cells in CML; iii) enrichment of a large number of CD8 TE differential genes in key signaling pathways; and iv) significant changes in CML CD8TE cells, suggesting that a large part of the gene expression changes in CD8 T cells in CML originate from CD8 TE cells. Further analysis unraveled a complex communication network between T cell subsets and bone marrow microenvironment cells. The proportion of CD8 TE cells was found to significantly correlate with neutrophils, with a significant enrichment of neutrophil-7 subtype, suggesting that this subtype is most associated with CD8 TE cells. Analysis of the ligand-receptor interaction between neutrophil-7 and CD8 TE cells revealed significant differences in ligand-receptor pairs between CML and healthy patients. In conclusion, this study utilized multi-level single-cell sequencing to comprehensively characterize the T cell subsets in CML patients, revealing "significant changes in the number and gene expression of T cells, diversity of TCR repertoire, cell-cell communication network, and the potential inter-relationship between bone marrow microenvironment and T cell subsets", thus providing a valuable resource to understand immune changes in CML. Single-cell sequencing reveals the expansion and diversity of T cell subsets in the bone marrow microenvironment of chronic myeloid leukemia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), classified into dry and wet types, poses a significant threat to the vision of the elderly population globally. Despite its prevalence, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the damage to retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPEs) and photoreceptor cells (PCs) in dry AMD remain poorly understood. Hence, there is a critical need for the development of human retinal models that can mimic dry AMD. This research, published in the Genes & Diseases journal by a team from The Third Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of the Chinese PLA General Hospital, and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, utilized human retinal organoids (ROs) stimulated with sodium iodate to establish a dry AMD model. Building on their earlier work, which demonstrated the presence of abundant RPEs and PCs in ROs after 186 days of differentiation, the researchers developed a human retinal degeneration model (hRO-AMD) by adding sodium iodate to the culture environment, which simulated the key pathological processes of human dry AMD. Interestingly, both metformin and TN1 significantly reduced sodium iodate-induced apoptosis in ROs, decreased oxidative stress in photoreceptors and alleviated RPE cell damage, thus providing a protective effect on the retina. Further RNA-seq analysis revealed that both metformin and TN1 exerted their protective effects through upregulation of the HMOX1 gene, which is involved in resistance to oxidative stress. Taken together, these findings suggest that HMOX1 may be an important molecule mediating the protective effects of metformin and TN1 against oxidative stress-induced injury. The researchers acknowledge that the current model does not yet fully simulate all aspects of dry AMD pathogenesis, such as vascular and immune cell involvement. Nonetheless, the hRO-AMD model could serve as a powerful tool to uncover novel therapeutic targets. In conclusion, this oxidative stress injury model of ROs can provide valuable insights for the development of new therapies for dry AMD via targeting HMOX1 and its downstream pathways.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Human-induced climate change may have intensified the European heatwave between 23 June and 2 July 2025, and increased the number of heat-related deaths, according to a new rapid analysis. Research suggests that this heatwave has been intensified by human-induced climate change, which has already led to a rise in the average global surface air temperature of about 1.3°C (degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial level. Using well-established models, previously published results on temperature-related mortality across Europe, and a recently developed framework for near real-time analysis, the researchers then calculated the number of heat-related deaths that may be attributed to the recent heatwave for each city. They then compared this to expected heat-related deaths if the climate had been cooler. It equates to about 65% deaths in the heatwave due to global warming, from practices including the burning of fossil fuels. We wouldn't be able to do rapid analyses like this if we had not spent years developing our underlying methodology and collating data across Europe's cities. At the rate the world is warming, heatwaves are not going away and we have to prepare for their public health impacts. Dr. Pierre Masselot, Assistant Professor at LSHTM and co-author of the study Dr. Malcolm Mistry, Assistant Professor in Climate and Geo-spatial Modelling at LSHTM, who also worked on the analysis, said: "Our study demonstrates why heatwaves are known as silent killers. While a handful of deaths have already been reported in Spain, France and Italy, thousands more people across Europe are expected to have died as a result of the blistering temperatures recorded at the end of June this year. "It can often take around six months for public health officials to publish mortality data from heatwaves and even then, heat as a possible factor is rarely recorded when a person dies. "Given the important early heat-health advisories issued by various meteorological and health authorities across Europe, we sincerely hope that our findings will be an overestimate to the actual toll, but these figures will still only be estimates by the authorities themselves. However, we believe it's important to issue these warnings now to reach as many people as possible and encourage them to take further precautions, so they are better prepared for further heatwaves expected across Europe this season." It's intensifying heatwaves and pushing vulnerable people to their limit. This study shows that every fraction of a degree of warming makes a huge difference, whether it is 1.4, 1.5 or 1.6°C. The team say that their estimates for expected deaths from the recent heatwave are irrespective of underlying health conditions, but did not take into account climate interventions already in place at the local level, such as cool roofs painted green or white. Early warning systems and heat-health action plans across Europe, designed to educate and protect people on the risks of extreme heat, are also improving and may reduce the expected mortality.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During the menopause transition, only 1 in 5 women have optimal scores using the American Heart Association's health-assessment tool, known as Life's Essential 8 (LE8). Among the tool's eight components, four of them - blood glucose, blood pressure, sleep quality and nicotine use - are key in driving future cardiovascular risks, with sleep being particularly crucial for long-term cardiovascular health. The findings – published today in Menopause – were made by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Baylor University. Previously we've shown that the menopause transition is a time of accelerating cardiovascular risk. This study underscores that it's also an opportunity for women to take the reins on their heart health." The team analyzed health data collected from about 3,000 women who participated in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), an ongoing, longitudinal, multi-site, multi-ethnic study of midlife women that began in 1996. The researchers compared the women's LE8 scores at baseline, around age 46, to their evolving health trajectories over time, from subclinical cardiovascular disease measures, such as increased carotid-artery thickness, to cardiovascular events, including heart attacks and strokes, to mortality of all causes. Above all, sleep emerged as a potential predictor for long-term effects of cardiovascular disease events and all-cause mortality, though it was not linked to the shorter-term effects of carotid-artery thickening. The team found that at midlife, meeting the bar for healthy sleep, defined in Life's Essential 8 as seven to nine hours on average for most adults, may contribute to women's heart health and longevity, a hypothesis that should be tested in a future clinical trial, said Ziyuan Wang, Ph.D. candidate at Pitt Public Health and first author. Low total LE8 scores correlated with increased cardiovascular risk, as expected-however, only 21% of the midlife women studied had an ideal LE8 score. "With heart disease being the leading cause of death in women, these findings point to the need for lifestyle and medical interventions to improve heart health during and after menopause among midlife women," said El Khoudary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new Scientific Statement released today by the Endocrine Society highlights potential research directions related to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) that should help with the development of new and improved treatment options. Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease where the body's immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreatic islet. Type 1 diabetes requires lifelong insulin administration and may result in complications such as eye, kidney, nerve, and heart disease. Type 1 diabetes is usually thought to be a disease of children and adolescents, but it is now recognized that T1D often has its onset in adults and can occur at any age. The Endocrine Society develops Scientific Statements to explore the scientific basis of hormone-related conditions and diseases, discuss how this knowledge can be applied in practice, and identify areas that require additional research. Topics are selected on the basis of their emerging scientific impact. Scientific Statements are developed by a Task Force of experts appointed by the Endocrine Society, with internal review by the relevant Society committees and expert external reviewers prior to a comment period open to all members of the Society. The Endocrine Society chose type 1 diabetes for a Scientific Statement because research related to T1D is rapidly expanding, and the field is poised for new advances. The hope is that the Scientific Statement will provide scientists, physicians, and funding agencies with a guide for areas of research that seem particularly promising." According to the International Diabetes Federation, 9 million people had type 1 diabetes in 2024 with considerable variation in the rates across countries. The causes and factors that lead to type 1 diabetes are unknown. The Scientific Statement summarized research and suggested directions for new research in these areas related to T1D: genetics, heterogeneity, pathology of the pancreas, assessment of β cell function and mass, immunologic biomarkers in peripheral blood, changes in the exocrine pancreas, and screening to identify individuals at-risk for T1D. "We hope addressing these research gaps and incorporating more widespread screening efforts will help identify those at risk sooner and improve treatment and long-term health outcomes for people living with type 1 diabetes." The Scientific Statement proposes that Stage 0 be added to this model which already included Stages 1, 2, and 3, to highlight that there are likely events occurring earlier in the disease that currently are not understood or being studied. "We hope that research in these areas infused with information from the application of emerging technological and analytical tools will lead to a new understanding of the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes," Powers concluded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a bid to better understand how cancer cells power their explosive growth and spread, scientists at Johns Hopkins Medicine say they have shed new light on the location and function of power-generating waves on the covering, or membrane, of these cells. The scientists say the waves, generated by rhythmic propagation of enzymes that produce energy from glucose, could potentially be used to better stage cancers, and as targets of drugs designed to slow down or halt the spread of cancer. In experiments with human cancer cells grown in the laboratory, the researchers also suggest that measuring the energy-producing waves could help to stage cancers in a more universal and standardized way, regardless of subtypes and genetic mutations. Our findings suggest a correlation between higher levels of the energy-producing waves and a greater severity of the cancer, or the cancer's potential to spread to other organs." Peter Devreotes, Ph.D., the Isaac Morris and Lucille Elizabeth Hay Professor of Cell Biology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine In cancer biology, scientists have long known of the Warburg effect, a process in which cancer cells utilize more energy from a less efficient pathway - glycolysis - rather than the more efficient mechanism, oxidative phosphorylation. "That appears to be a paradox for cancer because cancer cells need much more energy to grow than normal cells," says David Zhan, Ph.D., postdoctoral researcher in Devreotes' lab. But when the Johns Hopkins team examined cancer cells grown in the lab, they found that energy-generating enzymes gather and move as waves on the cell membrane, suggesting a more fine-tuned energy production process. Zhan and colleagues began the study by comparing samples of normal cells from the lining of human breast ducts with the same type of cells from people with breast cancer. The scientists used genetic engineering to tag fluorescent molecules to these glycolytic enzymes, enabling visibility and accurate measurement of these energy-producing enzymes under a high-powered microscope. This discovery stems from earlier research from Zhan and Devreotes, published in 2020 in Developmental Cell, which suggests that cancer stages are linked to glycolytic wave activity. In the most recent study, the scientists measured the level of ATP, the energy "currency" within breast cancer and normal cells, and found that more aggressive breast cancer subtypes were associated with higher levels of ATP produced from these waves. Using other cancer cell types, including lab-grown cell lines of human pancreatic, lung, breast, colon and liver cancers, the researchers found similar results: increases in wave activity and levels of ATP in subtypes of cancer considered to be more aggressive when compared with less aggressive types of cancer cells. "The increased presence of these glycolytic waves drives more ATP production from glycolysis in cancer cells, and that leads to enhanced reliance on glycolysis for energy," Zhan says. In search of a way to slow down the cancer cell energy wave activity, they used a small molecule, Latrunculin A (LatA), that disrupts the assembly of the glycolytic waves in cancer cell lines. The scientists then found a 25% decrease in ATP, suggesting that cancer cells largely depend on these waves to fuel and execute their daily energy-intensive activities. "When we inhibit the activity of these waves, we may be able to stop these cancer cells from being able to consume nutrients and grow," says Zhan. "Cancer cells require a lot of energy to drive cancer malignancy, so disrupting this process might be able to slow or stop its spread." In addition to Devreotes and Zhan, other scientists who contributed to this work are Dhiman Sankar Pal, Jane Borleis, Yu Deng, Yu Long and additional corresponding authors Chris Janetopoulos and Chuan-Hsiang Huang of Johns Hopkins. Self-organizing glycolytic waves tune cellular metabolic states and fuel cancer progression.

However, the half-life of intravenously administered 5-FU is less than 20 minutes, and the compound is quickly eliminated and shows systemic toxicity. This study was aimed at developing a nanohydrogel of 5-FU to improve anticancer drug delivery for skin cancer treatment. 5-FU Chitin nanoparticles (5-FCHNPs) were prepared through the ionic gelation technique, and 32-factorial design approach was used to optimize the 5-FCHNPs and nanohydrogel formulations. Subsequently, 5-FCHNP particle size, zeta potential, and entrapment efficiency were evaluated. The optimized nanohydrogel formulation was assessed for pH, spreadability, consistency, morphology, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and in vitro cytotoxicity analyses were conducted. The developed nanohydrogel formulation (5-FNH9) showed 68.40% entrapment efficiency, 72.88% drug release, and 1.418% skin penetration. The developed 5-FNH exhibited enhanced skin penetration and pH-responsive controlled drug release and therefore has potential in skin cancer treatment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A large US study suggests that boosting copper in the diet may support sharper thinking in later life, up to a point. Discover how much copper makes a difference, and why stroke survivors might benefit most. Study: Association between dietary copper intake and cognitive function in American older adults: NHANES 2011–2014. All forms of dementia, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, are characterized by cognitive decline and are emerging as a global public health concern. The Global Burden of Disease study has projected that 152.8 million individuals will have dementia by 2050. Exploring protective factors for cognition is vital to preventing cognitive impairment. Of late, micronutrients have received substantial attention for their role in reducing cognitive decline. An imbalance of specific micronutrients in the brain, such as selenium, copper, and zinc, is reportedly linked to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. It is a cofactor for enzymes involved in cellular energy production, antioxidant defenses, and neurotransmitter synthesis. However, both deficiency and excess can be neurotoxic due to copper's role in oxidative stress pathways. Nonetheless, the relationship between cognition and copper remains poorly understood. Researchers carefully accounted for other dietary components, adjusting models not just for energy intake but also levels of zinc, iron, selenium, fat, and saturated fatty acids alongside copper. Participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011 to 2014 were included. Individuals under 60 years and lacking information on cognitive tests, copper intake, or covariates were excluded. NHANES used a 24-hour dietary recall questionnaire to collect information on the intake of all food types within the past 24 hours. Participants were eligible for two dietary recall interviews. These include the delayed and immediate verbal list learning tests (CERAD-DRT and CERAD-IRT), the digit symbol substitution test (DSST; assessing processing speed), and the animal fluency test (AFT; assessing verbal fluency). For stroke survivors, the cognitive boost from higher copper was notably stronger, with their global cognitive score showing a sharper rise compared to those without a stroke history. Multivariate linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between cognitive function and copper intake. Model 1 was not adjusted for any confounding variable, whereas model 2 was adjusted for age, race, gender, marital status, education, and poverty income ratio (PIR). Model 3 was further adjusted for body mass index (BMI), alcohol status, smoking status, and history of stroke, diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease. Model 4 was additionally adjusted for dietary energy, iron, selenium, fat, zinc, and total saturated fatty acids. Furthermore, a generalized additive model was used to account for the nonlinear relationship between copper intake and cognitive test scores. In addition, subgroup analyses were performed by age, gender, BMI, hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Copper's potential brain benefits may stem partly from its role in making acetylcholine, a key neurotransmitter for learning and memory highlighted in the paper's discussion. Most participants were female (50.9%), non-Hispanic White (50.2%), and married or cohabiting (58.3%). Participants with higher copper intake were more likely to be male, non-Hispanic White, and have lower smoking rates and higher family income, compared to those with low copper intake. Dietary copper intake was positively associated with cognitive test scores. Cognitive test scores increased with an increase in copper intake. These associations remained significant after adjusting for various covariates. Notably, an inverse, L-shaped relationship was observed between copper intake and DSST, AFT, and global cognitive Z scores, but no nonlinear relationship was found for the CERAD immediate or delayed recall tests. Subgroup analyses showed that increased copper intake was associated with a higher global cognitive Z score, specifically in individuals with a history of stroke, potentially due to copper's role in reducing post-stroke inflammation and promoting neuronal repair. The association was sustained after adjusting for various confounding variables. There was a L-shaped relationship between dietary copper intake and processing speed (DSST), verbal fluency (AFT), and global cognition, with the association being insignificant beyond specific thresholds. However, this observational study cannot prove causality, and self-reported dietary data and residual confounding may limit findings. Further longitudinal analyses are needed to corroborate these findings. Tarun is a writer based in Hyderabad, India.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The recent rise of rapid at-home tests has made it easier to find out if you have a serious illness like COVID-19 or just a touch of spring allergies. But while quick and convenient, these at-home tests are less sensitive than those available at the doctor's office, meaning that you may still test negative even if you are infected. A solution may come in the form of a new, low-cost biosensing technology that could make rapid at-home tests up to 100 times more sensitive to viruses like COVID-19. The diagnostic could expand rapid screening to other life-threatening conditions like prostate cancer and sepsis, as well. Created by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, the test combines a natural evaporation process called the "coffee-ring effect" with plasmonics and AI to detect biomarkers of disease with remarkable precision in just minutes. "This simple yet effective technique can offer highly accurate results in a fraction of the time compared to traditional diagnostic methods," said Kamyar Behrouzi, who recently completed a Ph.D. in micro-electromechanical systems and nanoengineering at UC Berkeley. "Our work paves the way for more affordable, accessible diagnostics, especially in low-resource settings." This is due to a physical phenomenon called the coffee-ring effect: As a droplet of liquid evaporates, it generates a flow that pushes suspended particles towards the edge of the droplet. In 2020, Behrouzi was developing a biosensor for detecting COVID-19 when he noticed that droplets of his experimental solution were leaving ring-shaped stains as they dried. He realized that this coffee-ring effect could be used to easily concentrate particles of the COVID-19 virus, potentially making them easier to detect. The rapid test technology uses tiny particles called plasmonic nanoparticles that interact with light in unique ways. The user then adds a second droplet containing plasmonic nanoparticles that have been engineered to stick to the disease biomarkers. This change can be detected by eye or using an AI-powered smartphone app. The technology gives results in less than 12 minutes and is 100 times more sensitive at detecting COVID-19 than equivalent tests. One of the key proteins that we are able to detect with this method is a biomarker of sepsis, a life-threatening inflammatory response to a bacterial infection that can develop rapidly in people over 50. Every hour is critical, but culturing bacteria to determine the source of the infection can take a few days. Our technique could help doctors detect sepsis in 10 to 15 minutes." Liwei Lin, Study Senior Author, Distinguished Professor of Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley The researchers have created a prototype of a home testing kit, similar to at-home COVID testing kits, that includes 3D-printed components to help guide the placement of the sample and plasmonic droplets. "During the COVID-19 pandemic, we relied on at-home tests to know if we were infected or not," Lin said. "I hope that our technology makes it easier and more accessible for people to regularly screen for conditions like prostate cancer without leaving the home." Additional co-authors of the study include Zahra Khodabakhshi Fard, Chun-Ming Chen, Peisheng He and Megan Teng of UC Berkeley.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Children from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) families are more likely to have hearing loss compared to their ethnic majority peers, research led by The University of Queensland has found. Researchers analyzed 1,469 children aged 11-12 living in Australia, finding that the children from CALD backgrounds had 58 per cent higher odds of hearing loss compared to peers from ethnic majority backgrounds. PhD student and audiologist Dumini de Silva from UQ's School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences said the likelihood of hearing loss was related to several factors including how well children's parents speak English and how long they have lived in Australia. There were higher odds of hearing loss among children from CALD communities whose primary caregivers were more recent immigrants and reported a lower level of English language proficiency. A longer residency in Australia reduces the likelihood of hearing loss among children from CALD backgrounds.'' The study found other reasons for hearing loss could include genetic factors, as well as barriers to accessing and utilising health services such as cultural beliefs, a lack of trust of healthcare institutions and limited availability of interpreting services in hearing clinics. Researchers recommended targeted hearing screening programs for school-aged children from recently migrated families. Senior author Professor Piers Dawes of UQ's School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences said Australia has one of most diverse populations in the world, with about 1 in 4 Australians who are from a diverse cultural and linguistic background. "There is a compelling need to investigate inequalities in hearing among Australian children from diverse communities,'' Professor Dawes said. "To our knowledge, we are the first to investigate hearing loss among children from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds in Australia using a population-based sample.'' It did not include children with Indigenous backgrounds. Ms de Silva said future research should further investigate reasons for hearing loss that could then help develop prevention strategies and early detection and intervention programs. "By understanding factors contributing to hearing loss, strategies can be developed to address hearing loss early,'' Ms de Silva said. "Missed or delayed intervention for hearing loss can have lifelong consequences for educational achievements and quality of life. "This would allow parents and caretakers of children from CALD backgrounds to make more informed decisions regarding their children's hearing health and seek timely advice.''

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study from University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center researchers identifies a cellular signature that explains why about one-third of prostate cancers respond especially poorly to treatment. Treatments such as enzalutamide, which is an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI), are standard of care for advanced prostate cancer. While many patients have long-term good response to the drugs, some will derive no benefit whatsoever. These "extreme non-responder" patients die much more quickly from prostate cancer. The new study, published in npj Precision Oncology, looked at RNA sequencing data and clinical outcomes from several prostate cancer clinical trial datasets. The researchers identified a gene program linked to ARPI extreme non-response. Moreover, they discovered the chemotherapy docetaxel could be a good option earlier on in patients whose tumor harbors the ARPI extreme non-response program. Docetaxel is approved for prostate cancer but typically given later in the course of treatment. We found significant differences in the gene expression program between prostate cancers that do exceptionally well vs. exceptionally poorly with ARPIs. Patients who have this extreme non-response program appear to get significant benefit from docetaxel, suggesting these patients may be good candidates for earlier docetaxel treatment." Transcriptional profiling clarifies a program of enzalutamide extreme non-response in lethal prostate cancer.
