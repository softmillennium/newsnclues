                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States can benefit from blockchain technology if regulators embrace its “transparency, speed and programmability,” Chainalysis Co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told the Senate Banking Committee Wednesday (July 9). Speaking during the committee's hearing, “From Wall Street to Web3: Building Tomorrow's Digital Asset Markets,” Levin said that this sort of regulation would enhance both market integrity and innovation, according to prepared remarks provided to PYMNTS by Chainalysis, which is a blockchain data company that helps firms and public sector agencies combat illicit activity. A policy framework should acknowledge that blockchain introduces a fundamentally new model for financial oversight and that the oversight of the system should be built on publicly available information, Levin said. “The consideration of different types of activity and risks should first use all the available information of how these mechanisms work and the relative transparency and risks that are associated with these mechanisms,” he said in his prepared remarks. “Government agencies with the right mandates and focus on public-private partnerships will lead to the type of financial market infrastructure that all market participants are looking for,” he said. He highlighted a case in which crypto exchange OKX, stablecoin issue Tether and the United States Secret Service collaborated to freeze and seize $225 million in assets from illicit actors. “The traceability and programmability of these assets is a key benefit in acting quickly against illicit actors,” Levin said. The Senate hearing for which Levin prepared these remarks was focused on blockchain technology and digital assets, and the development of a framework that would provide clarity to innovators and protections to investors, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said in his opening statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The media, entertainment and technology company backed by Jerry Jones and Fort Worth investor John Goff will spend $100 million on Ethereum in a new cryptocurrency investment strategy. Frisco-based GameSquare Holdings is selling 8,421,054 shares of common stock for $0.95 per share with an expected profit of $8 million. “Today's announcement reflects the confidence of a proven group of high-quality investors and leaders in decentralized finance,” GameSquare CEO Justin Kenna said in a statement. “We've partnered with one of the world's top crypto investment firms to generate real, on-chain yield while deepening our expertise in decentralized finance, pursuing new revenue streams, and strengthening our balance sheet.” Become a business insider with the latest news. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy Ethereum is the world's second-largest cryptocurrency with a total market cap of about $321 billion, according to Coinbase. That's just a fraction of Bitcoin's $2.2 trillion value, but one Ether is still trading for more than $2,600. The firm's Ethereum-focused strategy will use Dialectic's platform Medici, which “applies machine learning models, automated optimization, and multi-layered risk controls to generate best-in-class risk-adjusted returns,” the press release said. GameSquare believes the strategy will generate a targeted yield of 8% to 14%. “This new treasury management strategy enhances our financial flexibility and allows us to support a defined capital allocation plan that is focused on pursuing additional ETH asset purchases, funding potential share repurchases and reinvesting in our growth initiatives,” Kenna said. In the future, GameSquare's treasury strategy may use other investment vehicles like stablecoins and nonfungible tokens to diversify its returns. GameSquare connects brands and game publishers with hard-to-reach audiences. It works closely with FaZe Clan, a well-known esports and entertainment company.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Circle, the U.S.-listed stablecoin issuer, has quietly arranged a revenue sharing agreement with Bybit, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, according to two people with knowledge of the arrangement. Circle, which is sandwiched in competition between larger rival Tether and a growing crop of new stablecoins, shares 50% of the yield from reserves backing its U.S. dollar-pegged USDC stablecoin with crypto exchange Coinbase, a long-standing arrangement that has helped proliferate USDC across the industry. Although details of the Bybit arrangement are unknown, deals between Circle (CRCL) and exchanges like Coinbase (COIN), and more recently Binance, are to foster adoption of USDC by rewarding these platforms with a portion of the interest on Circle's reserves, and one-off payments in case of Binance. Circle's pre-IPO filing revealed that Binance received an up-front fee of $60.25 million from Circle, and continues to receive a monthly incentive based on the percentage of USDC balances on the exchange. Competition in the stablecoin space is heating up. Circle's USDC currently stands at close to $62 billion in circulation, while Tether's USDT has the largest supply by some margin at about $160 billion. One person involved in cryptocurrency infrastructure said Circle has revenue sharing agreements with a number of exchanges. “You should assume any exchange that has some material amount of USDC has an agreement with Circle,” the person said. A Circle representative said the firm was unavailable for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and Solana were trading slightly higher on early Wednesday—but analysts note that they remain rangebound. Many investors are hedging their investments and expecting the U.S. to extend its August 1 deadline for tariff negotiations, analysts told Decrypt. Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana edged up on Wednesday, largely shaking off a jolt from the U.S. reentering negotiations with several of its foreign trading partners. Bitcoin, for instance, has largely traded between $107,000 and $110,000 over the last several weeks, up a modest 1.5% over the last 30 days, but still within striking distance of its all-time high. But trading data over the last 24 hours suggests optimism from traders and investors. BTC, the largest token by market capitalization was changing hands at $109,659 as of Wednesday morning New York time, up 0.7% over the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows. And although the total cryptocurrency market has contracted by 3% in the past day—currently valued at $3.45 trillion, it has still marked a 35% gain since early April. The recent uptick in cryptocurrency prices strikes a contrast with digital assets' downward spiral in April, when U.S. President Donald Trump first unveiled his “retaliatory tariffs.” But while some traders are expressing confusion over the crypto market's resilience to Trump's latest tariff threats, analysts say they shouldn't. U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday sent letters to 14 countries, including Japan, South Korea and Thailand, informing them of his plan to impose aggressive tariffs. The proposed trade-tax rates, which range from 25% to 40%, will go into effect on August 1—barring a deadline extension. The announcement has rattled officials representing several U.S. trading partners, but crypto investors seem largely unfazed. He said any pullbacks in cryptocurrency prices “will likely be viewed as a buying opportunity by investors,” which could help push prices back to within their current range. In addition, crypto traders have already witnessed several bouts of uncertainty amid Trump's on-and-off trade negotiations, giving them more conviction and confidence to hold their assets through major macroeconomic events. “Traders have now seen a full recovery in risk assets, undermining the fears from tariff shocks,” Greg Magadini, Director of Derivatives at Amberdata, told Decrypt. Meanwhile, investors are also hedging against macroeconomic uncertainties such as the U.S.' tariff negotiations, particularly through options trading, according to Magadini. For the past seven months, institutional investors have been turning toward options for BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, or IBIT, the largest Bitcoin ETF by total inflows. Magadini said investors have been hedging their investments by buying IBIT, selling the covered call for income, and then buying the protective put to mitigate risks. He also noted that the broader cryptocurrency market has become less susceptible to dramatic swings sparked by panic sellers as it has grown larger under President Trump.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto researcher criticizes Pump.fun ICO, calling tokenomics exploitative and lacking plans for community rewards. Solana-based memecoin launchpad Pump.fun has confirmed that its native PUMP token will debut through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) on July 12. The token will have a total supply of 1 trillion and a structured allocation designed to serve institutional, community, and internal stakeholders. Of this, 18% is designated for institutional buyers through a private sale. The remaining 15% will be available to the public via major exchanges like Kraken, Bybit, KuCoin, Gate.io, Bitget, and MEXC. Notably, all tokens purchased in the ICO will be fully unlocked once they become tradable, with no vesting period. In addition to the ICO allocation, the remaining supply will be distributed as follows: 24% will be reserved for community and ecosystem initiatives, 20% for the team, and 13% for existing investors. Interestingly, 3% of the total token supply is set aside specifically for live streaming. The public sale will run until the 150 billion tokens are sold or until 14:00 UTC on July 15, whichever comes first. Crypto researcher Rex described the tokenomics as exploitative. He argued that the team is allocating over 40% of the supply to itself while monetizing a community that has helped generate more than $750 million in revenue over the past year. “Community reward which should be the purpose of $PUMP is said to be ‘coming soon' which is just another term for ‘we do not really have a plan to airdrop. Looking ahead, Pump.fun outlined plans to evolve beyond its current launchpad model into a decentralized social platform. Alon Cohen, co-founder of Pump.fun, emphasized the platform's commitment to leveraging social trends in on-chain trading. He explained that the platform aims to revolutionize livestreaming by rewarding viewers for discovering talent early and allowing creators to monetize more effectively. Cohen further stated that Pump.fun intends to foster thriving communities, movements, and even cults.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pakistan plans to launch a digital currency pilot as part of broader crypto reforms. Pakistan is preparing to launch a pilot program for a potential digital currency as part of its wider digital finance reform efforts. Central Bank Governor Jameel Ahmad revealed on July 9 at the Reuters NEXT Asia summit in Singapore that Pakistan is working on its ability to develop a central bank digital currency, with plans to launch a pilot program in the near future. Speaking on a panel alongside Sri Lanka's central bank governor, P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, he also confirmed that Pakistan's central bank is working with several technology partners. Bilal bin Saqib, Pakistan's state minister for blockchain and crypto, announced that the government has passed the “Virtual Assets Act, 2025,” which establishes an independent authority responsible for licensing and regulating the cryptocurrency industry. With this move, Pakistan joins other nations like Nigeria and India in exploring central bank digital currencies and assessing their effectiveness through pilot programs. The legislation aims to license and regulate Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs), ensuring that these non-bank entities obtain the necessary authorization before issuing e-Money for digital payment services. Bilal bin Saqib met with Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, to explore the possibility of creating national Bitcoin reserves, with Saylor offering advisory support. Prior to that, Saqib was in different meetings with Brandon Lutnick, the Chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, a global financial services firm and New York City Mayor Eric Adams to discuss Bitcoin's role in the country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto analyst TradingShot says that while Bitcoin's long-term outlook is still bullish, there might not be enough time for another leg up. Bitcoin's long-term uptrend remains strong, but an analyst warns that the four-year cycle may limit another leg up. Analysts believe Bitcoin could move higher past the current all-time highs, with targets between $130,000-$168,000. “Despite the short-term volatility, the long-term outlook is still very strong, structured uptrend, a Channel Up pattern that is now technically aiming for its next higher high,” said popular analyst TradingShot in a Tuesday post on TradingView, basing his analysis on Bitcoin's technical indicators. TradingShot explained that another major rally could be limited by Bitcoin's position within a well-defined long-term uptrend that has yet to produce the kind of rallies seen in the past cycles. Related: Bitcoin gets ‘highly favorable' cues as DXY sets 21-year weakness record “As you can see during the previous two cycles, every time BTC got above that Buy Zone, it started a parabolic rally,” the analyst wrote. TradingShot says that this cycle has not produced a similar breakout, noting: Popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital also pointed out that Bitcoin may only have a few months of price expansion left in the cycle, especially if it follows the same historical pattern from 2020. Bitcoin keeps testing resistance at $110,000 but has failed to break above it thus far, casting doubts about its ability to continue its uptrend. Despite this, several traders believe BTC still has room for further expansion in 2025. “Bitcoin broke the bullish flag, retested it, and now pushes higher,” fellow analyst Jelle observed a similar technical breakout, adding: Bitcoin price is “still well above the 50-week MA, and it's also holding strong above the previous all-time high,” said popular crypto analyst Mags, adding: Besides traders, multiple onchain metrics and indicators show that Bitcoin is not exhibiting patterns associated with previous tops. These include Bollinger Bands, high BTC supply in long-term holder hands, diminishing BTC supply on exchanges, MVRV ratio, and persistent institutional demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasuries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump Media & Technology Group wants to dive deeper into crypto. The Truth Social parent company submitted an S-1 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on July 8, seeking approval to launch the Truth Social Crypto ETF. The filing shows that it is sponsored by Yorkville America Digital, an asset management company based in Florida. This firm partnered with Trump Media in April 2025 to launch a series of crypto ETFs in conjunction with Crypto.com. The possible ETF is the latest move by Trump and his companies to deepen ties to crypto. Last month, William Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said he had directed mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to start counting crypot as collateral when assessing mortgage risk. Bitcoin has jumped 18% this year, continuing a rally to fresh records about $111,000 in recent weeks. Shares of Trump Media were down on Wednesday, and have struggled this year as areas of the "Trump trade" that soared in the wake of the 2024 election stumble in 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum core developer Barnabé Mannot has proposed EIP-7782, which seeks to halve Ethereum block times from 12 to six seconds. From a technical standpoint, it raises questions about network stability, validator infrastructure and whether Ethereum is prioritizing speed over security. As with any Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), it must be discussed publicly and undergo the voting process to gain approval or rejection from the governance community. Anybody with an idea to improve Ethereum can write and submit a proposal for community review. Why faster blocks may scale Ethereum better than bigger ones That would total 6 seconds, cutting the current 12-second cycle in half and enabling twice as many blocks to be created per minute, while each block remains the same size. This could help smooth out bandwidth and storage demands rather than spiking. Simply put, reducing block time would result in faster confirmations, quicker onchain data for decentralized applications (DApps) and wallets, plus a more efficient user experience. This appears to be a more effective scaling solution than just increasing the individual block size. Ethereum can't easily incorporate blocks larger than 10MB without the risk of network congestion and excluding people with slow internet access. Reducing Ethereum block times to 6 seconds has its challenges, and the Ethereum community is known for its cautious approach to upgrades. Several concerns will need to be debated and understood, including potential implications such as: In June 2025, Ethereum saw 20 million active addresses interact with the network in one week, the highest ever recorded, reflecting a continued surge in utility and user engagement. There are clear benefits to the network and user experience for the proposed halving of block times in EIP-7782. A major part of this is making the network more appealing to real-time applications and preparing for future protocol upgrades. However, Ethereum validator challenges need to be addressed, but they appear manageable should the proposal make it through the EIP process. Ethereum clients and staking providers have matured significantly, and with careful coordination, the network should adapt. Additionally, Ethereum has a strong track record of executing technically complex upgrades with success: These milestones show Ethereum's ability to evolve while safeguarding decentralization and network health. This proposal also prepares Ethereum for future upgrades, including: By reducing slot time, Ethereum takes another step toward a more interactive, scalable and user-centric platform without compromising on its core values of security, neutrality and resilience.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When a substantial amount of capital is sitting idle in stablecoins, it often indicates that investors are preparing to shift funds into more speculative assets, like altcoins. At the same time, indicators and cryptocurrency analysts are closely monitoring $BTC activity. From 2023 to 2024, Binance's stablecoin and Bitcoin reserves were closely correlated, while the growing stablecoin reserves provided liquidity for bitcoin purchases. Oinonen calls this ‘decoupling,' suggesting that investors are moving $BTC to long-term storage (cold wallets), while holding stablecoins as ‘dry powder' ready to deploy – possibly into altcoins. If the market picks up, altcoins could rally fast. This makes now a favorable time to snag $BEST, $SUBBD, and $MAGIC before they likely rise in price. As a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet, it supports over 1K+ digital assets, soon across over 60 blockchain networks – all without requiring KYC when creating the account. It makes it easy to buy, store, send, and trade crypto assets – including top altcoins – while offering top-notch features like cross-chain swaps and portfolio management. It even has a built-in launchpad for the best crypto presales. Best Wallet leverages Fireblocks' MPC technology to eliminate single points of failure by storing private keys in a secure, single location. Moreover, instead of using traditional seed phrases, you'll get secure cloud backups and biometric login for safer, easier access. Then, you can enjoy lower gas fees, higher staking rewards (currently at a 100% APY), and governance rights to vote on the mobile app's future trajectory. Following exchange listings and new developments (like Best Card, its upcoming crypto debit card), the altcoin's predicted to reach $0.072 this year – a hefty 184% rise compared to its current price tag. Its ultimate goal is to reshape the $85B subscription-based content industry by giving creators more control and fans novel ways to engage. For creators, it offers a comprehensive suite of AI tools, including a video generator, voice cloning, and automated profile creation. On the other hand, fans benefit through exclusive content access, personalized AI experiences, and direct engagement with their favorite creators. Their loyalty will also be rewarded with platform perks, staking incentives, and governance votes. Together, these two-way systems can significantly boost fandom by creating a truly community-owned creator economy. Whether a creator or fan, you can get involved by buying $SUBBD on presale for just $0.055875. Now's a great time to get involved, before the possible altcoin season and marketing of high-earning creators possibly push $SUBBD to $0.301 by this year's end – a potential gain of over 438%. Considering that the SUBBD ecosystem has already attracted over 2K+ top-earning creators, the SUBBD ecosystem is already gaining serious traction. Over the past 24 hours alone, $MAGIC has soared by more than 82%. Such a spike is driven mainly by growing excitement in Treasure, the AI-powered entertainment ecosystem that it fuels. In just five days, Treasure will launch on AbstractChain and showcase its AI agent, Smol, which is capable of autonomously learning and interacting with dApps. Also driving excitement around $MAGIC are Treasure's three core products: $MAGIC unlocks agent functionality, fuels transactions within the games, and is also the currency for Treasure Market (its NFT marketplace). With billions of dollars flowing into Binance and $BTC quietly moving off exchanges, the stage is set for a massive altcoin rally. This dry powder of liquidity is likely waiting for the right catalysts, and altcoins like $BEST, $SUBBD, and $MAGIC might be the frontrunners. Whether you're interested in non-custodial crypto wallets, decentralized content creation, or blockchain entertainment, they could be the next crypto to explode when the moment's right.

BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSE AMERICAN: BMNR) ha completato con successo un importante private placement da 250 milioni di dollari per attuare la sua strategia di tesoreria in Ethereum. La ronda de financiación fue liderada por MOZAYYX con la participación de inversores destacados como Founders Fund, Pantera, Kraken y Galaxy Digital. La compañía planea usar los fondos para comprar ETH como su principal activo de reserva en tesorería, lo que le permitirá participar en actividades a nivel de protocolo como staking y mecanismos DeFi. BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSE AMERICAN: BMNR)는 이더리움 재무 전략을 실행하기 위해 2억 5천만 달러 규모의 사모펀딩을 성공적으로 마감했습니다. 이번 자금 조달 라운드는 MOZAYYX가 주도했으며 Founders Fund, Pantera, Kraken, Galaxy Digital 등 주요 투자자들이 참여했습니다. 회사는 조달한 자금을 ETH를 주요 재무 준비 자산으로 구매하는 데 사용할 계획이며, 이를 통해 스테이킹과 디파이(DeFi) 메커니즘 같은 프로토콜 수준 활동에 참여할 수 있게 됩니다. 최근 BitMine 이사회 의장으로 임명된 토마스 "톰" 리는 주당 보유 ETH를 늘리고 현금 흐름 재투자 및 자본 시장 활동을 통해 더 많은 ETH를 축적하는 회사의 전략을 강조했습니다. Le tour de financement a été mené par MOZAYYX, avec la participation d'investisseurs notables tels que Founders Fund, Pantera, Kraken et Galaxy Digital. La société prévoit d'utiliser les fonds pour acheter des ETH en tant que principal actif de réserve de trésorerie, ce qui lui permettra de participer à des activités au niveau du protocole telles que le staking et les mécanismes DeFi. Thomas "Tom" Lee, récemment nommé président du conseil d'administration de BitMine, a souligné la stratégie de l'entreprise visant à augmenter la quantité d'ETH détenue par action et à accumuler une réserve plus importante d'ETH grâce à la réinvestissement des flux de trésorerie et aux activités sur les marchés financiers. BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSE AMERICAN: BMNR) hat erfolgreich eine bedeutende Private Placement in Höhe von 250 Millionen US-Dollar abgeschlossen, um seine Ethereum-Treasury-Strategie umzusetzen. Die Finanzierungsrunde wurde von MOZAYYX angeführt, mit Beteiligung namhafter Investoren wie Founders Fund, Pantera, Kraken und Galaxy Digital. Das Unternehmen plant, die Erlöse zu verwenden, um ETH als primären Treasury-Reservevermögenswert zu erwerben, was die Teilnahme an Protokollaktivitäten wie Staking und DeFi-Mechanismen ermöglicht. Thomas "Tom" Lee, der neu ernannte Vorsitzende des Vorstands von BitMine, betonte die Strategie des Unternehmens, die pro Aktie gehaltene ETH-Menge zu erhöhen und durch Reinvestition von Cashflows sowie Aktivitäten an den Kapitalmärkten einen größeren ETH-Bestand aufzubauen. BitMine's $250M private placement to acquire Ethereum as treasury reserve marks significant strategic pivot with potential yield-generating opportunities. BitMine has secured a substantial $250 million private placement to implement an Ethereum treasury strategy, representing a fundamental shift in the company's financial approach. This capital raise, backed by prominent crypto investors including Founders Fund, Pantera, and Galaxy Digital, enables BitMine to adopt ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset rather than traditional currencies. Second, the company aims to measure performance through ETH held per share, suggesting a focus on increasing shareholder value through ETH accumulation rather than traditional financial metrics. As the primary blockchain hosting stablecoins and DeFi applications, Ethereum could benefit from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's projection of stablecoin market growth to $2 trillion. BitMine's approach creates what their chairman describes as a "self-reinforcing cycle" – their ETH staking contributes to network security, potentially attracting institutional capital and on-chain assets, which could drive demand for ETH and enhance the value of their staked position. The deal structure involved both cash and crypto contributions, with several institutional investors participating alongside new board chairman Thomas "Tom" Lee, founder of Fundstrat. This hybrid funding approach demonstrates sophisticated capital market engagement and institutional comfort with crypto-related investments in public companies. Private placement funded in a combination of cash and crypto LAS VEGAS, July 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE AMERICAN: BMNR) ("BitMine" or the "Company") today announced the closing of the previously announced $250,000,000 private placement, funded in a combination of cash and crypto, to help BitMine implement its Ethereum treasury strategy. The transaction was led by MOZAYYX with participation from a high quality group of investors including Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Republic Digital, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, DCG, Diametric Capital, Occam Crest Management, Graticule (GAMA), GSR, and Thomas "Tom" Lee. By having a direct ETH treasury position, the Company will have access to native protocol-level activities, such as staking and decentralized finance mechanisms, on the Ethereum network. Stablecoins have been rapidly adopted by consumers, merchants, and financial services providers, a trend underscored by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's recent comment that the stablecoin market could reasonably grow to $2 trillion. As the primary blockchain for stablecoin transactions, BitMine believes Ethereum is well-positioned to potentially benefit from this growth. There's a powerful, self-reinforcing cycle at play: by securing and staking a growing share of ETH, we contribute to Ethereum's economic security, which can bring institutional capital and real-world assets on-chain. That can, in turn, drive greater activity, increase demand for ETH, which ultimately, we expect to enhance the value of our staked position." "We look forward to building a world–class ETH treasury and executing a strategy intended to materially enhance the returns for shareholders," said Jonathan Bates, CEO of BitMine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Puteaux, July 9, 2025: The Blockchain Group (ISIN: FR0011053636, ticker: ALTBG) (the “Company”), listed on Euronext Growth Paris, Europe's first Bitcoin Treasury Company, holding subsidiaries specialized in Data Intelligence, AI, and decentralized technology consulting and development, announces that it is engaged in the final stages of its listing application on the OTCID market. This initiative is part of the Company's strategy to expand its global presence, facilitate investor access, and accelerate its Bitcoin Treasury Company strategy, focused on increasing the number of bitcoin per share on a fully diluted basis over time. As part of this listing, market makers would acquire existing shares of the Company on Euronext and make them available for trading in the United States via a dedicated ticker, denominated in US dollars, and through a settlement and delivery mechanism aligned with local market standards. OTCID is the strategic entry point for international companies wanting to have a transparent framework to engage with U.S. investors through consistent and ongoing reporting. Companies that trade on the OTCID market are required to meet specific disclosure benchmarks including timely annual financial management certifications and current profile information. These foundational requirements ensure that United States based investors, brokers, regulators and data providers can rely on timely and accurate information from issuers of securities. The Blockchain Group has applied for listing on OTCID, currently enabling the trading of over 1,200 securities, because of its compatibility with Euronext Growth financial standards under which the Company is reporting, as well as of the presence of major French and European publicly listed companies (Air France KLM, Nestlé, Intesa Sanpaolo, etc. The OTCID listing process, expected to take approximately 2 to 4 weeks, is governed by a rigorous framework combining the regulatory requirements applicable to listed companies and the internal standards of the OTCID market in terms of transparency, financial reporting, and governance. The listing on OTCID represents a natural extension of the Company's primary listing on Euronext Growth Paris, where the Company will continue to fulfill all its regulatory and disclosure obligations. “Our listing on the US OTCID market reflects the Company's commitment to expand its global presence and accelerate its Bitcoin Treasury Company strategy, focused on increasing the number of bitcoin per share on a fully diluted basis over time, through enhanced liquidity and accessibility for our international investors” said Alexandre Laizet, Deputy CEO and Director of Bitcoin Strategy. The realization of all or part of these risks could negatively impact the Company's operations, financial position, results, development, or outlook. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to purchase securities in any jurisdiction. It may not be regarded as an offer, solicitation, or sale in any jurisdiction where such an offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful before registration or certification under the local regulations.</p>
