                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Wednesday the U.S. will slap a 50% tariff on Brazil's imports, partly in retaliation for the ongoing prosecution of the country's former president, Jair Bolsonaro. Trump said in a letter that the new tariff — a massive jump from the 10% rate the U.S. imposed on Brazil in early April — was also spurred by the "very unfair trade relationship" between the two countries. Trump claimed that Brazil's trade policies have caused "unsustainable Trade Deficits against the United States," which threaten the U.S. economy and national security. But the U.S. has a goods trade surplus with Brazil, which totaled $7.4 billion in 2024, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The U.S. is also launching an investigation into potential unfair trade practices by Brazil, Trump said in a letter to Brazil's current president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The probe is based on "Brazil's continued attacks on the Digital Trade activities of American Companies," Trump wrote in the letter, which he shared publicly in a Truth Social post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Reserve officials diverged at their June meeting about how aggressively they would be willing to cut interest rates, split between concerns over tariff-fueled inflation and signs of labor market weakness and economic strength. Minutes from the June 17-18 meeting released Wednesday showed that policymakers largely held to a wait-and-see position on future rate moves. The meeting ended with Federal Open Market Committee members voting unanimously to hold the central bank's key borrowing rate in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, where it has been since December 2024. However, the summary also showed a growing divide over how policy should proceed from here. "Most participants assessed that some reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate this year would likely be appropriate," the minutes said, as officials saw tariff-induced inflation pressures as potentially "temporary and modest" while economic growth and hiring could weaken. How far the cuts could go, though, was a matter of debate. Opinions ranged from a "couple" officials who said the next cut could come as soon as this month to "some" who thought no reductions this year would be appropriate. Though the minutes do not mention names, Fed Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller have gone on record saying they could see their way to cutting rates as soon as the July 29-30 Fed meeting if inflation stays under control. At the same time, "several" officials said they thought the current overnight funds rate "may not be far" from a neutral level, meaning only a few cuts may be ahead. Those officials cited inflation still above the 2% goal amid a "resilient" economy. Officials at the meeting updated their projections for rate cuts, expecting two this year followed by three more over the next couple years. The release comes with President Donald Trump ramping up pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his cohorts to cut aggressively. In public statements and on his Truth Social site, Trump has lambasted Powell, going as far to call for his resignation. For the most part, he has joined the cautious approach, insisting that with a strong economy and uncertainty over inflation, the Fed is in a good position to stay on hold until it has more information. "Participants agreed that although uncertainty about inflation and the economic outlook had decreased, it remained appropriate to take a careful approach in adjusting monetary policy," the document stated. Officials also noted that they "might face difficult tradeoffs if elevated inflation proved to be more persistent while the outlook for employment weakened." Since the meeting, Trump has continued negotiations with key U.S. trading partners, with the tariff ground shifting on a near-daily basis. Trump initially announced tariffs on April 2, and then has altered deadlines for agreements, most recently ticking off a series of letters to foreign leaders notifying them of looming levies should they not act. Recent data indicate that Trump's tariffs have not fed into prices, at least on a large scale. The consumer price index showed an increase of just 0.1% in May. "Many participants noted that the eventual effect of tariffs on inflation could be more limited if trade deals are reached soon, if firms are able to quickly adjust their supply chains, or if firms can use other margins of adjustment to reduce their exposure to the effects of tariffs," the minutes stated. Personal expenditures declined 0.1% in May, while retail sales tumbled 0.9%. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oak View Group CEO Tim Leiweke has been indicted on a federal criminal conspiracy charge related to his alleged role in rigging the bidding to develop, manage and operate the University of Texas' basketball  arena in Austin. Leiweke, 68, is accused in the indictment of conspiring with another would-be bidder on the $338 million Moody Center arena project to induce that second company to drop out of the competition with Oak View Group in exchange for receiving lucrative sub-contracts at the arena. The indictment says Leiweke later reneged on that promise to the other company after it dropped its effort to bid on the entire project. CNBC has reached out to Oak View Group for comment. Oak View Group's website says the company manages 400 sports, entertainment and other venues. Lewieke is the former CEO of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment. Before that, he served as CEO of Anschutz Entertainment Group. Two people familiar with the matter told CNBC that the Department of Justice's antitrust division is expected to announce two non-prosecution agreements in connection with the case with Oak View Group and Legends Hospitality. Oak View is expected to pay a $15 million penalty, and Legends Hospitality is expected to pay a $1.5 million penalty, according to those people. We want to hear from you.

The number of performing rights organizations has proliferated in recent years, leaving some venues struggling to pay fees for music

Every song played in a public place requires a royalty fee be paid to the songwriter. 

Ever since operetta composer Victor Herbert sued Shanley's restaurant in New York in 1917 to force it to pay for playing his song on a player-piano, songwriters and music publishers have depended on Performing Rights Organizations to make sure they get compensated.

For much of the last century, three organizations dominated the industry, a relatively staid and unglamorous corner of the music scene that remained largely unchanged throughout the eras of radio, records and CDs. But the rise of streaming has led to a surge in revenue and spawned a handful of new organizations looking to cash in. Now there are at least half a dozen PROs in the US, representing different songwriters and publishers, each demanding that bars, restaurants, hotels and other venues pay a fee or risk being sued.</p>

Fed Meeting:

Close Federal Reserve watchers have a message for anyone who thinks the next leader of the US central bank will deliver lower borrowing costs on a silver platter: Don't count on it.

While it's an unlikely outcome, some investors have staked out positions in futures markets that will profit if interest rates drop immediately after Jerome Powell's term as chair ends in May 2026. The trade has been fueled by President Donald Trump's pledge to nominate “somebody that wants to cut rates.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Perplexity AI on Wednesday launched a new artificial intelligence-powered web browser called Comet in the startup's latest effort to compete in the consumer internet market against companies like Google and Microsoft. Comet will allow users to connect with enterprise applications like Slack and ask complex questions via voice and text, according to a brief demo video Perplexity released on Wednesday. Perplexity Max costs users $200 per month. "We built Comet to let the internet do what it has been begging to do: to amplify our intelligence," Perplexity wrote in a blog post Wednesday. Perplexity is best known for its AI-powered search engine that gives users simple answers to questions and links out to the original source material on the web. After the company was accused of plagiarizing content from media outlets, it launched a revenue-sharing model with publishers last year. In May, Perplexity was in late-stage talks to raise $500 million at a $14 billion valuation, a source familiar confirmed to CNBC. The startup was also approached by Meta earlier this year about a potential acquisition, but the companies did not finalize a deal. "We will continue to launch new features and functionality for Comet, improve experiences based on your feedback, and focus relentlessly–as we always have–on building accurate and trustworthy AI that fuels human curiosity," Perplexity said Wednesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you've been watching Wimbledon this year, I'll assume your eyes have been glued to the tennis court. From Rolexes to diamond-studded Tudors, celebrity tennis fans seem to be fighting for a title of their own: best timepiece. Beckham is a brand ambassador for the Swiss watch company Tudor, which gifted him a custom timepiece for his 50th birthday in May, as the brand confirmed to Business Insider. On June 30, he pulled out the watch to accessorize his Wimbledon look, pairing it with a cream suit and sunglasses. Tudor did not release details on the watch, but Esquire reported it's a custom version of the brand's Black Bay Chrono. Redmayne modeled in a campaign for Omega's Seamaster Aqua Terra, so it's no surprise he wore the $7,000 watch to Wimbledon. Hague, a reality TV star, influencer, and mogul, has been wearing her Nautilus watch from Patek Philippe since 2021. On July 1, she attended Wimbledon wearing it with a Christian Dior dress. The watch retails for $72,806 on Patek Philippe's website. Jonas attended Wimbledon with Priyanka Chopra Jonas on July 2, showing off a gold watch when he clapped. The timepiece was a vintage version of Rolex's Day-Date watch, which Jonas was also spotted wearing in April. Made of 18-karat yellow gold, it had diamond detailing on the black face for a touch of glamour. Though pricing wasn't available for Jonas' specific watch, the modern Day-Date 40 retails for $102,750 on Rolex's website. Rather than showing off their couple style by wearing the same color or pattern to Wimbledon, Crowe and Theriot both wore Rolex Cosmograph Daytona watches. The Manchester United player paired a yellow blouse from Loewe with trousers and a Rolex Day-Date on Friday. Mainoo's Day-Date 40 has an 18-karat rose gold band in Rolex's "president" style and a striking olive green face for a colorful and modern take on the watch. Warren Alfie Baker styled Powell for his appearance at Wimbledon on Saturday. Powell wore the brand's $10,600 Constellation watch, which has a leather strap and gold detailing on the bezel. On Sunday, Garfield appeared at Wimbledon wearing Ralph Lauren head to toe. Garfield added an Omega De Ville Trésor watch to the ensemble. The steel watch costs $7,400 and has a black leather strap. Rolex released its Land-Dweller 40 in March, and Federer, a brand ambassador for Rolex since 2001, starred in the campaign for the watch model. Federer appeared to wear the same watch at Wimbledon on Monday. The Land-Dweller 40mm with diamond and platinum detailing retails for $118,050. Holland took a break from filming Christopher Nolan's "The Odyssey" to attend Wimbledon, accessorizing his laid-back ensemble with a Rolex Cosmograph Daytona. He appeared to wear the ice-blue platinum model, which has a brown bezel and can feature diamond detailing on the dial.</p>

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. plans to ask junior bankers to confirm their loyalty on a regular basis in a bid to limit advances from talent-hungry buyout firms.

The investment bank will ask new analysts to certify every three months that they haven't already lined up jobs elsewhere, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing the confidential plan.</p>

Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 7 (left) and Galaxy Z Fold 7 (right) are its thinnest folding phones yet.

Samsung Electronics Co. introduced three new foldable smartphones in an effort to cement its grip on the category and broaden mainstream appeal before Apple Inc. debuts its first version next year.

The new devices, the $2,000 Galaxy Z Fold 7 and $1,100 Galaxy Z Flip 7, are thinner and lighter, advancements that helps Samsung funnel their still-unique benefits into designs that are similar in thickness to standard phones. The handsets address some user complaints about past editions and weave in more artificial intelligence features across the company's software.</p>

An ex-Citigroup Inc. employee who lost her job for allegedly saying it was a “nightmare” to work with Indians during a job interview sued the bank alleging she was unfairly dismissed and faced discrimination.

Ann Watson, who worked as a senior vice president in the Finance Solutions Group, sued the bank in a London employment tribunal after she was dismissed in 2023 for alleged gross misconduct. She is seeking compensation for being wrongfully dismissed and discrimination because of her disability, sex and age. The bank denied the allegations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI chief Sam Altman had barely strolled into Sun Valley's billionaire summer camp on Tuesday when he found himself peppered with questions from reporters on Mark Zuckerberg's rivaling AI ambitions, Elon Musk's America Party, and his thoughts on the Trump administration. Altman, who is set to attend the annual Allen & Co. Sun Valley Conference this week, spent a couple of minutes talking to reporters before entering the conference grounds. He was first asked about the war for talent between OpenAI and social media giant Meta. Obviously, some people will go to different places," Altman told reporters. "There's a lot of excitement, I guess you could say, in the industry. But no, I think we feel fine," he added. Zuckerberg and Meta have been aggressively poaching AI talent from competitors like OpenAI. Last month, Meta said it had made a $15 billion investment in data-labeling firm ScaleAI. It added that ScaleAI's founder and CEO, Alexandr Wang, will be joining Meta as its Chief AI Officer as part of the deal. In addition, Wang will co-lead Meta Superintelligence Labs with Nat Friedman, the former CEO of GitHub. The team also includes former top researchers from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. Altman told reporters on Tuesday that he has not spoken to Zuckerberg since Meta started poaching OpenAI's employees but is "looking forward" to seeing him at the conference. Altman said on Tuesday that OpenAI's approach toward retaining talent was to have a "great mission, really talented people, and trying to build a great research lab and a great company, too." Musk, once one of President Donald Trump's biggest backers, has publicly fallen out with the administration after he criticized Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill." "Elon busts up with everybody," Altman said on Tuesday. Altman cofounded OpenAI with Musk in 2015, but their relationship has since deteriorated since Musk left OpenAI's board in 2018. Last year, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI where he accused the ChatGPT maker of violating its nonprofit mission by partnering with Microsoft. He also gave Altman a nickname: "Swindly Sam."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the new arrangement, employees leaving a company would be relieved of their job responsibilities but severely restricted from working elsewhere. They would keep their pay and benefits but wouldn't be entitled to bonuses, which can make up a large chunk of pay in finance and management positions. The rule applies to workers earning at least twice the average local wage in Florida, which is about $140,000 in urban areas, plus those who have access to confidential employer information. Lobbyists for the law said it would protect trade secrets and invite high-paying companies to Florida. Since the pandemic, finance and other companies have flocked to Florida, moving headquarters or expanding offices in cities such as Miami. "If we want to attract those kinds of clean, high-paying jobs, you have to provide those businesses protection on the investment that they're making and their employees." Last year, the Federal Trade Commission issued a rule banning most non-compete clauses in employment contracts, which was blocked by a federal court order. He said this "Wall Street South" could one day overtake New York as America's financial hub. "Miami, I think, represents the future of America," he said in 2023, adding that Florida's pro-business political environment favors its growth. Citadel has extended non-compete agreements for some portfolio managers to 21 months, exceeding the industry practice of one year. The new law contrasts with the more worker-friendly policies that many states, including California, Oklahoma, Minnesota, and North Dakota, have been moving toward, including limitations and bans on non-competes. Before it became law, several think tanks urged Gov.</p>
