                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks during a lunch with African leaders in the State Dining Room of the White House, Wednesday, July 9, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump singled out Brazil for import taxes of 50% on Wednesday for its treatment of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, showing that personal grudges rather than simple economics were driving the U.S. leader's use of import taxes. Trump has described Bolsonaro as a friend and hosted the former Brazilian president at his Mar-a-Lago resort when both were in power in 2020. “This Trial should not be taking place,” Trump wrote in the letter posted on Truth Social. “It is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!” Trump also objected to Brazil's Supreme Court fining of social media companies such as X, saying the temporary blocking last year amounted to “SECRET and UNLAWFUL Censorship Orders.” Trump said he is launching an investigation as a result under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which applies to companies with trade practices that are deemed unfair to U.S. companies. The Brazil letter was a reminder that politics and personal relations with Trump matter just as much as any economic fundamentals. And while Trump has said the high tariff rates he's setting are based on trade imbalances, it was unclear by his Wednesday actions how the countries being targeted would help to reindustrialize America. Trump also sent letters Wednesday to the leaders of seven other nations. None of them — the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Libya, Iraq and Sri Lanka — is a major industrial rival to the United States. Trade, he said, “seems to be a foundation” for him to settle disputes between India and Pakistan, as well as Kosovo and Serbia. “And we seem to be quite successful in doing that.” On Monday, Trump placed a 35% tariff on Serbia, one of the countries he was using as an example of how fostering trade can lead to peace. Trump said the tariff rates in his letters were based on “common sense” and trade imbalances, even though the Brazil letter indicated otherwise. Trump suggested he had not thought of penalizing the countries whose leaders were meeting with him in the Oval Office — Liberia, Senegal, Gabon, Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau — as “these are friends of mine now.” Countries are not complaining about the rates outlined in his letters, he said, even though those tariffs are close to the ones announced April 2 that rattled financial markets. The S&P 500 index was up slightly in Wednesday afternoon trading. “We really haven't had too many complaints because I'm keeping them at a very low number, very conservative as you would say,” Trump said. Officials for the European Union, a major trade partner and source of Trump's ire on trade, said Tuesday that they are not expecting to receive a letter from Trump listing tariff rates. The Republican president started the process of announcing tariff rates on Monday by hitting two major U.S. trading partners, Japan and South Korea, with import taxes of 25%. Trump is giving countries more time to negotiate with his Aug. 1 deadline, but he has insisted there will be no extensions for the countries that receive letters. Maros Sefcovic, the EU's chief trade negotiator, told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France, on Wednesday that the EU had been spared the increased tariffs contained in the letters sent by Trump and that an extension of talks until Aug. 1 would provide “additional space to reach a satisfactory conclusion.” The EU has 27 member states, including France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The tariff letters are worded aggressively in Trump's style of writing. The president threatened additional tariffs on any country that attempts to retaliate. He said he chose to send the letters because it was too complicated for U.S. officials to negotiate with their counterparts in the countries with new tariffs. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba interpreted the Aug. 1 deadline as a delay to allow more time for negotiations, although he cautioned in remarks that the tariffs would hurt his nation's domestic industries and employment. Malaysia's trade minister, Zafrul Aziz, said Wednesday that his country would not meet all of the U.S. requests after a Trump letter placed a 25% tariff on its goods. Aziz said U.S. officials are seeking changes in government procurement, halal certification, medical standards and digital taxes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Student athletes hold signs during a hearing to consider bills to pass rules banning transgender student-athletes, April 1, 2025, in Sacramento, Calif. (AP Photo/Yuri Avila, File) Gavin Newsom, R-Calif., speaks to a crowd gathered at an event space during a two-day swing through South Carolina on Tuesday, July 8, 2025, in Bennettsville, S.C. (AP Photo/Meg Kinnard) SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration sued the California Department of Education on Wednesday for allowing transgender girls to compete on girls sports teams, alleging the policy violates federal law. The department says California's rules “are not only illegal and unfair but also demeaning, signaling to girls that their opportunities and achievements are secondary to accommodating boys.” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi warned other states that allow trans girls to compete in female athletics that they could also face challenges by the federal government. The state Education Department and the California Interscholastic Federation, the governing body for high school sports that was also named a defendant, said they would not comment on pending litigation. But Newsom's office said the Trump administration's attacks on the state's transgender athlete policies are “a cynical attempt” to distract from the federal government's withholding of funds for after-school and summer programs. California has a more than decade-old law on the books that allows students to participate in sex-segregated school programs, including on sports teams, and use bathrooms and other facilities that align with their gender identity. Trump criticized the participation of a transgender high school student-athlete who won titles in the California track-and-field championships last month. The federal Education Department earlier this year launched an investigation into California's policies allowing athletes to compete on sports teams consistent with their gender identity. Trump also sparred with Maine's Democratic governor over that state's transgender-athlete policies. His administration filed a lawsuit in April alleging Maine violated Title IX by allowing trans girls and women to compete against other female athletes. The Justice Department's lawsuit against California says its policies “ignore undeniable biological differences between boys and girls, in favor of an amorphous 'gender identity. “The results of these illegal policies are stark: girls are displaced from podiums, denied awards, and miss out on critical visibility for college scholarships and recognition,” the suit says. Meanwhile, on his podcast in March, Newsom angered some party allies when he questioned the fairness of trans girls competing in girls sports. GOP critics have called on the governor to back a ban, saying his remarks do not square with his actions. The issue is part of a nationwide battle over the rights of transgender youth in which states have limited transgender girls from participating on girls sports teams, barred gender-affirming surgeries for minors and required parents to be notified if a child changes their pronouns at school. More than two dozen states have laws barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain sports competitions. Some of the policies have been blocked in court. Trump signed an executive order in February aimed at barring trans girls and women from participating on sports teams consistent with their gender identity. Proponents of a ban, including the conservative California Family Council, say it would restore fairness in athletic competitions. But opponents, including the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Equality California, say bans are an attack on transgender youth. In Oregon, three high school track-and-field athletes filed a federal lawsuit against the state this week seeking to remove records set by transgender girls and prevent them from participating in girls sports. They say allowing trans girls to compete against other female athletes is unfair and violates Title IX. The U.S. Education Department launched investigations earlier this year into Portland Public Schools and the state's governing body for high school sports over alleged violations of Title IX for allowing trans girls to compete in girls sports.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss recent attacks on ICE agents, Democratic mayors resisting the crackdown on illegal immigration and TSA's reversal of the 'shoes off' airport security rule. Some of the suspects charged with attempted murder of two ICE agents and a police officer at Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, on Independence Day met in an online chat group on Signal, and court records show the incident could have been worse. A July 7 criminal complaint filed by the U.S. District Court Northern District of Texas alleges that assailants shot 20 to 30 rounds from an AR-15-style rifle before it jammed, causing it to malfunction. Investigators continued on Tuesday to look into how the suspects were linked, including through a possible Signal group chat. Ten suspects were charged with attempted murder of a federal officer in connection with the July 4, 2025, ambush attack on the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas. In addition, the U.S. Attorney's office charged an 11th suspect, Daniel Rolando Sanchez Estrada, with concealing evidence. On Friday night, the heavily armed group lured two unarmed ICE agents into a parking lot by firing a barrage of fireworks at their door, and spray-painting graffiti on their personal cars with the words "traitor" and "Ice Pig," which agents could see from the cameras inside. Ten individuals have been charged for their roles in the shooting of an Alvarado police officer at the Prairieland Detention Center. At around the same time, a police officer responded to their 911 call for two men firing rounds from a nearby tree line, and an officer was hit in the neck, which forced the agents to take cover. Suspect Bradford Morris was arrested while trying to flee from the scene in a red Hyundai van. While in custody, he told an FBI agent he had been "part of a Signal Group Chat for a while and that he had been invited to the group chat years ago after attending a protest." He drove to the incident with another suspect and two people he only knew by their nicknames, "Champagne and Rowan." According to the criminal complaint, Morris "claimed that he met some people online and transported some of them down from Dallas" to the center in order to "make some noise." The Prairieland Detention Facility in Alvarado, Texas, where a police officer was shot in the neck and several ICE officers were shot at on Friday. "One possibility is that they are related and this is a national concerted effort, to go after first responders," Alex Del Carmen, criminologist, told Fox 4 News Dallas-Fort Worth. "The second possibility is that, in fact, this may not be related at all, and these are simply copycats, people are getting inspired to do this kind of harm to first responders because they're reading what's happening in other states," he added. Court records revealed extensive planning as well as anti-government literature obtained in an apartment tied to a suspect, including literature entitled "Organising for Attack! Court records revealed extensive planning as well as anti-government literature obtained in an apartment tied to a suspect. The term "insurrectionary anarchy" is explained as a "subset of anarchism that stands out for its commitment to violence and revolutionary insurrection," according to a Perspectives on Terrorism journal article, which is part of the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism, from March 2024. The Combating Terrorism Center at West Point also had a journal article in March 2023 that explained "insurrectionary anarchism is regarded as the most serious form of domestic (non-jihadi) terrorist threat." "Threats or acts of violence toward law enforcement officers will NOT be tolerated. Secretary Noem has made it clear: If you threaten or attempt to harm a law enforcement officer, we will find you and prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law," the statement continued.

'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts break down the latest legal clashes over President Donald Trump's deportations of illegal immigrants. The government of El Salvador told the United Nations that more than 100 Venezuelan migrants deported by the Trump administration to its maximum-security prison, CECOT, in March remain under the sole custody of the U.S. government — appearing to undercut months of assertions by senior Trump officials, who have repeatedly claimed they have no power to compel the return of these individuals. The U.N. report was included Monday in a court filing submitted by lawyers for the ACLU and other migrant groups representing more than 100 detainees at CECOT who are challenging their removal from the U.S. to the maximum-security Salvadorian prison. The filing included a copy of statements made by the Salvadorian government to a U.N. human rights office in April, as part of an investigation brought on behalf of four families. Judge James E. Boasberg, chief judge of the Federal District Court in Washington, D.C., stands for a portrait at E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse in Washington, D.C., on Mar. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post via Getty Images) That assertion came roughly one month after the Trump administration in March invoked a 1798 wartime immigration law to more quickly deport Venezuelan nationals, including alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Prior to March, the U.S. invoked the law just three times, including most recently during World War II. Lawyers representing the migrants argued Monday that the statement included in the U.N. report should be grounds for plaintiffs to seek additional discovery in the case, which had been overseen by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg beginning in March. "Since March, the Trump-Vance administration has sought to operate in the shadows without public transparency as it removes people from the country under false pretenses or without any process at all," Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, which is representing the CECOT detainees alongside the ACLU, said in a statement this week. It could also breathe new life into a flurry of stalled immigration cases nationwide. As of this writing, the revelation has already had a knock-down effect on at least one case involving a CECOT migrant ordered back to the U.S. by a federal judge. Demonstrators gather outside the U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Maryland, to protest the Trump administration's deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was sent to El Salvador in March in what administration officials said was an administrative error, on July 7, 2025. "Defendants have repeatedly skirted this Court's directive to provide information regarding the steps they have taken and will take to facilitate the return of ['Cristian'] to the United States," the judge wrote in an order Wednesday evening, referring to a man deported to El Salvador in March. She noted that the defendants "have repeatedly made oblique references to their request of 'assistance' from the U.S. Department of State, which has 'entered into negotiations to facilitate Cristian's return' and 'assumed responsibility on behalf of the U.S. Government for ... diplomatic discussions with El Salvador.'" Gallagher ruled in April that the government violated a 2024 settlement between DHS and a group of young asylum seekers in deporting him before his case was fully heard in court. As of this writing, however, he has not been returned to the country. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis will hear from Trump administration officials and lawyers for Salvadorian migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia as she weighs a request from Abrego's attorneys to transfer him back to U.S. custody in Maryland. Abrego is currently in the custody of U.S. Plaintiffs have cited deep concerns that the Trump administration would immediately seek to take him into ICE custody upon release and deport him to a third country— a notion the administration did not dispute. Xinis, for her part, has taken umbrage with the Trump administration's evasiveness and slow-walking of information, which she likened earlier this week to "trying to nail Jell-O to a wall."

Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the investigation into the cover-up of former President Joe Biden's health decline as his physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor is set to testify despite concerns over patient confidentiality. Congressional Republicans and the Trump administration stuffed every legislative initiative imaginable (that would mesh with Senate budget rules) into the package. There are always subjects on which the GOP wants to focus and legislate. But after approving the hallmark of President Trump's legislative agenda, there are frankly not a lot of other big items rolling down the parliamentary pike. President Donald Trump, right, shakes hands with House Speaker Mike Johnson after signing his signature bill of tax breaks and spending cuts at the White House on Friday, July 4, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson) But we'll focus on a few that are important to the GOP – and could make headlines. A "rescissions" bill is due in the Senate. Congress approved an interim spending bill in March to avoid a government shutdown, but a few months later, White House Budget Director Russ Vought sent a "rescissions" request to Congress. Vought hoped to claw back $9.4 trillion in spending for USAID and public broadcasting. Flip one vote and the bill would have failed. Senators must do so before a July 18 deadline. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., noted that the measure was "subject to amendments." And the administration hopes to do multiple rescissions plans this year. So if the House and Senate can't even trim a few billion dollars from what the GOP considers low-hanging fruit…. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., who represents a sprawling state which still relies on radio in places, indicated that he'd like to see some changes to the rescissions package, especially in light of the flooding in Texas. South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds was a panelist for the inaugural Reagan National Economic Forum in California. "Looking at radio stations in some of the rural areas that do a lot of emergency services," said Rounds. Without question, the biggest challenge facing Congress this fall – and next fall – is funding the government and avoiding a shutdown. Congress managed to avoid a shutdown in March – simply renewing all existing funding at the levels dictated by the Democrat-controlled Congress last year, and signed off by former President Biden. So Schumer and several Democrats voted to assist the GOP overcome a filibuster – and keep the government lights burning. Democrats railed against Schumer for essentially helping bail out Republicans and getting nothing in return. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and other Democrats seethed at Schumer's maneuver. The New York Times Editorial Board accused the Democratic Party of being in "denial" over why it lost in 2024. Schumer can probably only go to that well once. One wonders what Schumer could possibly extract from Republicans and President Trump – who aren't exactly ready to deal – even though they lack the votes to fund the government themselves. Moreover, it's unclear if a government funding measure of any sort can even make it through the House with just GOP votes. Remember that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., promised conservatives that they would do funding bills one by one when he secured the speakership in October 2023. After all, that was the knock against former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Johnson managed to advance some spending bills last year, but the path to doing all 12 spending bills before the Oct. 1 deadline is narrowing. Well, the question is whether Johnson can again keep his coalition together and convince conservatives to approve yet another interim spending measure. And, since it's about the math, they absolutely must have assistance from Schumer and Senate Democrats to avoid a filibuster yet again. Some of this will boil down to what President Trump wants. The easy path is simply re-upping the old Biden/Democrats' money (again) for a short period and then hammering out a broader spending pact later in the fall or before Christmas. They have to do this all again by Oct. 1, 2026. From left to right, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson. There are also expectations – and some promises – of GOP leaders advancing another "reconciliation" package full of items they weren't able to stuff into the Big, Beautiful Bill. A "reconciliation" measure must deal with fiscal issues – not policy. It must also not add to the deficit over a decade. So, expect Republicans who didn't score certain savings items in the Big, Beautiful Bill to push for provisions in this package. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., has been among the most vocal advocates for two bills. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., even pushed for two reconciliation packages over the winter. Well, Republicans are simultaneously looking backwards – and forwards. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., is conducting an inquiry into what former Biden officials knew about the cognitive state of the former president. Republicans want to prevent future presidents from relying on staff if they are potentially out of it. The GOP wants to construct legislative remedies to address a potential future executive who can't handle the job. House Oversight and Accountability Committee Chair James Comer speaks during a news conference. But we've been down this road before. Addressing a future impaired executive is a worthy exercise, but gazing backwards may be problematic for the GOP. Republicans don't really have a good Democratic foil right now. It also doesn't hurt Republicans politically to find out what former Vice President Kamala Harris knew. Same with former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Most anything else will likely pale in comparison to the Big, Beautiful Bill. And with the touchstone of President Trump's agenda now signed into law, Democrats are now determining how to weaponize it against Republicans in the fall of 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>First responders carry out search and rescue operations near the Guadalupe River after a flash flood swept through the area, Monday, July 7, 2025, in Ingram, Texas. Rescue workers are seen on land and on a boat as they search for missing people near Camp Mystic along the Guadalupe River after a flash flood swept through the area Sunday, July 6, 2025, in Hunt, Texas. INGRAM, Texas (AP) — Riding on horseback through brush and over numerous dead turkeys, Margo Mellon spent Tuesday scanning the flood-ravaged ground of Texas' Hill Country for dead bodies. As she and her rescue mates trudged through the muddy terrain, state officials announced that more than 160 people are still believed to be missing. The triumphs of finding people alive ended days ago, while the mission of recovering bodies that might include even more children is far from over. The grim undertaking has prompted questions about how first responders and rescue teams are able to mentally reckon with the work ahead. Mellon, a 24-year-old volunteer with search and recovery organization Texas EquuSearch that is a working with local fire departments, said for now she feels emotionally detached as she focuses on the task. “I'll try not to think about it too much,” she said. The flash floods deluged homes, campgrounds and an all-girls summer camp over Fourth of July weekend. More than 100 people have been killed, including 30 children. Colonel Ben Baker of the Texas Game Wardens said Tuesday at a news conference after taking a deep breath. “We're making sure they have the support,” Baker said of the search teams, adding that “to see a child in that loss of life is extremely tragic.” As the search for bodies continued Wednesday, teams zeroed in on piles of debris that created a bottleneck along the receding Guadalupe River. Jason Waldrip of the Kerr County Sheriff's Office said during a Wednesday news conference. “So as this material is being removed, we are looking for anything of a sign of a person that may be within this material.” Jonathan Lamb, a community services officer with Kerrville police, asked residents to let search parties check their properties before cleaning up “because it's possible there are victims in that debris pile.” The discussion about first responders' mental health likely wouldn't have occurred a generation ago, experts say. And while first responders have higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and other psychological health conditions, most are able to process the heavy realities of the job. “It's definitely not the goal that you are hoping for,” he said. “But just being able to give someone closure that their loved one was found can give us a sense of accomplishment. There are still people unaccounted for from Katrina.” “People will still continue to call for police. And having resources available to use, whether it be an anonymous help line or a sit-down with a mental health counselor.” A lot of it depends on what the first responder experienced previously, both on the job and off, she said. “For these responders who are working in Texas, it's probably not their first incident,” said Jacobowitz, who co-authored a report on the mental health needs of New York's first responders. “So what they're dealing with now is probably layered on top of what they have dealt with in the past. Stress from the job can show up through sleeplessness, flashbacks or introversion, Jacobowitz said, as well as feelings of “Could I have done more? But because many don't want to burden them with what they've seen, they also lean on each other and mental health professionals. “Not every traumatic incident turns into full-blown PTSD,” Jacobowitz said. “You may struggle with PTSD-like symptoms and then be able to work through them.” Rescue workers are seen on land and on a boat as they search for missing people near Camp Mystic along the Guadalupe River after a flash flood swept through the area Sunday, July 6, 2025, in Hunt, Texas. There's been a marked shift toward acknowledging the mental health challenges of the job, said Ian Stanley, a University of Colorado emergency medicine professor. But there's still a long way to go because the issue “hasn't been talked about for so long,” he said. Challenges include serving first responders who work for volunteer organizations or in rural areas where there are fewer mental health resources.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed that another four individuals were arrested for allegedly interfering with a federal immigration operation outside Los Angeles as law enforcement officers face increased attacks for enforcing the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda. The Department of Justice (DOJ), meanwhile, said it "is actively tracking these targeted assaults against our law enforcement and will hold offenders accountable to the fullest extent of the law." "Any official promoting anti-police rhetoric and encouraging reckless behavior should think twice before inciting further violence and putting federal agents in harm's way," a DOJ spokesperson told Fox News Digital. The incident happened while U.S. Border Patrol conducted what DHS categorized as a "target immigration enforcement operation" in Van Nuys, Calif., on Tuesday. A Border Patrol vehicle tire punctured by a "homemade" device with nails on Tuesday in Van Nuys, California. "DHS and its components continue to enforce the law every day in greater Los Angeles even in the face of danger," a DHS spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "During the operation, four U.S. citizens placed improvised tire deflation devices on the road and punctured a Border Patrol vehicle's tire. Agents were able to identify the suspects and placed them under arrest for obstructing law enforcement." "During the arrest, one individual assaulted a Border Patrol agent and was subsequently arrested for assaulting federal law enforcement," DHS added. "Our officers are facing a surge in assaults and attacks against them as they put their lives on the line to enforce our nation's laws. Secretary Noem has been clear: If you obstruct or assault our law enforcement, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law." Border Patrol agents arrested Jenaro-Ernesto Ayala, 43; Jude Jasmine Jeannine Allar, 28; Sadot Jarnica, 54; and Daniel Montenegro, 30, "for interfering with federal agents conducting immigration enforcement operations," Bovino said in an X post. "They are facing felony charges for placing homemade tire spikes to disable law enforcement vehicles. Anyone who interferes with our lawful mission will be arrested." All individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty," he added. Border Patrol agents arrested (left to right) Jenaro-Ernesto Ayala, 43; Jude Jasmine Jeannine Allard, 28; Sadot Jarnica, 54; and Daniel Montenegro, 30. Local outlets said nonprofit organization Instituto de Educacion Popular del Sur De California (IDEPSCA) identified Ayala and Allard as "day laborer advocates," or individuals who support people, including migrants, seeking short-term and informal jobs. The group claimed that the two men were arrested while exercising their legal right to observe and document the immigration raid and complained about federal agents tackling their advocates. Officials documented two homemade tire-deflating devices with metal nails. Fox News Digital has also reached out to IDEPSCA for more information. The incident comes as DHS has reported a 700% increase in attacks on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal immigration enforcement agents since President Donald Trump took office this year. A man wearing a utility vest and armed with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents and a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen, Texas, on Monday, authorities said. Ten individuals were charged in connection with a Fourth of July ambush outside a detention center in Alvarado, Texas, where a police officer was shot in the neck and other correctional officers came under fire, according to the DOJ. The DOJ has also been monitoring repeated attacks and sabotage attempts on an ICE facility in Portland, Ore., since June. Story tips can be sent to danielle.wallace@fox.com and on X: @danimwallace.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Scores missing: At least 150 people are known to be missing in Kerr County as a result of the flooding in central Texas, according to officials. At least a dozen others are missing in other parts of the state. • Emergency plan at camp: Two days before the flooding, a state inspector visited Camp Mystic, the youth camp where at least 27 died, and certified that it had an emergency plan in place, records obtained by CNN show. For ways to help those affected by the floods, visit CNN Impact Your World. Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas pushed back against a football analogy made by Gov. “In this case, I think there are accountability issues at every level of government.” At a news conference yesterday when asked who was to blame for the deadly flooding, Abbott said: “Every football team makes mistakes. The way winners talk is not to point fingers. A CNN review of typically off-the-record communications from a real-time messaging system operated by the NWS showed that no emergency manager from Kerr County was sending messages or interacting with NWS staff on the platform. However, the forecast offices for Austin-San Antonio and San Angelo “had extra personnel on duty during the catastrophic flooding event in Texas' Hill Country,” according to a NWS spokesperson. As floodwaters swept through the Texas Hill Country in the early hours of July 4, a local firefighter requested a CodeRED alert — a mass notification system used by some cities and counties to send emergency alerts to residents' phones — to warn the public, CNN affiliate KSAT reports. However, Kerr County officials took nearly six hours to send the alert, according to audio from a dispatcher obtained by a KSAT source familiar with the emergency notification for residents near Hunt. “Stand by, we have to get that approved with our supervisor,” a Kerr County Sheriff's Office dispatcher replied. When asked about the hours that passed between the firefighter's call and when the alert was issued, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said those questions would be answered in time. Neil Jacobs, the nominee to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said during his Senate confirmation hearing that if confirmed he would work to improve weather warning issuance and communications, referencing the deadly Texas floods. Jacobs said he would seek to improve the NOAA Weather Radio network and credited it with saving his own life during a camping trip in 1996. “We also need more data in doing post-storm assessments. One of the things that I've envisioned, because I've worked on several aviation accidents with NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board), is something along the lines of what they do, but for weather disasters, because we need the data to understand what went right, what went wrong, whether people got the warnings, if they did or didn't — and if they did, did they not understand them?” “I think we can do more advancements, moving away from copper wire, moving towards telecom, potentially satellite to send out these messages.” However, Jacobs also told senators he supports the president's budget proposal that would gut weather and climate research programs at NOAA. Some of these programs are designed to improve flash flood forecasting, among other hazards. This post has been updated with more comments from Jacobs at the hearing. Kerrville Mayor Joe Herring Jr. said Wednesday that he was not on a call with Texas state and local officials to discuss the weather forecast the day prior to the flooding on July 4. “I will tell you personally, I did not receive a call,” Herring said, noting that he could not speak for the county judge. “I was not invited to the call,” Herring said when pressed further. Dan Patrick said Friday that county mayors and city judges were invited to be on the daily call and that a regional coordinator personally reached out to local officials, The Associated Press reported. In the first hour as authorities responded to the flash floods that swept Texas Hill Country killing at least 119, police rescued over 200 people and evacuated over 100 homes, Kerrville Police Sgt. Jonathan Lamb said as he recalled the morning of July 4. “I don't know how many lives our KPD team saved in an hour in Kerrville, but I know that this tragedy, as horrific as it is, could have been so much worse,” Lamb said. One of those trapped people was a patrol sergeant leaving his home in Hunt, Texas, on his way to work in Kerrville. The flooding cut him off and he became stuck in Hunt, where he saw dozens of people trapped on roofs in the swift moving water, according to Lamb. The patrol sergeant, a Kerrville detective and some other first responders “provided care to that Hunt community,” Lamb said. At points they waded into the water to rescue people, got people off of roofs, provided first aid and cleared debris from the roads for emergency crews until other emergency workers could make their way into the area. In another situation, a lone Kerrville police officer realized a trailer park was quickly flooding and drove through the streets with his siren blaring, calling over his PA system to wake people up and tell them to evacuate, Lamb recounted. “Then two other officers joined through first thigh deep, then waist, then chest deep water as they went from RVs and trailers and rescued people, carrying them safety through the water,” Lamb said. In another part of the city, two people were trapped in flood water, clinging to a tree, when three officers responded by wrapping a 100 foot garden hose around an officer's waist to go into the water and rescue them, according to Lamb. “That doesn't even come close to explaining the actions that took place, door to door, waking people up, convincing them that, yes, the floodwaters are coming and you need to leave now,” Lamb said. Bill Venus, an Army veteran who went missing after the devastating Texas flooding, has been found dead, his son told CNN. I can't hold a candle to his accomplishments, but his primary goal was helping others, and I'll do that every opportunity I have,” Will Venus Jr. said in a text message. In an earlier post on Facebook, Venus Jr. said his father's car was found flipped over in Burnet, Texas, but he was not inside. Kourtney Rand, a volunteer in Ingram, Texas, who is using horses to assist with search and rescue missions in areas along the Guadalupe River that are difficult to reach on foot, spoke with CNN's Pamela Brown Tuesday. “We're getting down in places that normally people can't get to by foot, more harder terrain,” Rand said. Rand explained that horses can cross treacherous terrain, such as fast-moving water, much more quickly than humans. Rand's equine volunteer group is running search and rescue missions from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., and their horses are trained to work all day. When asked about the timeline for activating the Code Red Alert System in Kerr County during the overnight flooding emergency on July 4, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said those questions would be answered in time. “I'll go visit them twice a day,” he said. As of 8 a.m. Wednesday, 95 deaths have been reported in Kerr County, including 36 children, according to Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha. Officials report more than 150 people are missing in the Kerr County area, including five campers and one counselor from Camp Mystic. A news briefing with Kerr County officials is underway, where they are providing updates on search and rescue efforts. At least 161 people are still missing in the county after catastrophic flooding swept through central Texas. The vehicle is also known as an ambulance bus or multi-patient vehicle, according to the Texas Emergency Medical Task Force. These buses respond to mass casualty incidents and provide “advanced medical transport and evacuation services for a large-scale disaster,” according to the task force. Greg Abbott ordered Texas flags to be lowered to half-staff Wednesday in honor of the victims of the deadly flash floods that devastated parts of central Texas on July 4. “May God bring comfort to every family affected and strength to the thousands of first responders still working on the ground.” Flags will remain at half-staff until sunrise on Monday, July 14, according to the release. New before-and-after satellite images reveal the extensive destruction caused by catastrophic flooding in central Texas over the weekend. New before and after satellite images show the massive destruction left behind from catastrophic flooding in central Texas. Texas officials are facing heated questions from reporters and community members over how much was — or was not — done in the overnight hours of Friday as the Guadalupe River flooded, sweeping away buildings and people in its path. But five days after the flooding, officials still have not provided a clear timeline. At a briefing yesterday, several deflected or got defensive when asked about how Kerr County's response unfolded. As search efforts continue, questions linger about what happened during those crucial hours, if existing warning systems had worked and whether additional preparations before the flooding could have saved lives. At the local level, there's a key, three-hour gap where it's unclear if alerts sent by the National Weather Service were relayed to local officials; and at a summer-camp level, there are questions about policies that included banning cellphones and limiting walkie-talkie use, according to a counselor. These are the questions that still need to be answered: As rescue and recovery efforts continue in central Texas, climate scientists are stressing we will see extreme weather events like this more often as the planet heats up. Hear why Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at the nonprofit Climate Central, thinks federal cuts to climate science and weather office are hindering preparations for the future. Mission Mules, a Christian nonprofit organization that uses mules to provide disaster relief, arrived on scene of the flooding disaster in central Texas on Tuesday, going straight to work, founder Mike Toberer told CNN. A team of six mules have helped to get gear into tough locations for multiple chainsaw crews and have assisted in searches along the Guadalupe River since their arrival, according to the organization. The mules, who also assisted in recovery efforts after Hurricane Helene struck North Carolina, are able to climb what remains in the washed-out riverbed, which includes often large rocks, Toberer told CNN. Teams are still working through brutal heat and humidity today in the ongoing search for at least 170 people missing in Texas. Ryan Logue, an incident coordinator with the United Cajun Navy, a volunteer rescue and relief group, just spoke with CNN's Sara Sidner. His group is based on the Guadalupe River, downriver from several RV parks and campgrounds, which were likely filled for the Fourth of July holiday, Logue said. While teams are still looking for the missing, no one has been found alive since Friday. “I will never ever give up hope on a single soul that is out there, but at the same time if I'm somebody in their situation, had to live through what I've been living through the last couple days with this weather, it would be getting increasingly, increasingly harder to survive,” he said. A cabin at Camp La Junta was captured on video floating along the Guadalupe River on Friday during the catastrophic flooding event with camp staff inside. Stover, who was a camper at Camp La Junta in the 80s, says the cabin had four men inside, ages 19 to 22. The cabin was ripped off its foundation and floated along the waters for only about 30 seconds, according to Stover. Stover says he received a message from the camp that morning that all campers and staff were safe but when he saw the video he couldn't help but worry. “The stories of what they did for these kids are amazing.” This post has been updated with additional information. The family of Texas flood victim Tim Walker has confirmed his death. “I'm sharing a brief update here to thank the masses for getting the word out through my earlier post. My family and I are deeply moved by your support.” CNN spoke with Bronwyn Walker earlier and has reached out for more information. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has announced a 90-day freeze on foreclosures for Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-backed single-family mortgages in Kerr County, Texas, after devastating floods hit central Texas, killing more than 100 people. In Kerr County, the hardest-hit region, search efforts continue for more than 160 people still unaccounted for as of Tuesday. There are more than 900 FHA-insured mortgages in the declared disaster area for Kerr County, HUD said in its statement Tuesday. “HUD is working with mortgage servicers and others to assess the extent of properties with FHA-insured mortgages in the designated area that have been severely damaged or destroyed,” it said. “Our hearts break as we witness the catastrophe unfolding in Texas,” HUD Secretary Scott Turner said. It is an unfathomable tragedy, and HUD will continue to provide resources and support as we pray for the Texas Hill Country community.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democratic socialists in New York City emboldened by Zohran Mamdani's mayoral primary win are warning that they may go after five House incumbents next — and Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader at the top of their list, is daring them to try. Jeffries' political operation even has a nickname for those talking up threats to the House minority leader back home: “Team Gentrification.” That phrase reflects that Mamdani turned out young progressives who, according to unofficial election data, were largely Whiter and wealthier as a whole than the longtime residents of the districts represented by Jeffries and others being targeted. But it also speaks to the resentment many Democratic politicians in the nation's largest city — and in places around the country that aren't as deep-blue as New York — have at being told by Mamdani supporters there's a new reality that they now need to adapt to, and quickly. Mamdani's allies, notably key leaders of the Democratic Socialists of America, are talking about running primary challengers against Jeffries and several other incumbents, including Reps. Ritchie Torres, Jerry Nadler, Dan Goldman and Yvette Clarke. Mamdani's win, Siddique said, “feels full circle,” and for future races, “it's really proof of concept.” Those results don't yet reflect who primary voters ranked below their first choices. Jasmine Gripper, the co-chair of the local Working Families Party, which has been eagerly re-energized by Mamdani's win after years of flagging, also suggested some lawmakers could be newly vulnerable to primary challenges. At least so far, Mamdani is not getting in his allies' way. Asked whether Mamdani thinks those House incumbent challenges should happen — of if he'd make any moves to stop them — his press secretary told CNN he was declining to comment. The members of Congress themselves and close advisers say they all have the community ties, political operations and resources to fend off whatever may come at them. They diligently say that anyone can run in a democracy, but chuckle or roll their eyes at hearing of lines like Mamdani ally Bronx state senator Gustavo Rivera saying, “My colleagues in Congress that stood against us, they might have to watch out.” If Mamdani wins, they say, he'll have a hard enough time running the city without his ranks going to war with the city's congressional delegation. Jeffries will make an endorsement decision after he meets with the candidate in person next week. “Leader Hakeem Jeffries is focused on taking back the House from the MAGA extremists who just ripped health care away from millions of Americans,” Jeffries senior adviser André Richardson told CNN. “However, if Team Gentrification wants a primary fight, our response will be forceful and unrelenting. We will teach them and all of their incumbents a painful lesson on June 23, 2026.” “We are going to continue to focus our efforts … on pushing back against the extremism that has been unleashed on the American people,” Jeffries said. Last week, Jeffries held together every member of his conference against Trump's sweeping agenda bill, then topped off that opposition with a nearly nine-hour speech. But he has for years been tagged by the city's far left as a moderate. “His leadership has left a vacuum that organizations like DSA are filling. I think that is more important right now,” New York City's Democratic Socialists of America chapter co-chair Gustavo Gordillo told CNN. State Sen. Jabari Brisport, a democratic socialist who represents some of the same parts of Brooklyn as Jeffries, said his congressman is “rapidly growing out of touch with an insurgent and growing progressive base within his own district that he should pay more attention to.” Rep. Greg Meeks, who endorsed Andrew Cuomo in the mayor's race, called anyone thinking of a primary against Jeffries “foolish.” “We are all here to combat some of the craziness that Donald Trump is doing,” Meeks said. Aides to incumbents from New York City and their colleagues privately admit to looking over their shoulders since Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez beat then-Rep. Joe Crowley in a 2018 primary. Asked if he was worried now, Rep. Adriano Espaillat, a Cuomo backer who got to Congress after challenging longtime Rep. Charlie Rangel, said simply: “No.” He urged socialists to keep the peace as national Democrats try to win districts far from the Big Apple where democratic socialism has come off as more of an imposition than an inspiration. So far, only one House incumbent from New York City has endorsed Mamdani since he won: Nadler, the 17-term dean of the delegation who had stuck with Scott Stringer, his old protégé, despite a campaign that never took off. Nadler easily won a 2022 primary in a redrawn district against another incumbent, but even ardent supporters acknowledged he was struggling physically at points in that race. Nadler is now 78 and aware of rumors again circulating that his retirement is imminent, but he said he plans to run again — and “I'll put my record against anybody in terms of progressivism.” They're not going to get rid of everybody that's older than whatever, nor are they going to keep everybody,” he said during a break while Jeffries was delivering his record-setting speech against the Trump megabill's final passage last week. Several Nadler allies told CNN that they did not want to offend the beloved congressman by going public with their fears he might not be up to fending off a Democratic Socialists of America-driven challenge. But Nadler aides have been working with Mamdani's team to build up the new mayoral nominee's outreach into areas of Manhattan where he did not do well and among Jewish communities suspicious of the assemblyman's views on Israel and what many say has been an insufficient condemnation of antisemitism. Efforts are underway to urge Lander into a Goldman challenge, but people who know the city comptroller say he's been more focused on helping Mamdani and potentially serving in a top position in City Hall. Clarke, whose district was almost evenly split between Mamdani and Cuomo, said anyone who sees what happened in the mayoral primary as the dawn of a new age in New York is getting ahead of themselves. The conversation went well, she said, as other members told CNN theirs did. The Mamdani ripple may not just be in primaries: Justin Brannan, who placed second for city comptroller on the same primary ballot that Mamdani carried, says the results have him taking another look at challenging Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, the lone Republican member from New York City, in a district covering Staten Island and Brooklyn which has trended increasingly Republican. “I'm like, ‘Guys, just take the ferry to Staten Island – there's a swing district here. Jamaal Bowman, who beat an incumbent to win a seat stretching from the Bronx to just north of the city in 2020 only to lose it to a challenger himself in 2024, said he's now constantly getting pitched on running against Torres, a progressive who has nonetheless enraged many Mamdani supporters for both being a staunch supporter of Israel and then endorsing Cuomo. Mamdani posted some of his weakest numbers in that district, with less than 33% compared to Cuomo's 52%. “Everyone in New York has to recalibrate their stuff,” Bowman said. Several members of the congressional delegation, meanwhile, have noted privately that Mamdani never himself expressed support for former Vice President Kamala Harris when she became the Democratic presidential nominee last year. Torres declined to address on the record how he'd marshal his significant campaign fundraising and support on the ground if faced with a challenge next year. Though Torres said the mayoral primary results were enough to end his flirtation with a primary challenge of his own to New York Gov. “The thought of Paperboy Prince keeps me up at night,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump, left, listens as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick speaks with reporters before boarding Air Force One at Morristown Municipal Airport in Morristown, N.J., Sunday, July 6, 2025, en route to Washington. The National Weather Service monitoring station is seen in Brownville, Texas, May 23, 2014. The billionaire also ran a financial firm, which he recently left in the control of his adult sons, that stands to benefit if President Donald Trump's administration follows through on a decade-long Republican effort to privatize government weather forecasting. Deadly weekend flooding in central Texas has drawn a spotlight to budget cuts and staff reductions at the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, two agencies housed within the Commerce Department that provide the public with free climate and weather data that can be crucial during natural disasters. What's drawn less attention is how the downsizing appears to be part of an effort to privatize the work of such agencies. Privatization would diminish a central role the federal government has played in weather forecasting since the 1800s, which experts say poses a particular harm for those facing financial strain who may not be able to afford commercial weather data. “It's the most insidious aspect of this: Are we really talking about making weather products available only to those who can afford it?” said Rick Spinrad, who served as NOAA administrator under President Joe Biden, a Democrat. The White House referred requests for comment to the Commerce Department, which said in a statement that Lutnick has “fully complied with the terms of his ethics agreement with respect to divesture and recusals and will continue to do so.” Privatizing weather agencies has long been an aim of Republicans. During Trump's first presidency, he signed a bill that utilized more private weather data. Lutnick is not the only one Trump nominated for a key post with close relationships to companies involved in the gathering of vital weather data. Trump's pick to lead the NOAA, Neil Jacobs, was chief atmospheric scientist for Panasonic Weather Solutions and has been a vocal proponent of privatization.

President Donald Trump speaks as he receives a briefing on the 2020 hurricane season in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, May 28, 2020, in Washington with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Neil Jacobs, assistant Secretary of Commerce for Environmental Observation and Prediction, and Pete Gaynor, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Elon Musk, the world's richest man, who spent more than $250 million to help elect Trump, owns a controlling interest in SpaceX and its satellite subsidiary Starlink. SpaceX also stands to gain through a new generation of private and federally funded weather satellites that would be carried into orbit on its rockets. Though Musk has now departed Washington and had a very public falling out with Trump, the DOGE staffers he hired and the cuts he pushed for have largely remained in place. Emails seeking comment sent to a lawyer who has represented Musk, as well as to media contacts at his companies X and SpaceX, received no response. While Musk is focusing on his companies, others with potential conflicts remain immersed in government work. Lutnick resigned as CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, an investing behemoth, upon taking office and began the arduous task of divesting his interests, as required by law. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick walks through a corridor at the Senate as Republicans work to advance President Donald Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill, at the Capitol in Washington, Friday, June 27, 2025. An ethics plan submitted in February states Lutnick would request a waiver allowing him to participate in matters that would have a “direct and predictable effect” on his family's business while he was still divesting. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, meanwhile, show Lutnick has agreements to transfer his shares in the Cantor companies and a family trust to his son Brandon. The Department of Commerce referred questions about Lutnick's ties to Satellogic, a satellite company that offers natural disaster imagery, to his former firm. Cantor spokesperson Erica Chase said that since Lutnick's resignation from the company, he has not made any decisions with respect to the company's investments or customer positions, or other operational matters. “Cantor and its subsidiaries operate in heavily regulated industries, and maintain robust compliance programs to ensure compliance with all applicable laws,” Chase said. Federal officials are barred from making decisions that benefit the business holdings of themselves or their spouses, but that prohibition does not extend to assets held by their adult children, according to Richard Painter, who served as the chief White House ethics lawyer during Republican George W. Bush's administration. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick speaks during a Senate Appropriations hearing, Wednesday, June 4, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington. Among its legion of disparate businesses, Cantor has interests in weather and climate. It owns a controlling interest in BGC Group, which operates a weather derivatives marketplace that essentially allows investors to bet on climate risk and where hurricanes will make landfall. Lutnick also played a pivotal role in cultivating Satellogic. The company now bills itself as an emerging federal contractor that can offer crisp images of natural disasters and weather events in real time, which in 2021 Lutnick said makes it “uniquely positioned to dominate the Earth Observation industry.” While Lutnick was still in charge of Cantor, it paid a $6.75 million fine to the SEC after it was accused of making misleading statements to investors about Satellogic and another company. Satellogic stands to benefit if the government retreats from operating climate-monitoring satellites. He is scheduled to appear Wednesday before a Senate committee weighing his nomination. President Donald Trump, center, walks to board Air Force One as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, left, looks on at Morristown Municipal Airport in Morristown, N.J., Sunday, July 6, 2025, en route to Washington. He also has expressed concerns about what happens to commercial data purchased by the government. He was a consultant at the time for Spire Global and Lynker, both of which have millions of dollars in weather data contracts with the NOAA, according to records including his most recent financial disclosure. Jordan, Trump's pick for another top NOAA post, has similarly close relationships. His financial disclosure lists more than a dozen weather-related lobbying clients, including Spire and Lynker. He also represented AccuWeather, a commercial forecast provider, before Congress and in meetings with the Commerce Department on “issues related to private sector weather forecast improvement,” according to lobbying disclosures. Though his nomination is pending before the Republican-controlled Senate, disclosure reports show he still represents weather and space companies and is still listed as a principal employee at a Washington lobbying firm.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's not often the iconic Argentine club that the legendary Diego Maradona once played for gets “schooled” yet it happened and it's a lesson we can all learn from. As some of the biggest names in soccer gather this week in New Jersey for the semifinals and final of the FIFA Club World Cup, watching on from over 8,000 miles away in New Zealand will be very one interested spectator. Christian is a trainee physical education teacher who just happens to have scored what he's calling the goal of his life – a thundering header against the mighty Boca Juniors which counts Uruguayan icon Edinson Cavani amongst its ranks. It was one of just six goals Gray has scored in four years for the Kiwi side. You know, I don't often score goals, but to score in that game was like a surreal moment. But I think by the time I processed it, my teammate Myer Bevan was on my back, jumped on my back, and we were having a big group hug.” After such a historic result for last year's Oceania Champions League winners, there was some time for celebration – though not a lot. We then had a 30-hour trip all the way back to New Zealand. Fortunately, it's a school holiday, so there's no school, but I still have my assignments to do,” Gray said. Gray returns to his day job July 14 at Auckland Grammar School where a hero's welcome awaits him. “From what I've heard, the school was buzzing for me. I know the boys and how passionate they are about their sport and their football, so I'm sure they'll be pretty happy,” he said to CNN Sports. “There's a lot of learnings from this tournament, I think. You know, the whole underdog story and anything's possible if you believe in yourself, these kinds of things. For Auckland City, the headline-grabbing draw with Boca Juniors was especially satisfying given a 10-0 defeat to European heavyweight Bayern Munich then a 6-0 loss to Portugal's Benfica earlier in the tournament. Related article Meet the amateur New Zealand team aiming to topple soccer's biggest names at the FIFA Club World Cup But, you know, the club has a proud and successful history. A world away from some of the multi-millionaire professionals they faced at the Club World Cup, Auckland City's squad comprises real estate agents, other teachers, soda salesmen and a barber. A typical day for Christian can begin at around 6:30 a.m. and end after 9 p.m. once teaching duties, coaching the school's senior soccer squad and his own training and fitness are taken care of. Missing out on the Club World Cup though was simply not an option. “A lot of the boys and I have taken unpaid leave to travel, and saying that, we're fortunate to have these opportunities. I think all the hard work and sacrifice, paid off, I think it's fair to say,” he said. The total prize money at this year's newly revamped 32-team Club World Cup is $1 billion. By qualifying for the tournament and securing a draw against Boca Juniors, Auckland earned over $4.5 million, yet it remains to be seen to what extent the club itself will benefit from a boost in finances. Currently there is a dispute between our club and New Zealand Football on the subject,” Auckland City General Manager Gordon Watson told CNN Sports. “I don't have a crystal ball, unfortunately, so I can't provide a satisfying answer to your question.” New Zealand Football told CNN in a statement: “While the exact amounts are commercially sensitive, a portion of the FIFA Club World Cup prize money goes to Auckland City FC and an amount is also allocated to support the sustainability of clubs in our National League system.” “99 percent of players and clubs on this planet are amateur, and we felt that in many ways we represented all of them. This has been our message ever since we qualified. “Firstly, Christian is such an understated person, the attention he's garnered must be uncomfortable for him to a degree. “We were favorites to finish 32nd out of 32, but there were five professional clubs that each finished below us, which when you think of their resources versus ours, is incredible. As for Gray, he says he's dedicating his goal to the wider Auckland City FC community and all who support the team. And keep this in mind: We could well be hearing his name mentioned for years to come. After all, not only are his exploits against Boca Juniors sure to live long in the memory, they're also worthy of trivia nights too. So, to have my name as one of them, potentially, it would be pretty cool!”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr. Kevin O'Connor, who was former President Joe Biden's physician, invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during a deposition on Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee. O'Connor entered the Rayburn House Office Building hearing room at 9:36 a.m. and didn't take any questions from reporters. He exited shortly after at 10:31 a.m., holding a Diet Coke. “It's clear there was a conspiracy to cover up President Biden's cognitive decline after Dr. Kevin O'Connor, Biden's physician and family business associate, refused to answer any questions and chose to hide behind the Fifth Amendment,” House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) said. O'Connor's brief deposition follows Neera Tanden's appearance for a daylong interview before the Oversight Committee's majority and minority counsel last month. Former President Joe Biden's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, entered his closed-door, transcribed interview with the House Oversight Committee at 9:36 a.m. The last interview, with Neera Tanden, took over four hours. O'Connor took the Fifth when asked if he was told to lie about President Biden's health and whether he was fit to be president of the United States,” Comer said. “Congress must assess legislative solutions to prevent such a cover-up from happening again. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) told reporters that O'Connor's decision to invoke the Fifth Amendment should not be seen as a sign of guilt but rather reality, as the House, Senate, and the Department of Justice have all opened investigations into Biden's health. “He did what any good lawyer would advise him to do, and it seems like he had two good lawyers in the room today,” Crockett told reporters. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have slammed the Biden investigation as a distraction from more pressing issues, such as looming Medicaid and food assistance reductions included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. President Donald Trump waived executive privilege the night before O'Connor's closed-door hearing. O'Connor's lawyers sent a request Saturday to delay his deposition before the counsel, saying the doctor could face “serious consequences” for violating his obligations as a physician, including losing his medical license. “We are unaware of any prior occasion on which a Congressional Committee has subpoenaed a physician to testify about the treatment of an individual patient,” the physician's lawyers wrote. Comer told the Washington Examiner last month that no interviews will be released before all of them have concluded. Transcribed interviews are typically conducted by committee staff over several hours, and both parties are granted extended time for questioning, compared to the five-minute increments afforded to members during publicly televised hearings. Interviews are set to take place until Aug. 7, with former Jill Biden aide Anthony Bernal scheduled to appear on July 16 for a deposition after being subpoenaed for refusing to appear before the committee to testify as part of its investigation, following the White House telling the witnesses they were not protected by executive privilege.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How Joseph Kurihara lost his faith in America A week earlier, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had signed Executive Order 9066, authorizing military commanders to designate areas from which “any or all persons may be excluded.” The order made no mention of race, but its target was clear: people who were ethnically Japanese. Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. Kurihara watched as children cried in the street and peddlers bought air-conditioning units and pianos from evacuating families for prices he described as “next to robbery.” Before long, the chaos Kurihara witnessed on Terminal Island was playing out elsewhere. In March, Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt, the head of the Western Defense Command, began using Roosevelt's executive order to exclude all people “of Japanese ancestry” from large swaths of the West Coast. The military forced Kurihara and more than 125,000 others from their homes, confining them to a circuit of remote prison camps. Many Japanese Americans attempted to demonstrate their loyalty to the United States through stoic acceptance of the government's orders. Some even volunteered to fight for the country that had imprisoned them: The 442nd Regimental Combat Team and 100th Infantry Battalion, a segregated Army unit of Japanese Americans, became the most decorated military unit in American history (relative to its size and length of service), fighting the Nazis through Italy and into France. This was the narrative of “Japanese internment” that reigned among my father's generation. When my grandmother was 20, she and her family were uprooted from Los Angeles and sent to a barbed-wire-enclosed camp in Heart Mountain, Wyoming, for nearly a year; my grandfather volunteered for the 442nd from Hawaii and was wounded by a grenade fragment in northern Italy. I didn't have to think too hard about what had happened at Terminal Island or Heart Mountain, or what either said about America. Kurihara, though, was unwilling to ignore the gap between his country's stated principles and its actions. He had always believed in democracy, he wrote, but what he saw at Terminal Island demonstrated that “even democracy is a demon in time of war.” During the years he spent incarcerated, shuttled through a succession of punitive detention sites, his doubts festered. He had already served in a war for the United States, and still the country accused him of disloyalty. The care package, it seemed, had meant a lot. “I hereby most sincerely thank you for the generous package you have sent us Soldier Boys,” Kurihara wrote to the Red Cross chapter of Hurley, Wisconsin. “By the name you will note that I am a Japanese,” his letter continued, “but just the same I'm an American. His parents had emigrated from Japan as plantation workers, joining a cohort that came to be known as the issei, or first generation of the Japanese diaspora. Kurihara and his four siblings were nisei, members of the second generation. After Hawaii was seized by the United States in 1898, Kurihara and others born in the islands were granted U.S. citizenship. From the January 2025 issue: Adrienne LaFrance on what America owes Hawai‘i There, his biographer, Eileen Tamura, notes, he was shocked to discover widespread antipathy toward Asians. Once, as Kurihara walked through central Sacramento, a man approached and kicked him in the stomach. Elsewhere in the city, children pelted him with rocks. A friend told Kurihara that midwesterners were more tolerant, so he moved to Michigan. After the war, Kurihara settled in Los Angeles, working as an accountant and then as a navigator on fishing boats. When Pearl Harbor was attacked, he was more than 3,000 miles south of California, plying the waters off the Galápagos Islands for tuna. The ship returned to San Diego Bay just after daybreak on December 29 and found a country at war. Suddenly out of a job, he sought work that might aid the war effort. But at shipbuilding and steel yards, he was rebuffed for being Japanese. But nisei leaders in the Japanese American community were taking a different tack. At a meeting of a group affiliated with the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL), an ardently pro-American civil-rights organization, Kurihara heard Mike Masaoka, the group's national secretary, tell the attendees that he had met with DeWitt and urged that they comply with his orders. Japanese Americans of my grandparents' generation tend to refer to the period that followed as “camp”—just “camp”—cloaking it in a protective shield of euphemism. Regardless of their name, though, the sites had a clear function: They were open-air prisons. Built on 6,200 acres of desert at the base of the Sierra Nevada mountains in eastern California, Manzanar held about 10,000 Japanese Americans at its peak. They were crammed into 504 plywood barracks, fenced in by barbed wire and guard towers. Families each received a 20-by-25-foot room; bachelors like Kurihara were assigned roommates. Aware that he'd wind up there anyway and tempted by the promise of work, Kurihara reluctantly agreed, helping build the camp that would imprison him. In Focus: World War II internment of Japanese Americans Construction was still ongoing when incarcerees began to arrive in April. At meetings held during the summer of 1942, Kurihara delivered a series of speeches—“dynamites,” he later called them—meant to “bomb the Manzanar Citizens Federation out of existence.” To one rapturous crowd he exclaimed, “If we must prove our loyalty to enjoy the full privileges of American citizens, then why and for what reasons are the Japanese American veterans of World War I doing here? Have they not proven their loyalty already?” The people at Manzanar were incarcerated not because they were “unloyal,” he argued. Then, if such is the case, let us be Japs! In her book Impossible Subjects, the historian Mae Ngai argues that the experience of internment ultimately fostered in many Japanese Americans what the removal orders had been meant to contain: disloyalty. The next day, thousands of Ueno's supporters rallied outside the mess hall, where Kurihara accused Tayama and other JACL leaders of informing on incarcerees deemed insufficiently pro-American to camp administrators and the FBI. When negotiations with camp administrators over Ueno's release collapsed, a crowd mobilized to free him from the camp's jail and hunt down Tayama and the others Kurihara had condemned. At the jail, military police deployed tear gas to disperse them. Amid the smoke, two soldiers fired live rounds. Kurihara, it turned out, was correct—Tayama and the others he'd identified had been reporting “pro-Japanese” incarcerees to camp administrators and the FBI. Finally, they landed at a camp called Tule Lake, in remote Northern California, where they were initially held in a stockade. Devastated by the deaths of the two men, Kurihara swore off camp politics and spent most of his time alone, reading his Bible and studying Japanese, a language he'd never mastered. On December 8, 1945, as an American bomber circled overhead, Kurihara and some 1,500 other Japanese Americans stepped off a naval transport ship at Uraga, a port on Tokyo Bay. As the war had stretched on and the American government's legal authority to incarcerate Japanese Americans had worn thin, Congress had passed a law to allow them to renounce their citizenship; the government had greater leeway to detain and even deport noncitizens under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Only a small minority of those incarcerated took the government up on its offer. From Uraga, Kurihara traveled to the village of Oshima, where his older sister Kawayo had relocated from Hawaii in 1920. Oshima was about 36 miles across a bay from Hiroshima; on August 6, Kawayo may have felt the shock wave from the first atomic bomb. Not wanting to burden her family, Kurihara moved to Sasebo, a city in the Nagasaki prefecture about 30 miles from where the second atomic bomb had been dropped. These jobs offered relatively high pay—and guaranteed access to food. It's unclear whether Kurihara lingered on the irony of his position. In his correspondence back to the United States, he acknowledged no regrets. “Here I am in Sasebo, working for the Occupational Forces and am doing exceedingly well,” he wrote in a 1946 letter to Dorothy Thomas, a sociologist he had met at Tule Lake. His time working for the military proved short-lived. The occupation needed people who could translate complex legal documents; Kurihara's abilities were likely insufficient. After a year in Sasebo, he moved to Tokyo and resumed work as an accountant. He and other repatriates stuck out in postwar Japan. Many were referred to by a racial epithet Kurihara likely never would have heard directed at him before: keto, Japanese for “white man.” In April 1949, David Itami, a fellow nisei who had also worked for the occupation, wrote a letter to Dorothy Thomas to see if something might be done on Kurihara's behalf. But he hadn't forgiven the United States. He died of a stroke in Tokyo on November 26, 1965. Mike Masaoka and the JACL seemed to win their debate with Kurihara. Not long after Pearl Harbor, Masaoka had proposed that the Army create a “suicide battalion” of nisei volunteers to fight for the U.S. while their parents were held as hostages in the camps. Speaking at its discharge in 1946, President Harry Truman suggested that the 442nd had affirmed that “Americanism is not a matter of race or creed; it is a matter of the heart.” He continued: “You fought not only the enemy, but you fought prejudice—and you have won.” Pronouncements like Truman's bolstered a narrative of internment as America's “worst wartime mistake,” as the Yale Law professor Eugene Rostow argued in Harper's in 1945. Remembering it as a mistake, rather than as the result of decades of policy that had excluded Asian immigrants from public life in America, allowed those who had experienced it to move on and ascend into middle-class life. If they shared Kurihara's sense of betrayal, they didn't express it and instead worked to rebuild their lives in the United States. My grandfather kept his Purple Heart tucked away in his sock drawer; my grandmother never spoke of her time at Heart Mountain. As historians came to question the triumphalist story of Japanese American history and activists lobbied for redress from the U.S. government, some came to celebrate Kurihara as a resistance icon. Others couldn't look past the death threats he made at Manzanar. Writing in the Japanese American newspaper Hokubei Mainichi in 1983, Elaine Yoneda, who had been incarcerated with Kurihara at Manzanar, called him “an embittered manipulator who helped turn some camp residents' frustrations into a pro-Japan cause.” Kurihara had named her husband a “stool pigeon”; on the night of the Manzanar Uprising, Yoneda and her son had barricaded themselves in their barrack, fearing for their lives. Harry Ueno, though, continued to defend his ally. Ueno had renounced his citizenship, but when he heard about the dire conditions in Japan, he fought to remain in the U.S. “Deep in his heart,” Ueno wrote, “he cried a hundred times for the country he once loved and trusted and fought for.” In February, I traveled to Washington, D.C., with my parents and two of my siblings to see a book, called the Ireichō, that lists every Japanese American who had been incarcerated. Gathered in its pages were those who had renounced their citizenship alongside those who had volunteered for the 442nd. Tayama, Yoneda, Ueno, and Kurihara, together just as they had been at Manzanar. In a small room off the Culture Wing of the National Museum of American History, we placed a neat row of blue dots beneath my grandmother's name—Misao Hatakeyama—and that of her brother, Kimio, and parents, Yasuji and Kisaburo, and a neighbor my father had grown up with in L.A., and her brother, who had been killed in Italy with the 442nd in April 1945, only days before Germany's surrender. I wonder what my grandmother might have thought of Kurihara, or if my grandfather would have welcomed him at the veterans' table. But I think they might have understood his anger at the country that had broken his trust, that had practiced values so different from the ones it proclaimed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE — Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley said he and the “entire Republican universe” would back Lara Trump should she decide to enter the 2026 race for North Carolina's United States Senate seat, but he didn't close the door on a possible run of his own. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) last month announced he would not seek reelection next year amid public sparring with President Donald Trump regarding the reconciliation bill. Whatley, who chaired North Carolina's state Republican Party before taking over the RNC, has also been floated as a Tillis successor. If Lara Trump is going to be interested, then she is certainly going to have the entire Republican universe, myself included, that are going to coalesce behind her,” he stated. “And if not, we'll work with the president, and we'll figure out who the best candidate is to be able to win there.” “I've been the chair down there for five years. I've worked with the president through three different presidential election cycles. In addition to Tillis, former Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced earlier this year that he will retire and not seek reelection in 2026. Whatley seemed to indicate Monday that the biggest challenge in defending the current map next year, in addition to picking up Senate seats in Georgia and Michigan possibly, is that Trump simply won't be on the ballot. “The biggest challenge that we have at the RNC right now is taking all of these Trump voters and converting them into Republican voters,” he explained.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Abrego Garcia has not been convicted on human smuggling charges, legal experts say the high court's orders on June 23 and Thursday, respectively, make clear that people with final orders of removal can be deported to countries other than the one they originally selected or, in Abrego Garcia's case, other than the one barred by a prior court decision — regardless of whether they have served criminal sentences. Under the current statutory framework, Arthur said, federal authorities still cannot send Abrego Garcia and illegal immigrants in similar situations to countries for which they have withholding removal orders, “but you can send them anywhere [else] you want.” Abrego Garcia, who was deported to El Salvador in March despite a 2019 order prohibiting his return there, was returned to the U.S. after federal charges were brought against him in Tennessee for human smuggling. A magistrate judge in that case has ruled that he may be released pending his trial, but his defense attorneys requested he remain in jail, citing Department of Homeland Security threats that he would be sent to a country different from his homeland if released. “There's no intention to just put him in limbo in ICE custody while we wait for the criminal case to unfold,” DOJ attorney Jonathan Guynn said. “He will be removed, as would any other illegal alien in that process.” Legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Bill Shipley wrote for his Substack blog Monday that the judge in Maryland has no authority to interfere in the implementation of Abrego Garcia's final removal order, even if that means he ends up in a country far from his birthplace. “Congress EXPLICITLY set forth what ‘judicial review' is authorized by statute in matters involving the [Immigration and Nationality Act],” Shipley wrote, citing 8 U.S.C. “These criminal illegal aliens sent to Sudan were so heinous even their own countries would not take them back,” McLaughlin said. “If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, you could end up in CECOT, Alligator Alcatraz, Guantanamo Bay, or South Sudan, or another third country.” The DOJ would not move forward with its prosecution of Abrego Garcia if he gets deported, Arthur said. “If he ends up leaving, they'll just drop the case.” “There are hundreds per day of people that they pick up who are facing pending criminal charges at the state level … who they opt to deport in lieu of conviction,” Arthur said. “If he gets cut loose,” they will seek his deportation. Abrego Garcia remains in criminal custody in Tennessee, with a hearing set for July 16 to determine whether he will be released to ICE custody. “There is no role left for Judge Xinis to play in the outcome of the Immigration and Nationality Act proceedings that will determine his destination,” he wrote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We will hold DHS accountable,” Mohammad Tajsar, ACLU senior staff attorney, said in the statement. On Tuesday, officials from Los Angeles and several cities in the surrounding county said they were joining the effort “to challenge the unlawful immigration enforcement activities … which have included the federal government's targeting of the Los Angeles area and of Angelenos based on their race and ethnicity and denying constitutionally-mandated due process to those detained,” a statement from Los Angeles City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto said. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass joins CNN's Dana Bash to discuss the massive "No Kings" protests in her city, as well as L.A.'s standoff with President Trump over immigration. Mayor Bass: ‘Disruption and fear' caused by immigration raids having a ‘devastating effect' on L.A. “We as jurisdiction, not only support our residents in stopping these unconstitutional practices, but we in effect assert our own rights under the 10th Amendment and as jurisdictions that have, ultimately, local control over our police powers,” Feldstein Soto said at a news conference Tuesday. “These unconstitutional roundups and raids cannot be allowed to continue,” Feldstein Soto added. CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on the lawsuit. “Any claims that individuals have been ‘targeted' by law enforcement because of their skin color are disgusting and categorically FALSE,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement after the lawsuit was filed, the Los Angeles Times reported. “DHS enforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence,” she said. The lawsuit comes after President Donald Trump ordered the deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles last month in response to protests against his administration's immigration raids. Trump claimed local leaders lost control of the city and military intervention was required to restore peace – accusations Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Bass said the immigration raids, which have been taking place at homes and businesses across the Los Angeles area since June 6, create a safety problem. “You have a situation now where people are walking down the street, a car will pull up, no license plate, men will jump out completely masked, pull guns on whoever it is and take them away,” Bass said at the news conference Tuesday. The announcement comes a day after Bass confronted heavily armed federal agents and the National Guard marching through MacArthur Park near downtown Los Angeles. “Our city is definitely united … We are a city of immigrants, and we will stand united with Angelenos regardless of what country they came from, when they got here or why they're here,” Bass said Tuesday. Last month, the Trump administration called for ICE to expand deportation efforts in Democratic cities and “do all in their power” to achieve mass deportations – a key campaign promise touted as a public safety and national security concern. Officials and business leaders in Los Angeles say the administration's immigration raids have already had economic impacts, disrupting key industries and hitting consumer sentiment.

President Donald Trump expressed his happiness over the renaming of a 4-mile stretch of Southern Boulevard in Palm Beach County to “President Donald J. Trump Boulevard.”

On Tuesday, the Palm Beach County commissioners unanimously approved the measure after Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) signed a bill authorizing the change last month. Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence is located along the boulevard.

“It has been brought to my attention that the Great State of Florida, which I won BIG three times, and where I am a proud Resident, has renamed an important four-mile stretch of Southern Boulevard, in Palm Beach County, to ‘PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP BOULEVARD,'” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

“Thank you to Palm Beach County, Governor Ron DeSantis, and all of Florida's great State Lawmakers, on granting me this wonderful honor! I LOVE FLORIDA!” he added.

The bill to redesignate the road also changed the name of another part of the Palm Beach County road to “PBSO Motorman Highway” in honor of three law enforcement officers killed in an SUV crash in November.

FLORIDA LEADS STATES IN CARRYING OUT TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION MISSION

The boulevard's renaming still has two final hurdles before becoming official: It must be approved by the city of West Palm Beach and the town of Palm Beach, through which the road runs.

The renaming reflects Florida's decisive rightward turn over the past several years, a far cry from its previous purple status.</p>
