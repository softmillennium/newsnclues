                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>William Ruto accuses protesters of terrorism and violence two days after 31 people killed in anti-government demonstrations “Those who attack our police, those who attack our security men and women, those who attack our security installations, including police stations, that is a declaration of war, that is terrorism,” he said. We cannot have a nation that is run by terror. We cannot have a nation that is governed by violence. “This country will not be destroyed by a few people who are impatient and who want to have a change of government using unconstitutional means. The demonstrations began in June last year as a youth-led movement against a proposed tax increase, and quickly widened to encompass calls for reform and Ruto's resignation. Police killings and abductions have done little to assuage public anger. On occasion, protests have degenerated into looting and violence by some protesters, with thousands of businesses destroyed. Ruto's latest comments echo an order to police from the interior minister, Kipchumba Murkomen, two weeks ago to shoot people who approach police stations “with criminal intent”. Opposition leaders, including Ruto's former deputy and ally Rigathi Gachagua, have accused the government of unleashing “hostile” state-sponsored violence against its citizens. On Tuesday, they called on the public to “boycott all businesses, services and institutions owned, operated or publicly linked to this regime and its enablers”. Ruto's allies have accused Gachagua of bankrolling violent protests, which he has denied. Gachagua also dismissed Ruto's claims of a plot to overthrow the government, saying on Wednesday: “We want to remove you … through the ballot in 2027.” Observers say that Ruto has to endear himself both to a disillusioned public and to younger Kenyans – a strong-willed and defiant generation born after the restoration of multiparty democracy who benefited from free primary education that started in 2003, and who have been leading the push for change since last year. The UN said it was “deeply troubled” over the deaths during this week's protests and that “intentional lethal force by law enforcement officers, including with firearms, should only be used when strictly necessary to protect life from an imminent threat”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exclusive: US president's former chief strategist calls for independent involvement in case Steve Bannon has called for a special prosecutor to investigate the Epstein files as Maga world's noisiest voices cause trouble for Donald Trump with political wrangling over the issue. Dissenting voices are heaping pressure on the Trump administration to release everything it knows about Jeffrey Epstein and his associates. Senior administration officials, who had long promised to expose hidden facts about the paedophile, suddenly this week announced they had nothing more to share. Mr Bannon, former chief strategist to Mr Trump, said there was a straightforward process for releasing sensitive court documents and told The Telegraph that a special prosecutor – often appointed in complex cases or ones with a potential for a conflict of interest – could get to the bottom of who else was involved in Epstein's crimes. Mr Bannon devoted a chunk of his influential WarRoom TV show to the issue on Wednesday morning, illustrating how it continues to exercise a huge swathe of the Trump base. They include Kash Patel, now director of the FBI, and his deputy Dan Bongino. In February, Pam Bondi, Mr Trump's attorney general, was asked whether the department of justice would release a list of Epstein's clients, amid claims that powerful paedophiles were being protected. She answered: “It's sitting on my desk right now to review.” This guy's been talked about for years,” he said. “The reason no one wanted to sign it, in my view, was because at its heart it's an attack on president Trump's supporters,” he told Mr Bannon's WarRoom TV show. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Republican congresswoman from Georgia, said she remained loyal to Mr Trump and that there was nothing disloyal in asking questions about the base. “We, the American people are fed up with… being lied to, or told a narrative that's not true, and that's what this election was about, not only in 2016 but again, in 2020 and 2024,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ron Duke treasured the Guadalupe River more than anything. So did Holly Frizzell, 72, who in recent years – after the ones she devoted to caring for her ailing husband – found “peace, joy, and reflection” along the Guadalupe. But the Guadalupe River, named in 1689 by Spanish explorers for a revered apparition of the mother of Jesus Christ, also long has held a quiet fury that can unleash powerful, often deadly flooding in a matter of just minutes. That rage unleashed again last week when, instead of Kerrville's planned annual Fourth on the River celebration at Louise Hays Park, more than a summer's worth of rain fell on bone-dry soil overnight into Independence Day, creating a deluge that pushed the Guadalupe from about 3 feet to 30 feet in just 45 minutes. The state's deadliest freshwater flooding in more than a century quickly killed more than 100 people – including Frizzell, a heroic father, camp leaders and dozens of children – while ripping through homes, businesses and cabins. The Guadalupe River “was our best friend,” said CNN's Pamela Brown, who as a child bunked along it in some of the same Camp Mystic cabins from which hundreds of girls last week had to be rescued – and several are still missing. But last week, she added, “it turned into an enemy for these sweet kids.” Parents dropping off yet another generation of daughters, some as young as 7, a few days earlier for the season's second session didn't know many good-byes would be their last. When floods come, “steep topography produces rapidly rising river stages,” the agency adds, giving people who live and play along the Guadalupe scant warning. A memorial at Kerr County's Pot O' Gold Ranch youth camp honors the 10 teenagers killed in 1987 when train-effect storms pushed the Guadalupe River up 29 feet in a single morning. Since then, efforts in Kerr County to build a more substantial flood warning system have been discussed – but have faltered or been abandoned due to budget concerns, leaving the epicenter of last week's floods without emergency sirens to warn residents about rising waters. How the catastrophic Texas flooding unfolded, in maps and charts While the National Weather Service issued numerous warnings early Friday morning as the danger along the Guadalupe River increased, it's not clear how well they reached remote areas and how factors from reception quality to personal phone settings came into play. For Koons, watching another flood tragedy unfold along the Guadalupe River has been “absolutely brutal.” “It's crushing to know that they are still looking and hoping,” he told WFAA. Christian Brown got a flash flood warning last week while he, his wife and children were starting their Fourth of July weekend at the Guadalupe River cabin that had been in his family for over 75 years. “All of our furniture and lamps, everything was falling down, crashing, breaking, and we just kind of stayed up there to assess the situation.” Among those still missing is Duke, the octogenarian kayaker and naturalist whose open-air shop along the river was a community hub, his friends told KPRC. Duke's home and shop are now a pile of wood intertwined with his memories and belongings, including a single paddle, perhaps an ode to his love for kayaking, friends told KPRC. President Donald Trump has signed a major disaster declaration, unlocking key federal resources for search and rescue efforts. Meanwhile, as rising global temperatures push weather toward extremes, Texas Lt. Gov. Cabins in the part of Camp Mystic most affected by last week's flood, for instance, have been there for more than 50 years, historical aerial imagery shows, even as new construction or major renovations in those flood zones would require a review by a floodplain manager, Kerr County documents say. At Lamps & Shades, a shop nestled for 30 years along the Guadalupe River's Historic Old Ingram Loop, the owners – with their daughter, who lived through Hurricane Katrina – just learned their insurance doesn't cover floods, she told CNN affiliate KTVT. Texas governor scolds reporter when asked who to blame for flood response “People really are just showing up out of every corner.” For now, the Guadalupe River has receded to its cypress-lined banks, again offering a place to bird watch, ride bikes, picnic and geocache for “treasures” hidden in the wild as people in Hill Country and online around the world band together to help Central Texas figure out what comes next.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Faced with abandonment from the state, rural residents built their own fire lines, shelters, and support systems. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. This article is an excerpt adapted from Red Flag Warning: Mutual Aid and Survival in California's Fire Country, by Margaret Elysia Garcia. If you live in a national forest in California, odds are pretty high that at some point or another you've been ordered to evacuate. In Indian Valley, for the first twelve days, many of our residents did indeed evacuate, but a significant number stayed behind. Some residents had livestock to look after and often no solid indication of where they could take their animals that wouldn't also need to be evacuated soon. With so many towns evacuating at once, some didn't want to stay in evacuation shelters where the lights would be on all day and night and the likelihood of catching COVID was high. Some people had family or friends to stay with outside of the county and took advantage of that. But for people whose entire families were in the valley, those who never leave their small rural communities, the prospect of evacuation was daunting — and expensive and feeling impossible. One Indian Valley community stands out in its defiance of evacuation: Taylorsville. The tiny town has roughly 150 people, comprising hippie artists, conservative ranchers, and a smattering of people in between, and is known for its independent spirit. Not everyone remained, but a sizable number of people young and old alike stayed, long after PG&E cut power. The population stayed after their generators ran out of fuel, and those who stayed did so with a communal spirit. Taylorsville residents watched the fire clouds over Greenville where it was burning seven miles away. This was no easy feat after the fire took Greenville. Most people in Taylorsville waited it out. Some snuck in supplies like bandits on dangerous dirt roads. Much of the defiance seemed to be personified by one main Taylorsville: Dan Kearns. He began a twice daily livestream on his Facebook page disseminating information to whomever followed him. His increasingly disheveled appearance and beard growing longer by the day seemed to embody what the rest of us were feeling. As it was very easy to panic, Kearns became the voice of reason, assurance, and calm in the face of adversity, even if his politics sometimes struck people as bizarre. “Clear, concise, and easily understood information from just a guy,” said Jeanna Van Brocklin on Kearns's Facebook page, adding that Kearns also spotlighted neighbors feeding evacuees' pets, restaurants that cooked for those who stayed, and the town's workers trying to keep the water running. Toward the end of August, when people still weren't allowed back and provisions were running low, you could tell that Taylorsville residents might be on the brink of madness from the livestreams and the TV crews allowed in to do stories on the defiant town that didn't burn. Adult children returned to Indian Valley from all over Northern California to help out elderly family members and their properties. They saturated the wood decks and set their own back burns to alleviate fire risk to specific properties, something oﬃcial firefighters would not have the time or resources to do. It's hard to argue that those in Taylorsville should not have stayed put. In the spring of 2022, when we all had a clearer picture of what was burned and what was coming back, you could see how far down Mount Hough the fire burned and the huge green swath around Taylorsville that owed its life to those volunteers who didn't leave town. The town was barely holding up, and this defiance saved some houses in nearby North Arm and some places in Genesee Valley. For many of the residents it became hard to argue that evacuation is always the best response to a fire disaster. News vans descended on the wreckage of the town with press passes to flash at the National Guard, but residents who had left were not allowed back, and those residents became increasingly frustrated. Why were coastal news organizations standing on the bones of the town when we ourselves were not allowed back? The governor, Gavin Newsom, visited and declared a disaster, someone from the feds finally declared a federal emergency nearly three weeks into our disaster, when finally enough monetary damage had been done, and the ball began rolling into the chaos of recovery. Still we oﬃcially couldn't come back. For those of us not on our own wells and septic, there was no water. The school year began two weeks late for some, a month late for others, in year two of COVID. Our downtown had the highest (worst) air quality index (AQI) levels on the entire planet for a week. We clocked in with an AQI of 851 one day. Unsympathetic employers had no sympathy for workers burning through vacation time and sick days. Some were evacuated a total of eight weeks in the Dixie Fire, and at the end of the eight weeks many didn't have a place to get back to. We crashed endlessly on friends' couches and couldn't give them an end date. We camped outside even though it wasn't safe to do so. We visited our animals still incarcerated in animal shelters and had no place to take them. We took relatives in Southern California up on that oﬀer to visit them. We grazed meals — random bits of whatever was around, fast food. Kids on evacuation started begging for vegetables and never wanted to see a granola bar again. We hoped for some sort of salvation that felt like it would never come. Kids started school in tents, with an internet-based curriculum but no internet access. No one had made a plan to live like this for so long. Eight weeks of evacuation — a time when none of us could plan or budget out an uncertain future, any future. And even though to not evacuate meant the very real possibility of running out of power and water, it seemed in these moments of uncertainty and unrest that camping out in our smoke-damaged homes was a better deal than whatever this was. To live like this is exhausting, and to be checking back online to see if our house was one with an X on a Google Earth map — meaning gone, or a check mark — meaning saved, was its own horrendous punishment during evacuation. My mother, a recent widow who has owned her own homes since the early 1990s and had no idea how much going rents were in California, let alone how much a motel would cost for evacuation, told me before the Dixie Fire that she didn't want to live in the mountains by herself anymore. That will get you a studio apartment in Turlock with nothing included. Motels and hotels begin at $100 a night easy up here. She stayed the remainder of evacuation in Sierraville in an old dilapidated Victorian house full of women who took turns cooking, laundering, and doing other duties while they enjoyed conversations together and read books. It's in this context that property owner Leslie Wehrman opened up her heart to oﬀer thirty-seven people (along with nine dogs, five cats, eight goats, fourteen chickens, and one goldfish) refuge from the fire on her five-acre parcel between the towns of Portola and Graeagle (eleven miles apart), safe space during evacuation. “Emergency cohabitation with virtual strangers experiencing deep stress and the trauma of loss over a seven-week period was hands down one of the most influential time periods in my life,” wrote Wehrman in a story for the Feather River Co-op Newsletter. Each evacuee took on a diﬀerent job in the makeshift commune — from tending the barn of evacuee animals to harvesting and tending the garden, and doing laundry. Michelle Fulton and her wife Lovely Hatzell of FulHat Farm in Meadow Valley were two of the fire refugees Wehrman took in during what Fulton called “an opportunity for community fellowship.” Together with their goats and cat and dogs they took refuge at Wehrman's, though their chickens stayed behind on the farm and were tended to by a neighbor who did not evacuate. Each evacuee took up the role best suited to them. The feeling, the atmosphere the makeshift commune created — all things and personalities taken into account — was calm, slowed down and focused on meeting basic needs and functions. Evacuees didn't try to retain their usual everyday lives. They tried instead to maintain a safe haven for all. According to Fulton, one person eventually left and another person who was a bit high-strung in the first place “freaked out,” but by and large they created seven weeks of harmonious living. We had a good time in the middle of all of this.” She likened it to a camping trip — if you could get your mind and anxiety into that space instead of one of looming dread and waiting for more bad news to strike. Perhaps that's what the model for evacuation should be. Like packing go-bags or knowing where the exits are beforehand, what if we had a plan for evacuation that encompassed who we wanted to evacuate with? Seeing evacuation as an opportunity for community might be what saves us all or at least lessons the anxiety and stress of feeling like one is all alone against the fire, every fire. It was a group of neighbors around my mother's house. Nowadays, though my mother and other retiree neighbors have left the state for cheaper and less fiery pastures, the bulk of us remain. We now act like neighbors should have acted in the first place. We ganged up on Waste Management together when it kept charging us but didn't pick up our trash for weeks on end. We watched each other's property since post-fire break-ins began when the sheriﬀ 's department was stretched too thin to do proper patrols. We complained en masse to Frontier Communications and PG&E for their lackluster delivery of services — as monopolies, they are not prone to put a high priority on customer service. Post-evacuation, we've learned a good deal about ourselves. There's no relief coming for those who had to max out their credit cards. For my part, I wish the toll of evacuation was taken more seriously by those around us. Could school administrators and teachers be more empathetic to students whose houses burn, who are not living anywhere stable for the first few weeks of the school year in evacuation? Could landlords, creditors, and employers be more empathetic? That it might exist in its own time and space altogether.

Consumer advocates said Tuesday that the Trump administration is to blame for an appeals court decision that effectively killed the Federal Trade Commission's click-to-cancel rule, a Biden-era effort to stop companies from trapping consumers in subscriptions with onerous cancellation terms. After the rule was finalized last October, the FTC — then led by Lina Khan — said it had received more than 16,000 public comments on the proposal, which would have required companies to make it just as easy for consumers to cancel subscriptions as it was to enroll. The rule was originally set to take effect on May 14, but the Trump FTC — now led by Republican Andrew Ferguson and two GOP commissioners — voted on May 9 to delay implementation, citing industry concerns that “it would take a substantial amount of time to come into compliance.” “The rule was set to go into effect in May but this FTC slow-walked it — and now a court has tossed it out, claiming industry didn't get enough of a say,” Khan lamented. Lee Hepner, senior legal counsel at the American Economic Liberties Project, said Tuesday that “the byzantine rulemaking process provides courts with infinite discretion to torpedo rules in service of deep-pocketed corporations and in spite of overwhelming public support.” “It's bad enough that the Trump FTC has done nothing to bring down costs for the American people,” Hegde said in a statement Tuesday. “Now, by slow-walking a simple, massively popular protection, they've ensured that hardworking people will keep getting stuck with subscriptions they don't want or can't afford from cable companies, gyms, and online services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police have raided the headquarters of France's far-right National Rally (RN) and seized documents as part of an investigation into alleged illegal campaign financing that was denounced by the party's leader, Jordan Bardella, as “a harassment campaign”. It also represented a fresh setback for the party after its figurehead, Marine Le Pen, was convicted in March of embezzling EU funds and barred from running for office for five years, effectively scuppering her hopes of running in 2027 presidential elections. Bardella, 29, whom Le Pen has asked to prepare to campaign in her place, said on social media on Wednesday: “RN headquarters – including the offices of its leaders – are being searched by about 20 police officers from the financial brigade.” The Paris prosecutor's office said the raid was part of an investigation launched in July last year that sought to establish whether campaigns in 2022 and 2024 were funded through “illegal loans from individuals to the party or to RN candidates”. The offices and homes of several company executives were also searched. The EU prosecutors' investigation follows a European parliament report alleging that the ID group, which included MEPs from RN, Italy's Lega, Germany's AfD and other far-right parties, had improperly spent more than €4m of EU money. Most of the funds benefited companies linked to a former Le Pen adviser and his wife, a consortium of European newspapers including Le Monde has reported. ID was disbanded last year and has been succeeded by a new group, Patriots for Europe. Le Pen has appealed against her conviction and has said she hopes it will be overturned so she can make her fourth run for the Elysée in two years' time. Polls suggest either she or Bardella would be strongly placed to win.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rubik's Cube owner Spin Master Toys UK on Wednesday lost its battle against a Greek rival as Europe's second-highest court annulled trademarks related to the shape of the iconic puzzle. Invented by Hungarian professor Erno Rubik in 1974, the multicolored cube puzzle is popular among young and old, with hundreds of millions sold worldwide. The brand was acquired by Canadian children's entertainment company Spin Master TOY-T in 2021. Spin Master took its case to the Luxembourg-based General Court after Greece's Verdes Innovations SA in 2013 asked the EU trademark office to invalidate several trademarks registered by Spin Master's predecessor between 2008 and 2012. The European Union Intellectual Property Office backed Verdes, saying Rubik's Cube trademarks had been registered contrary to EU law. The case is T-1170/23 Spin Master Toys UK v EUIPO - Verdes Innovations. “As the essential characteristics of that shape are necessary to obtain a technical result, it should not have been registered as an EU trade mark,” they said. Spin Master Toys, which can appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union, Europe's highest, did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.

MOSCOW, July 9. /TASS/. The Kremlin reacts calmly to US leader Donald Trump's criticism of his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

"We react quite calmly to that. First of all, Trump makes quite harsh statements, judging from the phrases that he has used," Peskov said when asked to comment on the Kremlin's reaction to Trump's remarks about Putin and the tightening of his rhetoric.

Earlier, Trump said he was "not happy with Putin" following their phone call on July 3. "I don't think he's looking to stop," the US leader shared as he questioned Moscow's resolve to put an end to the Ukraine conflict.

CNN released audio recordings of the then future US president telling his donors amid the 2024 election campaign that he had once threatened to bomb Moscow and warned Chinese leader Xi Jinping that he would bomb Beijing, too, to deter them from using force to resolve the Ukraine and Taiwan issues. The American politician did not say when or in excatly what circumstances those conversations had taken place.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained two Chinese nationals in Kyiv suspected of attempting to steal classified military technology related to Ukraine's Neptune cruise missile system, the agency announced on July 9. The younger man, who remained in Ukraine after being expelled from university in 2023 for poor academic performance, allegedly attempted to recruit a Ukrainian national with access to classified defense technologies in order to obtain technical data on the RK-360MC Neptune missile system. China has emerged as one of Moscow's key wartime partners, helping Russia circumvent sanctions and becoming the largest supplier of dual-use goods aiding its defense sector. President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly accused China of backing Russia and signed an order on July 8 imposing sanctions on five Chinese-registered companies for allegedly supplying components found in Russian Shahed-type drones used to attack Ukraine. The Neptune, a Ukrainian-developed coastal defense missile, gained international attention after it was used to sink the Russian Black Sea Fleet flagship Moskva in 2022. Investigators allege the elder suspect, who resides in China but made periodic visits to Ukraine, personally supervised his son's espionage activities. Searches of the suspects' belongings uncovered mobile phones containing evidence of coordinated efforts to spy on Ukrainian military technology, including encrypted communications between the two men. If convicted, they face up to 15 years in prison and confiscation of property. Ukraine struck a Russian warehouse storing ammunition and reconnaissance drones with a Neptune missile near the village of Chaltyr in Russia's Rostov Oblast in a January operation carried out by the SBU and Ukraine's Navy. Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Rome on July 9 and is set to meet with Pope Leo XIV, Suspilne broadcaster reported, citing the presidential spokesperson. The Kyiv Independent's Chris York speaks with former U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton about U.S. President Donald Trump's failure to bring peace to Ukraine — and his next steps on Russia's war. Since EU sanctions require unanimous backing, a single country's veto prevents the package from being implemented. The poll, conducted on July 4 and 5, found that 73% of Ukrainians trust Valerii Zaluzhnyi, who was dismissed as commander-in-chief in February 2024 but continues to command strong public support. Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers rejected a nominee to lead the economic crimes agency, drawing swift criticism from lawmakers and businesses over alleged interference in the selection process. Russia launched another mass missile and drone attack overnight on July 9, targeting Ukrainian cities, including in the country's far-west regions located hundreds of kilometers from the front line. The ruling also found Russia responsible for the deadly downing of Flight MH17, a Malaysian airliner shot down by Russian proxy forces in Ukraine in July 2014.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lithuania and Finland plan to begin domestic anti-personnel mine manufacturing in 2026, with some of the supplies potentially earmarked for Ukraine to counter the Russian threat, Reuters reported on July 9. The two NATO members will begin manufacturing once they complete withdrawal from the 1997 Ottawa Convention banning such mines, a six-month process that underscores Europe's shifting defense priorities. Ukrainian forces have increasingly relied on landmines for defensive operations, with Kyiv also withdrawing from the Ottawa Convention to "defend itself better against Russia." The Baltic country, which shares a 274-kilometer (170-mile) border with Russia's Kaliningrad exclave and 679 kilometers (422 miles) with Russia's close ally Belarus, will position its domestic industry as a primary supplier. Finland, which shares NATO's longest border with Russia at 1,340 kilometers (833 miles), views domestic production as essential for supply security, aiming to increase defense spending to 3% of GDP by 2029. In an interview with Reuters, Finnish parliamentary defense committee chair Heikki Autto called landmines "highly effective and very cost-efficient weapons systems" and confirmed Finland would consider supplying Ukraine. Helsinki previously held over 1 million anti-personnel mines before joining the Ottawa treaty in 2011. According to Reuters, the countries are relaunching production amid growing European fears that Russia's military goals extend beyond Ukraine, prompting increased NATO defense spending as demanded by U.S. President Donald Trump. These countries are not yet launching mine production, though they maintain manufacturing capabilities that could be activated if required. Polish private munitions manufacturer ZSP Niewiadow told Reuters it intends to resume large-scale anti-personnel mine production by 2027, with new facility investments already underway. Anti-personnel mines explode when triggered by contact or movement, threatening both soldiers and civilians long after conflicts end. The Czech Defense Ministry will provide 150 hours of training, worth approximately 32 million koruna (around $1.5 million), through the state-owned enterprise LOM Praha — at no charge to Ukraine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney attend a meeting with G7 leaders and guests, at the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alberta, Canada,  June 16, 2025. Blayne Haggart is a professor of political science at Brock University. If Canadians were confused by Prime Minister Mark “Elbows Up” Carney's axing of the digital services tax in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to scuttle trade and security negotiations between the two countries, that's understandable: Nothing about Mr. Carney's U.S. strategy, particularly his pursuit of a “comprehensive” trade and security agreement, makes a lick of sense. Given the ephemeral nature of any potential agreement, why does he think a comprehensive agreement is even possible, even without giving away the store? Trump's new tariff deadline prolongs instability, says UN trade agency They're acting as if the threat is purely economic and resolvable by normal, rational negotiations. Mr. Carney's archaic understanding of Canada-U.S. relations is nicely captured by his Finance Minister, François-Philippe Champagne, who said “the competitiveness of North America depends on what happens between Canada and the United States.” Ten years ago, appealing to “North America” as a shared economic space would have been entirely appropriate. Canadian economic development policy since the late 1980s has been built on the presumption of a single North American economy, nurtured through deliberate policy actions and binding economic treaties. If this assessment were accurate, it would make sense for Canada to push to eliminate and reduce trade barriers, as well as (economically rational) deeper integration while mollifying Mr. Trump, making the long-term argument that we're stronger together than apart and hedging somewhat against U.S. risk through trade diversification and strengthening the economy. We now live in the latter world of us versus them. As Wilfrid Laurier University professor of political science Jörg Broschek pointed out on Bluesky, this trade-only focus ignores the fact that the foundations of the North American economy are political, not economic. The U.S. has turned its back on all of these, making any traditional trade agreement literally impossible. Mr. Trump is an autocrat, a fascist, dragging the United States into a despotism that will take years, if not decades, to overcome. His goal is domination, not co-operation or rational win-win scenarios. He doesn't care about U.S. “security” or “economic prosperity.” Negotiating an agreement in the absence of the political foundations for an agreement is little more than cargo-cult policymaking. Addressing the U.S. threat requires thinking and actions appropriate to our changed circumstances. Not just more guns, but weaning our military from U.S. influence, protecting our communication networks from U.S. software vulnerabilities and making peace with the loss of guaranteed access to the U.S. market. Domestically, Washington's evisceration of its regulatory and statistical agencies will require greater, not less, Canadian government capacity. Governments that truly believe they're facing an existential crisis don't cut taxes or cap the size of the civil service and slash government program spending, as Mr. Carney is doing. Mr. Carney has been conspicuously silent on the Canadians being harassed at the border and detained by ICE, illustrated most sharply by Ottawa's almost-comical intransigence regarding pleas to change its U.S. travel advisory to reflect reality. On defence, the government is not taking seriously how our reliance on U.S. tech giants is a significant vulnerability, not least through software-enabled U.S. devices, from jet planes on down, that gives the U.S. a de facto veto over Canadian military missions. Canada will always have to deal with U.S. issues and complaints as they come up. U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday reiterated that countries that don't make trade deals with the United States will get letters, informing them of the tariffs they will be charged if they export products to the United States.

MOSCOW, July 9. /TASS/. The United States' move to resume weapons supplies to the Kiev regime will not help resolve the conflict diplomatically, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a press briefing.

US officials have once again made "statements about resuming" weapons supplies to Ukraine, even though Washington earlier declared its decision to suspend arms deliveries, the diplomat pointed out.

"The consequences of such steps have yet to be assessed. What can be said for sure is that the continued pumping of the Kiev regime with weapons is not facilitating a peaceful solution to the conflict, to put it mildly, while this is what the international community, including the West, is calling for," Zakharova stressed.

The New York Times reported on July 2 that the US would suspend the supplies of missiles for Patriot air defense systems, guided multiple launch rocket system (GMLRS) rockets, Hellfire missiles, Stinger man-portable air-defense systems and some other weapons to Kiev. After that, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry summoned US Charge d'Affaires in Kiev John Ginkel, while Vladimir Zelensky noted that Europe was unable to compensate for US supplies. On July 3, US President Donald Trump stated that Washington continued to provide Kiev with military assistance. However, he emphasized that the US requires weapons itself.</p>

Hazy Senior Fellow at Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation and a Senior Adviser at RAND. But determining who is ahead depends on what it means to win. A common definition is being the first to cross the threshold of artificial general intelligence, which in basic terms is an AI model that is as smart or smarter than the top human experts across a wide range of cognitive tasks. Similarly, countries stand to gain a competitive edge if they can adopt AI at scale across the economy and society. Governments are also battling to create and own the standards, supply chains, and infrastructure that will undergird the global technological ecosystem. Taking these additional AI races into account makes the United States' position look precarious. And given AI's world-changing potential, the stakes are profound: losing risks relegating the United States to economic dependence, military vulnerability, and diminished global leadership. But the United States will need to muster a coherent AI strategy, one that balances innovation, integration, and risk mitigation to translate the country's immense technological dynamism into enduring strategic advantage. Private companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind in the United States and DeepSeek in China are rushing to innovate, supported by their respective governments. No one knows exactly how the technology will evolve. Large language models could be the first signs of emerging AGI, or true AGI could manifest suddenly when AI models pass a certain threshold. Either way, AGI has enough potential to transform the sources of national power and competitiveness that the world's two AI leaders have a substantial interest in securing a first-mover advantage. American AI labs currently have a discernible edge, helped along by semiconductor export controls designed to maintain the United States' computational advantage over China. China's domestic innovation, circumvention of export controls, and intellectual property theft have kept the country in a close second place. Its leading AI companies, such as DeepSeek, are developing technologies that trail their U.S. counterparts by mere months. The United States' open system, meanwhile, fosters innovation but is inherently vulnerable to espionage and the rapid diffusion of algorithmic advances. Breakthroughs in algorithmic design or alternative paradigms for AI development could diminish the importance of U.S. semiconductor dominance, and their spread could enable China's AI labs to leapfrog American competitors. The Trump administration, driven by other political priorities, is also pulling back investment in basic AI research and development and discouraging talented foreign nationals from working in the United States, potentially setting back American AI efforts over the next several years. The U.S. private sector, moreover, responds to commercial imperatives that are not always consistent with national priorities. AI firms, for example, will be tempted to build AI computing power wherever there is available energy infrastructure—whether or not it is based in the United States. Favorable regulatory environments and abundant resources in the Middle East are already proving attractive. Washington does benefit from this arrangement, and U.S. firms including OpenAI and Microsoft are slated to operate most of the data centers' capacity. But moving crucial infrastructure offshore, where security may be lax, could also provide a backdoor for China and other competitors to acquire advanced computing resources and AI models. Current market trends suggest that frontier AI models are becoming so widely accessible and undifferentiated that they give no one a clear technological edge. If that trend holds when AGI emerges, victory will depend on effective AI adoption—and there is no guarantee the United States will come out on top. In the realm of national security, effective AI adoption requires both understanding the capabilities enabled (and threats posed) by frontier AI and integrating AI into existing structures in ways that secure a decisive military edge. Integration of AI promises to enhance intelligence processing, accelerate data-driven decision-making, optimize logistics and resource allocation, enable sophisticated autonomous systems, and possibly even lead to the development of a “wonder weapon”—such as a cyberweapon that could cripple an adversary's critical infrastructure and command and control or, used defensively, make a country invulnerable to cyberattacks. Although these problems are widely acknowledged, fixing them has proved difficult. China's authoritarian system, meanwhile, eases civil-military integration, providing it with a structural edge in AI adoption. State mandates ensure that technological advances are rapidly translated into military and intelligence capabilities. More than merely using algorithms in weapons systems, this entails a transition to a new type of warfare in which military superiority depends on the speed, sophistication, and reliability of those algorithms. The United States could produce scientific and technological breakthrough after breakthrough but still fail to recognize the point at which AI opens a new technological pathway to a revolutionary military or intelligence capability. Washington's bureaucratic structures, designed for incremental improvements to existing systems, often make it difficult to imagine left-field possibilities for emerging technologies. Beijing's centralized decision-making system, in comparison, could identify and exploit a disruptive pathway much faster, potentially leaving the United States technologically superior but strategically outmaneuvered. The U.S. technology companies that drive consumer and business AI applications, a vibrant venture capital ecosystem that funds innovation, relatively high digital literacy, and extensive digital infrastructure all provide the United States notable advantages. If corporate and governmental actors at all levels fail to create the right incentives for integration and build sufficient public trust in AI, the private sector could struggle to adopt AI quickly enough to capitalize on the benefits of enhanced productivity and new value creation. There is also a danger that AI will not simply augment human labor but replace it. Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, has recently warned that AI could lead to as much as 20 percent unemployment in the United States within five years—an outcome that could deeply destabilize both the economy and American society. Meanwhile, China may be poised to perform surprisingly well in the race for economic adoption. DeepSeek's open-source models, for example, are driving down costs for all Chinese AI models, which enables more businesses to experiment with the technology. This could give China an edge in creating game-changing products. Whereas automating jobs raises alarm in Washington, Beijing could even welcome AI adoption as a solution to China's labor shortages brought by a rapidly aging and shrinking population. As AI makes strides in spatial reasoning and embodied intelligence—AI that enables robots to interact with and learn from their physical environment—factory robots may become able to perform a much wider array of complex physical tasks. Although U.S. firms excel in software and services—areas that are also expected to make significant productivity gains as a result of AI adoption—the United States has ceded ground to China in recent decades in physical industries, including manufacturing, logistics, energy, and infrastructure. With its state-driven industrial policy and massive manufacturing base, China can deploy AI at scale within these sectors and might unleash dramatic productivity gains that lead it to finally surpass the U.S. economy. Export controls on semiconductor chips have given the United States a meaningful edge. But in countries with lower incomes, fewer customers, and less basic infrastructure such as broadband connectivity and electricity, Washington's strategy of following market forces will lead to underinvestment. This is the dynamic across a broad group of countries in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and South and Southeast Asia that are turning to AI to boost their economic growth. China is positioned to outcompete the United States in these places by providing less advanced and significantly cheaper AI models—as well as subsidizing the physical and digital infrastructure needed to run them. It may not currently be able to export any top-of-the-line chips, but for many developing countries where cost and accessibility are more important than cutting-edge performance, China's “good enough” offerings could prove highly attractive. The consequences for Washington extend beyond lost geopolitical influence and commercial opportunities. They automatically censor content critical of the Chinese Communist Party or related to sensitive topics such as Tiananmen Square, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Uyghurs, or Chinese leader Xi Jinping. In contrast, American AI models generally reflect stronger commitments to democratic norms, transparency, privacy safeguards, user choice, and data protection frameworks, helping reduce opportunities for government abuse. A critical step toward ensuring the technologies shaping modern life across the world align with democratic values is for Washington to proactively incentivize American AI firms to invest and build infrastructure in developing countries. Overly restrictive export controls could alienate allies or drive countries currently on the fence toward Chinese products. Conversely, applying too little control over advanced AI chips could inadvertently create opportunities for Chinese companies to acquire or remotely access them, potentially accelerating China's technological innovation. And if Washington cannot articulate a compelling vision for technological governance—one that carefully balances national security with economic openness and democratic values—potential international partners may turn elsewhere. China is not just selling AI; it offers a comprehensive toolkit for rapid modernization on financially and politically appealing terms to a substantial portion of the world. For a developing country eager to harness AI for economic gains and improved governance, the Chinese offer is often the most practical and readily available path forward. Even as the United States and China compete in the AI race, they cannot forget that AGI and other highly capable AI models create potential threats. It is imperative that neither competitor allows its rapid development and deployment of AI to make a disaster more likely. A nonstate actor or rogue state weaponizing AI models, unintentional military escalation caused by AI, or a loss of control of superintelligent systems could prove catastrophic. Preventing such outcomes requires that AI powers avoid cutting corners on safety in their haste to compete. The most pressing near-term catastrophic risks are that nonstate actors with access to advanced AI systems could launch large-scale cyberattacks that devastate financial systems or design and release highly lethal and transmissible pathogens. These hazards are no longer confined to the realm of science fiction. Companies at the forefront of AI development have predicted that their internally defined thresholds for dangerous capabilities—measured as “uplift,” or the degree to which an AI model significantly enhances a malicious actor's abilities—are likely to be crossed this year. Another rapidly approaching threat is the potential emergence of a superintelligence misaligned with human values or intentions, pursuing actions that endanger human well-being because of flawed design, ambiguous instructions, or unforeseen consequences. Growing evidence of frontier AI models exhibiting deceptive or scheming behaviors makes this risk increasingly credible. Both Washington and Beijing have an interest in preventing the proliferation of dangerous AI capabilities and the emergence of rogue AGI. For Washington, seeking ways to mitigate threats from AI—an imperative the Trump administration has recognized—is sound policy regardless of what other AI powers do. Even if rogue AI does not lead to global calamity, a major AI-related incident originating from the United States, whether accidental or through negligence, would undermine confidence in American technology. Success in the AI race therefore requires a strategy that advances progress across several fronts simultaneously while managing the security risks of unchecked AI. As part of a holistic strategy, Washington must make every effort to avoid being caught off guard by AI advances in Silicon Valley, China, and emerging AI hubs around the world. Being surprised could mean failing to recognize the emergence of new threats or missing opportunities to capitalize on AI progress ahead of China. To prevent this, the U.S. government must maintain close communication with domestic industry leaders and closely monitor imminent technological breakthroughs abroad. The Commerce Department's repurposing of its AI Safety Institute, now called the U.S. Center for AI Standards and Innovation, to focus on working with industry to research and test frontier AI is a step in the right direction. Likewise, the intelligence community must expand its monitoring of foreign AI efforts, particularly focusing on China's advancements and objectives, as well as those of emerging AI powers in the Middle East. The Trump administration should also identify ways to facilitate frontier AI development. It must ensure that AI companies have access to the resources they need for AI model development and deployment, including vast computational power (in the form of semiconductors), high-quality data, world-class talent, and sufficient energy supplies. It will be important not to create new problems in the process; to meet AI's growing energy demands without exacerbating climate change, for example, Washington should invest in cleaner energy sources such as nuclear power. To ensure that AI advancements are not rapidly replicated by competitors, the U.S. government will need to enforce stringent controls over technologies such as advanced semiconductors and manufacturing equipment, strengthen security measures at research labs and data centers to prevent espionage and intellectual property theft, and require rigorous user verification on cloud computing platforms so that they do not become unwitting tools for an adversary's technological advancement. These initiatives should help the government ramp up its adoption of advanced AI and promote prudent security practices. American AI companies can benefit from access to sensitive government intelligence about adversaries attempting to target them, and both the public sector and the private sector can benefit from co-developing AI applications that can enhance national security, such as advanced cybersecurity and biodefense tools. As China expands its industrial capacity using AI and robotics, policymakers in Washington must also broaden AI adoption beyond the technology sector. With tax credits, innovation grants, and public-private pilot projects, the government can incentivize factories, warehouses, and transportation hubs to integrate AI-driven systems, bridging the gap between the United States' cutting-edge software capabilities and its lagging factory floors. This means significantly increasing investments in STEM education, vocational training, and retraining and upskilling programs—services that would enable workers displaced by automation to swiftly transition into new roles, such as robot maintenance or AI system supervision. As companies increasingly use algorithms to schedule work shifts and more employees work on short-term contracts, wage-and-hour laws should be modernized to ensure transparent, fair compensation and clearly defined working hours. Strengthening unemployment benefits and other forms of direct income support for people disproportionately affected by automation will also be crucial to mitigating the potentially destabilizing consequences of significant labor displacement. It should also scale up government-backed financial tools—such as low-interest loans, loan guarantees, equity investments, political risk insurance, and tax incentives—through agencies such as the International Development Finance Corporation. These incentives should be geared toward building digital infrastructure in important emerging markets, such as in Brazil, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Doing so would give senior leaders opportunities to rehearse crisis responses, identify gaps in readiness, and improve their decision-making under pressure. They cooperated on negotiations for the 1970 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, recognizing that an uncontrolled race to the nuclear frontier could send humanity hurtling off a cliff. They could start with a bilateral agreement to share AI incident information and exchange best practices on AI safety, control, and alignment with human values. Further talks should focus on how to handle scenarios of misused or uncontrolled AGI. The challenge is to win not one definitive contest but a multifront competition whose outcome will shape the international balance of power. Navigating these deeply intertwined domains of technological and strategic AI competition demands that Washington adopt a holistic strategy. Without it, success in one race could create vulnerabilities in another—and neglecting any of them risks irreparably weakening the United States' global position.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Jacob Ware is a Research Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a co-author of God, Guns, and Sedition: Far-Right Terrorism in America. Gun violence has become a staple of daily life in the United States. The physical and emotional toll is carried disproportionately by young people: gun violence is now the leading cause of death for Americans between age one and 17. A 2024 report by Everytown for Gun Safety (where I serve as a Survivor Fellow), the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab, and the Southern Poverty Law Center found that an American young person knows, “on average, at least one person who has been injured or killed by a gun.” It soon emerged that the killer held “a significant passion” for researching U.S. school shootings, an Austrian police chief said; he had been particularly inspired by the 1999 school massacre in Columbine, Colorado. It has long been known that, in the U.S. context, school shootings are an epidemiological phenomenon. “The greatest number of incidents,” Silva noted, “occurred in 2019 and 2020.” Research also shows that many of these incidents were directly linked to examples set by U.S. shooters. Mass shootings now constitute a particularly bloody form of American foreign influence. Although its per capita death rates by firearm have remained relatively steady over the past 50 years, the United States has experienced a significant rise in mass shooting incidents. Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in 2023, former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas remarked that, when he engaged with non-American politicians, “almost every single time” they posed two questions to him about the United States. Scholars of gun violence point to the so-called Columbine effect, in which the Columbine shooters created a “cultural script” for future attackers involving particular ideological, tactical, and even sartorial choices. Likewise, there is significant evidence that American perpetrators inspired foreign attackers. Columbine led directly to copycat attacks in Brazil, Canada, Finland, and Russia, claiming dozens of lives. One German criminologist told The Guardian, “The phenomenon of massacres by young people in schools in Germany has only existed since Columbine.” In 2022, Silva and fellow researcher Adam Lankford found that “fame-seeking mass shooters who attacked outside the United States appeared more likely to have been influenced by American mass shooters than by perpetrators from all other countries combined.” Alexandre Bissonnette, for instance—a white supremacist who killed six people at a mosque in Quebec City in 2017—searched online for a “list of school shootings in the United States” in the run-up to his attack. Less ideological shooters have also pointed to American predecessors. In Luton, England, a would-be school shooter who murdered three family members last September had extensively researched shootings and claimed that he hoped to eclipse the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, which killed 32. A so-called accelerationist, he intended his attack to cause a tidal wave of anti-firearm sentiment in the United States that would speed the country's collapse. The United States exports violence abroad more indirectly, too. U.S. social media platforms, which are less regulated than social media companies in other countries, play a role in glorifying violence, especially to disillusioned young men. After these lawsuits failed, foreign regulators began scrambling to contain this malign form of American influence. In 2022, the EU passed the Digital Services Act, which opened the door to massive fines against companies, including U.S. ones, that “spread illegal content such as hate speech, terrorist content, or child sexual abuse material.” X now faces a multipronged investigation into its compliance with the DSA's obligation to counter “the dissemination and amplification of illegal content and disinformation” and faces significant fines or even a ban. But gun violence in the United States represents more than just a set of local tragedies. It has profound implications for U.S. soft power and foreign policy. For starters, the U.S. role in provoking violence abroad is becoming more concrete. In September 2024, for example, U.S. authorities arrested two U.S. citizens and charged them with leading an international online movement called the Terrorgram Collective, which had incited white supremacist attacks that killed and injured people in Slovakia and Turkey, both NATO allies. And by exporting violence, the United States' reputation is taking a beating. Some gun-rich countries that chafe at the thought of more stringent gun control have blamed the United States' gun culture for corrupting their own. After two back-to-back mass shootings in Serbia in 2023, for instance, a Serbian war veteran lambasted the way the United States had rewired his country's cultural attachment to firearms. After a 2018 school shooting in occupied Crimea, Russian President Vladimir Putin explained that “it all started with the United States and their schools”; in 2022, the Russian Supreme Court even designated the “Columbine movement” of school-shooting worshipers a terrorist organization. In 2023, a foreign ministry spokesperson claimed that the United States “brings to other countries not democracy or progress of human rights, but . instability,” noting that high rates of gun violence in Mexico and Pakistan could be traced to exported U.S. weapons. It was an American—the influential political scientist Joseph Nye—who popularized the concept of soft power. He explained the critical role that a culture's attractiveness plays in drawing other nations into its sphere of influence. The United States was a great practitioner of soft-power politics long before Nye popularized the term: it arguably gained its edge after World War II, and its enormous sway over geopolitics and the global economy, thanks less to its military investments and more to the allure of its commercial, cultural, and ideological exports. Policymakers eager to protect the United States' reputation and influence need to seriously consider the impact of its new major export, gun violence. So far, the persistent murder of American schoolchildren has not prompted such reforms. America's gun violence is driving agony and contempt among its allies and handing easy talking points to its rivals, both of which erode the United States' advantages. With his cuts to cultural diplomacy, U.S. President Donald Trump shows little overt interest in retaining the United States' soft-power edge. But his administration remains intensely interested in making U.S. exports successful, both for the sake of American companies' bottom lines and for the United States' reputation as a maker and purveyor of cutting-edge goods. Gun violence has become a cutting-edge U.S. export—but one that will harm, not help, its positive balance of power. If U.S. policymakers do not take gun violence more seriously, they will only ensure that this balance goes further off kilter.
