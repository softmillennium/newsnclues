                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>About a year ago, as the Republican-led Congress continued to sputter, a prominent right-wing activist named Laura Loomer published an interesting complaint to social media. “He has failed at all of his ‘investigations' that have gone nowhere.” It was easy to understand why those in the GOP's right-wing base would feel unsatisfied. But the problem wasn't with Comer, at least not entirely. The Oversight Committee chair and his partners went looking for scandals and failed — not because they were incompetent investigators, but because there were no scandals to find. Conservative internet and media personalities are criticizing Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Trump administration after a recent government memo appeared to contradict statements Bondi made about the case of convicted sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein. In particular, conservatives have expressed anger that Trump and other administration members promised tangible disclosures about Epstein if Trump were elected. This, naturally, got conservative conspiracy theorists' hopes up, which left the right feeling that much more dejected when Team Trump turned around and effectively said, “Never mind. But stepping back, what makes these developments even more notable is the familiarity of the circumstances: On an endless list of conspiracy theories, Republicans have been over-promising and under-delivering for many years. Republican officials told their far-right base they would uncover evidence of Joe Biden taking bribes. And proof that tech companies were discriminating against conservatives. And confirmation that the FBI had been “weaponized.” Those same Republicans vowed to discredit Trump's Russia scandal. And prove that Planned Parenthood was up to no good. And show that the IRS “scandal” was real. There's evidence buried in a pot of gold on the horizon. The next time Republicans turn to those same conspiracy theorists, making bold promises about all the great information they'll uncover with yet another investigation, conservatives should remember the feeling they had right after Attorney General Pam Bondi told them there is no Epstein “client list,” after having basically said the opposite during a Fox News interview months earlier.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Between Countdown and The Boys, Jensen Ackles is having a well-deserved moment in the spotlight — and Supernatural prepared him for these projects in one important way. That likely has to do with Supernatural's enduring legacy, which still has many viewers clamoring for a revival or 16th season of the show. He recently told People how it prepared him for his other roles. The television landscape has changed significantly since Supernatural, and most of Ackles' newer projects don't require nearly the same time commitment: "We'd spend nine and a half months filming 23-episode seasons. Newer shows tend to have much shorter runs, especially on streaming. Ackles jested that Countdown's "13-episode season feels respectful" by comparison. Tracker still has 20-episode seasons, but Ackles notably isn't in every installment. And The Boys runs shorter than Supernatural as well, averaging about eight episodes per outing. Supernatural's long and vigorous production periods prepared its cast well for any future projects, and it's likely that modern streaming series are much easier on them by comparison. While a ton of effort goes into the making of any TV series, Ackles comments point to a reality for many actors. Supernatural is still immensely popular, years after its ending, and Jensen Ackles had the perfect response to a potential revival of The CW show. They required a much greater time commitment, which made it difficult for cast and crew members to pursue other projects or take time for their own personal endeavors. Shorter seasons have been a major complaint about the streaming era, but it's worth remembering comments like Ackles' when discussing the current state of television. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. The Neo-Western that dominated the entertainment landscape for 5 season is also an example of why soap operas are succesful - because it is one. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 is a fun and nostalgic trip that also brings the arcade skater to a new generation - and the soundtrack is great, too. A close ally of the Man of Steel from 2025's Superman has given an interesting response when asked about the titular hero's dog, Krypto. A Formula One expert says Sonny Hayes' (Brad Pitt) driving in F1 would likely be controversial if he utilized his strategy in a real-life race. Jensen Ackles' new action thriller on Amazon Prime Video draws notable inspiration from a classic superhero movie, particularly in one scene.</p>

Our deep dive into the first-ever declassified Pentagon report detailing 144 accounts of UFO sightings is officially up on YouTube ... and there's a lot to unpack.

"TMZ Investigates: UFOs: The Pentagon Proof" analyzes our government's official response to UFO conversations from an investigative standpoint ... we interview key players and showcase footage of UFOs recorded from all over the world.

We talked to military officials and pilots who say they suffered severe retribution for daring to implore the Pentagon to take UFOs seriously ... including former Pentagon Counterintelligence official Lue Elizondo.

Lue appeared on camera and explained how Pentagon officials threatened to pull his security clearance, called him a liar and smeared his name ... all because he was pushing for UFO transparency.

Meanwhile, former Navy Pilot Ryan Graves told us he saw plenty of UFOs during his time in the sky, but said a lot of pilots wouldn't speak out about their own experiences for fear of being called crazy and having their reputations ruined.

Plus, former Defense Department official Christopher Mellon, who has spoken out about government findings and sightings, told us his career was placed in jeopardy by pressing the UFO issue. Still, he said he's willing to accept those consequences given what's at stake.

We also spoke with UFO journalists Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp ... and they break down one of the biggest mysteries to ever face mankind

"TMZ Investigates: UFOs: The Pentagon Proof" is now available on YouTube.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ovrkast is an accomplished producer and rapper who has laced tracks for everyone from Drake to Earl Sweatshirt. But his calm demeanor belies his place in an indie rap scene that's currently holding hip-hop on its back. But Kast Got Wings turned into a bunch of different shit.” He realized the project with producer Cardo “held some weight,” which encouraged him to take his time with his next solo album. “I was just in the studio every day,” he says. The result is a cathartic project where he delves into his creative journey on warm songs like “Truth” and “Stumblin,'” as well as collaborations like “Strange Ways” with Vince Staples, “Small Talk” with No Filller alum Samara Cyn, and “MAVKAST,” with his friend Mavi, who he's known since they were both teens exploring their craft in Kik groupchats. Ovrkast says that his placement on Mavi and Earl Sweatshirt's “El Toro Combo Meal” is what encouraged him to take his music career seriously and drop his 2020 debut Try Again. Five projects later, Ovrkast says his latest work is the result of a more intentional writing process. But even though it's a vulnerable glimpse of his life and times, he says it's also a reflection of an alternate, supernatural universe. “[It's me] as a character who moves to New York,” he says. And then I get struck by lightning. The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time “I'm moving to New York and all this cool shit is happening and then [I'm] struck with inspiration and acting on it.” He says, adding, “the story is me dealing with the ups and downs of this newfound success, dealing with people and staying true to the sound.” He paired the project with several music videos including “I'm On,” where he dons white face while satirizing the life cycle of flavor-of-the-month white rappers. The videos came together alongside Mitch Ritter, who he appreciates for their kindred desire to control their entire operation. “I wanted one person to shoot the whole thing. Mitch shoots it, he directs it, he edits it, he does everything.I mix my own shit, produce my own shit, write to my own shit. I'll be reading certain blog posts or certain tweets and niggas pick up on shit that I didn't expect them to. But I think that's the thing with artists, you think you slick and then niggas is like, “Nah, I seen that.” And it's kind of cool, but I'm really surprised. Drake's ‘Iceman' Era Could Be a Misstep if It's Too Focused on Beef Drake Addresses Fake Friends on New Song 'What Did I Miss?' Canadian Politician Jagmeet Singh Apologizes to Drake for Attending Kendrick Lamar Concert Drake, Smiley, Kim Gordon, Feid and All the Songs You Need to Know This Week What kind of things are they picking up on? I saw a blog post today and they were just saying that every feature is there on purpose, which is true. I made sure the features were carefully picked and everybody had their spot. [It's] stuff that I didn't think people would pick up on. But people actually sitting and listening to it…I'm like, damn, that's fire. My boy Sage told it's easy to just play. How did you go about adding the tags, vocal clips, and other elements to the project?That's [being a] producer, literally. Like one second it's a random intro. There's shit happening every 30 seconds, but it all makes sense. You've said your first album Try Again was your third time attempting to make an album.Yeah, the first album I had, I hadn't even made it. Then the second one was like, “Alright, I'm actually trying to make this thing,” but I didn't have it in me yet. Try Again was literally me [making] a bunch of songs and then got the Earl placement and I was like, “Alright, it's time,” and then that shit just went up. This is kind of the same thing, even though [the Drake placement] was a little while ago, it's another one of the things where it's like I got about keep going crazy. And I think that might be a recurring theme in my career. I just started seeing niggas tap in, bro. I had been cool with Mavi for a little bit…we've been friends since kids, so it was like, why the fuck not? And also I was getting better at my craft. I had a job at the library, my shift was seven hours, but I would spend 500 hours bullshitting, doing nothing. So I had my computer just making music and shit. Then I'd get off, go to the studio. I remember it was days where Earl would come to Oakland on some random shit and me and my homie Deja would be like, “I'll text him. You want to go to the studio?” We going to get off work, run into the studio with all my shit and be there until 2:00 AM [or] later than that. And even though it wasn't fully like how this album is, it was my first time giving niggas a whole album. Bro, [we] met through a Kik group chat. I was like 17 years old making beats for the first time. He hadn't recorded a song ever. Everybody was trying to buy beats, but nobody had bread. This nigga Mavi was like, “How much you want?” I was like, “$100.” He was like, “Alright bro.” He paid for the beat, he rapped to it and from there he just always had a connection to my music and same with his. Were you very active in the online beat making community?Hell yeah. I grew up on Knxwledge, Ohbliv, all that shit so it's in my DNA. My [previous] goal was to be like Madlib, be mysterious and put out vinyl releases every two years. It was like, all right, now niggas is rapping. MIKE came out, Mavi was turned up, the tide was shifting to rap so I'm like, fuck it, I might as well just keep rapping. At what point did you start taking rap more seriously? I had songs on SoundCloud that were blowin' up in like 2016. My beats were already circulating, so it was easy for me to put a rap in there and niggas not know who it was. So I had some rap songs, [with] 10-15,000 plays where I snuck 'em in, but no one knew who Ovrkast was. And then I took it seriously around 2019 when shit was getting serious. How did being in Kinfolk and Lo-Fiction sharpen your craft as well? It's imperative if you make music at a young age, you got to collaborate no matter what the corny ass group name is. I know everybody got videos and clips of them rapping with their homies back in the day. That really showed me collaboration and also it sharpened my skills because there's other people rapping and producing next to me and it was a good motivation having that camaraderie. Nobody really was coming in, so I had a lot of studio time and also I had a schedule. That helped me want to deliver on everything. So how do you feel about East Coast winters being from the bay?It's a bitch. That's how I stayed alive was making the music. You got to be doing something in the wintertime. I think this winter was one of the worst ones too. The terrain getting around everything is just much harder. But it's like I had more motivation to actually complete my [album]. Also I was having fun, [the] studio's warm and shit. You collect fire shit over time, right? Right now it's all just scrapbooking, really. I don't know because niggas say they want something but they don't really want [it]. They want the idea of an Ovrkast beat. How descriptive do they get?The only nigga to ever give me an in-depth [request] was Vince Staples. He sent me some music to hear first. Then I sent him a beat and he was like, “Yeah, this is hard.” And this nigga recorded a full verse on his iPhone and was like, “This is where I'm going with this.” And I went back in and I restructured, and he was like, “Okay, that's cool, let's make this two bars instead of four.” It was the most collaborative thing I've ever did with anybody. But most of the time it's like, “I need some beats. What you got?” I hate when niggas is like, “Oh, so-and-so need a beat.” I'm like, where the nigga at?! Probably the past three years I've been able to find shit that niggas don't know where it is at, super tucked. There's one sample I can't even say. I have people I work with…Angelo Leroy and Fly Williams and this guy named Charlie P Production who make samples and I can be like, “Yo, can you do this for me?” Because actual musicians know what I like and that's the name of the game. I think nowadays you got to have people who know your sound and are willing to work with you. Everything that I've done with the guys that I've worked with has done some crazy shit. Each one of them have a placement with somebody big. Are you the rapper who writes a lot of bars or are you more intentional about your songs? This album is when I became more writing-heavy. I can sit down and do a good 16 bars, but for the longest time it was hard because it was just difficult for me to focus and dig deep. Also, I don't wanna have filler. And I was doing that for so long, but now I be thinking of more shit to say. In what ways do you feel like it thematically or otherwise differentiates? Try Again was a little more shooting from the hip. Then the Earl placement happened and I was like, all right, I should think of this shit right now. So I spent a month to make cover art and sequence. I made this album a little bit different. How did you think of Samara Cyn for “Small Talk?” Everybody who heard this song was like, “[Get] Samara.” I sent it to her and she was like, “I'm going to get on this.” And then she was busy as hell, [so] I had the homegirl come on and do a hook, but then Samara was like, “I'mma hop on it still.” I had to swap out the homegirl, put her on ”Stumble Ma,” and then I met Samara in LA. It's easy to hear her on that. My beats are sometimes a playground for rappers. It is an open book for a skilled rapper to go crazy and I love that shit. I want niggas to go fucking crazy. Niggas are saying the features on album is better than him. I'm like, good nigga, these niggas are crazy. Why would I want you niggas to be trash? Imagine if all the features was lackluster niggas. It was a line you said on one of the tracks, just the phrase, “I still ain't done shit.” What do you think would make you feel fulfilled? I want two or three more albums. So once you get to five or six albums. I look up to Vince Staples and Saba, they have careers where they can put an album out [and] go. This is right next to it for sure. Can you take me into ideating and crafting the “I'm On” video? It seemed like a lot of fun. I like to be goofy for a few hours. I grew up in the era of Tyler and Childish Gambino and these niggas who do goofy shit just for the fuck of it. How intentional were you about that balance? It took a little while to figure out how to sequence it because I hadn't made my cast yet. I had to put “6AM” after Spike Lee. [“Spike Lee's”] prayer is really emotional, and the song after that opens you back up. I had to focus on how I felt playing the music and [what fit while] listening to the track list. One day I was rearranging it and I put “Stumblin',” “Skit,” “MAVKAST,” “Spike Lee,” [and thought] “that's perfect.” It flies by, and you're at the end in two seconds. The last two features were “MAVKAST” and Vince Staples. I wanted him to be on the album. He wanted to be on the album. I went back later and added some shit, but it was pretty much finished. I think it is different when you move from a far place and you still have connections to people…I moved here and I didn't really have nobody. So it was like a lot of the bars with me venting just about how difficult that was. You could do it too,” on “On Time!” I said I still made it relative to the film. It's like they don't really know what I'm doing. Even on “truth?,” I said if they didn't want you in the end / they didn't want you to turn shit out.” Sometimes I think you feel like people not supporting you is the end of the road and it's not. People have their own lives, number one, and two, people don't know what's going on until a lot of noise [is] being made. I think waiting your turn and being humble and staying true to yourself is a lot of the message I was trying get across back home. Even on “Spike Lee,” “it's hard in my city to make a scene,” and I was just shouting out callbacks to my hometown and people there. Do you grapple with feeling supported or feeling like people aren't seeing what you're doing?Yeah. I want people just to be inspired, bro. I think I just saw a post recently that showed all the Bay Area up and coming artists and it was cool because they were like, damn, this is them. It was an accurate list, but niggas don't really do an accurate list because there are a lot of fire Bay Area artists who are really good at music, but they don't get enough shine because they're in the bay. I got lucky to be in the Bay and still blow up, but that's rare. What I did you haven't seen since Hieroglyphics and Souls of Mischief, where niggas stay in the hometown and still blow up. You don't got to just be a bad rapper. You ain't got to just be or whatever rapper. You can do a bunch of different things. How do you feel about the Bay Area hip-hop scene?Right now it's starting to become homogeneous in a sense where different sounds are melting from each other. You got almost inspirational Hyphy music or positive Hyphy, or even the street soulful…the worlds are starting to merge. The Bay Area is becoming a place where you have the Bay sound, but it has different versions of it and that's what I think niggas need. There was another bar on the record, something like, “niggas mad I didn't say shit about the Drake beef.” Were people tagging you on Twitter?Yeah. Whenever I mentioned something about the beef, niggas just tried to bait me. I haven't even met this nigga in person. Nigga was coming up to me like, “What do you think about the beef bro?” And I'm like, “[The] shit's funny. I don't even know what's going on really. Shit just dropping [and] I was there with y'all. I was seeing the shit play out. How are you handling higher visibility and more annoying fans, more good fans, just being famous in general?Niggas are just dumb. Not even in a battle…people just don't know what things are. So they judge very quickly and harshly when it's like, “Y'all don't even know what anything is.” The worst thing I get is like, “The nigga think he Outkast.” It's like, “No, bro. I wasn't even thinking about Outkast.” Mad Niggas do that shit. Bruiser Wolf, Potluck Hip-hop is in a comedy deficit. There are plenty of memable rappers (and unintentionally hilarious artists) but fewer who make it a point to have fun with their craft; too many artists take themselves a little too seriously. That's not the case with Bruiser Wolf, the Detroit rapper with a one-of-one penmanship and penchant for side-splitting bars. Bruiser Wolf is funny, but his skills are no joke. The 14-track project shows Bruiser exploring a variety of vocal approaches and beats, but still sounding like himself throughout. He rhymes with a vocal inflection and cadence that feels somewhere in between preacher, pimp, and standup comedian; his lyrical content feels like a mesh of all three. On “Write or Wrong,” he raps, “Bought Ritalin for my white-chocolate and vanilla friends/Bucket hat like Gilligan, fuck cancer, stay away from carcinogens,” and on “Air Fryer,' he rhymes, “My bitch ignoring me/I told her to do the same thing if questioned by the authorities.” He's in such mastery of his craft that he's able to get slippery with his flow on “Fancy”: “I asked my bookie what's the odds if I bеt on myself?/'Cause my past is dark, gothic/Everything I say sound good, it's melodic,” pausing on “everything” to connect ideas. For all of the superlatives and labels pervading rap discourse, Bruiser embodies one of the most special as the kind of MC you could listen to all day. But the proceedings aren't all random musings. “Offer I Couldn't Refuse” is a reflection on his past in the streets, while “Confusing,” is all about his travails about where he and his women “bump heads like puberty.” From the “Pee-wee Herman,” where he samples the classic show theme, to the beat switching on “Air Fryer” and “Baby you,” Bruiser Wolf reaffirms that there's no kind of beat he can't get his bars — and jokes — off on. McKinley Dixon's latest album is an excavation of magic's inarticulable vastness, as evident in the wonder of a disappearing trick as the static presence of the sky, which Dixon references on album standout “We're Outside, Rejoice.” The project is based on the story of three friends mourning their deceased friend and pondering how to bring him back to life. He belts, “I'll make it so my niggas never die Maybe escape if we take to skies and fly” on the sunny track. Do you feel the magic?” It's hard not to feel it throughout Magic, Alive, which is all happening on a soundbed crafted by instrumentalists who embody the magic of mastery. It's an album that begs to be played over big speakers (or better yet, heard live), exemplified by “Recitatif's” shift from a lush, sullen canvas into a surging production fusing rock and hip-hop elements. The project is shaped by so many disparate sounds, tones and lead instruments that it doesn't feel native to a particular region, feeding Dixon's fantastic vision. But as imaginative as things get, they don't veer too far from our current reality, with Dixon telling a range of stories about magic and joy as a balm for all-too-common grieving for Black communities. “It's so easy to write about death when none of y'all niggas is really alive,” he offers on album intro “Watch My Hands,” while also surmisng, “Be as strong as the concrete/But as fragile as when it and ya knees kiss.” Dixon rhymes with a poetic flourish that requires multiple listens to unravel, but his engaging mic presence keeps you. You never knew how warm an ode to a mother's fighting skills could be until you hear IceColdBishop on “All The Loved Ones (What Would We Do??? And on the Outro, LA rapper Blu lauds Dixon by rapping, “you showed me the importance of self-belief.” There are likely thousands of Dixon fans who co-sign that admission. Rocky Snyda, 10/10 Would RecommendRocky Snyda's latest project has been out since April, but as the adage goes, there's no new or old music, just music you have and haven't heard. Unfamiliar listeners should consider tapping in with the up-and-coming artist, who's been rapping since at least 2020. Her Facebook page notes, “I'm a musical theatre nerd who has always had a secret love for rap and the music industry.” That passion is no longer private, as she's steadily built a buzz in her native New York as a confident, charismatic rapper who's trained to go over any kind of beat. That's the vibe throughout 10/10 Would Recommend, an electronic-tinged album where she self-proclaimed “Princess of Flatbush” serves a little something for everybody. The project is a manifestation of her desire to display her musical versatility; she told Grownup Magazine that, “I've got my rocker side, my hip-hop side, my femme side,” which are all reflected on an album cover depicting her with five disparate looks. True to theme, she begins the album offering those different sides of her artistry on a song called, “Who Am I,” which primes the listener for the breadth of what to expect. The track starts with a haunting, synth-laden production where she switches her tone and inflection, rhyming in double-time before belting out her boasts in a more emphatic tone. The beat then switches to a more traditional house production where she crowns herself, “Ms. On “Gimme My 10s,” she gets busy over a clever flip of Cheryl Lynn's “Encore,” where producer LLC4 masters the balance of homage vs. laziness. It's apparent enough to be recognizable, but not leaned on as a crutch. Tracks like “Superstar,” “Weekender,” and “Rockyverse” follow similar sonic vibes, with an overt house influence and danceable drum programming. But on “Sneaky” she slows things down and delves into harmony, while she's “flippin my hair, shakin' my ass” on “Target Practice's” sparse, bassheavy beat. No matter the beat she rhymes (or croons) over, Rocky's lyrical skill and Brooklyn charm is apparent throughout 10/10.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Young women are vulnerable in the face of anti-medicine messaging and bogus wellness influencers, says Gabriel Shemirani, who lost his twin Paloma to dangerous untruths It's hard to explain what being a twin is like. My twin, Paloma, died last July at the age of 23. But Paloma didn't get the recommended treatment – because, in my view, she was blindsided by our mum's dangerous anti-medicine conspiracy theories. That's also the case for countless others targeted by influencers pushing medical misinformation on social media. Growing up, Alex Jones — an American conspiracy theorist who claimed the Sandy Hook school shooting was staged — was the soundtrack to Paloma and I being dropped off at school. The interest in conspiracy theories started with my dad, Faramarz; he's Iranian and, because of his upbringing, has a distrust of the US government due to negative foreign intervention. As children, you naturally absorb your parents' beliefs: suncream was suddenly ‘toxic' and it's embarrassing to admit, but at one point my older brother Sebastian and I were convinced the royal family were shape-shifting lizards. When Sebastian and I were watching conspiracy theory videos on YouTube and nodding along to what our parents told us, she didn't engage quite so much. Paloma was more interested in sewing her own clothes, playing board games and reading Spanish literature — or making me laugh. People didn't expect her to have such a goofy sense of humour, because of how she looked, but she loved making up  funny rap songs using Shakespearean language or playing weird little characters. But I found our parents' conspiracy theories were impossible to tap out of completely. The house was an extremely difficult environment to grow up in. Things intensified when Paloma and I were around 11 years old: our mum was diagnosed with breast cancer. This was 2012, and her mistrust of medicine had fully taken hold. At first, she went along with the doctor's advice and had surgery. But instead of follow-up chemotherapy or radiotherapy, from what I remember mum opted for a regime of juices, mistletoe injections and enemas, a much-disputed regime known as Gerson therapy*. She then started crediting this with her recovery rather than the operations. Mum began giving us ‘healing' juices, without telling us what was really in them, and describing herself as an ‘authentic' health warrior who had seen the ‘truth'. As my mum's conspiracy theory beliefs continued to ramp up and spiral out of control, my brother and I started to break away from her. As teenagers we tried to stay out of the family home as much as possible, and after spending more time around other people, Sebastian and I began to realise that perhaps the conspiracy theories that mum obsessed over weren't actually exposing ‘dark hidden truths' after all. Mum then began styling herself as ‘Kate Shemirani, the Natural Nurse in a toxic world' online (although her real name is Kay) and charged her ‘health and truth-seeking' followers over £100 for a personal consultation. Leaning into that religious aspect and language, mum labelled herself as a ‘true seer' with the power to highlight the ‘medical industry's corruption'. The pandemic saw my mum's online notoriety soar: she claimed the virus was a political tool to gain access to — and change — people's DNA through vaccines, and took part in a London rally which led to a Met Police investigation and to her being struck off the Nursing and Midwifery Council in 2021. Around that time, mum's accounts were banned from social media and she entered what I call ‘the wilderness years', where she was receiving less attention online. I could tell it impacted Paloma, who did want to be able to have the consistent loving relationship that Kay always withheld from her. After graduating, Paloma moved back into the family home with her. She was nervous, as, over the years their relationship had grown strained. Paloma told me how mum started demanding she pay rent, once even moving all of Paloma's stuff into storage after she spent a weekend away. But not long after, she began to experience chest pains. She then phoned me crying from the hospital, saying doctors believed she had non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a form of cancer that can be aggressive. I was told the medical team had given Paloma an 80% chance of being cured with chemotherapy. I also found out that when Paloma called our mum to tell her the updates, desperately wanting support, mum's mistrust of medicine was unleashed once more. Only this time, she wasn't making decisions about her own body. Initially, I believe mum showed Paloma the affection she'd always wanted — but also began to quickly press upon her the idea that chemotherapy was akin to ‘pumping mustard gas' into her body, when she was in a moment of extreme vulnerability. Mum, I suspect, would have promised Paloma that an ‘all-natural cure' would keep her fertility and hair intact too, tapping into understandable fears and using herself as a misleading example. She then gradually began to isolate Paloma from her social circle. Instead of traditional chemotherapy, Paloma was relying on fruit juices and infrared saunas to heal her. Ideas that mum had long broadcast to the world: she had been allowed properly back online when Twitter became X and reinstated her account. Before too long, mum was soon using my sister's illness as a narrative to lure followers in. Paloma died a few months later, in July last year. Paloma passed away after having a heart attack and spent several days on life support before the machine was switched off. We were in the middle of a legal case that I had launched, because I wanted an assessment of the appropriate medical treatment for my sister. In one X post, to her 81,000 followers, Kay — who I no longer call mum, as she doesn't fulfil the role of a mother in any way in my eyes — claims Paloma was ‘gaslit' by doctors and experimented on by medics. Kay even sent a text to one of Paloma's friends after she passed away, saying, “This way [without chemotherapy], Paloma is intact and beautiful with all of her organs as she wanted. Ultimately, she returned to it all on her own.” Kay has since issued a press statement with my dad, saying any allegations against the two of them are “state-sponsored propaganda designed to silence the truth of what happened to our daughter and reframe a preventable death as parental misconduct — despite overwhelming legal, medical and forensic documentation to the contrary.” She continues to deny that Paloma ever even had cancer. When Kay and my dad, Faramarz, were contacted by Cosmopolitan, both said that Paloma's death is a sensitive family matter, denied any wrongdoing, and stated they would pursue legal action if false statements were published. Kay stated, “I strongly reject every claim made against me, many of which are factually incorrect, deeply misleading, and legally actionable.” Faramarz sought to highlight that “Paloma's case is the subject of an ongoing police investigation and a forthcoming coroner inquest.” For the past year, I haven't been able to grieve properly. My life has been dominated by police, coroners, and lawyers. While some have been kind, others have not always treated me like someone whose sister, who had her whole life ahead of her, has just died. Paloma's death has also opened my eyes to bigger power structures at play in the world, and now it feels like my duty as a brother to speak out on her behalf. Conspiracy theorists, like my mother, scare people into thinking there's hidden evil in the world and present themselves as being the only ones honest and brave enough to bring it to light. Even though people took thalidomide back then, which caused birth defects. The other strand is more liberal, praising Goop, astrology, ‘trusting your intuition', and ‘dialling into your true self', sometimes at the expense of legitimate science. Both branches often have a (seemingly healthy) thin, white blonde woman as the poster child. Wellness conspiracy theorists recognise real issues, like contraceptive pills having side effects, and hijack them in different ways, encouraging the rejection of modern medicine as a way of ‘reclaiming bodily autonomy' or ‘clean living'. They dress up dangerous ideas as ‘female empowerment' and even though prior to her diagnosis I wasn't aware of Paloma actively buying into any of this, I can imagine these narratives would have been rattling around her subconsciousness. When trying Gerson therapy, Paloma did post about it on her Instagram account, sharing photos of berry porridge labelled as ‘food that cures' and infrared sauna blankets to ‘detox through sweat', and it was hard for friends to call it out as concerning. Since sharing Paloma's story, I've also received dozens of messages from people saying they've lost their sister, mother or friend to anti-medicine propaganda. A few people have mentioned dads and brothers, but it does mostly seem to be women. It has highlighted, to me, the subtle differences between men and women; if a woman talks about being ill or worries about her health, there's this element of ‘oh, the silly girl is a hypochondriac!' whereas if a man said the same thing, he'd be taken more seriously. I imagine that could also make ‘alternative' health approaches feel a lot more appealing to women. This mistrust of medicine – and obsession with ‘clean girl living'** — is like a dormant virus: it has the potential to grow from a passing interest to a real obsession, then when someone has a health event it can cause them to start questioning if trusting doctors is really the right thing to do. I don't want anyone else to experience a loss like mine because of that. I'd give the world to play a game with her now. To see her have the future she dreamed of and deserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anand Wilder released his solo debut album I Don't Know My Words in 2022, and last year he teamed with Dirty Projectors' Maia Friedman to cover Metric in honor Last Gang Records' 20th anniversary. Now the former Yeasayer member is back with news of a sophomore solo LP. Wilder on the genre-melding project: “I just want to keep making records in a reeling music industry. This one's about drawing inspiration anywhere I find it — myth, history, anthropology, satire, life's little indignities, or a pink keyboard my wife found on the street.” Psychic Lessons includes Wilder's recent psych-pop single “Appointment in Samarra” as well as today's new track “Bog People.” The song weaves rock guitars into a scrappy boom-bap beat, creating a '90s aesthetic mirrored by the music video's use of fisheye lens. Here's what he says about the song and its visuals: Walter Fancourt and I had made this sort of '90s sounding boy band inspired beat with screechy synth bends, so I just laid three chords over it and really went for it in a '90s alt-rock vein. And I hope the video captures some of that fisheye lens, VHS-style, '90s fun. Directed by Patrick Drummond (Starcleaner Reunion), with some extra footage shot by my seven-year-old daughter Zazie and childhood friend Bernard Feinsod, I wanted it to look like a '90s Beastie Boys video or something. So it's kind of like a conversation between a know-it-all museum tour guide and a horrified museumgoer with scraps of anthropological history describing all these little details from what we think we know about this ritual sacrifice, combined with my poetic conjecture trying to get inside the minds of the people. 01 “Appointment In Samarra” 02 “Broken Beyond Repair” 03 “Molly's Song” 04 “Darling Please” 05 “Social Exile” 06 “Give Us A Wink” 07 “Tech Job” 08 “Selkie Bride” 09 “He Believed In It” 10 “Get A Dog” 11 “Bog People” 12 “Living Beside You” Lauryn Hill Closed Essence Fest To An “Empty” Superdome At 3:37 AM</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thrills and chills continue to descend on the theatre industry with this new screen-to-stage adaptation. Following a sold out run at Leeds Playhouse in the U.K. last summer, the stage play has set a North American tour for this fall, with stops planned at Chicago Shakespeare Theatre; Center Theatre Group in Los Angeles; Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C.; and American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco. The original Paranormal Activity film, released in 2009, reimagined the found footage genre for a new generation, grossing nearly $200 million worldwide and kicking off a blockbuster franchise spanning six sequels. Said Barrett, "I'm so thrilled that Paranormal will have a chance to ensnare and unnerve audiences in London later this year! From seeing the advertising campaign of the film 20 years ago, where you watched cinema audiences leap out of their chairs in horror, I have long wondered how you could recreate that visceral reaction in a theatre setting. How do you bring one of the most frightening films to life? How do you break the inherent safety that a plush West End theatre offers? It's been an incredible challenge, and we cannot wait to see how London audiences respond!" The London production will include Fly Davis as set and costume designer, illusions by Chris Fisher, Anna Watson as lighting designer, Gareth Fry as sound designer, video design by Luke Halls, and casting by Stuart Burt and Ginny Schiller. Paranormal Activity is produced by Simon Friend & Hanna Osmolska for Melting Pot in association with Gavin Kalin, Ken Davenport, Patrick Gracey, Jonathan & Rae Corr, and Leeds Playhouse. Thrills and chills continue to descend on the theatre industry with this new screen-to-stage adaptation. Also back are original stars Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, and Stanley Tucci. Due to the expansive nature of Off-Broadway, this list is not comprehensive.

Quietly, Wednesday replies, “Enid dies and it's all my fault.” The scene cuts to Wednesday's vision: She's in a graveyard next to a headstone that reads “In memory of Enid Sinclair,” and Enid appears, putting her hands around Wednesday's throat and shouting, “I died because of you!” In voiceover as the trailer continues, Wednesday says, “Secrets are the bedrock of the Addams family.

A Chinese football club has been fined 30,000 yuan ($4,100) for attempting to channel evil spirits by placing paper talismans in the opponent team's locker room.

Changchun Xidu FC, who play in China League Two, have been found guilty of placing “a number of feudal superstitious items in the away team's dressing room” before their match on June 28, in a bid to increase their chances of winning. Photos widely shared on Chinese social media showed yellow paper charms inscribed with messages like: “By decree, Shanxi Chongde Ronghai must be defeated.” Known as ‘fu', the use of paper charms is a Taoist practice believed to use spirit energy to bring good fortune, but it can also be abused to cause harm and misfortune to others.

After analyzing the evidence, the Chinese Professional Football League (CFL) ruled that Changchun Xidu FC used “feudal superstition items” to increase their chances of winning and fined the club 30,000 yuan ($4,100), vowing to “resolutely and seriously deal with all kinds of violations of regulations and disciplines in accordance with the provisions of the Discipline and Ethics Code.”



Changchun went on to win the game against Shanxi Chongde Ronghai by 2-0, cementing their second position in the league, but the team's success was overshadowed by the controversy surrounding the paper talismans and revelations that this wasn't the first time away teams found such charms in their locker room when playing Xidu FC.
