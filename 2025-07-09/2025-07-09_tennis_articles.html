                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Djokovic defeated 23-year-old Cobolli after Sinner battled through an elbow issue to win his tie with Ben Shelton The Wimbledon quarter-finals rolled on today, with Novak Djokovic continuing his bid for a record-equalling eighth title, after fans found out just how healthy world No 1 Jannik Sinner is. Sinner took on Ben Shelton after advancing in bizarre circumstances on Monday, when the Italian trailed Grigor Dimitrov by two sets to love before the latter had to withdraw due to injury. Sinner actually fell during the very first game against Dimitrov, injuring his elbow and having to limit his practising on Tuesday after undergoing an MRI scan. But he looked as good as new on Wednesday, downing 10th seed Shelton in straight sets on No 1 Court. Djokovic, meanwhile, faced another 23-year-old Italian in Flavio Cobolli, who had been flying this week. The youngster knocked out former finalist Marin Cilic in the fourth round, sparking emotional scenes among his family members, and he took the first set from Djokovic but was downed in four. And in the women's quarter-finals today, 18-year-old Mirra Andreeva saw her remarkable run come to an end at the hands of Belinda Bencic. That result came after Iga Swiatek's victory, as the five-time major winner reached a first Wimbledon semi-final by overcoming 19th seed Liudmila Samsonova. Follow all the latest tennis updates, scores and results from Wimbledon below. Aryna Sabalenka [1] vs Amanda Anisimova (USA) [13] – ladies' semi-finals Belinda Bencic (SUI) vs Iga Swiatek (POL) [8] – ladies' semi-finals Sem Verbeek (NED) & Katerina Siniakova (CZE) vs Joe Salisbury (GBR) & Luisa Stefani (BRA) – mixed doubles final “Wimbledon remains the most special tournament we have in our sport. “Another thing that makes me feel very young is competing with youngsters. That's what happens when you play on the grass, I didn't fall so far this year. It did come at an awkward moment, somehow I found some big serves.” I played him once last year on hard courts, we practiced quite a bit. “I knew he was playing well, it's obviously different playing an official match, he played at a very high level. His serve really surprised me, he's definitely one of the guys we'll be seeing in the future once more” The Serb is through to another Wimbledon semi-final - his seventh in a row. A huge standing ovation for the Italian as he leaves Centre Court! Big serve from Djokovic, and Cobolli's return sets up Djokovic for an inside-out forehand, which is too much for the young Italian. Another fine serve from Djokovic eases him to 30-0. Cobolli gets on the board in this game, though, with a jumping smash! Uh-oh... Djokovic moves one way, and a net cord for Cobolli takes his shot the other. Worry here for a few moments, but Novak is back up. Some big-hitting from Djokovic gets him to 30-30, before Cobolli's backhand lets him down again and he smashes into the net.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 20-time Wimbledon champion attempted to dine at The Ivy Cafe on Tuesday but was turned away because of her furry companion. Navratilova, who feared she could lose her U.S. citizenship, took the snub to social media, posting a picture outside the establishment with Lulu cozily nestled in a handbag. Navratilova tweeted: "Well - tried to have dinner at the Ivy at Wimbledon, but they won't allow Lulu into the restaurant - so plan B." Serving as part of the BBC's Wimbledon commentary team this month, she later revealed that she enjoyed a pasta meal at Cent Anni, an Italian eatery nearby. Navratilova's tweet has since gone viral, amassing over 1.6 million views, sparking a debate among X users in the comments. Navratilova replied, underscoring their unawareness of her identity: "They had no idea. Enforcement of a no-pet policy triggered mixed reactions online, with one user expressing support, stating: "Ew. Tennis legend Navratilova, involved in the incident due to her dog Lulu, quipped in response: "She is on the floor. Navratilova's barred entry with her pet sparked controversy among tennis enthusiasts. A supporter advocating for her privileges at Wimbledon reasoned: "Martina cannot be in? Martina should be allowed in any place of this universe where the word tennis is recognised.." At Wimbledon this year, serving as a commentator, Navratilova shared a humorous exchange with BBC's Nick Mullins before commentating on Mirra Andreeva's triumph over Emma Navarro. A throwback aired by BBC to Conchita Martinez's defeat of Navratilova in the 1994 finals prompted an amusing reaction from her. Narrating an interesting Wimbledon fact, Nick Mullins noted: "Now 47 years ago to the day, July 7, 1978, Martina Navratilova won the first of her nine Wimbledon singles titles," and he recognized her victory against Chris Evert. Surprised and pleased, Navratilova replied: "I did not know that it was the same day but yeah we are now a week later so that's why it's happening like this but a nice reminder, thank you very much."</p>

Defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz has made it through to the semis. Defending champ Iga Swiatek was knocked out in her semis match by the top seed of the women's tournament, Aryna Sabalenka — who will face No. In the U.S., coverage of this year's tournament is airing on TNT and truTV, and every match is streaming live on HBO Max. The 2025 French Open will take place between May 25 and June 8. Singles play begins May 25, with the men's final closing things out on June 8. In a shift from last year, the 2025 Roland-Garros tennis tournament will air across TNT and truTV — with all matches streaming on Max (soon to be officially re-named HBO Max). If you don't already have access to these platforms, this is a great option that really covers your bases, streaming-wise. You'll get access to three vast libraries, fully stocked with everything MCU, all those Disney princesses (new and old), Hulu's robust catalog of shows on-demand the day after they air, including the latest episodes of Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and more, and the most recent seasons of The Last of Us, The Pitt and White Lotus. While Sling doesn't offer a free trial these days, the tournament will last longer than any free trial anyway. With Sling Blue, you can get access to French Open coverage on TNT and truTV. Sling also has an option to bundle Max in with your Sling Orange + Blue subscription and save $5 on the overall price, in case you want to watch games via Max and take advantage of all the channels offered in the Sling Orange + Blue combo package. If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV. Don't live in either of those places? A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user. ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Djokovic sends his first return of serve long before doing the same with a ground-stroke in the next rally. He, once again, appears to be struggling with the sun in that far left corner. The Serbian's next return of serve finds the net before Cobolli secures a rapid hold to love with a forehand winner. Cobolli drags his first return of serve wide but then hits a fantastic winner to draw level at 15-15. The Italian catches the net with a forehand and drops to one knee for a moment, before pushing himself up with his racket. He then drags a backhand well wide, to fall 40-15 behind, but is let back into the game by a Djokovic double-fault. The Serbian recovers wonderfully with a big serve down the middle that his opponent can barely get a racket to. Some angry words from Djokovic to his box, though. After losing that game, Djokovic flung his racket high up into the evening sky. Djokovic goes for the lob and it brings about the wild smash from Cobolli that goes well wide. But it won't matter for the Italian as Djokovic pushes a return long before sending his racket into the sky in frustration. A couple of boos in response from the crowd. After Cobolli receives some more vigorous treatment from the medic on his right thigh, we are back underway. A serve from Djokovic doesn't make it back from Cobolli but the 23-year-old whips a lovely forehand winner into the corner to make it 40-15. The Serbian responds with an ace for a routine hold. No one can accuse Cobolli of surrendering. This is an Italian committed to the scrap, putting Djokovic back on his heels. Cobolli looked down and out at 2-0 in this third set but he is right back in this contest now. A big serve down the middle is unreturned and it's a second-successive hold to love for the Italian. During the changeover, there is a bit of concern for Cobolli as he brings the trainer on to do some work on his leg, it is unclear what exactly is the issue. After a lengthy exchange of ground-strokes during the next point, the Serbian once again catches the net with a forehand and appears to be struggling with the sun in his eyes in that far left corner. A big serve down the middle is returned long by Cobolli before Djokovic gets lucky as his backhand clips the net and evades the Italian, making it 30-30. Djokovic makes the smashed winner at the net to take a 40-30 lead but he drags a forehand wide to make it deuce. He then pushes a forehand long to set up the break point for Cobolli and it's taken as the Italian rips a forehand winner into the corner with his return of serve. An ace completes a crucial hold to love for Cobolli, as he wins his first game in eight. Djokovic shows sensational defence to stay in the point at the start of this next game and he gets his rewards as Cobolli eventually catches the net. The 23-year-old's return of serve on the next point drifts well long and Djokovic is absolutely flying now.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With no more than five sets in Grand Slam events on the men's side, fans typically can estimate how long a match will take, even it goes the distance. Time and time again, players have defied the odds on the biggest stages in tennis and turned a match into a marathon. While revised tiebreaker rules make it a bit more difficult today to play an enormously long match, the best of the best going toe-to-toe has still made for some grueling battles. Here's a look at the longest tennis matches in Grand Slam history. The longest match in any Grand Slam event belongs to John Isner and Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon in 2010 — and good luck breaking their record. It was a first round match, so Isner still had to overcome the exhaustion if he wanted to make a deep run. Instead, he was quickly dispatched by Thiemo de Bakker in the second round, losing 6-0, 6-3, 6-2. MORE: Why is there a curfew at Wimbledon? MORE: Tennis' top Grand Slam winners of all time Before Wimbledon implemented new rules to shorten the length of tiebreakers, Isner was involved in another marathon match in the tournament. Santoro took the first two sets and had a real chance to close out Clement in straight sets, but his fellow Frenchman battled back and forced a fifth set, where Santoro won 16-14 to reach the second round. Did a six-hour match really happen if almost no one was there to see it? The 2020 French Open was played with an extremely limited number of fans due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but Lorenzo Giustino and Corentin Moutet put on a show in the first round with a match that spanned just over six hours. Despite failing to win a single point in the first set, Giustino narrowly prevailed in the second and third sets before later winning a tense fifth set and advancing. Giustino fell to Diego Schwartzman in the second round. MORE: Like it or not, Novak Djokovic is the GOAT of men's tennis Instead, just about every game was grueling, with Djokovic nearly closing it out in four sets before Nadal narrowly survived and forced the decisive set. Djokovic ultimately won a war of attrition, defeating Nadal for the third consecutive Grand Slam final. "Physically it was the toughest match I ever played, if not tougher. I am tired," Nadal said after the loss, with Djokovic agreeing that it was one of the most taxing matches of his career.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek is into her very first Wimbledon semifinal after a straight-sets victory over Liudmila Samsonova on No. Iga Swiatek has broken new ground on grass. 8 seed Swiatek of Poland is into her very first Wimbledon semifinal after a 6-2, 7-5 quarterfinal victory over No. "Match by match, my confidence, for sure, went up so that I can use it on this championship. "Just happy with the work that I've been doing and proud of myself, yeah." Five-time Grand Slam champion Swiatek, who has spent 125 weeks ranked World No. 1 in her career, needed 1 hour and 49 minutes to overcome first-time Grand Slam quarterfinalist Samsonova. Swiatek remains undefeated against Samsonova, now leading their head-to-head 5-0. Growth on the turf: This has to stand as Swiatek's career-best grass-court swing. She's gone 8-1 on the surface this year -- the first time she has attained that many wins on grass in a calendar year. After not having made a Hologic WTA Tour final for over a year, Swiatek made her first-ever grass-court final two weeks ago in Bad Homburg (finishing runner-up to Jessica Pegula). Now she has made the final four at Wimbledon for the first time, eclipsing her previous best Wimbledon result, when she reached the 2023 quarterfinals before losing to Elina Svitolina. This result makes Swiatek the fourth active player to reach the semifinals at all four Grand Slam events, joining three other players who have been World No. 1: Aryna Sabalenka, Victoria Azarenka and Karolina Pliskova. Bencic awaits: Swiatek will face World No. "I can only imagine how hard it is to come back after pregnancy," Swiatek said. "For sure she has the game to play well here on grass. Yeah, I never doubted that she can't come back after pregnancy. 4 was a perfect 10-for-10 when she got her first serve into play in the opening frame. However, Samsonova made her move at nearly the last possible moment, finding more margin on her rocket groundstrokes. Samsonova came all the way back in that game, pulling back on serve at 4-3 with a forehand return winner. Suddenly, the second set became a real battle, with some excellent angles from Samsonova forcing errors from the former World No.1. At 5-5, Swiatek had to fight back from 0-30 down to keep herself in front -- but she did so with some powerful forehands of her own. On her second match point, Swiatek fired a return winner to seal victory and become the first Polish woman to make the Wimbledon semifinals since Agnieszka Radwanska in 2015. "Obviously if your opponent is winning two games in a row and is breaking you back, you need to change something 'cause you can't let her keep winning," Swiatek said. Five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek is into her very first Wimbledon semifinal after a straight-sets victory over Liudmila Samsonova on No.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool came up clutch when it mattered most on Wednesday at Wimbledon, where they saved three match points to sink defending champions Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten 6-4, 4-6, 7-6(8) The British stars are now riding a 12-match winning streak into the semi-finals at SW19, having won consecutive grass-court titles at Queen's Club and Eastbourne. Serving at 5-6, 0/40 in the third set, Cash fired two unreturned serves before Glasspool hit a sumptuous drop volley to save a third consecutive match point, and they then served out the game to force a Match Tie-break. “We have learned a lot about each other and what each other needs,” Cash said of his partnership with Glasspool. The confidence that we have built, especially over this grass period, really helps in those moments and keeps us calmer than we normally would be. The fifth seeds made their team debut in August 2024 and have since won five tour-level trophies together. They will face a semi-final meeting with Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos. “We are on 12 matches [unbeaten], I have never done that in my life before. Cash and Glasspool are third in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings, now just 575 points behind second-placed Heliovaara and Patten.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CENTRE COURT, THE ALL ENGLAND CLUB — Mirra Andreeva, the 18-year-old Russian, was determined to cast one of her spells over Wimbledon and turn the All England Club into another of her party spaces. Bencic, the Tokyo Olympic gold medalist from Switzerland who is playing her first season after giving birth to her first child, matched Andreeva shot for shot in a duel of hard, spinning power that turned in the final moments of both sets. It ended with Bencic charging into her first Wimbledons semifinal 7-6(3), 7-6(2), where she will face Iga Świątek. And there were plenty of those from Andreeva, who tried to attack Bencic with her hard, slicing forehands. But Bencic picked up enough of them and turned enough points around her way to snuff out Andreeva's precocious efforts to put the sport back in teenage hands, something that has become increasingly rare in women's tennis lately. “She's 18 years old and she's performing at the biggest stage,” Bencic said of Andreeva in her on-court interview. Two days ago, she lived her dream of seeing Roger Federer in the flesh as she won her fourth-round match against Emma Navarro in front of him. On Wednesday, though, she couldn't come up with the goods when she has so often all year: in those crucial moments when tight matches go one way or the other. She played her worst points in the first-set tiebreak, missing two backhands early. One was a sitter from close range. On the next point, Bencic showed her how it is done, jumping on a second serve and thumping her backhand return so deep Andreeva couldn't catch up with it. Andreeva, though, hates to leave a good party early. She broke Bencic right back to extend the match, frustrating her with an endless series of forehand slices. Andreeva tried the forehand slice once more, but it floated long. A double fault gave Bencic four match points. All she needed was one, finishing it with easy overhead. The Andreeva party was over, but a Swiss one – there have been a bunch of those on this court – was just getting started. He is currently writing a book about tennis, "The Cruelest Game: Agony, Ecstasy and Near Death Experiences on the Pro Tennis Tour," to be published by Doubleday in 2026.</p>

World number one Aryna Sabalenka and American 13th seed Amanda Anisimova will contest the other semi-final. All Britons out of Wimbledon singles - what did we learn? It has been a remarkable year for Bencic, who won the Abu Dhabi Open in February just 10 months after giving birth to her daughter Bella. In a match of long, intense rallies the pair could barely be separated. Andreeva immediately responded to force what felt like an inevitable tie-break as her coach Conchita Martinez – a former Wimbledon champion herself – watched on with an anxious look on her face in the coaching box. But Andreeva's nerves seemed to get the better of her and a double fault handed Bencic four match points and she took her chance at the second opportunity. Former world number one Swiatek showed her battling qualities to come out on top of a tricky second set and beat Liudmila Samsonova 6-2 7-5 to reach her first Wimbledon semi-final.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was a decision that came after days of reflection, following the hard-fought first-round defeat against Carlos Alcaraz, which he took to the fifth set with grit and pride. "This is the best way to say goodbye ," said Fognini, " after that match I don't want to play again. Born in 1987, Fognini won nine ATP titles, including the prestigious triumph at the Monte-Carlo Masters 1000 in 2019, the high point of a career that has always come with personality and passion. "These are all things that played against it. I think it also takes courage to say enough, in a beautiful setting: with Alcaraz it was a defeat-victory that I have never experienced so intensely. "This sport has accompanied me throughout my life and will continue to do so. I will always keep so many good memories. I played in the era of Djokovic, Nadal and Federer. I was lucky to live through this era. I am happy to say goodbye at this time. My dream would have been to finish next year in Monte Carlo, where I won the tournament, but this is life. However, I am happy to say goodbye to my professional career, I did my best even if it was not always easy." "You journalists got to know me, we clashed, the relationship with you I would change if I could go back because it played against me. Emotionally, he also recounted a touching moment: 'At the end of the match I cried a little together with my family, right now I am struggling to find the words. I'm happy that my son Federico saw his dad play against one of his idols, he even received Carlitos' shirt as a gift'. On that occasion, he had left the door open to a definitive decision, but his heart seemed to have already chosen: 'It's not a definitive decision yet, but I couldn't ask for something more beautiful, I didn't think I could play a match like that'.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whether it's Wimbledon or the lowest-rung tournament in tennis' minor leagues, there aren't any shortcuts to getting in. You can only advance to the next level by winning. Unless, of course, you're billionaire hedge fund guy Bill Ackman. On Wednesday afternoon, the 59-year old founder of Pershing Square Capital Management will suit up at the Hall of Fame Open in Newport, Rhode Island, indulging his sports fantasy while making a mockery of the tournament and the ATP Challenger Tour where players strive to eke out a living. "I am playing the best tennis of my life," Ackman wrote last week on X, where he posts frequently about politics and is often far-too-eager to embrace ridiculous conspiracy theories. Including the idea that he belongs in a pro tennis event. He's a bit of a gadfly on tour, befriending several players and helping bankroll the Professional Tennis Players Association when it was launched in 2019 by Novak Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil. He says he practices nearly every day, seems to be in good shape for a 59-year old and, because of his access to top players, has found himself on the other side of the net from all-time greats like Roger Federer in informal hitting sessions. And still, there is no deeper story to what's happening in Newport this week other than exactly what it looks like: A wealthy tennis benefactor who started playing seriously a decade ago using his privilege to say he competed in a pro tour event. We can be honest about how gross that is – both in Ackman's desire to make it happen and the ATP's willingness to humor him. According to Ackman's social media posts, former Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios had proposed playing doubles together at one point, but ongoing injury issues delayed their partnership indefinitely. It's simply the privilege of being Bill Ackman. Even though entrants for every tournament on the ATP or Challenger Tour level must meet a rankings threshold or earn a spot through a qualifying event, every tournament reserves a handful of wildcards that can be given out at its discretion. The wildcard system isn't perfect and sometimes creates controversy, but in general they're used for reasonable purposes: An accomplished player who lost their ranking due to injury and is trying to come back, an up-and-coming star with local ties, a highly-ranked player who didn't enter initially but decided to play at the last minute. There's just one little issue: Sock, 32, is a pickleball player and podcaster now. His last professional tennis match was at the U.S. Open in 2023, and there is no indication that he's planning a comeback. Also interesting: In an interview with Front Office Sports last week, Ackman said he had never even met Sock but that they were going to begin practicing together last weekend. So Sock – out of the blue, apparently – requested a wildcard from Newport even though his tennis career has long been over. The tournament granted it, and Sock listed Ackman as his doubles partner. Which, again, the tournament allowed even though you can't find results on Ackman in any of the public tennis databases kept by the USTA or Universal Tennis Rating (UTR). One truly wonders – unless, of course, you know how the world works. But that's not how tennis is supposed to work. But this isn't a golf pro-am. And as long as we have pro sports, you'd like them to be played by professionals and not exist for the whims of potential benefactors who have a ton of money and a delusion about how good they are at playing tennis. It's a bad look, and it certainly doesn't help the image of a sport that does not necessarily deserve its country club reputation. The top two men's players, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, both emerged from middle class backgrounds. Djokovic grew up flat-out poor in a war-torn country. And even for those who had advantages like Jessica Pegula, whose parents own the Buffalo Bills, there's no faking it in tennis. You can't use your social media fame or friendships or wealth to buy your way onto the pro tour.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Fritz's Wimbledon journey continues to roll on and two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz awaits him in the semi-final. Fritz, who overcame ‘scary' Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard and Gabriel Diallo in the early rounds, beat Karen Khachanov in straight sets to advance to the blockbuster match against Alcaraz. Fritz has only won one match in seven when playing Alcaraz or Sinner. His lone win came against Sinner back in 2021 at Indian Wells, the American winning 6-4 6-3. So I think, I mean that's just it, just the level of tennis they're playing and then being such great players makes me want to, you know, improve.” He said: “I'm not sure, they're just really good. “That's kind of the only way I know to get better.” Following his semi-final appearances in Stuttgart, Eastbourne and Wimbledon, Fritz broke an ATP Tour record. Fritz is now the first American to reach three ATP-level semi-finals on grass in a calendar year since the inaugural ATP Tour season in 1990. 1 – Since the inaugural ATP Tour season in 1990, Taylor Fritz (Stuttgart, Eastbourne, Wimbledon) is now the first American to reach three ATP-level semi-finals on grass in a calendar year. Fritz could become the first American man to reach the Wimbledon men's singles final since 2009, when Andy Roddick lost a marathon five-set match to Roger Federer. He is also looking to break a 25-year unwanted streak for American male tennis players. No American player has won the men's singles title since Pete Sampras in 2000.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fritz won two grass court titles coming into Wimbledon this year at ATP 250 tournaments in Stuttgart and Eastbourne. The American has been able to bring this form into the grass court major, with Fritz reaching his first Wimbledon semi-final. Although Fritz is now beating most players on grass, there was once a time that he lost to a wildcard who has now announced his retirement. The 2022 grass court summer saw the rise of Dutch player Tim van Rijthoven, who had never won a main ATP Tour match before at 25 years old. He would win his first ATP Tour match against Matthew Ebden before shocking the likes of Fritz, Hugo Gaston, and Felix Auger-Aliassime to become an unlikely finalist. Van Rijthoven would complete his dream week by beating Daniil Medvedev to become the first Dutch male winner of the Libema Open in 19 years. After winning his first ever title, Van Rijthoven was rewarded with a wildcard for Wimbledon and took advantage of it by reaching the fourth round in his first main draw appearance in a Grand Slam. Van Rijthoven's dream would come to an end at the hands of top seed Novak Djokovic, who would go on to win the title. Van Rijthoven played his last match in Roland Garros qualifying and has now announced his retirement from professional tennis in an emotional statement on Instagram. With a heavy heart, I have to share something today that I have been trying to process for a long time: My professional tennis career is forced to end,” announced the 28-year-old. “I would have liked to see it differently. I would have liked to say goodbye on my own terms, with a racket in hand and the audience in the stands. “Yet I look back with an incredible amount of pride and gratitude. From a little boy in mama's arms with big dreams to this. “And of course the fourth round at Wimbledon, where I got the opportunity to compete against a living legend: Novak Djokovic on Centre Court. “I want to thank everyone who supported me on this journey: my family, team, coaches, physios, sponsors and fans. I don't know exactly what will happen next, but I do know that my heart will always stay with tennis. A post shared by Tim van Rijthoven (@timvrijthoven) Despite losing to Djokovic, Van Rijthoven would take a set away from the man who would go on to win his seventh Wimbledon title that year. After beating the Dutchman, Djokovic was full of praise for Van Rijthoven in his post-match press conference. “I knew coming into the match that it was always going to be a tough, challenging matchup against Tim, who I've never faced before,” Djokovic said at the time. Was a very good fight, especially in the first two sets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner's coach, Darren Cahill, has provided a key update on the Italian star's elbow injury following his Wimbledon Round of 16 win over Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov — a match that ended prematurely with Dimitrov retiring due to a pectoral injury. During the match, Sinner took a hard fall onto his right elbow, which caused visible discomfort, especially while serving. Although he pushed through the pain to book a spot in the quarterfinals against American Ben Shelton, concerns grew after he canceled his planned practice session the next morning and went for an MRI. The missed training session raised eyebrows and sparked speculation among fans about whether the World No. 1 would be fit for the Grand Slam quarterfinal clash. However, in an interview with ESPN, Cahill downplayed concerns and said there was "nothing out of the ordinary" about Sinner's condition. "So [coach] Simone [Vagnozzi] and I just fed him a few balls out of the basket." Cahill — who has coached legends like Lleyton Hewitt and Andre Agassi — added that indoor hitting sessions are fairly common during Wimbledon. Agassi used to do it all the time. We've done that for a couple of years, so it wasn't unusual.” 2 Carlos Alcaraz became the first player to reach the semifinals after dispatching Britain's Cameron Norrie 6-2, 6-3, 6-3 in clinical fashion. "I'm really happy with the level I played today against a really difficult player like Cam." 5 Taylor Fritz, who survived a major scare in his quarterfinal match against Karen Khachanov. I've never had a match just flip so quickly," Fritz said. Meanwhile, the winner of the quarterfinal clash between Sinner and Shelton will go on to face either 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic or fellow Italian Flavio Cobolli in the semifinals.</p>

Cruz, 16, who is ranked 45th in the world junior standings, drew attention to himself for speaking in between points, with most assuming his comments were directed at his father, who was attempting to coach him from the stands.
