            Finland has detained a ship and its crew after a critical undersea telecommunication cable connecting the country to Estonia was damaged Wednesday, Finnish authorities said.
    


            Finnish police said in a statement that the vessel suspected of causing the damage was found with its anchor chain lowered into the sea in Finland's waters, while the damage site itself was in Estonia's waters. The police later named the vessel as the Fitburg, a Saint Vincent and the Grenadines flagged cargo ship.
    


            The Finnish National Police Commissioner Ilkka Koskimäki said at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon that all 14 members of the ship's crew have been detained, adding that the crew are citizens of Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.
    


            Incidents like this have become more frequent in recent years, raising suspicions they are the result of sabotage and prompting NATO to launch a project earlier this year specifically aimed at strengthening the protection of critical undersea infrastructure.
    


            According to MarineTraffic, which tracks ship movements, the Fitburg departed the Russian port of St. Petersburg on Tuesday and was headed to Haifa in Israel.
    


            After the damage was reported, Finnish authorities instructed the ship to stop and raise its anchor, and then took control of it, the police said.
    


            Finnish media reported that the ship was seized by special forces police and the coast guard from helicopters.
    


            Finland's President Alexander Stubb said that the government was monitoring the situation closely and that Finland was “prepared for security challenges of various kinds.”
    


            The police said they were investigating the incident as aggravated criminal damage, attempted aggravated criminal damage, and aggravated interference with telecommunications.
    


            The cable that was damaged runs between the Finnish capital Helsinki and the Estonian capital Talinn. While the extend of the damage was not immediately clear, the incident was serious enough to cause faults that were detected by the Finnish telecommunications provider Elisa, which operates the link.
    


            Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said he spoke to his Estonian counterpart Kristen Michal about the situation, adding that the two countries were cooperating on the issue.
    


            Estonia's Ministry of Justice and Digital Affairs said in a statement that the country's connections remained sufficiently backed up through other sea and land cables, ensuring the continuity of all services.
    


            The ministry said that a second cable, owned by the Swedish company Arelion, was also damaged.
    


            At least 10 undersea cables have been cut or damaged in the Baltic Sea since 2023. Some officials from Scandinavia, the Baltic states and the European Union have pointed the finger at Russia. They say the incidents appear to be part of what experts say is the Kremlin's hybrid war on the West.
    


            Russia has consistently denied involvement, but some of the ships that have caused damage to the undersea infrastructure in the past were found to have links to Russia.
    


            Last year, a Baltic Sea power cable and several data cables were damaged after a Cook Islands-registered vessel dragged its anchor through the seabed for more than 50 miles.
    


            Finnish and European officials said the ship, Eagle-S, was part of Russia's shadow fleet of fuel tankers, and Finland later charged members of its crew. However, a court in Helsinki dismissed the case in October, saying Finland did not have jurisdiction over the issue.

            When Greg Pryer served in the Marine Corps three decades ago and then worked as a New York City police officer who experienced the trauma of September 11, alcohol was his go-to coping mechanism.
    


            After retiring from the NYPD in 2015, his drinking habit only worsened, he said. Without the job, he had no structure or direction, just time, memories and the bottle.
    


            “I went from being a veteran and being in law enforcement, over 20 years of really having an obvious purpose, and retirement somewhat stripped me of my identity,” said Pryer, who retired as a sergeant. “All I had, in a way, was my alcohol to deal with it.”
    


            With liquor running his life, Pryer was arrested in 2019 on weapons and driving while intoxicated charges, and again in 2022 on similar weapons charges, in New York's Suffolk County, on Long Island. He had been in courtrooms plenty of times as a cop. Being in one as a defendant was a difficult reality to accept.
    


            Because of his military service, Pryer was eligible to have his cases transferred to the Suffolk County Veterans Treatment Court. A specialized part of the local court system, vets court helps troubled service members get into drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs and mental health counseling in lieu of doing jail time. Veterans who complete their court-monitored treatments can have their sentences reduced, or charges dropped.
    


            “Yes, it'll help out your legal situation, but it's also a chance to work on yourself, whatever that underlying issue that brought you into the legal system to begin with,” Pryer said. “It's really a blessing that the court picked me up.”
    


            For 15 years, hundreds of struggling vets like Pryer have received a lifeline through Suffolk's veterans treatment court, run by those who served just like they did. Today, nearly 750 similar programs are found in 49 states, according to Department of Veterans Affairs data.
    


            Like so many fellow veterans, Pryer was not aware of the treatment court's existence until he wound up in the criminal justice system.
    


            “I had to learn the hard way,” Pryer said.
    


            The country's first specialized court for vets started in 2008 in Buffalo, New York. Two years later, Judge John Toomey, a Vietnam War combat veteran, worked with the Suffolk district attorney's office, the local VA health care system and a small group of volunteers known as the Green Jackets to create the Suffolk County Veterans Treatment Court.
    


            The idea was so new it had no set guidelines or rules, providing Toomey and company freedom to develop their operation from scratch. Toomey, a two-time recipient of the Bronze Star, set a casual tone: He didn't wear a robe on the bench, knew veteran defendants by name, and talked with their families about life at home. He even gave out his phone number.
    


            “You had to put your trust that this is going to work out, and that this (person) is going to do the right thing,” Toomey said.
    


            It worked because the veterans in the program wanted to get better. Toomey said they could have gone through the regular court system, served a few months of jail time and gone right back to what they were doing before their arrest.
    


101-year-old WWII veteran inspires generations with his service



            The court accepts vets arrested for a gamut of crimes, including driving while intoxicated, misdemeanor and felony drug charges, robbery and criminal possession of weapons.
    


            “They made the decision they want to turn their lives around. They're sick of what's going on,” Toomey said. “It gives you an advantage in helping them.”
    


            To ensure accountability, the DA's office developed a screening process to evaluate eligible veterans. A small team of prosecutors who either served in the military or have a deep understanding of veterans' issues review criminal and combat history and other factors to assess whether they're a good fit for the program, according to a spokesperson for the DA's office.
    


            Once they're in the court, veterans participate in rehabilitation programs tailored to their individual needs. Varying in length depending on the charges, they include mental health and addiction counseling administered by the VA, with treatments managed by a VA counselor.
    


            They're also required to make regular court appearances so the judge can monitor their progress and adjust the individual's program as needed.
    


            Toomey left in 2018, and today Judge Pierce F. Cohalan presides.
    


            An Army reservist with a high-and-tight haircut, Cohalan keeps proceedings in the small, gray courtroom informal and personal, routinely asking defendants how he can help them. Like his predecessor, he doesn't wear a robe.
    


            For Cohalan, the program is about progress, not perfection. If participants make mistakes or relapse, they're not kicked out.
    


            Pryer, for example, first entered the program in 2019 following an arrest for criminal possession of a weapon and driving while intoxicated, then re-entered it after he was arrested on similar weapons charges in 2022.
    


            He was sentenced to three years of probation in April after completing veterans court, according to a court system spokesperson.
    


            “A number of participants misstep,” Cohalan said. “We're here to catch them or to pick them up, and to keep them moving forward.”
    


DHS Secretary Noem questioned about deported US veteran



            Navigating sobriety, court appearances, therapy and lawyers can be overwhelming.
    


            A volunteer group of vets uniformed in kelly green bomber jackets is there to help. The Green Jackets, mostly Vietnam vets, mentor and guide defendants through the process. Volunteer Grace Mehl, a 20-year veteran of the Navy, explained how shared experiences in combat or in the court allows participants to trust them, and, ultimately, to succeed.
    


            “The more they can talk to us about their issues, the more they get it off their chest, the more they can start to see answers,” Mehl said.
    


            Melissa, who asked for her last name not to be used, is a great example of how it works.
    


            “When she first came, she was a piece of work. She was just all over the place,” Mehl said.
    


            Two years ago, Melissa had an order of protection against her, wore an ankle monitor, used drugs. Her family wanted nothing to do with her. Melissa called her life “completely just a disaster.”
    


            After she was arrested for violating that protection order, Melissa said, she reluctantly accepted transferring to vets court, but wanted nothing to do with anyone in it. But Mehl and others eased her into the program, gained her trust and supported her as she trudged the road to recovery.
    


            “They just directed me toward where I was supposed to be. And step by step, they opened doors for me,” said Melissa, who served in the Navy in the 1990s.
    


            As of November, Melissa said, she was two years sober and reconnected with her mother, whom she talks with daily.
    


            Camaraderie is key to the success of the Suffolk veterans court, where former service members enact a new mission within the most elemental military tradition: having another soldier's back.
    


            The court boasts a 90% success rate for the hundreds of veteran participants, according to Cohalan.
    


            Frank D'Aversa, a Green Jackets founding member, has been with the court since its inception. Being shunned by World War II and Korean War veterans when he returned from Vietnam propelled him to get involved.
    


            His group operates on a simple conviction: “Never again will one generation of veterans abandon another,” D'Aversa said.
    


            Pryer, a D'Aversa mentee who served four years in the Marines, was recently invited to become a Green Jacket. For Pryer, 18 months sober and a two-time graduate of vets court, it's an opportunity to give back the gift he got in the program, to help vets through the system he's seen as both a lawman and a defendant.
    


            “I am honored to do it today,” he said.

Moscow's Defense Ministry has released a map showing the route of the Ukrainian long-range drones that targeted Russian President Vladimir Putin's residence in Novgorod Region early on Monday.

According to Moscow, Kiev launched 91 UAVs at the compound on the night of December 28-29. All of the incoming drones were destroyed before they could reach the residence.

The map released by the Defense Ministry on Wednesday shows the flight path of the UAVs, which were launched from several locations in Ukraine and flew north towards Russia's Novgorod Region through Bryansk, Smolensk and Tver regions.

According to the map, Russian air defenses shot down 49 drones above Bryansk Region, one above Smolensk Region and another 41 above Novgorod Region as they approached Putin's residence.

Later in the day, the Defense Ministry published footage showing the debris of one of the UAVs that had been used in the failed attack.

The ministry said in a statement that it has “presented irrefutable evidence of a terrorist attack planned by the Kiev regime on the Russian President's residence.”

The intentions of the Ukrainian government are confirmed by “fragments of drones shot down in Novgorod region, including those with warheads equipped with special striking elements designed to kill people,” the statement read.

The local eyewitness accounts of those who observed Russian air defenses at work “refute all attempts by Western and anti-Russian media outlets” to argue that there was “no evidence of a terrorist attack by the Kiev regime,” it said.

Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, who denies the drone raid on Putin's residence took place, is “either unaware of the actual situation or is simply lying as he usually does,” the ministry argued.

The Kremlin noted previously that the drone attack was targeted not only against Putin, but also “against [US] President [Donald] Trump's efforts to facilitate a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict.”

MOSCOW, December 31. /TASS/. It's too early to say that the Russian-EU dialogue is lost forever, because relations may change under a new European Commission, Vladislav Maslennikov, Director of the Department of European Problems at the Russian Foreign Ministry, has told the Izvestia newspaper.

""I don't think that the Russia-EU dialogue is lost forever. The European Commission is always elected for a particular term. And the current European Commission also has its term, and a new commission will be elected when it expires,"" the diplomat said.

""I wish the EU finally realize that, in fact, they are the ones to suffer from their policy of sanctions against Russia,"" he continued.

Reunification ‘is unstoppable', says Chinese president, a day after the conclusion of intense military drills

China's president, Xi Jinping, has vowed to reunify China and Taiwan in his annual New Year's Eve speech in Beijing.

Speaking the day after the conclusion of intense Chinese military drills around Taiwan, Xi said: “The reunification of our motherland, a trend of the times, is unstoppable.”

China claims Taiwan, a self-governing island, as part of its territory and has long vowed to annex it, using force if necessary.

US intelligence is increasingly concerned about the advancing capabilities of China's armed forces to launch such an attack if Xi decides the time is right.

On Monday and Tuesday, China's People's Liberation Army launched live-fire military drills around Taiwan, simulating a blockade of main ports and sending its navy, air force, rocket force and coastguard to encircle Taiwan's main island. The drills, called “Justice Mission 2025”, came closer to Taiwan than previous exercises, and involved at least 89 warplanes, the highest tally for more than a year.

The drills were expected by analysts before the year's end but were also connected by Chinese commentators to a recent arms approval by the US government for a record $11bn (£8bn) weapons sales to Taiwan.

Speaking in Beijing on Wednesday evening, Xi said China “embraced the world with open arms” and highlighted several multilateral conferences hosted by Beijing this year, including the Shanghai Cooperation Summit in August, when world leaders including Russia's Vladimir Putin, India's Narendra Modi and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, gathered in Tianjin, a port city near Beijing.

The broadcast of Xi's speech on Chinese state media was interspersed with several shots of China's largest ever military parade, which was held in September to mark 80 years since the end of the second world war. During the parade, which was viewed as an unbridled display of military force, Xi, Putin and North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, stood side by side in Beijing – a geopolitical alignment that has been called the “axis of upheaval”.

Central to Xi's vision of a new world order is the annexation of Taiwan and the support of other countries in recognising Taiwan as part of “One China” ruled by the Chinese Communist party in Beijing, something that the majority of Taiwanese people reject.

In his speech, Xi also highlighted “Taiwan Retrocession Day”, a memorial day created in 2025 to mark the anniversary of the end of Japanese imperial rule in Taiwan in 1945. This year, Taiwan also passed a law to recognise the date, 25 October, as a national holiday. The legacy of the second world war has been a big theme in political rhetoric in China and Taiwan this year. China has emphasised its role in defeating the Japanese in that conflict, something that China feels has been underappreciated in the west. Taiwan's president, Lai Ching-te, gave a punchy speech this year comparing Taiwan to European democracies in the 1930s that faced a threat from Nazi Germany.

Xi's speech also praised China's progress in hi-tech development this year, mentioning kickboxing robots and Tianwen-2, a comet exploration mission that launched in May. He also flagged the global success of Chinese cultural exports, such as the video game Black Myth: Wukong and the animated film Ne Zha 2.

Earlier in the day, Xi addressed a meeting of top Chinese Communist party officials and said that China was on track to meet its 5% GDP growth target.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Announcements mark latest twist in the frosty relationship between west African military governments and the US

Mali and Burkina Faso said they would ban US citizens from entering their countries in retaliation for Donald Trump's decision to ban Malian and Burkinabe citizens from entering the US.

The announcements, made on Tuesday in separate statements by the foreign ministers of the two west African countries, marked the latest twist in the frosty relationship between west African military governments and the US.

On 16 December, Trump expanded earlier travel restrictions to 20 more countries, including Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, which are run by juntas and have formed a breakaway association from the regional bloc, the Economic Community of West African States.

“In accordance with the principle of reciprocity, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation informs the national and international community that, with immediate effect, the Government of the Republic of Mali will apply the same conditions and requirements to US nationals as those imposed on Malian citizens,” the Malian ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement.

Another statement signed by Burkina Faso's minister of foreign affairs, Karamoko Jean-Marie Traoré, cited similar reasons for the ban on American nationals entering Burkina Faso.

The White House noted persistent attacks by armed groups as one of the reasons for the travel ban.

The expanded ban imposed by the US represents an intensification of Trump's crackdown in the aftermath of the shooting of two national guard members in Washington DC on 26 November.

The Trump administration highlighted the case to justify further tightening controls on immigration.

In announcing the ban earlier this month, which included Mali and Burkina Faso, officials said the restrictions were “necessary to prevent the entry of foreign nationals about whom the United States lacks sufficient information to assess the risks they pose. It is the President's duty to take action to ensure that those seeking to enter our country will not harm the American people.”

Mali and Burkina Faso have struggled to contain armed groups that have spread rapidly in both countries.

The juntas vowed to fight the armed groups after deposing civilian governments over the insecurity that has roiled much of the region.

Thailand releases 18 soldiers

Thailand yesterday released 18 Cambodian soldiers held for five months as prisoners of war, days after a fresh truce between the nations ended weeks of deadly fighting along their contested frontier. Some of the soldiers, with closely cropped hair, smiled, waved and gestured with their palms pressed together to cheering crowds through the windows of a bus in the border province of Pailin, video from state television showed. “I am so happy. I can't wait to see him. I miss him so much,” said 51-year-old Voeung Vy, the father of one of the soldiers captured in late July. He said he would welcome his son home in the capital, Phnom Penh. Phnom Penh said it “remains hopeful that this release will significantly contribute to building mutual trust.”

UAE pulling out of Yemen

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Tuesday said it was pulling its remaining forces out of Yemen, following a Saudi Arabian demand to withdraw within 24 hours as tensions escalate over a sweeping offensive by Abu Dhabi-backed separatists. The Emirati Ministry of National Defense said it was withdrawing “counterterrorism teams ... of its own volition.” The Presidential Leadership Council and Saudi Arabia, the UAE's rival powerbroker in the Arabian Peninsula's poorest country, have both demanded Emirati troops pull out. The withdrawal follows a strike on Tuesday against an Emirati shipment, that Saudi Arabia said contained weapons for separatists.

Rio wins party record

Rio de Janeiro has been awarded the Guinness world record for the largest-ever New Year's Eve celebration hosted by a city, for an hours-long free concert that gathered 2.5 million people on Copacabana beach last year. Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes on Tuesday received a plaque from a Guinness World Records representative on the main stage prepared for this year's installment, also on Copacabana, that was to feature legendary Brazilian singer Gilberto Gil. Paes described the award as an honor, and said “no other city in the world organizes events that bring together so many people with such consistency.”

 SOUTH AFRICA

Dozens die from circumcision

At least 41 young men have died as a result of circumcision procedures as part of traditional initiation activities in South Africa in November and last month, authorities said on Tuesday. Traditional initiation is a rite of passage into manhood for young men that is practiced annually by ethnic groups in Africa, including parts of South Africa. Among them are the Xhosa, Ndebele, Sotho and Venda communities. Despite laws that force initiation schools to be registered with authorities, it has not stopped the proliferation of illegal initiation schools where many of the deaths are reported.

“The United States should prepare itself because Donald Trump will fall seriously ill,” Juan de Dios Garcia proclaimed as he gathered with other shamans on a beach in southern Lima, dressed in traditional Andean ponchos and headdresses, and sprinkling flowers on the sand.
The shamans carried large posters of world leaders, over which they crossed swords and burned incense, some of which they stomped on.

State media praised Peng Peiyun (彭珮雲), former head of China's National Family Planning Commission from 1988 to 1998, as “an outstanding leader” in her work related to women and children.
The reaction on Chinese social media to Peng's death in Beijing on Sunday, just shy of her 96th birthday, was less positive.
“Those children who were lost, naked, are waiting for you over there” in the afterlife, one person posted on China's Sina Weibo platform.

Thieves used the quiet Christmas holiday to drill their way into the vault of a German retail bank and make off with at least 10 million euros (US$11.73 million) of money and valuables from customers' deposit boxes, police said on Tuesday.

The perpetrators drilled through a thick concrete wall at a branch of Sparkasse bank in the western city of Gelsenkirchen, and broke into several thousand safe deposit boxes and stole a sum estimated in the double-digit millions of euros, police said in a statement.

Most shops and banks close in Germany over the Christmas holiday, starting from the evening of Dec. 24, and police only discovered the hole after a fire alarm went off in the early hours of Monday.

The bank said that “more than 95 percent of the 3,250 customer safe deposit boxes were broken into by unknown perpetrators.”

Dozens of angry customers on Tuesday gathered in front of the bank loudly chanting: “Let us in.”

“I couldn't sleep last night. We're getting no information,” one man told the Welt broadcaster as he waited outside the branch, adding that he had been using the safe for 25 years and that it contained his retirement savings.

Another man said he used his deposit box to store cash and jewelry for his family.

A spokesperson for Sparkasse bank in Gelsenkirchen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Police said witnesses have reported that they saw several men on Saturday night carrying large bags in the stairwell of an adjacent parking garage.

There were also reports of a black Audi RS 6 leaving the garage early on Monday morning with masked men inside.

The vehicle's license plate was that of a car stolen in Hannover, more than 200km northeast of Gelsenkirchen, police said.

A police spokesman said that the break-in was “indeed very professionally executed,” likening it to the heist movie Ocean's Eleven.

“A great deal of prior knowledge and/or a great deal of criminal energy must have been involved to plan and carry this out,” he said.

Guinea's junta head General Mamady Doumbouya, who had pledged not to run for office after seizing power four years ago, has been elected president after securing a sweeping majority of the vote, according to initial results published late on Tuesday by the country's election commission.

Doumbouya, 41, faced eight rivals for the presidency, but the main opposition leaders were barred from running and had urged a boycott of the vote held over the weekend.

In standing, the general reneged on his initial vow not to run for office and to hand the mineral-rich, but poor west African nation back to civilian rule by the end of 2024.

He secured 86.72 percent of the first-round vote, the Guinean General Directorate of Elections said, well over the threshold that would trigger a runoff vote.

Voter turnout stood at 80.95 percent, Guinean General Directorate of Elections Director Djenabou Toure said.

Doumbouya had placed well ahead in districts of the capital, Conakry, often winning more than 80 percent, according to official partial results read out by Toure earlier on RTG public television.

However, a citizens' movement calling for the return of civilian rule questioned the results.

“A huge majority of Guineans chose to boycott the electoral charade,” the National Front for the Defence of the Constitution said in a statement on Monday.

In September 2021, Doumbouya led a coup to topple Guinea's first freely elected president, Alpha Conde.

He has cracked down on civil liberties and banned protests, while opponents have been arrested, put on trial or driven into exile.

Candidate Abdoulaye Yero Balde denounced “serious irregularities,” citing in a statement late on Monday in particular the refusal to grant his representatives access to vote-counting centers and allegations of “ballot stuffing” in some areas.

Another candidate, Faya Millimono, complained of “electoral banditry” linked to influence exerted on voters.

Editor's note: This story has been updated to include information about the strike on Tuapse Oil Refinery from sources inside Ukraine's military intelligence.

Ukraine carried out strikes on oil infrastructure inside Russia late on Dec. 30, sources inside Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent. 

The operation targeted Tuapse Oil Refinery in Krasnodar Krai on Russia's Black Sea coast, and struck transport pipelines, a sea terminal and other equipment, the sources said.

Local authorities reported that a dock was damaged alongside equipment at the refinery, adding that five homes were damaged and two people were injured in the attack.

""A fire at one of the docks was promptly extinguished. A fire was also put out at the refinery site in an area of 300 square meters,"" the Krasnodar Krai Operational Headquarters said in an announcement.

While it was not immediately clear as to what weaponry was used in the reported strikes, Ukraine routinely launches deep strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia and Russian-occupied territories, primarily relying on domestically developed drones.

Kyiv continues to escalate its campaign against Russian oil and gas infrastructure, a key source of Moscow's revenues helping to fuel its all-out invasion of Ukraine.

Tuapse, located in Russia's Krasnodar Krai, around 75 kilometers northwest of the major city of Sochi, has served as a regular target of Russian attacks. The coastal town is home to the Tuapse Oil Refinery, capable of refining approximately 12 million tons of crude oil per year.

Earlier in the night, Telegram media channels, citing resident reports, also claimed that an oil depot in the Russian-occupied community of Rovenky in Luhansk Oblast was attacked by Ukraine's military.

Photos and videos posted to social media and filmed by local residents appear to show large flames at the facility.

The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify reports of the strikes. 

Ukraine has previously struck the Rovenky depot. In October 2024, Ukraine's General Staff confirmed Ukrainian troops in cooperation with the intelligence service (HUR) carried out an attack. 

No information was immediately available on the extent of the damage caused.

Earlier this month, Russian oil prices dropped to the lowest level since the outbreak of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Bloomberg reported.

The operation targeted a large oil depot in Rybinsk, a city 160 miles north of Moscow in Yaroslavl Oblast, the sources said.

 The Kyiv Independent's Tim Zadorozhnyy speaks with Meaghan Mobbs, head of the R.T. Weatherman Foundation and the daughter of President Donald Trump's outgoing special envoy on Ukraine, Keith Kellogg.

Over 170,000 people are without power after the attack, Ukraine's Energy Ministry said on Wednesday morning.

Romania will contribute 50 million euros ($59 million), according to a press release by the Romanian government. 



Ukraine's military reportedly struck oil depots in the various Russian and Russian-occupied regions late on Dec. 30, Russian Telegram media channels reported.

The number includes 1,000 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

The Ukrainian Air Force reported intercepting 101 of the 127 drones launched by Russia overnight. 

U.S. President Donald Trump said Dec. 29 that Russian President Vladimir Putin told him Ukraine had tried to attack Putin's residence, an allegation Kyiv has denied. ""I learned about it from President Putin today. I was very angry about it,"" Trump said.



""Where is their condemnation of the fact that our children are being bombed and people are being killed all this time? I don't hear India, frankly, nor the United Arab Emirates,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 30.

Launched in August 2025, the PURL initiative has raised $4.3 billion for purchasing U.S. military equipment and munitions for Kyiv.

Ukraine has repeatedly stressed the importance and sometimes irreplaceable nature of certain American technologies, such as Patriot systems for intercepting ballistic missile strikes. 

Romania will contribute 50 million euros ($59 million), according to a press release by the Romanian government. 

""Romania's contribution to PURL will support the achievement of a lasting peace in (Ukraine) by strengthening Ukraine's capabilities,"" Romanian Foreign Minister Toiu Oana said in a tweet late on Dec. 30.

Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) carried out a strike on an oil facility north of Moscow on the morning of Dec. 31, a law enforcement source told the Kyiv Independent.

Ukraine has escalated its strike campaign against oil facilities inside Russia and Russian-occupied territories throughout 2025, primarily relying on domestically developed drones. Oil and gas are key sources of revenue for Moscow, helping to fuel its invasion of Ukraine.

The latest operation targeted a large oil depot in Rybinsk, a city 160 miles north of Moscow in Yaroslavl Oblast, the source said. 

They added that the facility is managed by Rosreserv, a state agency responsible for stockpiling commodities for times of crisis. 

In the early hours of Dec. 31, Yaroslavl Oblast Governor Mikhail Yevraev declared a drone threat to residents. Russian media later reported explosions in Rybinsk. 

Footage shared with the Kyiv Independent appeared to show a large fire and plumes of black smoke rising from the purported attack site. 

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims.

Two trains taking tourists to Peru's famed archeological site of Machu Picchu crashed on Tuesday, killing at least one person and injuring around 30 passengers.

The person killed was a railroad worker, according to Jhonathan Castillo Gonzalez, a captain with the Cuzco police department. He told The Associated Press that the railway suspended services along the rail line connecting Machu Picchu with the nearby city of Cuzco after the accident.

According to the company operating the railway, a train coming from Machu Picchu collided with a train headed there in the early afternoon, near Qoriwayrachina, also an archeological site.

No further details about what had caused the crash were immediately available.

Videos on local media showed train cars with broken windows and dented sides stuck along a rail line hemmed in between a lush forest and a massive rock.

Machu Picchu gets around 1.5 million visitors per year, mostly arriving by train to the nearby town of Aguas Calientes. Known for its perfectly fitting stone bricks, the site was built in the 15th century by the Incas and served as a sanctuary for the nation's emperors.

The number of people visiting Machu Pichu has increased by about 25% over the past decade, but tourism in the area has also been affected by political turmoil and disputes over how the site is managed, with protesters sometimes blocking the railroad that leads to the ancient site.

Machu Picchu can also be reached on foot, with visitors trekking from the small town of Ollantaytambo. The trek takes about four days.

Matt Fowler and Dwight Chambers chat at Dineen Coffee's Commerce Court location, one of three Bay Street outposts for the Toronto cafe.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail

It's 10 a.m. and the queue at Dineen Coffee in the Commerce Court West lobby is just 14 people deep – a slow morning by the busy java shop's standards. 

Still, its baristas will pour about 1,000 cups of black gold for the caffeine addicts of Bay Street by day's end. 

This Dineen location, which is one of six for the boutique chain, has become a stalwart of Toronto's commercial district.

On any given weekday, you'll find a cross-section of the country's bankers, corporate lawyers, consultants and power brokers huddled around Dineen's tables, networking, dealmaking and relaxing with colleagues.

Today, a recent Thursday morning in December, consultant Irfan Karmali (flat white) is making a pit stop on his way to the office: “The coffee at work sucks, and that's the truth.”

In the seating area, a man and woman dressed in sharp dark suits are huddled over a stack of papers at a high top.

At the bar, Matt Fowler (mocha) is perched on a stool, catching up with his former co-worker, Dwight Chambers (drip coffee with milk and sugar).

“We used to work together at TD. We haven't seen each other in ages,” Mr. Fowler said. Mr. Chambers is still with TD Securities. 

While they were chatting, another former TD co-worker, Verinder Sharma (drip coffee black), happened to come in. Mr. Sharma is now a Managing Principal at Capco.

This is what's great about the location, said Mr. Fowler, who manages operations at Cedar Leaf Capital: You never know who you'll run into.

Articling student Emily Feng treats herself to an almond-milk cappuccino.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail

Around the corner, a barista signals that Emily Feng's order – a large cappuccino with almond milk – is ready.

“I'm treating myself today. I usually just come on Fridays, because my firm has free coffee, but this is better,” said Ms. Feng, an articling student at Stikeman Elliott.

Cappuccinos are Dineen's most popular drink, said Ruth Young (flat white in the morning, matcha in the afternoon), although it's neck and neck with the Americano.

As far as food goes, the banana loaf is hands down the winner.

Ms. Young, whose family is one of Dineen's owners, is the company's chief operations officer, but on this day she's also chief hot chocolate maker. 

They've got to fill an order for 1,100 cups of hot chocolate for a holiday party that day – the prior day they'd had another party needing 900 cups – so Ms. Young is in the back behind the bar, pouring chocolate ganache into a large pot and whisking it with milk. 

“You've got to just keep stirring until the chocolate is melted, without letting it boil over – like this,” she said with a laugh as white foam poured out over the edge. 

Dineen Coffee was founded by three businessmen, with its first location opening over a decade ago on Yonge Street.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail

Dineen was founded by a trio of businessmen – David Fortier (regular drip), Ivan Schneeberg (dark roast drip), and John Young (dark roast drip) – who were running a film-production company by day, but who had other ventures, including in hospitality.

The first location opened in 2013 on nearby Yonge Street, which divides Toronto's east and west. 

“It was really the building,” said Helen Young (almond misto), Mr. Young's wife and Ruth Young's mother. “John, David and Ivan really liked it and wanted to do something with the spot.”

The property at 140 Yonge St. was built in the 19th century and is famous for its yellow brick and curved architecture. Back in 1897, it was the headquarters for the Dineen Hat and Fur Company, which is what inspired the coffee shop's name.

Helen Young, who is now the chain's CEO, said that the space was so beautiful, they wanted to do something that would be a gathering spot for people to sit and chat, right along one of the country's busiest streets. A coffee shop just made sense.

See how well you remember the top business stories of 2025

The Commerce Court kiosk, which anchors the lobby of the tower at King and Bay Streets, was Dineen's second location.

“John, David, Ivan – they would go to Commerce Court for meetings and just say ‘god, this place needs a coffee shop,'” she said. Dineen has two more Bay Street outposts: one in CIBC Square and another at 200 King St. W.

The chain survived the COVID-19 shutdowns because of “really good landlords,” the elder Ms. Young said. And with more workplaces shifting toward employees being back in the office, the towers are filling up again, bringing more people in for coffee.

Ruth Young said she loves how Dineen has evolved into a hub of the financial district.

“It's cool, you know, watching this. No one is on a laptop. Everyone is chatting with each other,” she says gesturing to the packed tables and benches. “You feel like you're in a spot where people are making moves, making decisions, people are talking about deals. This is a place to go to have those conversations. It's really exciting to be a part of.”

More than a decade after Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 vanished with 239 people on board, the search to locate the main wreckage is being resumed. DW speaks to an expert and a relative of an MH370 passenger.

On March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 took off from the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, en route to Beijing, China. The plane, with 239 people on board, soon veered off course and vanished. 

While small pieces of the plane have washed up, no main wreckage has ever been found. The search, led by marine robotics firm Ocean Infinity, resumed on December 30, 2025, under a ""no find, no fee"" deal. If the wreckage is found, the company will receive $70 million.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

In Germany, it's only permitted to sell fireworks in the three days leading up to New Year's Eve. Some line up early to buy them, while others have safety concerns and want to see them banned altogether.

In the early hours of Monday, December 29, residents in the state of Thuringia called the police out to a local supermarket, warning that thieves were trying to break in. But when the authorities arrived, they found a group of young men, armed with hot tea and blankets, who just wanted to be first in line when the supermarket opened.

December 29 is the start of the three-day window in Germany when fireworks can be sold, to adults over the age of 18, to celebrate New Year's Eve.

All over the country, undeterred by the cold and dark, people line up and wait every year for fireworks to go on sale. The coveted products have names like Giftzwerg (""poison dwarf""), Hysteria and Hurricane Force. The fireworks come in brightly colored packages of various sizes, with a fuse sticking out.

When the fuse is lit, they shoot up into the air. Black powder produces loud explosions, while colorful effects are created by metal powder, in combination with other chemicals.

Germany has a long tradition of people setting off their own fireworks on New Year's Eve. For manufacturers, it's a profitable and steadily growing business. The German Pyrotechnic Industry Association calculated that in 2024 its turnover was €197 million ($232 million) — a record high, up from €180 million the previous year. The association estimates that 10% to 15% more goods will be on sale in 2025.

Yet only 22% of people living in Germany want to see in the new year with a private fireworks display. These were the findings of a representative survey of 2,500 people over the age of 18 by the opinion research institute Civey. The survey was commissioned by Germany's Association of Technical Inspection Agencies (TÜV).

""It's only a minority of people who set off their own firecrackers, rockets or other fireworks on New Year's Eve,"" said Joachim Bühler, the CEO of the TÜV association. He explained that the tradition is most popular among younger people and families with children.

But while some regard fireworks as colorful, exciting and fun, the rockets and firecrackers have serious downsides. In addition to creating an enormous amount of trash, the Federal Environment Agency has recorded that burning fireworks to ring in the new year generates more than 2,000 metric tons of fine particulates, which constitute a risk to health. That represents around 1% of Germany's entire annual particulate pollution.

The most serious concern, however, is that injuries and property damage are increasing year on year, especially in big cities. Firecrackers can cause serious injuries like acoustic trauma, burns and the loss of body parts, such as fingers or an entire hand.

More and more often, injuries are caused by fireworks that have been purchased illegally on black markets in Poland, Czechia and the Netherlands, and have considerably more explosive power. According to police, they're comparable to bombs and grenades.

In 2024, two young men died in Germany after handling so-called spherical bombs that contained more than 600 grams of black powder. A doctor described one of the men as having been ""ripped to shreds.""

This year, fireworks have been banned for the first time in large parts of Czechia. Starting in 2026, the Netherlands is banning private fireworks altogether. The hope is that this will stop the two countries being used as key transshipment points for homemade firecrackers and goods smuggled in from China.

German customs officials reported that in 2024 they seized more than 7 tons of pyrotechnics that were not authorized for use in Germany. That's considerably more than in all three of the previous years put together.

""For many people, ordinary fireworks aren't enough anymore,"" warned Jochen Kopelke, the chair of the federal German Police Union. ""They want them to be more and more powerful, with big explosions and lots of fire.""

There has also been an increase in the deliberate use of pyrotechnics as a weapon, including against police officers, firefighters and paramedics. Aggression and violence tend to break out on New Year's Eve, especially in the bigger cities, with some neighborhoods almost resembling a war zone.

This is why the security services are calling for a blanket ban on all fireworks. A petition to this effect, launched by the police trade union (GdP) in Berlin, has already been signed by almost 2.5 million people.

The branch leader of the GdP in Berlin, Stephan Weh, believes politicians have to do something.

""All that's happened in the last few years has been the imposition of localized bans on firecrackers, guns and knives, in specific zones. But these make no difference to the excesses of violence,"" he said. ""We don't want to wait until one of our colleagues loses their life in this wild, senseless firecracker frenzy.""

More than 50 civil society organizations have also come together to call for a ban on private New Year's Eve fireworks, under the hashtag #böllerciao (""Bye-bye, firecrackers""). Medical associations, Environmental Action Germany, animal welfare organizations and the German Children's Fund are among those supporting the initiative. Around 750,000 people have already signed their petition.

Increased aggression on New Year's Eve also affects people's perception of security. The TÜV survey found that almost one in three — women in particular — do not feel safe in public if there are firecrackers around. Of those surveyed, 32% said they didn't feel safe outside on New Year's Eve because of fireworks; 45% of women said they didn't feel safe.

More and more people would welcome restrictions on private fireworks. Almost half are in favor of a total ban, with only the smallest fireworks excepted, such as sparklers or table fireworks; 22% would like to see a ban on firecrackers, both large and small.

However, there are also people — 33%, according to the survey — who reject any sort of ban, citing tradition and personal freedom.

There is no prospect of a nationwide ban on private fireworks any time soon, as Germany's state and federal interior ministers have not been able to reach agreement on this. The state premier of Lower Saxony, Olaf Lies, is relying on local decision-making instead.

""Lots of local authorities stipulate areas where people are not allowed to set off fireworks,"" he said before the holiday.

More and more prohibited zones have been established in Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne, Munich and other big cities in recent years, particularly in the town centers. And it's completely forbidden all over Germany to let off fireworks in the vicinity of hospitals, churches, children's homes, old people's homes and airports.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Cyprus back at the helm of EU Council presidency","https://www.dw.com/en/back-at-the-helm-of-eu-council-cyprus-focus-is-russias-war-in-ukraine-and-middle-east/a-75328041","Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:43:49 GMT","

After 14 years, Cyprus takes over the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union on January 1. It will lead during a politically sensitive moment, and aims to shape the EU's role on the global stage.

When the Republic of Cyprus first took over the Council presidency in 2012, the European Union was struggling to contain the fallout of a financial crisis that was approaching its peak. The eurozone and its cohesion were under constant pressure, while countries such as Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland were in financial assistance programs.

Cyprus itself was no exception. While holding the presidency, the country was grappling with severe problems in its banking sector, which would force it into an EU- and International Monetary Fund bailout just a few months later. The EU-IMF bailouts were financial rescue packages provided during the eurozone crisis.

Speaking to DW, Cyprus' then-Foreign Affairs Minister Erato Kozakou-Marcoullis recalled that in 2012, ""the strategic agenda focused on addressing the eurozone crisis, promoting growth, employment and competitiveness, modernizing public administration and strengthening the single market.""

Fourteen years on, Cyprus is taking on the presidency for a second time, in a markedly different context. The European Union is now being called upon to redefine its role as a political actor amid prolonged geopolitical tensions, both in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.

Commenting on the current environment, Kozakou-Marcoullis said Europe today is ""facing new and unprecedented challenges stemming from Russia's war against Ukraine and the situation in the Middle East, within a rapidly changing global landscape and growing instability.""

According to the diplomat, the EU appears determined to assume a more prominent leadership role in addressing these challenges — a stance reflected in the strategic agenda adopted by the European Council in 2024, covering the period through 2029. It is therefore only natural, she added, that the agenda of the Cypriot presidency reflect these priorities.

Indeed, when Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides presented the priorities of the presidency on December 21 from Lefkara — a symbolic village in Cyprus, rich in cultural heritage — the objective of a more autonomous European Union capable of playing a role in global affairs was unmistakable.

""The Cypriot presidency will work for a self-reliant union that is open to the world,"" Christodoulides said, outlining the overarching vision underpinning the five main pillars of the presidency.

According to the president, these pillars focus on security, competitiveness, enlargement, autonomy and fiscal balance.

Elaborating on these priorities, Christodoulides stressed that Cyprus will support initiatives in the field of defense and promote the agenda of European defense readiness by 2030, while also placing emphasis on strengthening the trans-Atlantic alliance. On competitiveness, he highlighted the need for energy security and the diversification of supply sources and routes through enhanced energy connectivity infrastructure.

Regarding enlargement, he referred in particular to Ukraine, Moldova and the Western Balkans, noting that the Cypriot presidency is committed to delivering tangible progress in the accession paths of these countries.

Whenever Christodoulides speaks about the objectives of the Cypriot presidency — especially the goal of strategic autonomy for the European Union — he consistently refers to the crises on the EU's eastern borders, notably Ukraine, as well as developments in the Middle East.

This was also evident at a recent European Council summit, where the Cypriot president linked the Ukraine issue both to the EU's enlargement agenda and to discussions on security and defense.

Christodoulides had already signaled Cyprus' priorities during his visit to Ukraine on December 4, stating that ""Nicosia will do whatever is necessary"" to ensure that Ukraine's European perspective remains high on the EU's agenda.

Describing enlargement not merely as a political choice but as a ""geopolitical necessity,"" he emphasized that the Cypriot presidency will seek to advance the accession process as a means of strengthening Europe's collective security and democratic resilience.

Similar weight is expected to be placed on the Middle East. For the Cypriot president, strengthening the EU's institutional ties with countries in the region is imperative.

""As the EU, we must clearly do much more, institutionalize our cooperation and demonstrate in practice what we often say — that the EU must have a 360-degree perspective,"" he said in Brussels ahead of the start of the presidency.

For Ioannis Kasoulides, Cyprus' foreign affairs minister for three terms, most recently from 2022 to 2023, the linkage between the war in Ukraine, the crisis in the Middle East and the EU constitutes the core challenge of the Cypriot presidency.

He told DW that Cyprus must conduct a presidency in which the Ukraine issue is firmly embedded in discussions on EU foreign policy and defense, enabling the bloc to play the role it is expected to play globally.

At the same time, Kasoulides underlined that Cyprus, as the presiding country, can offer ""added value in enhancing cooperation between the EU and the Middle East and the Arab world,"" given Nicosia's close relations with countries in the region.

He also stressed that President Christodoulides has already announced a summit to be held in Nicosia on April 23, 2026, bringing together the leaders of the EU's 27 member states alongside countries from the eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf.

The ICE drive would use an ad-targeting technique called “geofencing” to send recruitment ads to users' phone browsers.

Independent journalism at Truthout faces unprecedented authoritarian censorship. If you value progressive media, please make a year-end donation today.

The Trump administration is planning a massive propaganda campaign aimed at recruiting thousands of new federal immigration enforcement officers to carry out its mass deportation agenda.

The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that it had obtained internal documents revealing that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is planning to spend $100 million over the next year on what the agency describes as a “wartime recruitment” drive.

The propaganda blitz will be targeted at highly specific demographics, including “people who have attended UFC fights, listened to patriotic podcasts, or shown an interest in guns and tactical gear,” according to the Post.

The ICE drive would also use an ad-targeting technique called “geofencing” to send recruitment ads to users' phone browsers if they are in the vicinity of certain locations, such as military bases, NASCAR races, college campuses, and gun shows.

The ads being designed for the recruitment drive will be based around current appeals that depict joining ICE as part of a “sacred duty” to “defend the homeland” from “foreign invaders,” the Post reported.

This rhetoric is similar to the language used in a recent ICE job post flagged by University of Wisconsin–Madison sociologist Jess Calarco. The listing asked prospective recruits if they are “ready to defend the homeland” by joining “an elite team dedicated to … securing our nation's safety.”

Calarco noted that the job post “reads like a video game ad,” which she said “is almost certainly by design.”

Sarah Saldaña, a director of ICE under the Obama administration, told the Post that it is worrying to see the Trump administration casting such a wide net for people who lack any experience in law enforcement and who may be eager for what the Post described as “all-out combat.”

The recruitment blitz comes amid new indications that the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign is falling far short of its goals.

The New Republic's Greg Sargent on Wednesday wrote that immigration arrests this year have fallen far short of the goal of 3,000 people per day set by top Trump aide Stephen Miller, and it seems highly unlikely that Miller will realize his dream of deporting 1 million people per year.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow with the American Immigration Council, told Sargent that “it's clear that they have not achieved the shock-and-awe campaign of mass deportations that they wanted, and they are still running into quite a lot of obstacles.”

Reichlin-Melnick also predicted that “there will still be millions of people here who are undocumented” after Trump leaves office in 2028, as the administration “will not be able to deport even the majority of undocumented immigrants in four years.”

The Trump administration earlier in the year announced plans to entice new ICE recruits by offering them $50,000 sign-up bonuses and assistance with repaying student loans in a bid to double the agency's head count.

Muslim voters who backed Zohran Mamdani are now looking for him to follow through on his policy proposals.

As we produce journalism that combats authoritarianism, censorship, injustice, and misinformation, your support is urgently needed. Please make a year-end gift to Truthout today.

On January 1, New York City's first ever Muslim and South Asian mayor will take office, inheriting the largest police force in the United States while assuming responsibility for a city that's seen a rise in immigration raids and deportations ever since Donald Trump became president over the last year. Zohran Mamdani's victory in November came on the heels of a campaign focused on making the city more affordable. His messaging was clear, consistent, and connected directly to the concerns of New York workers in every community across the city. 

The mayoral election saw the highest turnout in more than 50 years, thanks to Mamdani's success with a wide coalition of groups. His campaign brought in new immigrant voters, particularly within South Asian communities, younger millennial and Gen Z voters, and Black voters who flipped from Andrew Cuomo thanks to consistent outreach. The campaign also spoke directly to Muslim voters, many of whom were motivated to cast a ballot because of the surge of Islamophobia, both on a national level and specifically hurled against Mamdani, especially as the election drew closer.

The attacks against Mamdani felt almost like outdated caricatures, reminiscent of a time when Muslim hate was much more bluntly spoken and acceptable across the political aisle. Systemic Islamophobia has long been normalized, but that more candid, virulent brand of hate was brought back into fashion with the rise of Donald Trump. And while the anti-Muslim rhetoric that dominated his 2016 campaign caused real harm, Trump was still generally regarded as extreme and outlandish, especially by Democrats. Now, Democrats, who'd long couched their harmful rhetoric and policies in flowery language and progressive aesthetics, jumped on the bandwagon, suggesting Mamdani's win would make the city unsafe. 

What changed? The genocide in Gaza, which illustrated clearly the dehumanization of Muslims and Arabs that was so pervasive across our institutions. Mamdani's unequivocal stance against Israel's genocide and his solidarity with pro-Palestinian student protesters made him inseparable from that very same dehumanization.

Tens of millions of dollars were spent attacking Mamdani, including on attacks that tried to paint him as a Muslim extremist. In one case, a pro-Cuomo group ran a video ad showing Mamdani smiling while the Twin Towers burned in the background. Mamdani was forced by media, in interviews, on talk shows, and from his own opponents, to repeatedly respond to accusations of antisemitism for his criticisms of Israel — allegations that are also rooted in anti-Muslim sentiment, suggesting any Muslim who condemns the genocide in Gaza must harbor hatred against Jews.  

Mamdani's response to the wave of Islamophobia directed at him, however, signaled a turning point, not only in the election, but hopefully the future of the city as well. Addressing New York City's roughly 1 million Muslims, Mamdani doubled down on his Muslim-ness and invited the rest of us to do the same. He challenged the casual racism and dehumanization of Muslims that has become so acceptable in this country, to the point that repeatedly questioning a Muslim about Jewish safety has been framed as not only reasonable, but in the public's best interest. 

And then he won, in spite of — or perhaps because of — all of the blatant attempts to tear him down. 

While Muslims of every generation celebrated Mamdani's win, millennials like myself, who came of age in a post-9/11 New York City, may have felt the significance of his victory the deepest. Members of this generation might have been too young to understand the shifting geopolitics of the time as the country would soon begin an endless war in the Middle East, but they were old enough to know that their place in this country, their sense of belonging, was being questioned. They felt that ostracization when a classmate made a “terrorist” joke, or when a family member was questioned by law enforcement. They heard the stories that swirled around campuses about FBI and New York City Police Department (NYPD) informants in Muslim student organizations. They learned, along with their elders, that the NYPD had been spying on our communities, mosques and campuses, surveilling young Muslims under the guise of public safety. 

Many of these Muslim New Yorkers, who grew up in Mamdani's generation, see themselves in him. They share a perspective similar to the one he shared during the campaign: the understanding that being a Muslim New Yorker after 9/11 meant becoming familiar with the anti-Muslim hate and fearmongering that has become embedded in our institutions, along with an urgent desire to make such hate politically toxic.

Political leaders on both sides have historically used anti-Muslim hate to further their own agendas. After 9/11, the anti-Muslim sentiment that became synonymous with the George W. Bush administration, which used the attacks to start an illegal war in Iraq and fuel the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, pushed Muslims to vote for Barack Obama and his promise of change. Obama then left office with a legacy of deporting more immigrants than any other president in U.S. history and carrying out more drone strikes on largely Muslim-majority countries in his first year than his predecessor Bush did in his entire tenure. Donald Trump's Muslim ban, which was enacted in his first week in office, tore families apart. Again, Muslims chose “the lesser of two evils” in the next election. They reluctantly turned out for Obama's former vice president, Joe Biden, who then facilitated and funded a horrific genocide in Gaza that killed more than 70,000 people. 

Islamophobia is still being used by politicians to garner support. In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott, who is running for a fourth term, recently designated the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a civil rights group, a terrorist organization. In the same state, a Republican running for Congress has made anti-Muslim hate a focal point of her campaign, calling Muslims “terrorists” and promising to expel them from Texas if elected. Far right, anti-immigrant rhetoric like this has only increased under a Trump administration that has made immigrants the target of baseless attacks and often aggressive violence. 

At the same time, the success of Mamdani's campaign has already inspired other Muslims to pursue political office. Aber Kawas, a community organizer and member of the Democratic Socialists of America, like Mamdani, announced her run for New York State Assembly in Queens in early December after receiving the endorsement from the socialist group. In a post announcing her run, Kawas wrote, “I never planned to run for office, but in the last two years, there has been a massive political shift that has called for all of us to reexamine who should hold power,” citing similar issues around affordability that were the focal point of Mamdani's campaign. If she wins, she would become the first Palestinian to serve in the state's legislature. More importantly, it would add to the number of officials elected on the promise of protecting immigrants and making the city more affordable for its workers. 

Of course, identity representation doesn't equal tangible change — there is a laundry list of prior leaders across every level of office who are proof of that. Especially not after more than two years of an ongoing genocide in Gaza funded by our own tax dollars, it's not enough for elected officials to simply come from marginalized identities. They must be willing to upend a status quo in which people struggle to afford even the most basic necessities while their government spends billions of dollars a year to support mass slaughter in Gaza instead. 

Muslim voters who backed Mamdani are now looking for him to follow through on his policy proposals, from affordable housing to universal child care to raising the minimum wage — things that will actually make a real difference in their lives. 

And they are not naive, either. Mamdani has advocated for reforms to policing, proposing a Department of Community Safety which would limit the role of police in responding to 911 calls concerning mental health and homelessness. But his decision to keep NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch, appointed by former Mayor Eric Adams, has left many of his supporters wary of his incoming administration. Under Tisch's leadership, the NYPD amped up its crackdown on low-level offenses and cooperated with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to target and detain student protesters. Muslims and others are moving with caution, aware of the NYPD's long history of surveilling Black and Brown communities and enacting policies that disproportionately harm our people. 

Muslims have been exploited by both parties for so long, used as political pawns to incite fear and garner support for foreign policy objectives. In this fraught political moment, we must remember it is our right to call on our leaders to build the city we want to live in, one where our safety is prioritized and our needs are met. Like any elected official, Mamdani will face scrutiny as mayor over how well he makes good on his promises. His actions can also set the precedent for how Muslims are reflected in policy and governance for years to come. After a campaign in which we finally felt heard, and at a time when the stakes for our communities are so high, he bears a heavy responsibility.

 Neither Overreach nor Retreat Can Win Domestic Support

 Charles Kupchan and Peter Trubowitz

The “America first” foreign policy of U.S. President Donald Trump has unsettled the world America made. Allies are questioning the United States' reliability as a strategic partner and are concerned that Washington is now more foe than friend of the liberal rules-based order. They have reason to worry. The Trump administration believes that international pacts, open trade, and foreign assistance are degrading, not amplifying, U.S. power and influence. Trump has made quite clear his hostility to multilateralism, stating that he opposes “international unions that tie us up and bring America down.”

“America first” foreign policy may be the focal point of public debate over the future of U.S. leadership, and it is certainly setting the world on edge. But it is also a symptom of a broader challenge confronting the United States: the hollowing out of the domestic consensus that anchored U.S. grand strategy from World War II into the twenty-first century. Partisan, regional, and ideological divides have produced a disconnect between the country's domestic politics and its foreign policy.

At one end of the political spectrum are the embattled liberal internationalists, firmly committed to the defense of the liberal order through the projection of American power, trade liberalization, multilateral governance, and the promotion of democracy. At the other are newly empowered “America firsters,” who are attempting to dismantle the liberal order by loosening foreign commitments, putting up tariff walls, disengaging from multilateral institutions, and abandoning efforts to spread democratic values. Neither vision can muster sustained domestic support. As a result, U.S. foreign policy has become erratic and inconstant, buffeted by competing visions of the country's purposes and disagreement over how best to pursue them.

Such domestic division would matter less for the United States if it faced a benign and quiescent geopolitical landscape. Yet the country finds itself confronting mounting international challenges just when it has lost the political capacity to meet those challenges. If a fractured America is to steady a fractured world, U.S. leaders must bring international ends back into equilibrium with domestic means by persuading Americans from different walks of life to again get behind U.S. statecraft. Doing so will require pursuing a brand of foreign policy that appeals to the interests and aspirations of a broad majority of Americans, from the country's urban metropolises to its rural hamlets.

To get there, the United States must make three key adjustments. It needs to repair the partisan divide between urban and rural America and rebuild an internationalist consensus that includes working families left behind by globalization. Such an effort will require a rebalanced trade policy that avoids both unfettered markets and protectionist excesses, a program of targeted investment in the country's lagging regions, and an overhaul of a broken immigration system. Second, Washington needs to find a happy medium between deep multilateralism and a unilateralist breakout. To counter populist nationalism, the United States should reform existing multilateral institutions to produce a more equitable sharing of authority and burdens while enhancing the delivery of public goods such as common defense, humanitarian assistance, and cybersecurity. It should also promote coalitions of the willing that would allow states to work together on shared interests despite geopolitical and ideological differences. Finally, Washington must adopt a more discriminating approach to international engagement that avoids both the temptation of unrestrained globalism and the siren call of self-defeating retreat, prioritizing the country's vital interests. The United States should continue to play the role of great-power balancer, but not global policeman.

Shoring up domestic support for a new American internationalism will be difficult, given the many divides now cleaving the country. But in an unruly world, poised and proactive U.S. leadership remains a necessity. The United States must find a midpoint between internationalist excess and nationalist retreat, stepping back from global overreach without stepping away from global engagement.

This is not the first time in U.S. history that the country's leaders have struggled to strike a balance between the competing pressures of international and domestic politics. Racked by deep partisan and regional divisions in the 1920s, the United States rebuffed international leadership. Congress rejected membership in the League of Nations, and the Republican administrations of Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover favored commercial rather than strategic engagement abroad.

The laissez-faire credo that dominated the political landscape came to define U.S. foreign policy. Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover recognized the need to stabilize the economies of a war-ravaged Europe but were fearful of excessive government involvement in world affairs and constrained by the demands of coalition building in an increasingly fractured GOP. They gambled that private initiative, rather than government activism, would be sufficient to steer the world away from economic fragmentation and toward interdependence and geopolitical stability. But relying on “dollar diplomacy” did the opposite; in the absence of U.S. leadership and strategic engagement, militarism and geopolitical rivalry spread. The Great Depression only deepened the United States' retreat. Washington erected tariff barriers and sought to cordon itself off from the forces destabilizing Europe and East Asia. Only the worldwide war that broke out would end the United States' isolationist delusions.

With the end of World War II and the onset of the Cold War, Washington finally assumed the mantle of global leadership that it had rejected after World War I. Abandoning isolationism while eschewing idealistic calls for world federalism, U.S. officials instead took a middle course and pursued liberal internationalism. The liberal international order that took shape in the late 1940s and early 1950s was made possible by a broad political alliance that spanned party, region, and class. Democrats and Republicans, Northerners and Southerners, bankers, factory workers, and farmers all found common cause in freer trade, forward defense, and foreign aid, which linked prosperity and security at home to economic and strategic engagement abroad.

This bipartisan internationalism provided the political grounding for the network of strategic and commercial partnerships that succeeded in containing the ambition and appeal of the Soviet bloc. Foreign policy and domestic politics were in broad alignment. Because international purposes generally enjoyed widespread domestic buy-in, liberal internationalism survived even the political tumult produced by the Vietnam War.



But after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the ideological triumph of the Western bloc, the United States' foreign policy aims and its domestic politics began pulling in opposite directions. In the absence of a geopolitical rival, Washington's unchecked international ambitions ballooned beyond the country's political will. Neoliberal reformers rushed in to liberalize, deregulate, and globalize markets. Their economic policies, coupled with the scaling back of the U.S. welfare state at home, expedited the shrinking of the middle class and incubated a backlash against globalism. An influx of immigrants, primarily from Latin America, intensified this backlash, as politicians fused concerns about economic insecurity with identity-based grievance.

Washington also overreached strategically, taking on a broad array of new commitments and missions in the 1990s and early 2000s. The Clinton administration intervened in the Balkans and launched NATO's enlargement in central and eastern Europe; the Bush administration pursued a war on terrorism that morphed into an effort to turn Iraq and Afghanistan into stable democracies; the Obama administration pledged to shift the focus to “nation-building at home” but ended up mired in Afghanistan and battling the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) in Iraq and Syria. These and other internationalist ambitions regularly failed to produce the promised results and stretched well beyond what voters would tolerate. Public doubts metastasized into widespread resentment.

Indeed, long before Trump unleashed his assault on globalism, popular support for free trade, institutionalized multilateralism, and democracy promotion and nation building abroad was waning. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, antiglobalist sentiment took hold in America's left-behind locales, whittling away what remained of the postwar bipartisan foreign policy consensus. Trump harnessed the politics of grievance, promising to end Washington's liberal internationalist compact. His “America first” foreign policy replaced open trade with economic protectionism; liberal immigration policies with a sweeping crackdown; internationalist ambition with nationalist pullback; multilateralism with unilateralism; and the promotion of democracy with indifference toward the spread of democratic values abroad.

U.S. President Joe Biden sought to reverse Trump's foreign policy and bring ends and means back into balance by pursuing a “foreign policy for the middle class.” His administration attempted to revive liberal internationalism by framing its foreign policy as part of a global struggle between democracy and autocracy. But Biden failed to rebuild anything close to the postwar domestic consensus and many working Americans again rallied behind Trump's “America first” alternative.



Especially during his second term, Trump has overcorrected and underperformed. His tariffs risk fracturing the global economy and have only made it more difficult for working Americans to make ends meet. His inhumane detention and deportation of immigrants have strained the labor market and alienated voters. His unilateralism has isolated the United States by antagonizing longtime allies and undermining international teamwork. Trump has dismantled U.S. foreign aid programs and coupled his pullback from promoting democracy abroad with disregard for the rule of law at home, compromising the country's moral authority.

Meanwhile, strategic overreach has given way to self-defeating withdrawal. Trump has backed away from supporting Ukraine while failing to apply coercive leverage against Russia, enabling Vladimir Putin to hijack ongoing negotiations and intensify the war. Trump did succeed in brokering an uneasy peace between Israel and Hamas, but his episodic engagement has produced virtually no progress in advancing a broader regional peace. The administration's 2025 National Security Strategy announced a resuscitation of the Monroe Doctrine, which has amounted in practice to legally questionable military strikes against boats alleged to be trafficking drugs in the Caribbean and open musings about toppling Venezuela's government. Meanwhile, a strategy for dealing with China has yet to materialize.

The United States is at an inflection point. Liberal internationalist policies that once served the country well no longer enjoy public backing. At the same time, support for Trump's “America first” foreign policy is fast dwindling; opinion polls indicate little public appetite for tariffs, deportations, unilateralism, and international disengagement. At a time when Americans are facing great economic uncertainty and recognize they live in an interdependent world, they would be better off with a pragmatic foreign policy that strikes a more measured balance between international ends and domestic means.

Given the scope of the country's political fracture, it will not be easy to bring U.S. foreign policy back into alignment with public preferences. Studies by political scientists, including Jacob Grumbach and Jonathan Rodden, indicate that urban-rural differences have become a vector for polarization. Since 2016, Trump has widened the urban-rural divide by ramping up political debate over globalization and immigration. Broadly speaking, urban Americans are more supportive of open trade and liberal immigration policies. Rural Americans tend to lean in the other direction, prioritizing the use of tariffs to protect U.S. jobs and a reduction in legal as well as illegal immigration.

This political divide is now firmly entrenched in America's electoral system. By design, the Electoral College and the Senate enhance the influence of less populous, rural states, magnifying the effect of ideological and partisan polarization along the urban-rural fault line. During the Cold War, the positions that elected officials took on matters of trade and immigration rarely broke along party or ideological lines. No longer. Mobilized voters in “red” and “blue” America now consider politicians' positions on these issues to be a litmus test of tribal loyalty, sharply reducing the room for political compromise.

U.S. policymakers need to go to the source of the problem: the socioeconomic imbalances that are pitting urban and rural Americans against each other. To bridge this gap and rebuild support for internationalism in the country's lagging regions, Washington needs to simultaneously move on two fronts. It needs to craft a trade policy that does more for working Americans and to expand economic investment in the country's stagnant locales. And it needs to revamp immigration policy, stopping illegal entry while continuing to admit the documented immigrants needed to contribute to the country's economic vitality.



Democrats and Republicans alike have begun to move forward on these fronts. Both parties have started to back away from open trade in favor of protectionist policies aimed at reshoring manufacturing jobs and select supply chains. The Biden administration also took steps to redress long-standing regional inequities in infrastructure investment. It sought to reduce broadband Internet gaps between urban and rural America and invested in “regional technology and innovation hubs” in up-and-coming metropolitan areas. But partly because of congressional resistance, these initiatives did not go far enough, with many projects needing more time to produce tangible benefits. And Biden moved far too slowly to curb the inflow of immigrants, leaving the implementation of measures needed to block illegal crossings of the southern border until his last year in office.

The Trump administration has focused intensely on the problems of unfair trade and illegal immigration. But it has used a sledgehammer instead of a scalpel. High tariffs are only exacerbating a national affordability crisis. The promised manufacturing revival made possible by tariffs and industrial policy will not come close to employing a sizable portion of the U.S. workforce, most of which is already in the service sector. The administration's draconian crackdown on immigration and massive deportations of undocumented migrants, opposed by two-thirds of the public, has led to labor shortages and rising consumer prices in agriculture, construction, hospitality, and other economic sectors.

To repair the partisan divide over trade and immigration, Washington needs to decisively break with the hyperglobalization of the 1990s and negotiate a more level playing field with trading partners, particularly China. But rebalancing trade does not require protectionist overkill, which risks fragmenting the global economy and punishing U.S. consumers. A better trade policy for urban and rural America needs to do more for U.S. workers, not just for corporate America. Washington should also couple place-based domestic investments with an overhaul of immigration policy to fill out the labor force and enhance economic security for working Americans.

The institutions of global governance are being attacked from both sides of the aisle. An array of domestic political forces in the United States is undermining support for multilateralism. Many “America firsters” view supranational bodies such as the UN and the World Trade Organization as encroaching on U.S. sovereignty and have thus embraced a stiff-necked unilateralism, aiming to hobble existing institutions and make it nearly impossible to create new ones. They see alliances as encumbrances and believe that the United States has shouldered a disproportionate share of the burdens of multilateralism while its allies and partners free-ride on the largess of the American taxpayer. Meanwhile, liberal internationalists, who generally support global teamwork, worry that in a world of mounting strife, rising economic inequality, and worsening environmental decay, multilateral institutions are no longer fit for purpose.

The United States is not the only country in which domestic support for institutionalized multilateralism is waning. Populist nationalism is gaining ground across Europe. China and Russia are leading efforts to create counterweights to post–World War II institutions that they see as dominated by the West. Bodies such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, BRICS, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization offer new venues for organizing collective initiative. But they are also fracturing the institutional landscape and fostering distrust among competing multilateral platforms. Many developing countries see existing international organizations as outmoded, unrepresentative bastions of great-power privilege and dominance. It does not help that repeated efforts to reform the UN Security Council to make it representative of today's world, rather than the world of 1945, have gone nowhere or that the current international architecture has failed to address climate change, reliably provide humanitarian assistance, or deliver on other fronts.

Despite these political blockages and institutional shortcomings, multilateral cooperation remains essential to marshaling the collective action needed to address global challenges. As the principal architect of the postwar order and the country best placed to reform this order, the United States needs to rebuild domestic and international support for multilateralism by updating existing institutions and supplementing them with informal coalitions of the willing, which are often able to deliver more quickly and efficiently than large, bureaucratic institutions.



Washington should take its cues from the U.S. and global public. Americans, along with the citizens of many other countries, oppose Trump's deep cuts to U.S. foreign aid; they would respond favorably to efforts to enhance the capacity of the World Food Program. They are also united in their anguish over the human suffering in Gaza; Washington should enhance and showcase the UN's ability to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinians. And in the aftermath of the havoc caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Washington should be investing in and improving the World Health Organization, not walking away from it.

Washington should also look for ways to get other states to be more generous providers of public goods. Giving large countries from the developing world permanent seats on the UN Security Council, for instance, would demonstrate that the body is changing with the times, and could encourage countries such as Brazil, India, and Nigeria to contribute more. The United States remains the UN's largest funder, contributing almost one-third of the body's overall budget. Washington should continue to pay its UN bills, but it is time for other countries, including wealthy countries in the global South, to scale up their contributions in exchange for a greater voice.

As the global South seeks to increase its say in global governance, its regional institutions should assume more authority and responsibility in their respective zones of influence. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Arab League, the African Union, and other regional organizations can and should do more to provide public goods, including conflict resolution, peacekeeping, and the delivery of humanitarian assistance. The United States and other wealthier countries can foster greater regional self-reliance by helping lower-income countries build state capacity, alleviate poverty, hunger, and disease, and expand economic opportunity.



U.S. alliances are similarly in need of a rebalancing of responsibility. European and Asian allies that benefit from the United States' military protection should boost their own defense spending and contribute more to collective defense. Trump's arm-twisting has produced results, with NATO members on track to raise defense spending to five percent of GDP. But Washington should rely more on positive inducements than angry harangues, which end up alienating friends that the United States needs by its side. Better trade deals, preferential access to U.S. research and development programs, and favorable financing for major purchases of U.S arms would provide attractive incentives.

Rather than focus only on formal bodies, Washington should also more regularly rely on smaller and informal coalitions to tackle specific issues that are more difficult to resolve in large, slow-moving institutions. The Biden administration made good use of this approach, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, where it partnered with fellow democracies to counter Chinese ambition by teaming up with Australia, India, and Japan in the security partnership known as the Quad. Cooperation with democracies comes easily, but Washington must also reach across geopolitical and ideological divides to tackle pressing problems. The United States has experience fashioning such informal, ideologically diverse coalitions. The Clinton administration joined France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and the United Kingdom in the Contact Group, which helped bring peace to the Balkans in the 1990s. The Obama administration joined China, France, Germany, Russia, and the United Kingdom in the so-called P5+1, which negotiated a deal to contain Iran's nuclear program in 2015. Such ad hoc groupings do not always produce results, but they do offer a model for working across ideological lines and sidestepping the bureaucratic and political snags that often stymie action by larger, more formal bodies.

Finally, Washington should look for ways to work with, rather than oppose, multilateral groups formed and headed by other countries, including rivals. It was a mistake for the Obama administration to oppose the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank by China in 2015. Washington should have joined the effort and sought to ensure that the new lending institution complemented and aligned with the work of the World Bank. Bodies such as the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, despite limited track records of serving the public good, have the potential to add value even if the United States and its allies are not members. These bodies also provide a vehicle for advancing dialogue across ideological dividing lines by including large democracies such as Brazil, India, and South Africa.

The United States must be prepared to operate in a messy and fluid institutional setting, measuring the merit of multilateralism through output and efficacy, not ideological affinity or Washington's ability to call the shots. By devolving greater decision-making authority to other countries and persuading those states to assume greater responsibility for finding and funding solutions to global and regional challenges, U.S. leaders can accomplish two goals at once: securing broader international support for collective action and winning back a measure of the domestic support for multilateralism that has been lost since the 1990s. Progress will be slow and uneven; skepticism about multilateral governance runs deep in rich and poor countries alike. But modest, incremental changes will go a long way toward closing the gap that now exists between the demand for global public goods and the supply.

The United States needs a more levelheaded brand of statecraft that occupies the middle ground between strategic overreach and indifference toward, if not detachment from, the outside world. Washington's former role as global policeman breached the limits of U.S. power and the American public's appetite for engagement abroad. But in an interdependent world, the United States does not have the option of returning to hemispheric isolation. It still needs to prevent China or Russia from dominating Asia and Europe, even as it retrenches from other regions, particularly the Middle East. The shift in power from Iran and its proxies toward Israel, the Gulf monarchies, and Turkey should enable the United States to downsize its military footprint in the region and pursue its interests primarily through diplomacy.

As it seeks to check the threats posed by China and Russia, the United States should focus on discrete challenges rather than amp up rhetoric about an existential clash between democracy and autocracy. Washington will ultimately need to work with Moscow and Beijing, as well as other autocracies, to deal with climate change, nuclear proliferation, and other global threats. The United States should keep trying to find a just end to the war in Ukraine and make improved relations with Moscow contingent on the Kremlin's readiness to compromise and end its ongoing aggression. Similarly, Trump's instinct to seek a trade deal with Beijing that could help dial down U.S.-Chinese rivalry is correct. Washington should embrace practical carrot-and-stick diplomacy, working with whatever regimes are willing to cooperate to address shared challenges.

A foreign policy more oriented toward problem solving would have strong public appeal. Americans on both sides of the aisle are concerned about job security, inflation, health care, and immigration. They would welcome leadership in Washington that lightens the country's load abroad and invests more time and money in solving problems at home. They also have little appetite for protectionist and isolationist policies that only exacerbate economic insecurity for working families, needlessly increase suffering abroad, and leave the United States less secure. More pragmatism will play well with an American electorate that has grown skeptical of Washington's ability to shoot straight and to deliver concrete gains at home and abroad.

Nearly a century ago, Washington mended the domestic fracture of the interwar era with a steady statecraft that successfully navigated the global fractures of the Cold War. Today, the country again faces domestic and international fracture—simultaneously. Once more, it must overcome partisan division, reinvent its statecraft, and anchor U.S. leadership abroad in a new political consensus at home. As always, good policy requires good politics.

 How Trump and Xi Can Reset Relations

 Wu Xinbo

Over the last half century, Washington and Beijing have twice faced turning points that redefined the terms of their relationship. The first came during President Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972, when the United States abandoned its policy of containment and instead sought rapprochement with Beijing. This was an effort to work together against the threat of Soviet expansion, but when the Soviet Union disintegrated at the end of the Cold War, so, too, did this accord. The second occurred in the mid-1990s, when the Clinton administration decided to engage a rising China and support its economic modernization. Beijing, for its part, sought to join the U.S.-led international system and play a constructive role in world affairs. But this understanding collapsed during the first Trump administration, when Washington viewed China as the United States' primary challenger and replaced engagement with competition.

The second Trump administration is uniquely well positioned to mark a third key turning point, one which sees China and the United States forge the kind of steady relationship that they need at this moment. Given the havoc that the first Trump administration wreaked on U.S.-Chinese ties, it may seem counterintuitive to argue that President Donald Trump's return to office can improve relations. But the chemistry exists for a productive bond between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Unlike President Joe Biden, who framed the contest with China as one between democracy and authoritarianism, Trump does not view China through an ideological lens. In fact, he frequently praises Xi as a political strongman. More broadly, Trump seeks a world order in which the major actors—namely China, Russia, and the United States—should respect one another's national interests and seek to avoid conflict, which reflects China's position, as well. In other words, leaders in Beijing and Washington agree that a concert of power (active coordination between China and the United States), not just a balance of power between the two countries, is necessary in today's world.

This suggests the conditions are in place for a grand bargain between China and the United States. Such a grand bargain should include reform of the current international system to create more space for rising powers, long marginalized by the United States and Europe, to pursue their own interests. It should also promote a new approach to bilateral relations that prioritizes cooperation over confrontation, which requires a deliberate effort to manage economic competition and jointly address security challenges in the Asia-Pacific. The goal, if not outright partnership between Washington and Beijing, should be peaceful coexistence and productive power sharing.

For Beijing, such a deal would ensure China's continued access to American markets, capital, technology, and institutions of higher education and research, which are key to sustaining its economic growth. It would also prevent tensions about Taiwan from spilling over into active conflict with the United States. Washington similarly wants to prevent a large-scale, high-risk, and unaffordable war in the western Pacific, and a grand bargain would benefit the U.S. economy by maintaining the United States' access to China's expanding market, hard-to-replace supply chains, and investment capital. Moreover, coordination and cooperation with Beijing will reduce the United States' international responsibilities, which is one of the Trump administration's goals. Offloading some international burdens onto China will allow the United States to shift more of its resources to domestic priorities.

Any attempt at collaboration will face major challenges, especially when it comes to working out the details on issues connected to deep-seated disagreements between China and the United States. But now is the time to pursue such a deal. If Washington and Beijing fail to strike a grand bargain soon, the risks of a “Thucydides trap”—the tendency for war to break out when a rising power threatens to usurp an existing great power—will continue to grow, with Taiwan a likely flash point. If a conflict occurs, both economies would suffer tremendously, and the fragmentation and disintegration of the international system would make cooperation among other global powers almost impossible. To offset this danger, China and the United States can build on the positive momentum established at the Xi-Trump summit in October 2025 and work to fundamentally reset relations for the better.

When Nixon took the unexpected step of improving U.S. relations with China, he was driven not only by an urgent foreign policy agenda—ending the Vietnam War and countering Soviet expansion—but also by the knowledge that the world was moving toward multipolarity. He recognized that U.S. diplomacy had to adapt to a new global reality in which Washington shared the world stage. During Nixon's 1972 visit to China, the two countries issued the Shanghai Communique, a historic document that outlined a roadmap for their future relationship and stipulated the principles that would guide their interactions in a changing world. These principles included “respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, nonaggression against other states, noninterference in the internal affairs of other states, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.” The agreement helped build mutual trust and allowed their nascent relationship to strengthen over the next two decades.

Today, these principles remain relevant, and many of the concerns that gave rise to them are once again at play. The world is moving into another multipolar era, with multiple conflicts raging and many others on the verge of breaking out. Geopolitical rivalries are becoming more intense, the international system is under extreme strain, and China and the United States, as two leading countries, have an opportunity to recalibrate the global order. If Beijing and Washington can reiterate their commitment to the principles of mutual respect and cooperation that guided their last rapprochement, they can reduce the trust deficit between them and begin building a new relationship that is productive for both powers.

One key challenge that the United States has faced in recent decades is its obsession with unipolarity and the impulse to shape the world according to its own preferences. The second Trump administration's departure from post–Cold War thinking about American hegemony suggests that Washington is ready to change course. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described unipolarity as an “anomaly” and has stressed the importance of pragmatism and balance in U.S. foreign policy. And during a speech in Saudi Arabia in May 2025, Trump announced that although he intends to defend and promote “the fundamental interests of stability, prosperity, and peace,” he does not believe it is the job of the United States to intervene in the rest of the world.

Concern over China's rise and the decline of U.S. superiority have pushed many American policymakers toward a more confrontational approach in recent years. But this fear is misguided. Although China could overtake the United States in some metrics (such as GDP) in the near future, even if China were to become the world's largest economy, the United States would retain its lead on many other fronts—among them technological innovation, military might, and influence in the international institutions and alliance networks that it crafted. Despite China's ascendence, the United States will remain the world's most powerful country for the foreseeable future. In short, there's enough room on the world stage for both countries to prosper.

For China, multipolarity comes with greater responsibilities as well as greater influence. China has benefited from the stable and economically open U.S.-led world order over the past 40 years, which allowed it to pursue a low-key foreign policy and focus on domestic growth. As Beijing becomes more powerful, however, it must overcome its hesitancy to spend more of its own resources to mediate global conflicts, provide a variety of public goods, and work with countries that are deeply skeptical of its intentions and political system. Xi has signaled an interest in doing this by introducing efforts such as the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Governance Initiative, but China must do much more to translate its words into deeds and deliver tangible results that can convince skeptical countries that its rise is a positive development.

Efforts to secure a U.S.-Chinese grand bargain must begin with a compromise on trade and investment. Economic ties are at the core of U.S.-Chinese relations and have been a major source of friction between Beijing and Washington since the first Trump administration. But the two countries complement each other economically. Chinese imports of U.S. products and services benefit the American farming, manufacturing, energy, and service sectors, and increased access to China's rapidly expanding market for American companies generates greater profits for U.S. enterprises. The kind of direct Chinese investment that has marked the past two decades of U.S.-Chinese economic relations boosts the U.S. economy and helps employment, and China's purchase of U.S. federal bonds helps stabilize the American financial market. In 2016, for instance, the year before Trump first took office, direct Chinese investment in the U.S. economy peaked at between $45 billion to $50 billion, and China was the largest overseas holder of U.S. federal debt from 2008 to 2018, when Japan surpassed it for the greatest share.

China also benefits from economic links with the United States. For decades, the United States has been China's top single export market, a major source of foreign direct investment, and Beijing's most significant technology partner. Trade and economic ties with the United States remain robust despite the 2018–19 trade war, the tit-for-tat tariff escalation in April 2025, and efforts to decouple or “de-risk” launched by both the first Trump administration and the Biden administration. During bilateral talks in Geneva the following May, China and the United States recognized the importance of sustaining their economic and trade relationships long term. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent declared that “generalized decoupling” would be a mistake, and the reality is that the two economies are now so interdependent that operating separately is not only undesirable but impossible.



Beijing and Washington can carry the success from bilateral negotiations held throughout 2025 into further negotiations focused on a comprehensive agreement covering trade, technology, investment, and market access. In each of these realms, reciprocity must be the basis for any possible deal. Rather than seeking to eliminate the trade imbalance, which is a highly unlikely outcome because of structural factors (the U.S. economy operates with low rates of saving and high rates of spending, and the U.S. dollar is the dominant international currency), China can reduce its trade deficit by purchasing more U.S. products. In return, the United States can loosen China-specific export controls and remove civilian Chinese firms from the Commerce Department's Entity List, a collection of foreign companies and organizations against which Washington applies strict export restrictions for national security purposes. These civilian firms, such as Huawei, should not be targeted simply because they are technologically competitive. Dialing back export controls will increase the shares of U.S. products and technologies in Chinese markets and help shrink the U.S. trade deficit with China.

If China encourages more investment in the U.S. manufacturing industry as a way to enter the U.S. market, it will help reduce bilateral trade imbalances and create more job opportunities for American workers. In response, the United States should remove obstacles to Chinese direct investment, some of which have been in place since 2017. This will attract more Chinese capital in both U.S. manufacturing and service sectors. And where Washington can reduce the limit on U.S. investment in China, Beijing can further open its service industry to American investors. As China's growing middle-class population cares increasingly about its health, for instance, U.S. investors have opportunities to profit from medicine and health care in China.

A reciprocal approach will also work for technology, which has been a major source of competition between the United States and China in recent years. Washington, wary of China's advancement, continues to tighten its restrictions on technology transfers. But this strategy has backfired; Beijing has enhanced its investment in domestic tech innovation, resulting in major revenue losses for U.S. firms operating in Chinese markets. For the United States, the short-term gain of slowing down China's tech progress can't outweigh the long-term pain of losing both access to Chinese markets and its lead in technological innovation. If Washington tempers its tech war against Beijing by reducing its ban on technology flows to China, Beijing can exercise similar self-restraint with its own limitations on the export of rare-earth elements and critical minerals, which are essential for the production of both commercial and defense products such as batteries, radar, or consumer electronics.

The geopolitical contest between the United States and China in the Asia-Pacific is a major obstacle to any grand bargain between the two powers. Military aircraft and ships from both countries encounter each other increasingly frequently, contributing to high levels of tension and low levels of trust. Under such circumstances, any accidental clash can easily escalate into a major crisis, or even war. Both sides, however, should be cognizant of their own limitations. China can expand its regional influence, but it cannot dominate the Asia-Pacific in the face of resistance from the United States, Japan, and other regional powers, nor can it drive the United States out of East Asia entirely. And although the United States might want to contain China's reach, Beijing's economic and military capability and its active diplomatic outreach to its neighbors means Washington cannot stymie China's momentum as a leading regional power.

On the Korean Peninsula, both China and the United States share a goal of stability. Given that North Korea has emerged as a nuclear power despite strict international sanctions, it is unlikely that any country can reverse Pyongyang's moves toward nuclearization. Thus, managing the situation requires shifting from deterrence to establishing a peace mechanism that both China and the United States guarantee. Washington and Beijing should also work together to dissuade South Korea from pursuing its own nuclear capability, which Seoul is considering but would risk making the peninsula even more dangerous. If South Korea goes nuclear, Japan would very likely follow suit, and neither Beijing nor Washington would welcome such proliferation. This is an ideal moment to relaunch the Four Party Talks—a diplomatic initiative from the 1990s involving China, North Korea, South Korea, and the United States—to work out a security arrangement that can reduce tensions on the peninsula and increase Seoul's confidence in its nonnuclear security. The dialogue prompted by the initial Four Party Talks helped improve relations among all four powers and resulted in meetings between leaders of North and South Korea as well as mutual visits by high-level individuals in Pyongyang and Washington.

Control over territory and resources in the South China Sea is another flash point between China and the United States that risks spiraling into a broader conflict. As China's power in the region increases, Beijing must clarify what rights and interests it claims. It should reassure the United States and neighboring countries such as Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam that it has no intention of expanding its claims further and turning the South China Sea into an “inner lake” surrounded by Chinese territory. To do this, China should refrain from using its military superiority to expand control and instead rely on bilateral and multilateral consultations with other regional powers to manage and resolve disputes. Beijing should also demonstrate greater flexibility in its negotiations with Southeast Asian countries over the code of conduct in the South China Sea, an effort to establish shared norms in the region.

As part of a deal with China, the United States should reduce its interventions in the South China Sea. To Beijing, the United States lacks the credibility to act as an arbitrator in the conflicts between China and Southeast Asian powers because it is not a signatory to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Nor does the United States have the resources to keep China in check by policing the South China Sea in perpetuity. A more constructive and realistic U.S. role would be to encourage, through direct statements of support, China's bilateral and multilateral efforts to manage disputes peacefully, negotiate the code of conduct, and enhance maritime cooperation with Southeast Asian countries.



The single most consequential challenge to the future of U.S.-Chinese relations is Taiwan. Since Lai Ching-te, a member of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party who has expressed support for the island's independence in the past, came to power in 2024, relations between Beijing and Taipei have worsened. Lai has made provocative comments, such as referring to Beijing as a hostile foreign force in a major policy speech. Washington has also increased its support for Taiwan in recent years: in December, for instance, the United States announced an $11 billion arms package for Taiwan, the largest such deal to date. For its part, Beijing has ramped up its military pressure against Taipei and bolstered its defense preparations for a potential conflict with the United States in the western Pacific.

Avoiding war and securing a grand bargain will require Beijing and Washington to de-escalate their own competition in the Taiwan Strait and slow the current militarization around the island. For Beijing, the best path to avoid conflict while maintaining its bottom line is to remain committed to its policy of “peaceful reunification”—emphasizing for both Taipei and Washington that while its first resort will not be force, it will also not accept any Taiwanese effort at independence. Taiwan and the United States will have to countenance some military buildup to allow for credible deterrence from China, but Beijing should prioritize establishing economic and social ties across the Taiwan Strait and promoting dialogue between officials in Beijing and Taipei whenever possible, both of which have dried up completely in the past year and made militarization more enticing.

Trump has been notably (and perhaps even strategically) vague about his position on Taiwan, refusing to declare publicly whether he would call for the U.S. military to defend the island in the event of a Chinese attack. Maintaining his restraint on the issue works in favor of a U.S.-Chinese grand bargain, but Washington can and should go further by calling on Taiwan to stand down and using its leverage to ensure that Taipei makes no overt move toward independence. Ensuring that the Lai administration doesn't cross any redlines—including revising the constitution to pursue de jure independence—is one example. Reaffirming that the United States welcomes peace and reconciliation across the Taiwan Strait and would accept any formula that is acceptable to both sides, which remains in line with its existing “one China” policy, is another. If Washington follows through on these efforts, Beijing should offer a good-faith effort to curtail its military activities around the island.

Although instability is an unavoidable part of the U.S.-Chinese relationship—and would continue even with a grand bargain—both sides have an interest in avoiding war. That goal requires the militaries from both sides to work together to improve crisis management. The United States, for instance, can rein in its close-range reconnaissance on the eastern and southern Chinese coasts and its freedom of navigation operations near China's shores. Such activities have failed to contain Beijing's military action and instead only raise the risk of clashes. Beijing, in turn, can be more transparent about its military maneuvers and more forthcoming in military exchanges with the United States, which are aimed at building confidence and preventing crises between the two countries. And in an era of immense uncertainty and new frontiers of conflict, the United States and China should also engage in bilateral strategic dialogues that focus on nuclear, space, cyber, and artificial intelligence threats.

A grand bargain between China and the United States is also necessary to clarify their respective roles in the international order. Neither side wants to completely overturn the existing structure. Although the first Trump administration designated China a revisionist power and the Biden administration repeatedly asserted that Beijing has not only the ability but also the intent to reshape the international order, China has reaped remarkable economic benefits and status from the current system. It is now the world's second-largest economy, for example, and has significant influence in the UN Security Council. Rather than entirely overthrow or replace the current U.S.-led international order, China seeks to preserve the overall international system while reforming some of its multilateral institutions to enhance Chinese influence, improve their efficiency, and increase representation of non-Western countries. In other words, rather than burning down the house—or building an entirely new one next door—China wants to renovate what exists to create more space for its interests. Beijing has proved that it can back its constructive intentions with positive actions: it brokered talks between rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia in 2023, for instance, and hosted a meeting between Hamas and Fatah in 2024 to promote intra-Palestinian reconciliation.

The United States, meanwhile, seems to be on a journey of disengagement from the prevailing international system that it leads. Under an “America first” ideology, Trump has orchestrated the U.S. withdrawal from numerous international agreements and institutions, including the Paris climate accord, the World Health Organization, and the UN Human Rights Council. But as Bessent declared before the Institute of International Finance in April 2025, “America first does not mean America alone.” Regardless of Trump's isolationist tendencies, American prosperity and security are deeply intertwined with developments outside the country, and they depend on how the United States engages the rest of the world. The United States cannot deal with transnational challenges such as terrorism, public health, or the environment single-handedly; it has to rely on broad international cooperation and resources, often orchestrated by multilateral regimes. Simply put, for the sake of its own survival and well-being, the United States cannot afford to pull away from the international system entirely.

The fact that China's growing strength and desire to play a bigger role on the world stage coincides with the United States' declining interest in sustaining its global dominance makes a grand bargain between the two not only possible but necessary. If the United States wants to reduce its own burden without destabilizing the international system, it needs to be comfortable with China shouldering more responsibility. China can assume a more prominent position in global economic governance and play a larger role in Asia-Pacific security. If China wants to convince Washington (and the world) that it's right to pick up what the United States puts down, Beijing must commit to using its increasing influence responsibly.



To accommodate China's desire to pursue its global interests and encourage mutually beneficial Chinese contributions to the international system, Washington can continue to participate in world affairs and play a leading role without seeking total dominance—a collective effort, rather than a monopoly, over global leadership. China's cooperation is imperative to addressing major global challenges, and any U.S. attempts to contain China's potential power will only incentivize Beijing to turn to an alternative (and perhaps antagonistic) order, much as the Soviets did. As a rising power, China won't look to challenge the existing international system as long as it's allowed to thrive. And because the terms of a successful grand bargain could counteract zero-sum thinking, a thriving China would not inherently result in a suffering America. Instead, it could benefit Beijing by accommodating its more ambitious role within the international order while ensuring that the United States still reaps its own rewards.

Given the recent U.S.-Chinese rivalry, a grand bargain between them will also depend on expanding the areas in which the two countries have parallel or common interests. This includes big-picture goals, such as tackling climate change or epidemics. It also includes supporting developing countries as they strive to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, such as improving infrastructure and alleviating poverty. As permanent members of the UN Security Council and the world's two leading economies, this is a shared obligation. And the two powers can work together to de-escalate conflicts that threaten the two countries' security or stress their resources, such as the war in Ukraine, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and militarization on the Korean Peninsula. As Rubio noted during a press briefing in December, the United States and China can cooperate to deal with global challenges. Engaging on common interests does not mean that Washington and Beijing must work toward exactly the same ends, only that they must work in tandem.

But doing this effectively does require reforming multilateral institutions such as the UN, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. The United States is overrepresented in its power and influence in these institutions. Even if China and the United States disagree on the shape of or their role in these institutions overall, the two sides need to have a frank discussion about adjusting the distribution of shares and quotas in the IMF and World Bank (which determine voting rights and other interests of the organizations' members) and about whether to add more developing countries to the Security Council as permanent members, which will make the body more representative of today's world.

As the United States turns increasingly inward under Trump, and the U.S.-Chinese contest remains poised to intensify, reaching a grand bargain between Beijing and Washington is a formidable challenge. But such an understanding is possible, and beneficial, for both countries. Rather than serving the interests of the other side, China and the United States would be supporting their own interests by cooperating. For the United States, this grand bargain would enhance its economic and security interests while reducing its burdens as an international power. For China, the bargain would allow it to play a larger international role while cushioning against shocks in a period of global turbulence. A phased approach is advisable. Negotiations can begin with economic questions, then use the trust built in that stage to support more difficult discussions on regional security and institutional reform.

Trump and Xi have already shown that they can have positive bilateral meetings, and both have expressed willingness to forge a major deal. During their recent talk in Busan, South Korea, for instance, Xi noted that China and the United States can “work together to accomplish more great and concrete things for the good of our two countries and the whole world.” Trump, meanwhile, told Xi that, together, “our two countries can get many great things done for the world.” For Xi, de-escalating tensions over Taiwan and stabilizing relations with the United States would boost his popularity at home. For Trump, securing economic gains and promoting peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific would likewise enhance his political standing. The world is in flux, and while Trump is no Nixon, he appears to have the political mettle to reset U.S.-Chinese relations with a realist, pragmatic perspective.

In 2026, Trump is scheduled to visit Xi in China, Xi is likely to visit Trump in the United States, China will host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the United States will host the G-20 summit. These events provide vital occasions for the two leaders, as well as Chinese and U.S. policymakers more broadly, to make deals, build relationships, and begin shaping a grand bargain. If Washington and Beijing can use this moment to bridge their divide, it will not only reset relations between two leading powers but also provide stability and opportunity for the rest of the world.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Why ‘Auld Lang Syne' still unites the world at midnight","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/31/world/why-auld-lang-syne-still-unites-the-world-at-midnight","Wed, 31 Dec 2025 13:13:29 GMT","


            As “Auld Lang Syne” takes its annual spin around the globe on New Year's Eve, its chorus belted out by revelers young and old, Edinburgh's Poet Laureate Michael Pedersen says the song's enduring power lies not in tradition alone, but in its uncanny ability to bind people together.
    


            Pedersen, a prize-winning Scottish poet and author who is the current Writer in Residence at the University of Edinburgh and the city's Makar, or Poet Laureate, told CNN that the song's customary rendition at midnight on December 31 was never formally ordained — it simply felt right.
    


The full lyrics to ‘Auld Lang Syne' so you don't mumble your way through it



            “For generations, it's been sung at New Year because it's perfect for it,” he said. “There's nothing in the song that dictates it should be sung then. People just had an emotional compass for it. They gathered outside town halls and sang it, and it drifted — like a great, beautiful glacier of song — into that New Year position.”
    


            Despite its popularity, few would claim to know all the words to the song, first written down by Robert Burns in 1788 – but that has done little to dent its appeal.
    


            The phrase “auld lang syne” translates loosely to “old, long since,” though Pedersen says a modern equivalent would be “for old times' sake.” At its heart, he said, the song is “a tale that looks back at childhood friendship, rekindled with a handshake and a goodwill drink.”
    


            “It's a song of reunion, not parting,” he added. “It's about celebrating happy days gone by and the glorious bonfire in the belly when you come back together.”
    


            As a Scotsman, watching the song circle the planet each year feels like “sending out the Scottish bat signal,” Pedersen said.
    


            “Auld Lang Syne is very much born in Scotland, though it's become the ultimate international citizen,” he said. “Everyone has made it their own. What a beautiful expression of art and humanity — to write something national and deeply personal, and have people project their own lives into it.”
    


            Part of its staying power, he argues, is physical. The song isn't just sung — it's performed.
    


            “It happens at such beautiful moments: the end of the year, weddings, big gatherings,” he said. “You join hands, you form a circle, you create a physical expression of friendship. Most people hum through the verses and come in strong on the chorus, and it pulls us all together. It's a mellifluous, song-sized hug that's survived the centuries.”
    


            As for the choreography, Pedersen says the arm‑crossing moment comes later than many think.
    


            “Traditionally, you hold hands for the first five verses,” he said. “Then on the fifth, everyone crosses their arms, still holding their neighbors' hands, and runs in and out of the circle. Of course, culprits and rogues will run in at various points — that's part of the beauty, the calamity of it.”
    


            The question of authorship remains one of Scottish literature's most enduring debates. Robert Burns claimed he merely wrote down a version he heard in a coaching inn, later adapting it to fit a tune.
    


            “We have no evidence of how much he adapted,” Pedersen said. “It could have been a word or two, or a massive Burns rewrite.”
    


            Burns' publisher, George Thomson, altered the music again after the poet's death, producing the melody known today.
    


Times Square has a dazzling new ball for the New Year's Eve drop — and it's the biggest yet



            “Even now, critics argue over whether Burns was leading us astray, and it was his all along,” Pedersen said.
    


            “He was known to avoid attributing some of his own work — sometimes because it was too heretical, sometimes because he wanted to see how people reacted without his fame behind it. It remains a beautiful, mellifluous mystery.”
    


            Pedersen has now added his own contribution to Scotland's New Year canon with “Boys Holding Hands,” a poem inspired by Burns and written, he said, from a lifelong devotion to friendship.
    


            “I've always worshipped at the altar of friendship,” he said. “I wanted to write my own poem about joining hands in celebration of friendship, inspired by Burns. ‘Boys Holding Hands' is that piece — taking your pal's hands in celebration of all the times you've had and all the times you're going to have.”
    


            The poem, he said, is also a gentle challenge to the emotional constraints placed on men.
    


            “There's a real bravado to masculinity that causes us to trap a lot of our emotions in our belly and dissolve them like a piece of gristle until they're voiceless,” he said. “We have to let all that soppy, sumptuous sentimentality spill out to make ourselves better, more equipped, more loving human beings.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Zohran Mamdani becomes New York's mayor on New Year's Day. His administration is a work in progress","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/31/politics/new-york-mayor-transition-mamdani-administration","Wed, 31 Dec 2025 12:00:58 GMT","


            New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has spent the last several weeks sprinting towards a deadline.
    


            After publicly committing to filling many of the top posts in his new administration before taking office, Mamdani, 34, is closing 2025 with a still-evolving image of the team that is going to help steer his government and enact an ambitious agenda to tackle the affordability crisis in the nation's largest city.
    


            During the campaign, Mamdani – a former state assemblyman who will make history as New York's youngest mayor in a century when he takes the oath of office at midnight on New Year's Day – battled criticism that he lacked the experience needed to lead the city's massive bureaucracy.
    


Since his election, Mamdani's transition has continued to try to swat away that criticism even as it has slow-rolled some of its appointments, leading critics and political insiders watching from the sidelines to wonder if the pace of the transition is an indication of what the Mamdani era of government will bring.
    


A look at Zohran Mamdani's policy ideas as he becomes New York City's mayor



            The appointments of newly elected mayors are closely watched affairs, as they provide an early test for a new administration. Mamdani has continued to name new appointees, including as recently as Tuesday afternoon. 



            Still, several members of the transition granted anonymity to speak freely about confidential proceedings acknowledged the transition has indeed moved slower than previous administrations, in part due to Mamdani's limited network of seasoned government hands and a struggle to appease competing constituencies inside the transition.
    


            “He wants to broaden his coalition,” said one Mamdani transition member granted anonymity to discuss confidential proceedings. “But he also has a lot of very hard left people internally who are less interested in compromising, and that push and pull is really delaying things.”
    


            Another member described the effort as a “careful managing of everyone's political feelings.” And while some have been quick to focus on the delays, members of the transition have also praised some of Mamdani's picks so far, describing them as “sane, sober choices” that should put at ease anyone worried Mamdani would place a “bunch of radical kids” in charge.
    


            “I feel confident about the team we're putting together,” Mamdani said earlier this month when asked about the pace of his appointments. “We are going to be building out a team that New Yorkers will see being the ones who will help to make the decisions that will shape their lives and their ability to afford living in this city.”
    


            Since winning the general election in November, Mamdani hasn't quite stopped running.
    


            He has held a series of quasi-campaign events in the past two months: Rallying alongside independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Starbucks workers on strike, distributing hot chocolate to tenants in the freezing December temperatures to highlight his proposal to freeze stabilized rents, meeting with daycare workers to talk about his universal childcare pitch and traveling to Washington, DC, for an Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump.
    


            All the while, his team has been working to fill out key roles in the administration.
    


            New York City's municipal gears turn with the help of more than 300,000 public workers and dozens of agencies, mayoral offices and boards. They're tasked with everything from picking up the more than 10,000 tons of garbage the city produces daily, to leading the city's public hospital system, helping small businesses, and awarding city contracts, to name a few of their collective responsibilities.
    


            So far, Mamdani has named leaders to the city's largest core service agencies – including the New York Police Department, the Fire Department, the Sanitation Department and the city's office of Emergency Management. For the last two posts, Mamdani is relying on holdovers from the administration of outgoing Mayor Eric Adams, who will stay in their jobs when the new year begins.
    


            Mamdani has also named the city's corporation counsel and his director for the Office of Management and Budget – a key appointment as the city's budget season begins in January. And he has appointed deputy mayors for housing and planning and health and human services, in addition to creating a new office for deputy mayor for economic justice – a nod to Mamdani's affordability agenda.
    


            Still, some big jobs remain open.
    


            Mamdani has yet to announce a commissioner for the Department of Correction, which controls one of the largest jail complexes in the nation. The Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs and the commissioner for the Administration of Children's Services have also yet to be announced.
    


            And Mamdani hasn't named a transportation commissioner, who would be key in helping implement his “fast and free” bus plan.
    


            Former New York Mayor Bill De Blasio, whose transition had a similar pace of appointments to Mamdani's, announced job appointments through the last day of the year before he took office.
    


            Mamdani is expected to do the same: Sources familiar with the plan tell CNN he is expected to announce a schools chancellor on Wednesday.
    


Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to introduce Zohran Mamdani at New Year's Day inauguration



            Mamdani jumped into action after election day, appointing a transition committee led by Grace Bonilla, a seasoned non-profit leader who previously served in de Blasio's administration, and Lina Khan, the former Federal Trade Commission chair under President Joe Biden best known for her work in antitrust and consumer protection.
    


            Days later, Mamdani named Dean Fuleihan as his first deputy mayor. The veteran of state and local government most recently served in the de Blasio administration. Mamdani also named Elle Bisgaard-Church, who ran his primary campaign, as his chief of staff.
    


            The mayor-elect's inner circle is made up of the same core group of people who helped lead his campaign to victory, with Bisgaard-Church leading the effort to form Mamdani's Cabinet and senior aide Morris Katz and Fuleihan helping move the process along.
    


            Mamdani is also relying on Patrick Gaspard, the former ambassador to South Africa and aide to President Barack Obama. Gaspard first met Mamdani when the then-rapper was on a promotional tour for the film “Queen of Katwe,” which was directed by Mira Nair, the mayor-elect's mother.
    


            Gaspard has also acted as a bridge between Mamdani and Obama and has been providing advice on everything from hires to communication strategy.
    


            The transition has not been without controversy: Catherine Da Costa resigned as Mamdani's director of appointments less than 24 hours after she was named to the role after a series of antisemitic social media posts she made more than a decade ago surfaced. Da Costa expressed “deep regret” for the statements and said she felt “a profound sense of sadness and remorse at the harm these words have caused.”
    


            Mamdani was forced to acknowledge his team had missed the postings during the vetting. After accepting Da Costa's resignation, he said “clear changes” needed to be made to the vetting process, adding he would not have hired Da Costa if he'd been aware of the posts.
    


            The transition has since brought on an outside legal firm to vet potential hires. Before that, vetting of candidates was led by an internal team and paid lawyers. Now, that team partners with the outside firm, which the transition has so far declined to name.
    


            The work will be paid for by the transition, which has raised $3.7 million dollars from more than 32,000 donors, a majority of whom gave less than $250 dollars, according to the transition.
    


            Mamdani's transition – a group of more than 400 people split into 17 committees dedicated to different policy areas – met a handful of times since the election, kicking off with an all-hands meeting in mid-November.
    


            That gathering was followed by Zoom meetings and smaller committee working groups, giving transition members a chance to discuss inner government workings and submit suggestions for potential hires. After those meetings, participants were asked to submit forms back to the transition team, according to several members of the transition who spoke with CNN, who said they were more an opportunity to submit ideas and the names of job candidates, and less of a chance to weigh in on policy.
    


            Then came the job interviews: Some candidates sat for meetings with members of the transition, sometimes over Zoom and in a handful of cases without a clear idea of which job they were interviewing for, according to two members of the transition who spoke about the process. That led to frustration among government wonks and public servants who wondered if they would need to inform their current employer that they were leaving to work in Mamdani's City Hall.
    


            Indeed, much of the work has taken place in secret. Members of Mamdani's transition were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements and were discouraged from speaking with the press.
    


            Mamdani's allies say the delay in making some appointments is not cause for alarm.
    


            Several pointed out Mamdani and his team have been working under a much shorter timeline than his predecessors: In previous years, the winner of New York's Democratic primary was considered a shoo-in for the general election, allowing them to shift focus to the work of the transition and start vetting dozens of candidates for high-stakes posts.

            But the 2025 race for mayor was hard-fought until the last minute. Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo mounted an independent general election bid despite his primary loss to Mamdani, and Adams, the incumbent, declined to drop his bid until just days before the election.
    


            “They had to do a job very quickly on something that usually can be spread out over months,” New York state Sen. Gustavo Rivera, a member of Mamdani's advisory committee, said of the transition process.
    


            “The north star is finding people who are committed to the job – public servants, first, who can do the job they're being asked to do,” Rivera said. “Zohran has a vision, and he is also smart and humble to know what he doesn't know.”

            Another series of atmospheric river-enhanced storms will soak California as the new year begins, bringing a flood threat and evacuation warnings back to the state just days after a destructive Christmas-week storm.
    


            The midweek storm lacks the extreme ingredients of last week's flooding, but it arrives in a state already pushed to its limits. With soil having little room to absorb additional water, rainfall rates rather than totals will determine where problems emerge. 



            Southern California, including Los Angeles, is the area of most concern, but the rest of the state will see more rain that could slow down travel.
    


            “Since the ground is so saturated from the super soaking Christmas storm, almost all rainfall will become runoff. This will allow flooding to occur with less rain amounts and rates than is typical,” the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said.
    


            California Gov. Gavin Newsom prepositioned crews and equipment ahead of the rain to respond to flooding and debris flows in Los Angeles and Ventura counties.
    


            Evacuation warnings have been issued for the second time in a week in parts of Los Angeles County recently burned by wildfires. The storms present a heightened threat of debris flows and flash flooding in these areas, which are the most incapable of absorbing heavy rain.
    


            The voluntary warnings begin at 11 a.m. PT and are meant to give residents time to prepare with heaviest rain moving in Wednesday night.
    


            Those warnings include the greater Wrightwood area, which was devastated by debris flows and flash flooding on Christmas Eve. Residents had to frantically flee their homes as a torrent of debris rushed through town and encased homes and cars in feet of mud.
    


            No evacuations have been ordered for Wrightwood proper in San Bernardino County, but they are in effect just to its west across the county line in Los Angeles County.
    


            The storm is expected to reach Southern California New Year's Eve, then spread north through much of the state into New Year's Day. Much of Southern California is in a Level 2 of 4 flooding rain threat Wednesday and Thursday, the Weather Prediction Center said.
    


            Coastal and valley areas such as downtown Los Angeles could see 1 to 3 inches of rain, with 2 to 5 inches possible in foothills and mountains.
    


            Light rain began in Southern California Wednesday morning, but the most worrisome downpours arrive around the stroke of midnight and will last through noon on New Year's Day. Rainfall should ease through the afternoon hours.
    


            The timing is bad news for the 137th Tournament of Roses Parade Thursday morning in Pasadena. This is expected to be the first wet Rose Parade since 2006, according to the National Weather Service.
    


            Rain arriving Wednesday night will affect parade-goers camping along the route, with downpours continuing into Thursday morning. 
    


            This system is only the first of three in a conga line that could affect the waterlogged state through early next week.
    


            Conditions change late Friday into Saturday as colder air drops snow below major pass levels, including Interstate 80 through Donner Pass.
    


            Over a foot of snow is likely at Sierra Nevada ski resorts, though exact totals remain uncertain and could make mountain travel hazardous.
    


            An avalanche last Friday killed a ski patroller and left another patroller injured at the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area in the eastern Sierra, according to the resort. It happened after feet of snow buried the mountain range last week.

DENVER (AP) — Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the former senator and U.S. representative of Colorado known for his passionate advocacy of Native American issues, died Tuesday. He was 92.

Campbell died of natural causes surrounded by his family, his daughter, Shanan Campbell, confirmed to The Associated Press.

Campbell, a Democrat who stunned his party by joining the Republican Party, stood out in Congress as much for his unconventional dress — cowboy boots, bolo ties and ponytail — as his defense of children's rights, organized labor and fiscal conservatism.

A member of the Northern Cheyenne tribe, Campbell said his ancestors were among more than 150 Native Americans, mostly women, children and elderly men, killed by U.S. soldiers while camped under a flag of truce on Nov. 29, 1864.

He served three terms in the House, starting in 1987. He then served two terms in the Senate, from 1993 to 2005.

Among his accomplishments was helping sponsor legislation upgrading the Great Sand Dunes National Monument in southern Colorado to a national park.

“He was a master jeweler with a reputation far beyond the boundaries of Colorado,” said Colorado Sen. John Hickenlooper on X. “I will not forget his acts of kindness. He will be sorely missed.”




The motorcycle-riding lawmaker and cattle rancher was considered a maverick even before he abruptly switched to the Republican Party in March 1995, angry with Democrats for killing a balanced-budget amendment in the Senate. His switch outraged Democratic leaders and was considered a coup for the GOP.

“I get hammered from the extremes,” he said shortly afterward. “I'm always willing to listen ... but I just don't think you can be all things to all people, no matter which party you're in.”

Considered a shoo-in for a third Senate term, Campbell stunned supporters when he dropped out of the race in 2004 after a health scare.

“I thought it was a heart attack. It wasn't,” said Campbell. “But when I was lying on that table in the hospital looking up at all those doctors' faces, I decided then, ‘Do I really need to do this six more years after I've been gone so much from home?' I have two children I didn't get to see grow up, quite frankly.”

He retired to focus on the Native American jewelry that helped make him wealthy and was put on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian. He also worked on a line of outdoor gear with a California-based company, Kiva Designs, and became a senior policy adviser with the powerhouse law firm of Holland & Knight in Washington.

Campbell founded Ben Nighthorse Consultants which focused on federal policy, including Native American affairs and natural resources. The former senator also drove the Capitol Christmas Tree across the country to Washington, D.C., on several occasions.

“He was truly one of a kind, and I am thinking of his family in the wake of his loss,” said Colorado Rep. Diana DeGette on X.

In 1982, he was planning to deliver his jewelry to California, but bad weather grounded his plane. He was killing time in the southern Colorado city of Durango when he went to a county Democratic meeting and wound up giving a speech for a friend running for sheriff.

Democrats were looking for someone to challenge a GOP legislative candidate and sounded out Campbell during the meeting. “Like a fish, I was hooked,” he said.

His opponent, Don Whalen, was a popular former college president who “looked like he was out of a Brooks Brothers catalog,” Campbell recalled. “I don't think anybody gave me any kind of a chance. ... I just think I expended a whole lot of energy to prove them wrong.”

Campbell hit the streets, ripping town maps out of the Yellow Pages and walking door to door to talk with people. He recalled leaving a note at a house in Cortez where no one was home when he heard a car roar into the driveway, gravel flying and brakes squealing.

The driver jumped out, tire iron in hand, and screamed that Campbell couldn't have his furniture. “Aren't you the repossession company?” the man asked.

“And I said, ‘No man, I'm just running for office.' We got to talking, and I think the guy voted for me.”

Campbell went on to win and he never lost an election thereafter, moving from the Colorado House to the U.S. House and then the Senate.

Born April 13, 1933, in Auburn, California, Campbell served in the Air Force in Korea from 1951 to 1953 and received a bachelor's degree from San Jose State University in 1957. He attended Meiji University in Tokyo from 1960 to 1964, was captain of the U.S. judo team in the 1964 Olympics and won a gold medal in the Pan American Games.

Campbell once called then-Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt a “forked-tongued snake” for opposing a water project near the southern Colorado town of Ignacio, which Campbell promoted as a way to honor the water rights of the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute tribes.

He clashed with environmentalists on everything from mining law and grazing reforms to setting aside land for national monuments.

Despite all this — or perhaps because of it — voters loved him. In 1998, Campbell won reelection to the Senate by routing Democrat Dottie Lamm, the wife of former Gov. Dick Lamm, despite his switch to the GOP. He was the only Native American in the Senate at the time.

He said he was criticized as a Democrat for voting with Republicans, and then pilloried by some newspapers for his stances after the switch.

“It didn't change me. I didn't change my voting record. For instance, I had a sterling voting record as a Democrat on labor. I still do as a Republican. And on minorities and women's issues,” he said.

Campbell said his values — liberal on social issues, conservative on fiscal ones — were shaped by his life. Children's causes were dear to him because he and his sister spent time in an orphanage when his father was in jail and his mother had tuberculosis.

Organized labor won his backing because hooking up with the Teamsters and learning to drive a truck got him out of the California tomato fields. His time as a Sacramento County sheriff's deputy in California in the late 1960s and early '70s made him a law enforcement advocate.

His decision to retire from politics, Campbell said, had nothing to do with allegations that Ginnie Kontnik, his former chief of staff, solicited kickbacks from another staffer and that his office lobbied for a contract for a technology company with ties to the former senator.

He referred both matters to the Senate Ethics Committee. In 2007, Kontnik pleaded guilty to a federal charge of not reporting $2,000 in income.

“I guess there was some disappointment” with those charges, Campbell said. “But a lot of things happen in Washington that disappoint you. You just have to get over them because every day there's a new crisis to deal with.”

SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — On New Year's Day, Bulgaria becomes the 21st country to join the euro currency union, furthering its integration into the European Union. But the historic milestone arrives amid political instability and skepticism among ordinary people fueled by fears of price rises.

Supporters of switching to the euro from the old currency, the lev, are praising the move as one of the greatest achievements since the 1989 transition from a Soviet-style economy to democracy and free markets. They hope it will make the country more attractive for investors and strengthen its orientation toward wealthier Western Europe. 

But many people are uneasy, in a country where corruption is rife and trust in the authorities is low. One fear is that merchants will round prices up or otherwise use the changeover to worsen inflation, at a time when inflation has rebounded to 3.7%. 

An EU Eurobarometer poll from March showed that 53% of 1,017 people surveyed opposed joining the eurozone, while 45% were in favor. A separate Eurobarometer poll, taken between Oct. 9 and Nov. 3 on a similar sample, showed that about half of Bulgarians opposed the single currency while 42% were in favor. The margin of error was about plus or minus 3.1 percentage points for the March poll. 




The government successfully completed the euro adoption process by beating inflation down to 2.7% earlier this year to comply with EU rules and win approval from EU leaders. But clearing that hurdle was followed by a new chapter of political chaos. The government resigned after less than a year in office amid nationwide anti-corruption protests. This left the country without a regular budget for next year and is hampering plans for long-overdue structural reforms and decisions on use of EU support funds. A new election — the eighth in five years — is expected to be held next spring.

Nevelin Petrov, 64, said he welcomed the euro. “Bulgaria is a full member of the European Union, and its rightful place is alongside the other developed and democratic European nations,” he said. “I am convinced that the adoption of the euro will contribute to the long-term prosperity of our country,” he said.

Others, like Darina Vitova, who runs a pedicure salon in Sofia, said things were moving too fast although she welcomed the change “in principle.”

“The standard of living and incomes in our country are far from those in the richest European countries, while prices here are rising and life for the average person will become more difficult,” she said. She acknowledges that when heading to the beaches in neighboring Greece, it will be more convenient to pay with the same “pocket money” she uses at home.

Bulgaria, with its 6.4 million people, is one of the poorest members of the 27-country European union. The average monthly wage is 1,300 euros ($1,530). 

Countries that join the EU commit to the euro, but actually joining can take years and some members are in no hurry. Poland in particular has seen strong economic growth since joining the EU in 2004 without adopting the euro.

Opponents of joining have fed fears that the changes will allegedly lead to more poverty and loss of national identity. Social media has spread disinformation such as false claims that the euro could lead to confiscation of bank accounts. Nationalist and pro-Russian groups exploit these fears.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has said that countries have experienced a slight, transient rise in prices of 0.2%-0.4% right after joining. Price rises can be more apparent than real, as cafe and hairdressers may put off printing new menus and price lists ahead of the change, so that increases are only delayed, not caused by the euro.

Anti-euro rallies in May and September were organized by the pro-Russian Vazrazhdane party but remained smaller than the mass protests that toppled the government. While the anti-euro protests were supported by older people based on economic anxiety, the mass protests that toppled the government appeared to represent a younger electorate fed up with corruption and eager to integrate with Europe.

Anti-euro disinformation spread by pro-Russian politicians and social media aim “to reduce support for the European Union, NATO and Ukraine,” said Dimitar Keranov, program coordinator for engaging Central Europe at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin.

Bulgaria's European integration “is not in Moscow's interest at all, so if it can somehow polarize society and weaken support for the European Union that's what it tries to achieve,” he said.

Euro adoption is another way to combat Russian influence, he said: “The further Bulgaria advances in its European integration, the harder it becomes for Russia to influence the country.”

Petar Ganev, an analyst at the Sofia-based Institute for Market Economics, says that that by stepping down the outgoing government has sent a signal of uncertainty to foreign investors.

“Instead of capitalizing on euro adoption as a strong and positive signal to the international community—investors, debt holders, and those investing in Bulgarian assets and economic activity—we risk sending the opposite message,” Ganev said in an interview with the Associated Press.

Ganev believes that eurozone membership should be regarded as an opportunity, an additional mechanism to address corruption and the rule of law, although it alone cannot resolve Bulgaria's chronic cycle of elections and political fragmentation and instability.

Local economists think that joining the euro will not bring dramatic changes to Bulgaria's economy. That is because the lev has been pegged since 1999 to the euro by law, at a fixed rate of 1 lev for every 51 euro cents.

The lev and the euro will be in dual use for cash payments for the whole month of January, but people will receive only euros in change.

BEIJING (AP) — Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday hailed his country's technological progress in areas such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors while once again insisting his country would annex self-ruled Taiwan. 

During his New Year's Eve address broadcast Wednesday evening by state media, Xi praised the country's advancements in key sectors including military tech and space exploration. Images ranging from humanoid robots performing kung fu to new hydropower projects rolled on the screen as he spoke.

“We sought to energize high-quality development through innovation,” Xi said while thanking Chinese people for contributing to the country's economic growth over the past five years.

China plans its economic development over periods of five years and is preparing to discuss its new five-year plan at the upcoming legislative session in March. 

The country is set to speed up self-reliance in science and technology as the United States imposes increasingly tight controls on access to semiconductors and other high-tech items.

Xi also praised the country's rising prominence on the world stage by listing high-level political events and exchanges it hosted over the past year.

Regarding Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that China considers sovereign territory, Xi reiterated Beijing's annexation intentions.

“We Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait share a bond of blood and kinship,” he said. “The reunification of our motherland, a trend of the times, is unstoppable.”




China this week conducted two days of military drills around Taiwan, launching rockets and sending aircraft and warships in response to a planned arms sale by the U.S. to the island.

Taiwan President Lai Ching-te condemned the drills but said his territory would act responsibly by neither escalating the conflict nor provoking disputes.

PARIS (AP) — Trains were running again Wednesday in both directions through the Channel Tunnel between continental Europe and the United Kingdom but problems remained after a day of travel chaos caused by power malfunctions.

The tunnel operator, Eurotunnel, said the 50-kilometer (32-mile) undersea link was back to “full capacity” after a power fault inside it was fixed overnight Tuesday. The short statement didn't detail the cause of the power failure. 

But Eurostar, which runs passenger trains through the tunnel, warned of continued possible delays and cancellations because of “knock-on impacts” from the severe disruptions on Tuesday. Its website showed delays Wednesday to London-Paris, London-Brussels and London-Amsterdam trains in both directions and early morning cancellations.

Tuesday's hours-long interruption of cross-Channel train services and a resulting cascade of cancellations upended travelers' end-of-year getaway plans and provoked scrambles for flights and buses.

Another power malfunction Tuesday on the U.K. side that Eurostar said was related to the electrical fault inside the tunnel also caused severe delays for passengers aboard three trains, Eurostar said.

It said an overhead power cable fell onto a Eurostar train from London to Paris, near the tunnel entrance, and that an effort to move the train with its passengers inside proved “very complex.” The power failure also caused severe delays to two trains to Brussels, Eurostar said. 




Passenger Ghislain Planque told French broadcaster BFMTV that his Eurostar journey Tuesday evening from London to France was meant to take just under 90 minutes but instead took around 11 hours, with passengers stuck overnight in the train that had only intermittent power.

“We were left without electricity, so with no heating, no air-conditioning, no possibility to charge phones,” he said. “We were in total darkness for some of the time.”

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports on the Trump administration's strikes on ISIS targets in Syria following the deaths of three Americans on ‘Special Report.'

U.S. and partner forces killed or captured nearly 25 Islamic State operatives in Syria in the days following a large-scale U.S.-led strike on Dec. 19, according to a new statement from U.S. Central Command, underscoring Washington's assessment that ISIS remains an active and persistent threat inside the country.

CENTCOM said those forces conducted 11 follow-on missions between Dec. 20 and Dec. 29, killing at least seven ISIS members, capturing the remainder and eliminating four ISIS weapons caches. The operations followed Operation Hawkeye Strike, when U.S. and Jordanian forces hit more than 70 ISIS targets across central Syria using over 100 precision munitions, destroying infrastructure and weapons sites linked to the group. 

""We will not relent,"" CENTCOM Commander Adm. Brad Cooper said, adding that U.S. forces remain ""steadfast"" in working with regional partners to dismantle ISIS networks that pose a threat to U.S. and regional security.

The scope of the follow-on raids highlights a reality U.S. commanders and analysts have been warning about for months: ISIS no longer controls large swaths of territory, but it retains the ability to organize, strike and regenerate inside Syria's fragmented security landscape.

Syria remains divided among competing forces, militias and foreign-backed armed groups, with no single authority exercising full control over large parts of the country. Analysts say that vacuum continues to provide space for ISIS cells to operate quietly, recruit and exploit overstretched local forces.

Analysts note that Syria's security environment remains shaped by former jihadist networks that were never fully demobilized after the war. The country's transitional leadership, including President Ahmed al-Sharaa, emerged from armed Islamist factions that relied heavily on foreign fighters and militias, according to regional security assessments. While those groups are not synonymous with ISIS, experts say the incomplete dismantling of extremist networks has left gaps that ISIS cells continue to exploit.

""ISIS today doesn't need a caliphate to be dangerous,"" Bill Roggio told Fox News Digital. ""We've always been quick to declare terrorist organizations defeated and insignificant, and that couldn't be further from the truth.""

Roggio said the group has adapted rather than disappeared, shifting away from holding territory toward smaller, more covert cells capable of carrying out lethal attacks. He pointed to ongoing ISIS activity not only in Syria and Iraq, but also in Afghanistan and other regions, citing United Nations reporting that estimates roughly 2,000 ISIS fighters remain active in Afghanistan alone.

""That's not what a defeated group looks like,"" Roggio said, noting that ISIS continues to recruit, indoctrinate and inspire attacks even without the visibility it once had.

FROM SYRIA TO SOMALIA, US TROOPS REMAIN DEPLOYED THIS HOLIDAY SEASON UNDER MISSIONS THAT NEVER FORMALLY ENDED

One of the most sensitive vulnerabilities remains the network of detention facilities in northeastern Syria holding thousands of ISIS terrorists and supporters. Those prisons are guarded primarily by Kurdish-led forces backed by a small U.S. military presence, estimated at roughly 1,000 troops, according to Reuters.

U.S. and coalition officials have repeatedly warned that any major disruption to prison security could allow hardened ISIS operatives to escape and reconstitute networks across Syria and beyond. Kurdish officials have also raised concerns about funding shortages, manpower strain and pressure from rival militias operating nearby.

While U.S. officials have not publicly linked the recent strikes to prison-related threats, analysts say the broader environment of fragmented control increases the risk of coordinated attacks, insider assistance or prison unrest.

The danger is not theoretical. ISIS has previously staged mass prison break operations in Syria and Iraq, including a 2022 assault on the al-Sinaa prison in Hasakah that required days of fighting to contain.

The U.S. strikes also come amid continued instability inside Syria, where multiple armed actors operate with overlapping authority. Analysts note that clashes among militias, sectarian violence and unresolved command structures have weakened overall security and diverted attention from counterterrorism efforts.

Bombings in neighborhoods of Damascus, including Mezzeh, and unrest in minority areas have further illustrated the gaps ISIS and other extremist groups can exploit, according to regional security assessments and open-source reporting.

""Syria's chaos is the accelerant,"" Roggio said. ""ISIS thrives where no one is fully in charge.""

U.S. officials and analysts stress that ISIS activity in Syria is part of a wider pattern rather than an isolated flare-up.

Sources in the Israeli Mossad told Fox News Digital of continued ISIS-linked activity across multiple theaters, including recruitment networks and small-scale attacks designed to test security responses and maintain operational relevance.

In Turkey, security forces recently clashed with Islamic State militants during counterterrorism operations, wounding several officers, according to Reuters on Monday. Turkish authorities said the raids targeted ISIS cells suspected of planning attacks inside the country.

""These are signals, not spikes,"" Roggio said. ""ISIS operates across regions, adapting to pressure and exploiting weak governance wherever it finds it.""

The renewed U.S. military action raises difficult questions for policymakers about how long the current containment strategy can hold.

While U.S. officials say the Dec. 19 strikes delivered a significant blow to ISIS infrastructure, they have also acknowledged that counterterrorism operations alone cannot eliminate the underlying conditions that allow the group to persist.

Christian Pulisic is not dating Sydney Sweeney, and he wants everyone to know.

The United States Men's National Team superstar has been rumored to be dating the famed actress, but he put those rumors to bed earlier this week.

""Please stop with the made-up stories about my personal life. Need to hold sources accountable it can affect people's lives,"" Pulisic wrote on his Instagram story earlier this week.

In another post that highlighted Pulisic's accomplishments, one of which was his reported fling with Sweeney, Pulisic wrote, ""Fake news guys let's stop with the silly rumor.""

Sweeney, 28, is just one year and six days older than the 27-year-old Pulisic, who was born in 1998 — both were born in mid-September.

But Pulisic has been dating golfer Alexa Melton since at least the summer of 2024. Melton played college golf at USC and competed in the 2024 U.S. Women's Open. She has mostly competed on the women's Epson Tour but not since 2024.

LOOKING BACK AT THE SPORTS GAMBLING CONTROVERSIES THROUGHOUT 2025, WITH NBA AND MLB INVESTIGATIONS LEADING WAY

Sweeney, meanwhile, has been linked to music manager Scooter Braun, who has worked with Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift.

Pulisic will suit up for the Stars and Stripes this summer at the 2026 World Cup, which will be played throughout North America. The final will take place July 19 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, home of the New York Giants and Jets.

It will be Pulisic's second appearance in the World Cup, having also played in 2022 in Qatar. That team advanced to the knockout stage but was eliminated by the Netherlands, who lost to eventual champion Argentina in the round of 16.

The U.S. is the highest-ranked team in its group this summer, joining Australia (26th), Paraguay (39th) and a team to be determined in a playoff.

The USMNT has not had much success in the World Cup. The squad reached the Round of 16 in 2010 and 2014 but failed to qualify for the tournament in 2018. It returned to the Round of 16 three years ago but couldn't advance out of the Copa América group stage on home soil last year.

Former U.S. Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado died on Tuesday at the age of 92, according to his family.

Campbell died of natural causes surrounded by his family, his daughter Shanan Campbell, announced. He is survived by his wife Linda, their two children, Shanan and Colin, as well as four grandchildren.

Originally a Democrat, Campbell switched to the Republican Party in 1995 while serving in the U.S. Senate, a seat he held from 1993 until his retirement in 2005 due to health reasons.

Before serving in the Senate, he held office in the U.S. House and the Colorado House.

Campbell was known for his passionate advocacy of Native American issues as well as his dress attire, which included cowboy boots, bolo ties and a ponytail.

He was a member of the Northern Cheyenne tribe and said his ancestors were among more than 150 Native Americans, mostly women, children and elderly men, killed by U.S. soldiers while camped under a flag of truce on Nov. 29, 1864. He helped sponsor legislation to upgrade the Great Sand Dunes National Monument in southern Colorado, where the killings happened, to a national park.

Campbell was also a strong supporter of children's rights, organized labor and fiscal conservatism.

A renowned master jeweler, Campbell has designs displayed at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian.

""He was a master jeweler with a reputation far beyond the boundaries of Colorado. I will not forget his acts of kindness. He will be sorely missed,"" Colorado Sen. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, said on X.

Colorado Democrat Gov. Jared Polis ordered flags to be lowered to half staff from sunrise to sunset on the day of Campbell's service.

""He will be missed here in Colorado and across the country, and his contributions leave a lasting legacy to our state and nation,"" Polis said on X.

Born April 13, 1933, in Auburn, California, Campbell also served in the Air Force during the Korean War.

He received a bachelor's degree from San Jose State University in 1957. He also attended Meiji University in Tokyo from 1960 to 1964, was captain of the U.S. judo team at the 1964 Olympics and won a gold medal in the Pan American Games.

Additionally, he worked as a deputy sheriff in Sacramento County, California, coached the U.S. national judo team, operated his own dojo in Sacramento and taught high school classes.

Campbell was also a motorcycle rider and cattle rancher, and he was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame.

The former lawmaker has driven the Capitol Christmas Tree across the country to Washington, D.C., on several occasions.

""He was truly one of a kind, and I am thinking of his family in the wake of his loss,"" Colorado Rep. Diana DeGette, a Democrat, said on X.

Campbell founded Ben Nighthorse Consultants, a lobbying firm that focused on federal policy, including Native American affairs and natural resources, following his retirement from public office. He also continued to design and craft American Indian jewelry after leaving Congress.

Although he switched to the Republican Party in March 1995 after becoming angry with Democrats for killing a balanced-budget amendment in the Senate, Campbell said his principles never changed.

""It didn't change me. I didn't change my voting record. For instance, I had a sterling voting record as a Democrat on labor. I still do as a Republican. And on minorities and women's issues,"" he once said.

A social liberal and fiscal conservative, Campbell's party switch outraged Democrat leaders.

""I get hammered from the extremes,"" he said shortly after the switch. ""I'm always willing to listen ... but I just don't think you can be all things to all people, no matter which party you're in.""

Editor's Note: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Ben Nighthorse Campbell was the first Native American to serve in both the U.S. House and U.S. Senate. In fact, Charles Curtis was the first to hold that distinction.

LeBron James made his Los Angeles Lakers season debut last night, starting year 23 with a win over the Utah Jazz. Nick Wright, Chris Broussard, and Kevin Wildes discuss how impressive this was for LeBron, and how much pressure is on Patrick Mahome.

LeBron James took heat over the weekend after he was seen swinging his hips during the national anthem before the Los Angeles Lakers played the Sacramento Kings.

The Lakers star was accused of practicing his golf swing instead of standing still with either his hand over his heart or with his hands behind his back. Sports pundit Craig Carton called out James for the move during an episode of his podcast on Monday.

""If you wanna disregard your coach, disregard your teammates, being an 11-plus-1 type of guy, do it on your own time. Don't do it during my national anthem,"" Carton said. ""A couple of days ago, Lakers basketball, national anthem, he disrespects the national anthem.

""And while the anthem is being played, your guy, the self-appointed ‘King,' decides that's a good time to work on my golf swing and disrespect the men and women of the military who gave their lives for this country. ‘Let me get a couple of air swings in while the anthem is being played because I don't play good basketball anymore. I gotta work on my golf game.'""

Fox News Digital reached out to James' reps for comment.

National anthem controversies first bubbled up during the 2016 season when then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee while ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" played. He said he was protesting racial injustice in the U.S., and took it a step further when he wore socks depicting police officers as pigs and expressed support for Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.

An anthem controversy sparked up again when James and others took a knee during the song in the NBA bubble after Jacob Blake was shot in a police incident weeks after the death of George Floyd. Blake later admitted he had a knife on him when he was shot.

It didn't appear James was doing an act of protesting before the game against the Kings.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Trump 'absolutely' wants to revoke citizenship of Somalis who committed fraud in Minnesota: Leavitt","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/4364551/leavitt-trump-revoke-citizenship-somalis-fraud-minnesota/","Wed, 31 Dec 2025 15:00:23 GMT","

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed on Wednesday that President Donald Trump wants to denaturalize members of Minnesota's Somali community involved in yearslong, billion-dollar fraud schemes.

The scandal, which has already produced dozens of federal indictments in recent weeks, has proven a political godsend for the Trump administration, which is hoping to turn the national conversations away from the economy and back toward immigration heading into the 2026 midterm election cycle.

During a Wednesday morning interview with Fox News, Leavitt said the scandal will be a “top priority” for federal investigators heading into the new year.

“The Department of Justice, as we speak, is continuing to execute search warrants and subpoenas. People will be in handcuffs as a result of the fraud that Governor Walz has allowed to occur there for many, many years,” she said. “We're also not afraid to use denaturalization.”

Leavitt was asked by Fox News to clarify whether Somalis convicted of fraud should “have their citizenship revoked,” to which she responded, “Absolutely.”

“It's something the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State is currently looking at right now. It's something this administration has already done, and we know that there are liberal activist judges across the country who will try to block and tackle this administration from pursuing justice at every turn,” she continued. “But that's not going to stop the president and his entire cabinet by acting on behalf of law abiding, taxpaying citizens in the state of Minnesota and in states across the country who have been ripped off by people who abused our immigration system, came to our country, do not love our country or respect our values, and now have been ripping off and stealing money from law abiding Americans. This administration is not going to tolerate it.”

Denaturalization, the process by which the federal government revokes citizenship status from former immigrants, is extremely rare and can only be pursued through the judicial system. From 1990 through 2017, the federal government opened an average of just 11 denaturalization cases per year, although the number rose to 25 cases per year during Trump's first term in office.

Furthermore, the government cannot revoke the citizenship status of citizens who were born in the United States; it can only revoke the citizenship status of immigrants who later became naturalized U.S. citizens. Roughly 100,000 Somalis currently live in Minnesota, with more than half being born on U.S. soil. Nearly 90% of Somali immigrants living in Minnesota are believed to be naturalized citizens.

In the weeks after the fraud cases made national headlines, the Trump administration has taken several steps to implicate Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) in the scandal. Leavitt referred to Walz as “completely incompetent.”

HERE'S HOW DENATURALIZATION WOULD WORK FOR US CITIZENS FROM SOMALIA

Furthermore, the administration has deployed Justice Department and Homeland Security personnel to the state to continue investigations and immigration enforcement actions.

Leavitt said the administration also paused Small Business Administration and Health and Human Services child care funding to the state while the investigations continue.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday accused a Politico reporter of “inciting violence” against federal authorities in a social media post about the ongoing federal investigation of alleged fraud in Minnesota's day cares.

Josh Gerstein, a senior legal affairs reporter, suggested Minnesotans have the right to stand their ground when federal officers approach their businesses.

“At some point, the amateur effort to knock on doors of home daycares intersects with robust stand-your-ground laws,” he wrote on X late Monday.

At some point, the amateur effort to knock on doors of home daycares intersects with robust stand-your-ground laws

Stand-your-ground laws allow people to use deadly force for self-defense when threatened in public. Gerstein's post suggests that deadly force could be used against ICE officers if they knock on the doors of day care centers.

ICE called out the reporter for making the insinuation.

“You would think a ‘Senior Legal Affairs Reporter' for POLITICO would know better than to tweet something inciting violence against federal agents,” the agency posted on social media.

Gerstein wrote a message in response to ICE less than 10 minutes later: “To observe that something is likely to happen or there's a serious risk of it happening is not to advocate for it happening.”

ICE JOINS FBI AGENTS IN INVESTIGATING SUSPECTED MINNESOTA FRAUD SITES

Minnesota does not have a broad stand-your-ground law, but the state does permit the use of deadly force without retreating in a person's home, vehicle, or place of business as long as the person reasonably believes they're in danger of serious bodily harm or death. Typically, a person must retreat first in public places.

The federal government is currently investigating alleged fraud schemes involving Minnesota's social services programs and day care facilities. ICE is collaborating with the FBI to investigate suspected fraud sites in Minnesota. ICE is highly active in Minneapolis and St. Paul, where Somali immigrants are concentrated, as part of an immigration enforcement operation in the blue state.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Democratic candidate Renee Hardman won the Iowa Senate special election on Tuesday, preventing Republicans from regaining two-thirds control of the state's upper chamber.

Hardman defeated Republican candidate Lucas Loftin by nearly 45 percentage points, according to the election results, which showed that more than 95% of the votes were in by late Tuesday.

The special election was for a seat representing parts of Des Moines's suburbs. The seat became vacant after Democratic state Sen. Claire Celsi died of an undisclosed medical condition in October.

Celsi's death reduced the Democratic caucus to 16 seats in the 50-seat Iowa Senate. With Hardman's victory, her party now holds 17 seats, compared to the Republicans' 33.

The Democratic Party previously broke the GOP supermajority in an August special election, but that victory was undermined by Celsi's death two months later.

If Loftin won, Republicans could have easily overrode gubernatorial vetoes, called special sessions, and confirmed Gov. Kim Reynolds's (R-IA) appointees without Democratic support. But given his loss, Iowa Republicans now need at least one Democratic vote to confirm the governor's nominees to state agencies, boards, and commissions.

Tuesday's special election adds to the Democratic Party's winning streak this year. The Democratic National Committee congratulated Hardman on her “historic” win as the first black woman elected to the Iowa Senate.

“Senator-elect Hardman … will be a voice for working Iowans and will fight tooth and nail to make Iowa more affordable,” DNC Chairman Ken Martin said. “Her victory ensures that Iowa Republicans will not have a supermajority in the Iowa Senate, a major check on Republican power that puts billionaires first. With the last special election of the year now decided, one thing is clear: 2025 was the year of Democratic victories and overperformance, and Democrats are on track for big midterm elections.”

IOWA SPECIAL ELECTION PUTS GOP SENATE SUPERMAJORITY BACK IN PLAY

Iowa Auditor Rob Sand, the sole Democrat currently serving in statewide elected office and one of the leading candidates to replace Reynolds next year, also released a hopeful statement ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

“Congrats to Renee Hardman on her over 40-point victory in SD-16 tonight,” Sand wrote on X. “As the sixth straight Democratic overperformance in special elections since 2024, it's clear Iowans are ready for change as we head into 2026.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A federal judge has ordered the Department of Justice to turn over internal records tied to its decision to investigate and charge Salvadoran migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, signaling growing judicial skepticism that senior DOJ leadership may have pushed the prosecution while publicly denying involvement.

The order, issued earlier this month by U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw and unsealed on Tuesday, requires prosecutors to produce documents related to the opening of a criminal investigation and the pursuit of charges stemming from a 2022 traffic stop. The investigation was launched earlier this year while Abrego Garcia was being held at El Salvador's CECOT maximum-security prison.

Crenshaw's ruling sets the stage for a high-stakes evidentiary hearing scheduled for Jan. 28 in Nashville, where the Trump administration will be required to rebut prior findings that the prosecution may have been vindictive. The judge canceled Abrego Garcia's trial date pending the outcome of that hearing.

While stopping short of ordering testimony from senior officials, the judge highlighted internal emails that appear to contradict prosecutors' repeated claims that the charging decision was made locally without outside pressure. Those emails suggest that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and his office were closely looped in as the case progressed.

“These documents show that McGuire did not act alone,” Crenshaw wrote, referring to Robert E. McGuire, the acting U.S. attorney in Nashville. “The government's documents may contradict its prior representations that the decision to prosecute was made locally and that there were no outside influences.”

In an April 30 email, Aakash Singh, a senior official in Blanche's office, told prosecutors that charging Abrego Garcia was a “top priority” for DOJ leadership, according to page five of the unsealed order. McGuire responded that the office wanted the “high command looped in.” In another message weeks later, McGuire said he had heard “anecdotally” that Blanche and then-Principal Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove III wanted charges filed quickly.

Abrego Garcia's attorneys argue the case was brought in retaliation for his success in a separate civil suit in Maryland challenging his deportation. Crenshaw previously ruled in October that Abrego Garcia had established a “reasonable likelihood” of vindictive prosecution, shifting the burden to the government to rebut that conclusion.

The DOJ has pushed back aggressively, asserting attorney-client and work-product privileges and denying any improper motive. Blanche's office has dismissed claims that he played a leading role in the prosecution.

DHS TRASHES ABREGO GARCIA FOR ‘MAKING TIKTOKS' DURING HIS RELEASE

The criminal case is unfolding alongside parallel immigration litigation. A Maryland judge on Dec. 11 ordered Abrego Garcia released from immigration custody and accused DOJ lawyers of misleading the court. That judge has temporarily barred his re-detention, though the administration has signaled it may attempt to rearrest him.

Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador earlier this year despite a 2019 withholding of removal order to his country of origin. This political and legal saga now threatens to expose the inner workings of DOJ decision-making at the highest levels.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Department of Health and Human Services announced on Tuesday that all child care payments to Minnesota have been frozen in response to the widespread fraud allegations under federal investigation.

The move taken by HHS concerns Somali-run day care centers that are allegedly benefiting from government payments issued by the Administration for Children and Families. The Trump administration alleges the centers in question are stealing money directly from children.

In a video, HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill and ACF Assistant Secretary Alex Adams said they took three direct actions to combat the alleged child care fraud.

We have frozen all child care payments to the state of Minnesota.You have probably read the serious allegations that the state of Minnesota has funneled millions of taxpayer dollars to fraudulent daycares across Minnesota over the past decade.Today we have taken three actions… pic.twitter.com/VYbyf3WGop

First, the department is now requiring justification and receipt or photo evidence of all ACF payments in Minnesota and the rest of the country.

Secondly, HHS demanded Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) provide a comprehensive audit of the day care centers. O'Neill said the audit will include attendance records, licenses, complaints, investigations, and inspections.

Thirdly, HHS launched a dedicated hotline and email address to report suspected child care fraud.

In a subsequent post, O'Neill said the frozen funds will be released “when states prove they are being spent legitimately.”

Walz suggested HHS's actions were politically motivated.

“This is Trump's long game. We've spent years cracking down on fraudsters,” he wrote on X. “It's a serious issue — but this has been his plan all along. He's politicizing the issue to defund programs that help Minnesotans.”

The Democratic governor maintains his administration has taken steps to crack down on fraud by referring cases to law enforcement and shutting down or auditing certain programs. Despite his efforts, he has faced intense criticism from Minnesota Republicans and the Trump administration on the fraud issue since late November.

Minnesota's day care system recently came under scrutiny following a viral video that shed light on the state's fraud scandal. O'Neill credited independent journalist Nick Shirley for making the video.

Adams said his office provides Minnesota with $185 million in child care funds annually, estimating that 19,000 American children are meant to benefit from that amount of money.

After speaking with the director of Minnesota Child Care Services, Adams said he was not told with “confidence whether those allegations of fraud are isolated or whether there's fraud stretching statewide.”

MINNESOTA OFFICIALS REVEAL PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS INTO CHILD DAY CARE CENTERS UNCOVERED NO ‘FINDINGS OF FRAUD'

Commissioner Tikki Brown of the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families revealed that while no fraud has been found at child day care centers in the state so far, her office is investigating the centers again in response to Shirley's video.

“While we have questions about some of the methods that were used in the video, we do take the concerns that the video raises about fraud very seriously,” Brown said on Monday. “Each of the facilities mentioned in the video has been visited at least once in the last six months as part of our typical licensing process, and in fact, our staff are out in the community today to visit each of these sites again so that we can look into the concerns that were raised in the video.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A symbol of New York is gone.

On a chilly December morning, I descended a flight of stairs and entered the New York Transit Museum. Housed in a decommissioned subway station in downtown Brooklyn, the museum was packed with elementary-school children on a field trip. All around me, tour guides shepherded groups of them through the various exhibits. Later on, I heard one guide ask if any of the students knew how to pay for the subway. “You tap a phone,” a child volunteered.



For decades, the default answer has been something else: You swipe a MetroCard. Something like a flimsy yellow credit card, the MetroCard has bound together nearly everyone in the city—real-estate moguls and tenants, Mets and Yankees fans, lifelong New Yorkers like myself and new arrivals from Ohio. Any tourist who visited New York inevitably got one. But now the MetroCard era is about to end. Today is the last day you can purchase a card.



The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the organization that operates the city's public-transit system, has for years been phasing out the MetroCard in favor of contactless payment—tapping your phone or a credit card, much as you would at any store. The new system, known as OMNY (“One Metro New York”), will bring together the benefits of technological progress: tens of millions of dollars in savings for both riders and the MTA each year, shorter lines, less plastic waste. Many other large metro systems have already fully transitioned to tap-and-go; in this sense, New York is behind the times.



In 2025, swiping a plastic rectangle through a card reader feels like an anachronism, but the MetroCard shouldn't be taken for granted. Every little yellow plastic rectangle represents a genuine technological marvel.

At first, the MetroCard was a flop. The system was designed to be a technological leap forward: No longer would New Yorkers have to lug around physical tokens to pay for subways and buses. MetroCards would not only be lighter, but allow users to transfer between trains and buses without having to pay a second time. Despite the obvious upside, convincing people to embrace the swipe was not easy. When the MetroCard debuted, in 1994, “everybody was like, ‘I don't want to give up my tokens. You'll get my tokens out of my cold dead hands,'” Jodi Shapiro, the Transit Museum's curator, told me. People lined up to buy as many tokens as possible before sales ended so they could put off converting to the MetroCard for as long as possible. Television segments reassured New Yorkers that “they could get to work by using plastic.” The MTA put out ads and flyers explaining how to use the card, and briefly considered having someone dressed as an aardvark (the “Cardvaark”) go to Times Square and educate passersby about the MetroCard.

Despite a rough start, the MetroCard swipe eventually just became routine. Knowing how to swipe a MetroCard—the crook of your elbow, the gentle flick of your wrist as you glide the magnetic stripe through the card reader—is essential New York knowledge. To create the infrastructure for this system, “all of this technology had to be upgraded,” Shapiro said. “And some of it had to be invented.” The MTA needed not just physical cards, but also a way to read them, vending machines to sell them, and a central computer system to track each one and process every transaction. Even the “swipe” mechanism, faster and easier to maintain than fare cards in other American cities at the time, was bespoke—designed specifically for New York City public transit's sprawl and enormous ridership.

Last month, I visited the facility in Queens that mints the city's MetroCards to see this logistical feat for myself. Known as the Fortress Revenue Collection Lab, the building does look startlingly like a fortress—with barbed wire, barred windows, brick walls, and a central tower. Before the trip, the MTA made me agree not to disclose the precise location, and when I arrived, Michael Ellinas, the MTA's senior vice president of revenue control, led me through an entrance monitored by security guards. All of these measures safeguard the millions of MetroCards processed and stored inside the facility, many of them already loaded with money—just 1,000 monthly passes would be worth $132,000.

The Revenue Fortress Collection Lab doesn't make MetroCards from scratch. The plastic yellow cards are first manufactured in North Carolina and the United Kingdom before they are shipped, some 10,000 per box, to Queens, where they are turned into usable MetroCards. Employees load decks of blank cards onto conveyor belts that assign each a serial number and encode its magnetic stripe with value: monthly passes, single-ride cards, and so on, or zero dollars if the MetroCard is intended for someone to purchase from one of the vending machines throughout the MTA system. There are roughly 100 types of MetroCards, and the encoding process is what “puts the secret sauce on the magnetic stripe,” Ellinas told me. The room is kept between 35 and 55 percent humidity: Too muggy and the cards might stick together, too dry and they might develop static.

Some of the MetroCards are then brought to another conveyor belt and wrapped in plastic for individual retail at pharmacies and gas stations. Modified from machines used by Planters factories to wrap peanuts, this contraption envelops 5,000 MetroCards every hour—or more than one every second. Sunillall Harbajan, an MTA employee overseeing the room's operations, told me he has a nickname for the machine: “The Beast.”

At its peak, the fortress was pumping out 180 million MetroCards every year; some 3.2 billion have been prepared in total. By the time I visited the fortress, just about 10 percent of riders were still using MetroCards, and the facility was no longer making them every day. Ellinas had timed the run so that I could witness it. “All good things come to an end, but I'm happy to have been part of it,” Karen Kunak, the MTA's chief officer of processing operations, told me from inside the fortress, surrounded by boxes of MetroCards. She started at the MTA as a college intern 36 years ago—before the MetroCard was even around: “We made it into a thing, its own living, breathing thing.” Employees operating the MetroCard machines are being retrained to work elsewhere across the MTA.



If the city had never adopted the MetroCard—had not installed electronic turnstiles systemwide, developed a complex computer system, gotten people used to paying with a card at all—OMNY would have been a far more gargantuan effort. The switch from paying with one sort of card to another is far less jarring than going from coins to a piece of plastic. “If all of the technological things had not been done to make MetroCard a viable fair-payment system,” Shapiro said, “we wouldn't have OMNY now.” Eventually, the fortress will be reconfigured into an OMNY facility, just as MetroCard vending machines in subway stations have been replaced by OMNY vending machines. (Those who don't want to use a phone or credit card or don't have one can instead purchase an OMNY card.)

In saying goodbye to the MetroCard, New York City is saving time, money, and waste. But the city is also losing a bit of friction, and a common denominator, that is central to its character. New Yorkers and tourists lined up to buy special MetroCards designed in collaboration with local legends and institutions—Biggie Smalls, David Bowie, the library—that are now collectors' items. Before long, even the basic MetroCards might be coveted as well. There will never be a card to celebrate a World Series victory for my beloved New York Mets. The leap into modernity can feel like sliding into a featureless void, in which every transaction of any sort becomes hard to distinguish. Paying to ride the subway is now like paying for a coffee at Starbucks.



Or perhaps it is just me; the MetroCard is all I've ever really known. My friends and I used to protect our student MetroCards, which allowed us to ride for free, like amulets, our keys to the city. As I walked through the Transit Museum with Shapiro, she and an MTA spokesperson accompanying us poked fun at visitors who didn't remember the subway token. I remained quiet, not wanting to out myself.

If you don't have the energy for New Year carousing, pick up these books instead.

There are nights when the dance floor beckons but the bones refuse. When the urge to party arrives, it may be too late to book a babysitter. Perhaps you're already in sweatpants, or closing time is before midnight where you live. Possibly, the prospect of going out has been raised but vetoed by a cohabitant, and you don't want to tango alone. You could also be the kind of person who is more interested in the idea than the reality of loud, sweaty, euphoric congresses found in clubs and music venues.

Fortunately, mood-altering substances are available at home—by which, of course, I mean books. A rich literature on pleasure-oriented nightlife is available for consultation or consolation on your evening in. These five books offer a bit of vicarious sweat and thrill to get you as close to the experience as possible without demanding that you leave your couch. They also invite readers to think more expansively about what exactly draws so many people to mingle in the dark—the club's human stakes, its sensory pleasures, and its illuminating social history. Reading a good book is not the same as riding a social high into the wee hours, but it may equip you with a sense of possibility that you can apply far beyond the coatroom. On the right night, wise women attest, a DJ can save your life.

The Haçienda: How Not to Run a Club, by Peter Hook

The Haçienda in Manchester was a catalyst of the U.K. acid house scene in the late '80s, and a prophecy foretold: “The haçienda must be built,” the Situationist poet Ivan Chtcheglov wrote in 1953. Heeding these cryptic words some three decades later, the audacious (and well-read) impresario Tony Wilson opened the Haçienda together with the circle of post-punk musicians and designers involved with his label, Factory Records. Their attempt to decipher Chtcheglov's mystical phrase lasted 15 years. Hook, the bassist for New Order, served as a kind of player-coach at the Haçienda, helping manage its madcap affairs while his band became the club's cash cow. In this memoir of misbegotten business administration, Hook returns to the storied nights out that changed British culture even as they threatened to bankrupt him—and worse. Beset by gangs and guns, the Haçienda faltered in the '90s despite clever-sounding schemes such as replacing the club's security with the gangsters themselves. This is a scrapbook of utopian folly, yes, but also an insider's look at what was, for a time, the wildest workplace on Earth.

Love Saves the Day: A History of American Dance Music Culture, 1970–1979, by Tim Lawrence

“Disco sucks” was the cry of philistines, if not bigots, Lawrence argues. In this meticulous but inviting cultural history of New York nightlife in the 1970s, he follows disco's rise from underground clubs such as the Loft to the vaunted lights of Studio 54 and the FM airwaves of American suburbs. Versions of this story have been told before, but what distinguishes Love Saves the Day are the more than 300 interviews Lawrence conducted with promoters, partiers, and legendary DJs such as Frankie Knuckles. It's full of wisdom from the elders of American club culture: how to stagger straight and gay crowds on a Friday night, how to find the next great floor-filling single, how to build a DJ set like a furnace that can burn all night. Lawrence also folds in a number of select club “discographies” so you can reproduce Jimmy Stuard's set from 12 West, circa 1976, at home (on nice speakers, perhaps, or an iPhone placed in a cereal bowl).

Bright Lights, Big City, by Jay McInerney

Some might say McInerney's debut novel reads a bit long in the tooth four decades after it first offered the curious public a glimpse of Manhattan-yuppie hedonism. Still, no syllabus on clubbing could be complete without the opening chapter's rendering of the dislocation and dread that may await the partygoer “on that imperceptible pivot where two A.M. changes to six A.M.” For the nameless protagonist—a young fact-checker recently separated from his wife—a punishing club itinerary provides the opposite of community and connection. Something important is being avoided, in fact, on the dance floor and in the many crowded bathroom stalls where lines of “Bolivian Marching Powder” are hungrily apportioned. Beyond its glitz and sleaze, Bright Lights is a sobering lesson on why partying does not always soothe a troubled soul.

Legendary: Inside the House Ballroom Scene, by Gerard H. Gaskin

One of the older photographs in Gaskin's book, from 1998, finds an impeccably suited ballroom performer strutting the boards of what appears to be a community-center gymnasium. Scanning from head to toe, the viewer sees a banded fedora, cigar, jacket and trousers, and, finally, holding it all up (easily missed at first glance): vertiginously high stilettos. It's an image of heroic poise, accentuated by the look of enchantment on the faces of a trio of young men watching from folding chairs. Gaskin has long enjoyed a reputation as the “Trinidadian Andy Warhol” of the ballroom scene in New York City, writes the scholar Frank Roberts, a subject of Gaskin's; for those who performed in that world between the mid-1990s and the early 2010s, when these photos were taken, appearing in a Gaskin portrait was a “rite of passage.” His pictures illustrate the drama and grandeur of these events, but they also convey the importance of the club as a place where dignity—elsewhere denied—may be claimed without apology, and freedom can be realized for the length of the catwalk.

Raving, by McKenzie Wark

Wark's sprawling intelligence is a pleasure to access on any subject. In Raving, Wark blends autofiction and theory to chaperone the reader through the trans rave scene in New York City—or at least the scene as she found it in the years before and after 2020. “First thing I look for at raves: who needs it,” she writes of these parties, “and among those who need it, who can handle their habit?” Vividly told, Raving is no gawking ethnography; it's a sticky and tender little book with serious ethical contemplation at its center. Wark is attentive to the essence of raving as a Black art form and its special significance for queer people, but she approaches it as an activity open to anyone who can handle it—not a way of life so much as a way of creating new lives together.

Soviet New Years, a ritual that survived the country's dissolution, may be in danger of slipping away.

Every year in late December, my childhood home transformed into a vision of American bliss. We'd gather to ornament a tree, drape string lights around the house, and sit down to an elaborate feast. Not long after dawn the next day, while our little sister still slept, my brother and I would impatiently sneak downstairs to see our gifts, which we understood to have been delivered by a kindly old man. It could have been a scene out of A Christmas Story. Except we weren't celebrating Christmas. My family was celebrating the Soviet version of New Year's, a holiday that resembles Christmas in nearly every way, except that it takes place almost a week later and excludes Jesus, God, or any other signifier of religion. We were keeping the national tradition alive in suburban America, years after the country that invented it had dissolved.

Soviet New Year's began as a ritual in a country where all the religious rituals were gone. Long before the 1917 revolution that brought them to power, the leaders of the Soviet Union had decried religion as, in Karl Marx's phrase, the opium of the masses. Their officially atheist government suppressed many kinds of spiritual observance, including Christmas. But by the mid-1930s, Soviet leaders sensed that people needed something to take the edge off in the dead of winter, a carnivalesque custom of the sort that Christmas once provided. So they took the most fun parts of the Christian holiday and plopped them on New Year's.

It became arguably the most important holiday on the country's calendar. Other celebrations tended to come with historical significance, such as the anniversary of the revolution and of the Soviets' victory in World War II. But New Year's, at its core, was about nothing more and nothing less than family: a chance to come together and take stock. That may be a big reason it survived the Union's dissolution. Even after religious institutions were allowed to conduct their services without government interference and their holidays were acknowledged, New Year's remained important for both the people who had left the region and those who still lived there.

But today, Soviet New Year's customs are in danger of slipping away or evolving beyond recognition. Some people still celebrate the holiday the old way, with their families and gifts. Many, though, are establishing new practices that reflect new values and new political circumstances: Wars between former Soviet republics, for instance, and the ways that political leaders have used the momentous nature of the night for their own gains, have changed how people celebrate. A holiday that once felt embedded in the identity and culture of the Soviet people may soon become untethered from its history.

Soviet New Year's began at a time when morale in the country was, in general, low. It was the 1930s, and Ukraine had suffered one of the worst man-made famines in world history. The idea to bring joy to the winter came from a Communist Party leader named Pavel Postyshev, who had been one of the famine's administrators. During an intimate car ride around Moscow with General Secretary Joseph Stalin and a future successor, Nikita Khrushchev, Postyshev proposed reviving the tradition of trees, but tied to a secular holiday. Stalin enthusiastically endorsed the idea, and in 1935, a letter from Postyshev appeared in Pravda, the official newspaper of the party's central committee, arguing that all Soviet children should get to experience the cheer that the bourgeoisie's children once had: “Let's organize a fun New Year's Eve party for the kids.”

Postyshev's idea spread like a wildfire in reverse—trees sprang up across the Soviet Union. The first year, delegates from the local party leadership and schoolteachers gathered parents and instructed them in how to decorate a tree. In some schools, Grandfather Frost, a Santa Claus equivalent, distributed gifts to kids. Soon, families adopted the new practice as their own. But Postyshev never got to see the extent of it. In the '30s, Stalin consolidated power, punishing anyone he suspected of opposing him, including Postyshev—who was executed in 1939. The holiday soon became another tool for Stalin to reinforce his power and centrality in Soviet life. “The cheerful, happy children sang, danced, recited poems, praising in the songs and poems of their beloved Stalin, who gave them a joyful and happy life,” one 1938 newspaper report read.

Read: Understanding Stalin

After Stalin died, in 1953, the holiday's focus turned away from politics. In 1956, Khrushchev delivered a speech criticizing Stalin's “cult of personality” and his purges, signaling to people that they could drop the anxieties about political correctness that had constricted their lives in the Stalin era. The film Carnival Night, released that same year, captured the iconoclastic mood. In it, workers resist the efforts of their company director to organize a New Year's celebration in which everything is acceptable to the people above him and no fun for those below. He plans to deliver a speech, but a worker persuades a magician to make the text disappear; when the director later goes to grab it, he instead finds a string of scarves and other knickknacks. The company director, representing a self-aggrandizing political blowhard, is humiliatingly sidelined, and the workers have a grand time.

By the time my dad started celebrating New Year's in Moscow, in the '60s, most of the elements of the holiday I would come to know as a kid were present: family dinner, gifts, and a decorated tree. It had become an unquestioned fulcrum of Soviet life. If there was a custom of reading poems or singing songs in Khrushchev's honor, it wasn't ubiquitous. Once the country's leaders began giving an annual New Year's address, in 1970, these speeches weren't taken seriously. They were filled with empty platitudes, “void of meaning,” according to The Invention of Russia, by the journalist Arkady Ostrovsky. “These addresses were merely a prompt for popping the corks from bottles.”

That cork-popping continued even as the Soviet Union dissolved and many people left the region. I was born in Moscow in 1996, five years after the fall of the Union, and we moved to upstate New York five years after that. For a long time, the New Year's my family celebrated was stuck in amber, the old tree-and-gifts version. In the former Soviet republics, people still considered the day significant but changed some of the customs. In Armenia, for instance, once religious holidays were again allowed, religious institutions attached themselves to New Year's. From the early 1990s until 2023, the head of the national Church would deliver a midnight address right before the country's president or prime minister. Tigran Simyan, a professor at Yerevan State University who studies the evolution of New Year's in Armenia and the post-Soviet world, told me, “Our happy New Year, for us, is more important than Christmas.”

Politics also returned to the holiday after the Soviet Union's fall. In Russia, the seeming end of single-party rule and a brief moment of political competition revived the status of the New Year's address. It was a rare time when all eyes were focused on the same speaker. The Russian Federation's first president, Boris Yeltsin, strategically resigned on December 31, 1999, giving his handpicked successor, Vladimir Putin, the opportunity to introduce himself during a midnight address as the millennium turned. “The ritual was unmistakably staged,” Ostrovsky writes in The Invention of Russia. “The New Year's address had greater symbolic value than any election.”

In more recent times, young Russians have tended to focus on partying on New Year's Eve. But the many people who maintain the Soviet way of celebrating at home with family might still put on Putin's address. Once again, a popular film captures the mood. The plot of 2010's Yolki is almost the exact opposite of Carnival Night's. Whereas the 1956 film is about a collaborative effort to prevent a speech, Yolki features people across the country working together to help a girl on her quixotic quest to insert a phrase into the president's midnight address, granting the address central importance. Yolki was the first in what became Russia's most financially successful non-animated film franchise, despite the series' declining artistic and entertainment value. Its 12th sequel, set as ever on New Year's Eve, came out this December.

Eventually, politics' creep back into the New Year's holiday began to affect the way my family celebrated in the United States. Although for years, none of us took what Putin said in his address too seriously, my grandparents still put it on out of habit. But as his regime grew more repressive and violent, we let that go. The way I remember it, we stopped after Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine, in 2014, deciding that we didn't need to support Putin's rule on our holiday. But my dad dates our move away from the midnight address to earlier, in 2012. That year, Putin stepped through a loophole in constitutional term limits and returned to the presidency, then brutally suppressed the protests that followed. “I didn't want to hear him anymore,” my dad told me recently.

After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in February 2022, some Ukrainians' New Year's celebrations stopped. “What is there to celebrate when there is a war?” a Ukrainian soldier serving on the front line asked Euronews last New Year's. Meanwhile, I spent last New Year's in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, where clubs had just been closed for weeks in deference to protests over the government pausing its European Union accession bid. Though some young people I talked with were spending the night with their family, many spilled out onto Rustaveli Avenue in the city center for a combination party, protest, and celebration. Without a single state to hold it together, and so many interstate conflicts, the Soviet New Year's tradition is splintering across the Soviet diaspora.

Read: What I learned from the Georgia protests

Perhaps soon the holiday will become unrecognizable from its former iteration, especially as the people who remember its origins adapt to new cultures or pass away. My own family no longer makes a point of gathering on the holiday. In part, that's because my siblings and I have gotten older, scattered, and given in to assimilationist pressure—the fear of missing out on the American custom of partying with our friends on New Year's. But we've also lost the center of gravity that held us to the Soviet tradition. Early in November, my last surviving grandmother suffered a stroke, which paralyzed most of her body, leaving only her eyes and one arm fully mobile. Her grandfather, my great-great-grandfather, became a Bolshevik in 1905 and participated in the three revolutions that led to the establishment of the Soviet Union. His son, her father, wrote and disseminated anti-religious propaganda. Much of my family's adherence to the holiday might very well be because of this history. On Thanksgiving, days before my grandmother died, I told her I was researching our holiday tradition. She squeezed my hand and blinked knowingly.

Watching the tradition slip away feels like losing part of the Soviet and post-Soviet identity that's defined my family for more than a century. I feel a grief that's hard to disentangle from my grief for the people who passed the tradition on to me. But looking back on how my family has acted in decisive moments, I'm also aware of an opportunity. My forefathers helped form the Soviet identity and its rituals, even before there was a country to promote them. Likewise, during and after the Soviet Union's existence, although politicians repeatedly imposed a tone that fit their priorities, my family chose how to spend the day. Ultimately, the common people reshaped the holiday to suit their needs and values. Their examples prove that people can make their own traditions, with whatever ideals they inherit.

8 ways the administration has undermined data collection this year.

One of the biggest changes so far during President Donald Trump's second term has been the steady degradation of basic data collection.

In some cases, moves have been driven by his ideological resistance to the numbers themselves; in others, by a desire to bury uncomfortable trends. And in many places, it's simply the result of deep job and budget cuts that have left agencies unable to track the country they're meant to govern.

• The federal government is a key collector of vital data about the makeup of the country.

• President Donald Trump has long been hostile to data that contradicts his messaging and has presided over major rollbacks to data collection relating to the environment, public health, employment, demographics, and the weather.

• With less robust and accurate data, advances in science will slow down, Americans will have a murkier picture of the economy, and officials could miss important health trends. It will also further erode trust in public institutions.

Gathering basic data about the country is one of the key responsibilities of the federal government. After all, the census is mandated by the Constitution. Getting correct numbers about people, their health, the environment, and the economy is essential for taking an accurate snapshot of the country. These data are also the essential foundation for allocating resources and for sorting what works from what doesn't.

Good numbers are a key accountability tool, and with the absence of data or lower-quality numbers driving decisions, it will be easier for leaders to mislead. Strip away the measurements and tallies, and the consequences pile up fast: Scientific research slows, early warnings about health threats get missed, economic policies become more volatile, and trust in institutions erodes even further.

Of course, good information can often have huge political consequences, which creates a strong temptation to fudge the figures.

But the Trump administration has gone far beyond its predecessors, cutting entire data-collection programs while putting ideologues in charge of fact-finding — all while pressuring agencies to support preordained conclusions. And if the White House has its way, even more rollbacks are in store.

Here are some of the most significant ways in which the White House has diminished our capacity to count and measure the country, and the world, this year:

Over the spring, the Trump administration laid off federal workers responsible for collecting basic information about people's well-being and put in motion the process to overhaul federal surveys to eliminate the questions related to racial minorities and LGBTQ+ people.

We may not think of the federal government as one of the most important pollsters in the world, but it is: The best data we have about everything from teen smoking to increases in obesity rates to how many people have health insurance has come from the government.

Among the estimated 3,000 employees laid off from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were staffers who conduct surveys assessing everything from pregnancy risks to youth smoking to sexual violence. Without that data, the country will be flying blind when new health trends emerge. And as the administration moved to erase certain underrepresented communities from data collection, it will be harder to know whether depression or anxiety are particularly high among LGBTQ+ people or whether certain populations are becoming more susceptible to hypertension or diabetes.

The White House justified the cuts partly in the name of reducing government waste and partly as part of its ongoing crusade to erase any protections for and recognition of transgender or gender non-conforming people.

But that comes at a cost. The raw data that allows us to intervene and stop health problems are evaporating. —Dylan Scott, Vox senior health correspondent 

The National Institutes of Health, which awards upward of $40 billion in grants to scientific researchers every year, is the single biggest funder of independent scientific inquiry in the world.

But this year, the administration slashed its financial support for those research projects by an estimated $2.7 billion while proposing billions more in future cuts — cutting off another vital source of information about what's driving changes in the population's health and how any emerging problems might be fixed.

The list of canceled NIH projects, as documented by ProPublica, is long and varied. Scientists have been working for years to diversify their clinical trial participants, to collect better data that better reflects the wider population. One such project, to improve the recruitment for Alzheimer's disease clinical trials, was being funded by an NIH grant — and it was cut by the Trump administration. Another grant uncovering new data on how contaminated drinking water affects fetal development — cut. New research into how discrimination affects the mental health of young Hispanic people, into the maternal health of Black women, into the driver of the disproportionate death rate from cervical cancer among Black women — cut, cut, and cut.

These are the kinds of nuanced scientific questions that the federal government's surveys can't answer on their own. That's why the US has long provided support to independent researchers who can provide us with answers. This system has relied on the trust of the scientific process.

But not anymore. —Dylan Scott, Vox senior health correspondent 

The administration has been busy overhauling the childhood vaccination schedule — based not so much on new facts but out of the deeply felt convictions of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his handpicked panel of vaccine-skeptical advisers that something must change given the declining public trust in vaccines.

For example, Kennedy's vaccine advisers justified their decision to end the recommendation for a birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine based in part on dubious data that they said suggested the vaccine's immunity waned over time. But even some of the advisory committee's own members, who were overruled on the final decision at a December meeting, questioned the evidence for the change.

“There is not a single case who is otherwise healthy who received the recommended schedule, of anyone who developed disease or is symptomatic or has chronic disease,” Cody Meissner, a Tufts University pediatrician and infectious disease specialist, said during the adviser meeting. “The evidence is very strong that there is lifelong immunity to hepatitis B.”

The new recommendations they approved did suggest, however, that if your child does not receive the birth dose, you should wait until they are at least two months old before giving it to them. At least two members of the committee argued that there was no scientific basis for the two-month recommendation, and no data had been presented to justify it.

“It's unconscionable,” Hibblen said shortly before the final vote. Nevertheless, the change was approved.

As Wilbur Chen, an infectious disease physician at the University of Maryland, put it to me after watching the meeting: It calls to mind a magician with a sleight of hand. They were picking data, whatever it is that supports their argument.” —Dylan Scott, Vox senior health correspondent 

From the outset, the Trump administration has had federal climate change research in its crosshairs. Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's proposed agenda for Trump's second term, said that the White House needs to “eradicate climate change references from absolutely everywhere.”

Trump has done much more than delete the words “climate change” though; his administration has taken climate-related tools, data, and reports offline.

The budget and staff cuts at agencies like NOAA — the main department monitoring weather and climate — have reduced data collection activities like weather balloon launches that are important for forecasting models. There have also been budget and personnel cuts to divisions that do key tasks for research and predictions like flying aircraft into hurricanes. The agency also retired its database of billion-dollar disasters, which had tracked the costliest extreme weather events across the country going back more than 40 years.

More recently, the US has withdrawn its last research ship from Antarctica, a key field site for climate research. And now Trump wants to dissolve the National Center for Atmospheric Research, an internationally renowned institution that White House budget director and Project 2025 author Russ Vought called “one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country.”

Climate research is about much more than understanding climate change; it's a critical field for tracking evolving risks in the environment and threats to the economy. The federal government's climate research work has long led the world, and its efforts will be hard to duplicate elsewhere. —Umair Irfan, climate correspondent 

The Environmental Protection Agency has a mandate to protect human health and the environment, but the Trump administration has been celebrating its efforts to constrain it. One of its strategies is to roll back efforts to monitor pollution and enforce regulations. For example, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act zeroed out fines for car manufacturers that violate vehicle fuel economy and pollution rules.

The EPA made it easier for industries to apply for exemptions to air pollution standards. The agency also scrapped grants for measuring pollutants in communities with industrial facilities.

This year, the EPA initiated the fewest lawsuits against polluters in 25 years. The Department of Justice's environmental enforcement division, which handles EPA's litigation, now has around half the number of lawyers it did at the start of the year. With declining enforcement, the government has fewer resources to monitor violations of pollution regulations, while industries face less pressure to track and reduce their impact on the environment.

The agency is cutting back on its scientific efforts as well. The EPA's Office of Research and Development, which provides the scientific basis for its regulations for things like toxic chemicals and water contaminants, was shuttered over the summer. This includes the Human Studies Facility, one of the largest laboratories in the country, which studied how smog, smoke, and soot affect the human body.

Looking ahead, the White House wants to shut down existing satellites that track carbon dioxide and remove pollution monitoring capabilities from the next generation of weather satellites. And the EPA wants to end greenhouse gas reporting for major industrial polluters, which includes more than 8,000 facilities.

All of this means less visibility and accountability for the things that make our planet less livable. —Umair Irfan, climate correspondent

If the Trump administration had had its way earlier this year, then we might not have known just how bad the job market is right now, with the unemployment rate now at its highest level in four years.

Over the summer, Trump — who has a history of rattling wildly inaccurate unemployment numbers — fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after the agency released revised jobs data that made the economy look bad. Trump's first pick for a replacement, the chief economist of the Heritage Foundation, floated suspending the monthly jobs report altogether before bipartisan condemnation forced the White House to withdraw his nomination. The agency is currently being led by acting commissioner William Watrowski, a longtime civil servant, pending a new nominee from the Trump administration.So, for now, the jobs data appears safe. But with about one-third of leadership roles at the agency vacant, and a president still very much in denial about how the numbers work, it's unclear if they will stay that way for long. —Sara Herschander, Future Perfect fellow

Since 1970, American companies have been required to report their earnings on a quarterly basis — a cache of data offering transparency about public companies that is considered to be among the most reliable in the world.

But Trump would like to change that.

In a September Truth Social post, he advocated for the Securities and Exchange Commission to make firms report on a semiannual rather than quarterly basis. This would, according to Trump, “save money and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.”

He tried to push this through during his first term, although nothing materialized then. But now the SEC is actively looking into this, and if Trump is successful, this would put the US more in line with UK and EU practices. But many companies in the American market are growing significantly faster than their European counterparts, and investors benefit from more — not less — frequent information. —Shayna Korol, Future Perfect fellow 

The centuries-old census is a very big deal. Its results can redraw voting districts and control the fate of hundreds of billions of dollars of federal funds for schools, roads, and hospitals.

That's why it's so important that the Census Bureau, the country's largest statistical agency, gets its counting right. Exactly how the census asks Americans about themselves has evolved dramatically over the decades. During President Joe Biden's term, the administration required the 2030 Census to include, for the first time, new checkboxes for “Middle Eastern or North African” and “Hispanic or Latino” participants under a question about race and ethnicity. This is a crucial change because with more accurate data for those previously undercounted populations, the country will be able to more effectively allocate resources and enforce civil rights legislation.

Unless, of course, the Trump administration gets to it first. A White House official recently said that the administration is considering revoking those changes — which were made to better capture people's racial identities — amid a broader war against anything even remotely tied to diversity, equity, or inclusion.

Trump has also repeatedly attempted to exclude undocumented people from the census, which would be an unprecedented change. If either of those things happen, the country will likely be one step further away from understanding itself — and undercounted American communities will suffer the consequences. —Sara Herschander, Future Perfect fellow 

This, of course, isn't Trump's first time in office, nor is it his first attempt to manipulate, ignore, or erase the numbers. And researchers, nonprofits, and activists have raised the alarm before about losing access to quality government data.

There are now multiple groups working to rescue and archive federal statistics and websites, as well as guides for finding information that has gone missing.

But there's only so much companies, universities, and NGOs can do to match the US government's data-gathering scale and depth. A concerted effort from the White House to diminish or manipulate the numbers behind policies will be hard to counteract, and the effects will linger for years to come.

A major Groq investor said data center development was ""speculative"" and would put ""stress on the system.""

Alex Davis, the CEO of Austin-based investment company Disruptive Tech, sounded an alarm about the US data center market in an end-of-year letter to investors on Monday.

He said he was concerned about landlords who were building data centers based on speculation about future demand.

""I am also deeply concerned about the 'speculative' data center market,"" Davis wrote in his letter. ""The 'build it and they will come' strategy is a trap. If you are a hyperscaler, you will own your own data centers.""

He said he predicted a ""significant financing crisis in 2027-2028 for speculative landlords.""

""We want to back the owner/users, not the speculative landlords, and we are quite concerned for their stress on the system,"" Davis added.

In a similar letter on LinkedIn, Davis also talked about data centers, and said AI has spurred ""too many business models with no realistic margin expansion.""

""This will not end well,"" he added on LinkedIn.

Disruptive Tech has backed Groq, an AI hardware startup. In a press release in September in which it announced a $750 million capital raise, Groq said Disruptive Tech had invested nearly $350 million in the company.

The release also said that Disruptive Tech had invested in Airbnb, Spotify, and Slack, as well as AI-forward companies like Shield AI, Palantir, and Databricks.

This funding round took place shortly before Groq signed a $20 billion licensing deal with Nvidia in November.

Davis's comments about data centers come as tech companies are spending billions of dollars on their construction.

A Business Insider investigation into the US's data centers in June showed that at the end of 2024, companies had filed permits for 1,240 existing or planned data centers. This was nearly four times the number of permits in 2010.

These centers, which store, process, and distribute large amounts of data, use massive amounts of land, water, and electricity. Cities give companies tax incentives to build data centers, spurring the rate of their construction.

Nike shares were up 4% in midday trading Wednesday after insiders picked up the stock near the end of a rough year.

Apple CEO Tim Cook, who serves as a director at the athletic apparel maker, added around 50,000 Nike shares, an approximately 90% increase in his stake, according to financial data provider Verity.

Fellow board member Robert Holmes Swan added roughly 8,700 shares, per Verity. That marked a 24% expansion to the former eBay and Intel executive's position.

Nike CEO Elliott Hill got about 16,400 shares in a transaction valued at $1 million, Verity found. His personal stake grew by more than 7% as a result.

This buying comes as the Oregon-based company wraps up another tough year in the eyes of investors.

Shares of Nike have tumbled around 19% in 2025, on pace for its fourth straight down year. The stock has shed nearly half of its value over the last three years.

Nike has recently contended with weak sales in China and hits from tariffs, the latest in a string of challenges for the retailer. The company has pitched its turnaround story led by Hill, who took the role last year.

Wall Street appears optimistic that the stock can rebound. The average analyst polled by LSEG has a buy rating and price target suggesting shares can rise about 26% over the next year.

In this article

On Dec. 8, Federal prosecutors in Texas unsealed documents that revealed an investigation into a massive smuggling network that stretched across the U.S. and the world. 

Dubbed ""Operation Gatekeeper"" by the feds, the investigation wasn't focused on drug smuggling or stolen goods but rather an alleged secret, underground network of suppliers for Nvidia's graphic processing units, or GPUs. Such chips are the backbone of the AI race, and can be used for military or civilian purposes. 

The government said a hidden smuggling ring was sending chips to China in defiance of American national security export control laws. The smuggling syndicate allegedly involved operatives illegally entering the United States, phony front companies and a secret warehouse shipping operation in New Jersey that was penetrated by at least one undercover agent working on behalf of the U.S. government. 

What that federal investigation found showcases the desperate struggle between the United States and China for access to cutting-edge chips that many believe will control the fate of the global economy. The smuggling ring, they said, attempted to export at least $160 million worth of Nvidia H100 and H200 GPUs to China between October 2024 and May 2025.

The demand for these chips from China is enormous, and the best supply is still in the United States. Although China is establishing its own local AI chip market, the county remains highly dependent on Nvidia's technology. 

""I think more than 60% of the leading AI models in China are currently using Nvidia's hardware,"" said Ray Wang, an analyst at SemiAnalysis. ""Nvidia have [a] systematic advantage ranging from hardware to software. And I think for now, if you combine [those] two factors together, it's still a thing that China is trying to catch up to."" 

As they gathered facts, the government sent an undercover agent into a warehouse in Secaucus, New Jersey. There, the person allegedly witnessed suspects relabeling Nvidia GPUs with branding for a phony company they called ""Sandkayan."" The shipping and export paperwork, the government said, misclassified the goods as ""adapters,"" ""adapter modules"" and ""contactor controllers."" 

Operation Gatekeeper culminated in a dramatic scene at the New Jersey warehouse on May 28 as three trucks hired by the conspirators pulled in to pick up the smuggled chips.

In near real time, a user in a text chain allegedly used by the conspirators messaged that one of the truck drivers transporting the goods to the New Jersey warehouse reported that police officers had appeared at the scene and were asking questions about the cargo's destination.

According to the texts, conspirators told the drivers to ""just say they don't know anything.""

Five minutes later, according to prosecutors, one of the conspirators sent another message to the entire text thread: ""Dissolve this group chat. Delete everyone."" Soon after that, prosecutors said federal agents swooped in and secured the high-tech equipment, preventing the goods on site from being shipped to China. 

The case comes amid a flurry of similar busts regarding unauthorized Nvidia exports in recent months. The think tank Center for a New American Security estimates that between 10,000 and several hundred thousand AI chips were smuggled to China in 2024 alone.

""In today's world, I feel there's so many ways that you can get your hand on Nvidia's chips in all kinds of illegal"" ways, Wang said. ""You can set up your data center globally, you can have shell companies to purchase Nvidia chips. And it's so hard to for Nvidia to track and do due diligence.""

A Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC that the U.S. government's export is rigorous and comprehensive.

""Even sales of older generation products on the secondary market are subject to strict scrutiny and review,"" the Nvidia spokesperson said. ""While millions of controlled GPUs are in service at businesses, homes, and schools, we will continue to work with the government and our customers to ensure that second-hand smuggling does not occur.""

But on the same day that federal prosecutors announced their investigation, President Donald Trump made a social media post that could undermine the whole operation. 

Trump said on Truth Social that the United States would now allow Nvidia's H200 GPUs — the most powerful GPUs seized by authorities in Operation Gatekeeper — to be exported to China. Trump said those exports would be allowed provided that the the U.S. received a 25% cut of the sales. Trump added that Nvidia's most advanced AI chips, the Blackwell and Rubin GPUs, are still not authorized for export. 

Operation Gatekeeper resulted in the arrests of two businessmen and a guilty plea from a Houston man and his company for smuggling the cutting-edge AI technology. But the president's announcement has scrambled the case for U.S. prosectors trying to make the case that smuggling the same chips is a danger to the country's national security. Defense attorneys for the men charged were quick to pounce on the opportunity. 

In a court filing the next day, defense attorneys wrote that ""the President gave the lie to that claim when he announced that the United States will now allow Nvidia's H200 GPUs—the most powerful GPUs seized by authorities in this case—to be exported to China.""

Some experts said they believe smuggling of even Nvidia's highest end AI chips into China will continue. 

""I don't believe the smuggling will just stop,"" Wang said. ""It is unclear to me that the new opening of the H200 chips will be enough for Chinese AI demand. The compute demand we are seeing globally has been accelerating, and I believe that should be the case in China as well.""

China has urged the Netherlands to swiftly correct its ""mistakes"" over chipmaker Nexperia and restore stability in the global semiconductor industry, in the latest development in a dispute over technology transfer.

In September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands. The unusual move was reportedly made after the U.S. raised security concerns.

In response, China moved to block its products from leaving China, which, in turn, raised the alarm among global automakers as they faced shortages of the chipmaker's components.

On Wednesday, a spokesperson for China's Commerce Ministry said that the Netherlands should ""immediately correct its mistakes and clear the obstacles to restoring the stability and security of the global semiconductor supply chain.""

""What is perplexing is that, faced with the anxiety and unease of the global industry, the Netherlands remains indifferent and stubbornly insists on its own way, showing absolutely no responsible attitude towards the security of the global semiconductor supply chain, and taking no substantive action whatsoever,"" the spokesperson said in a statement, according to a Google translation.

A spokesperson for the Dutch government was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Wednesday morning. Dutch Economy Minister Vincent Karremans has repeatedly defended his decision to intervene in the company over recent weeks. 

Nexperia manufactures billions of so-called foundation chips — transistors, diodes and power management components — that are produced in Europe, assembled and tested in China, and then re-exported to customers in Europe and elsewhere. 

The low-tech, inexpensive chips are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, they're used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows.

Auto industry groups have said that disruptions in the supply chain for Nexperia parts have not yet been fundamentally resolved, meaning that component availability remains uncertain.

Japan's Nissan and German auto supplier Bosch are among the firms to have warned about looming shortages. 

Speaking to CNBC last month, a spokesperson for the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW among hundreds of others, warned of elevated risks to supply, ""particularly for the first quarter"" of 2026.

BEIJING — China is set to tighten controls on silver exports from Thursday, expanding restrictions on the once-ordinary metal critical to the U.S. industry and defense supply chains.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticized the move over the weekend on his social media platform X, responding to a post about the upcoming restrictions. 

""This is not good. Silver is needed in many industrial processes,"" Musk wrote.

But the rules are not new. China's Commerce Ministry first announced the new measures in October to strengthen oversight of rare metals, on the same day that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in South Korea. At the time, Beijing agreed to a one-year pause on certain rare earth export controls, while the U.S. rolled back tariffs. 

Earlier this month, China released a list of 44 companies approved to export silver under the new measures in 2026 and 2027. The new rules in 2026 also restrict exports of tungsten and antimony, materials dominated by China's supply chain and widely used in defense and advanced technologies.

While China hasn't explicitly announced a blanket ban on silver exports, the state-run Securities Times on Tuesday cited an unnamed industry insider, who said the new policy formally elevates the metal from an ordinary commodity to a strategic material, placing its export controls on the same regulatory footing as rare earths. 

The EU Chamber of Commerce in China found in a flash survey of members in November that a majority of respondents have been or expect to be affected by those Chinese export controls.

The U.S. added silver to its nationally designated list of critical minerals in November, citing its use in electrical circuits, batteries, solar cells, and anti-bacterial medical instruments. A separate U.S. analysis said China was one of the world's largest producers of silver in 2024, and also home to one of the largest reserves.

China exported more than 4,600 tons of silver in the first 11 months of the year, far more than the roughly 220 tons of imports during that time, according to Wind Information, citing official figures.

The restrictions on silver come just as interest in the metal has increased in recent weeks.

Two Chinese companies contacted Canada-based Kuya Silver on Friday, offering to buy physical silver at about $8 more than the market price at the time, CEO David Stein confirmed to CNBC. He said one company was a manufacturer, and the other was a large trading firm. 

An Indian buyer approached Kuya on Monday with an offer $10 above the market price, he added.

Conservative digital media outlet The Free Press ran a column Tuesday by George Mason University economics professor Tyler Cowen, who said the surge in silver and gold prices reflects investors shifting away from the U.S. dollar.

He called the surge in prices ""a flashing warning for the [U.S.] economy.""

The U.S. dollar index has fallen by nearly 9.5% in 2025, its worst performance since 2017. 

In contrast, silver has more than doubled in price, on track for its best year since 1979 when the metal surged by nearly 470%. Silver prices retreated on Wednesday after touching a record peak above $80 an ounce at the start of the week, with spot prices last trading at around $73.

Gold has gained more than 60% so far this year and is also on pace for its best year since 1979.

Bitcoin, sometimes promoted as an alternative to gold as a store of value, was trading near $88,000 Wednesday morning Beijing time, down by more than 5% for the year.

The Department of Justice has 5.2 million pages of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents left to review and it will take weeks longer to complete the effort, multiple outlets reported.

About 400 lawyers are being enlisted from multiple government divisions to pore over those records, The New York Times first reported late Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The review of the staggering number of files will take until at least Jan. 20 to complete, the Times reported. A government document reported by Reuters on Wednesday morning said that the process of reviewing the remaining records will take place between Jan. 5 and Jan. 23.

The updated timeline is likely to draw more criticism from lawmakers who have already accused the Trump administration of flouting a statutory deadline to release its files on Epstein, the notorious late sex offender.

While it was unclear how many total records would be disclosed, the latest reported figure is much larger than previously indicated, and appears to further undermine a July memo claiming the DOJ conducted ""an exhaustive review"" of its files on Epstein.

Asked for comment, the White House and the DOJ both referred CNBC to an X post from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who said lawyers ""are working around the clock through the holidays, including Christmas and New Years, to review documents in compliance with federal law.""

""It truly is an all-hands-on-deck approach and we're asking as many lawyers as possible to commit their time to review the documents that remain,"" Blanche wrote, adding, ""Required redactions to protect victims take time but they will not stop these materials from being released.""

President Donald Trump signed a bipartisan bill in mid-November requiring the government to publicly release unclassified records from its investigations into Epstein by Dec. 19.

The DOJ released thousands of records on that date, but Blanche indicated that more would be doled out over the ""next couple weeks.""

""I expect several hundred thousand more,"" Blanche said at the time.

On Christmas Eve, the DOJ revealed that more than a million additional documents potentially related to Epstein had been ""uncovered"" and that it would take ""a few more weeks"" to release them.

The document cited by Reuters on Wednesday said that the 400 additional lawyers are being provided by the DOJ's Criminal Division and National Security Division, as well as the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan.

The FBI declined to comment. The other divisions and the Manhattan office did not immediately respond to CNBC's outreach.

Lawyers involved will be expected to review up to 1,000 documents per day over three to five hours, and volunteers are being offered incentives including time off awards and telework options, the document reportedly said.

After releasing its initial batch of files, the DOJ quickly drew accusations of failing to produce the required files and of redacting more information than was legally mandated.

The department said it ""is not redacting the names of any politicians"" and maintains that it is fully complying with federal law. Democrats have nevertheless signaled they will take legal action against the administration over the alleged violations.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused the administration of carrying out a ""cover up to protect Donald Trump,"" a former friend of Epstein's who has frequently griped about the public focus on the files.

One investor has leaned into Core Scientific's infrastructure pivot, seemingly betting the market is missing what comes next.

San Francisco-based Valiant Capital Management increased its position in Core Scientific (CORZ 0.20%) by 1.68 million shares in the third quarter, adding an estimated $34.34 million in overall position value, according to a November 14 SEC filing.

According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated November 14, Valiant Capital Management reported buying 1.68 million additional shares of Core Scientific (CORZ 0.20%) during the third quarter. The post-transaction position totaled 6.48 million shares with a market value of $116.31 million as of September 30. The fund also reported holding call options tied to about 4.21 million shares.

Top holdings after the filing:  

As of Wednesday, CORZ shares were priced at $14.65, up about 4% over the past year and underperforming the S&P 500, which is up about 17% in the same period.

Core Scientific, Inc. is a leading provider of blockchain infrastructure and digital asset mining services in North America, operating large-scale data centers and offering both self-mining and hosting solutions.

It's important to note that this stake was built while Core Scientific was rallying sharply, not after the wheels came off. Shares were up roughly 24% in the first three quarters of the year, reflecting growing optimism around infrastructure monetization and the proposed CoreWeave merger. The subsequent 32% slide came later, after that deal was scrapped in late October.That sequencing reframes the move. This was not a reflexive dip buy. It was an endorsement of the strategy before the headline risk reentered the picture.At the time, Core Scientific was starting to be valued less like a pure-play Bitcoin miner and more like a power and compute platform. Third-quarter results reinforced that shift, highlighting growing colocation revenue and the optionality embedded in its large-scale, power-rich data center footprint. The merger's collapse removed a near-term catalyst but did not erase the underlying thesis.Meanwhile, within the portfolio, this remains the most concentrated position, outranking broad market ETFs and industrial holdings alike. That suggests a tolerance for volatility in exchange for a potentially nonlinear payoff.

Oops, something went wrong

Key Takeaways

Tom Lee attributed Ethereum's late-December price weakness to automated trading activity and year-end tax losses.

Despite the downturn, BitMine continued accumulating Ethereum, adding 44,463 ETH.

Analysts warn Ethereum remains vulnerable to further downside.

BitMine's Tom Lee said “bots” and year-end tax-related selling were driving Ethereum's recent price weakness, even as the firm added another 44,463 ETH tokens.

In a post on X, Lee said market conditions in the final days of December are typically distorted as institutional investors step away for the holidays, as Ethereum continues to trade below $3,000.

Despite the price slump, BitMine said it continued to accumulate Ethereum into the end of the year.

The company said in a statement that it added 44,463 ETH over the past week, taking advantage of year-end selling pressure.

As of Dec. 28, BitMine held about 4.11 million ETH valued at $2,948 per token, representing roughly 3.4% of Ethereum's circulating supply.

“Market activity tends to slow as we enter the final holiday weeks of a calendar year,” Lee said.

Adding: “Year-end tax-loss related selling is pushing down crypto and crypto equity prices, and this effect tends to be the greatest from Dec. 26 to Dec. 30, so we are navigating markets with this in mind.”

BitMine said its total crypto holdings, cash, and strategic investments now amount to $13.2 billion, making it the largest Ethereum treasury in the world.

In a post promoting the latest buy, Lee said the late-December pullback was consistent with seasonal trading patterns.

“Typically, in these last holiday trading days, many institutional investors have stepped away from markets,” Lee said.

That dynamic, he said, leaves markets more heavily influenced by automated trading systems and year-end tax-loss selling.

“As a result, trading is dominated by bots and other automated strategies, along with tax-loss related selling.

Ethereum was trading below $2,971 on Wednesday, up almost 5% in the last 30 days.

However, analysts say near-term risks remain skewed to the downside.

Victor Olanrewaju, an analyst at CCN, said Ethereum remains vulnerable to declines, pointing to rising exchange reserves as a key concern.

“Despite the uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin's recent on-chain movements, Ethereum's price still appears exposed to additional downside risk,” Olanrewaju said.

Data from CryptoQuant shows Ethereum's exchange reserves have climbed to their highest level in more than a month.

If the trend continues, Olanrewaju said, Ether could slide toward the $2,500 level.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum sees 745K ETH locked for staking","https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-sees-745k-eth-locked-for-staking-will-eth-react-this-time/","Wed, 31 Dec 2025 02:03:45 GMT","

Confidence in the network keeps growing… even if price isn't all that attractive right now.

Ethereum has been building itself back up.

After a long period of weak price movements and wobbly ETF flows, things are starting to change. Staking inflows have turned positive for the first time in six months, and institutions are making moves.

Exchange Balances have fallen at the fastest pace this cycle, while Staking Inflows turned positive for the first time in six months. Over 745,000 ETH are now queued for staking, versus roughly 360,000 ETH waiting to exit.

There is huge confidence in the long-term potential.

The 90-day Spot Taker CVD showed sell pressure falling to neutral territory, so aggressive selling is losing pace.

While ETF flows remained negative, on-chain numbers look different. Smart contract deployments just hit record highs, and RWA value on Ethereum has climbed to nearly $19B.

There's real usage backing it all.

Institutional flows are confirming the stability. Despite weak price action, ETHA (BlackRock's Spot Ethereum ETF) have been picked up in large numbers.

Source: X

These holders now lean heavily long, with 486 long positions versus just 1 short. This is despite the cautious outlook. There's been steady growth in ETHA ownership through late 2025.

Source: X

Institutions are increasing exposure while sentiment is still fragile. Case in point: Trend Research bought 46,000 ETH in the past day. Their total ETH exposure is now at 626k ETH.

Ethereum is perhaps stuck in a compression.

At press time, the price traded sideways just below the mid-Bollinger Band, with no decisive breakout in sight. The RSI showed neutral momentum at the time of writing, with MACD indicating a loss of direction.

Source: TradingView

Importantly, downside attempts have been absorbed above the lower Bollinger Band, keeping the $2,800-$2,900 zone intact as short-term support.

Big moves will likely follow broader market cues, rather than lead them.

Crypto-linked equities were largely muted in after-hours trading Tuesday, with one clear exception. Shares of iPower Inc. (IPW) climbed after the company disclosed its first purchases of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), marking the launch of a new digital asset treasury strategy announced in June.

The clean energy and tech infrastructure company said it acquired 15.1 Bitcoin at an average price of $87,686.33 and 301.1 Ethereum at an average price of $2,934.67. The total investment comes to around $2.21 million, with  Bitcoin accounting for roughly $1.33 million and Ethereum representing about $884,000 of the total.

IPW's stock rose more than 5% in after-hours trade, offsetting a 5.49% decline during the regular session. On Stocktwits, retail sentiment around the company remained in ‘bearish' territory over the past day amid ‘extremely low' levels of chatter.

The acquisition marks iPower's formal entry into holding cryptocurrencies as part of its balance sheet. Corporate adoption of digital asset treasury strategies has expanded beyond Bitcoin-only approaches in recent quarters, with a growing number of firms opting to hold Ethereum alongside BTC.

The company did not disclose whether additional purchases are planned or how the assets will be managed long term.

According to data on Arkham Intelligence, spotted by Lookonchain, Tom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) bought another 32,938 Ethereum and staked another 118,944 ETH on Tuesday night.

BMNR's stock rose 0.29% in after-hours trade after dropping nearly 2.9% in regular trading. Retail sentiment on Stocktwits around the company remained in ‘bearish' territory even as chatter rose to ‘normal' from ‘low' levels.

This comes on the heels of BMNR announcing its total Ethereum (ETH) holdings had reached 4.11 million tokens after adding over 44,000 ETH over the past week. BMNR also disclosed it has staked 408,627 ETH, locking up tokens to validate transactions and earn rewards. The firm expects to launch its Made in America Validator Network staking platform in early 2026 and urged shareholders to vote ahead of its January 15 annual meeting in Las Vegas.

The overall cryptocurrency market rose around 1.2% in the last 24 hours, still holding above the $3 trillion mark. Liquidations across the market were relatively contained at $142 million, according to CoinGlass data. Bitcoin's price rose 2.1% in the last 24 hours to around $88,700, with retail sentiment on Stocktwits trending in ‘bearish' territory over the past day amid ‘normal' levels of chatter.

On the equities side, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) fell 0.17% after-hours after closing the day with a 0.12% loss, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) edged 0.08% lower after closing 0.21% in the red, and the Nasdaq-100 tracking Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) was slipped 0.24% after a loss of 0.23% in regular trading. On Stocktwits, retail sentiment around QQQ remained in ‘bullish' territory, but chatter rose to ‘normal' from ‘low' levels over the past day.

Bitwise filed for 11 crypto Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, with the aim to offer exposure to Aave (AAVE), Zcash (ZEC), Ethena (ENA), and other altcoins. Despite the shift in institutional interest from Bitcoin (BTC) to altcoins, Bitcoin's dominance remains around 60%, suggesting the chances of an altcoin season are low.

Bitwise, a crypto asset management fund, filed for 11 new crypto ETFs with the US SEC on Tuesday, expanding its offering to include niche altcoins such as Aave, Uniswap, Zcash, Canton, Ethena, Hyperliquid, Near Protocol, Starknet, Sui, Bittensor, and Tron. While the ticker code and fees are yet to be determined, the effective date is expected to be March 16, 2026, if approved by the SEC.

Bitwise will invest 60% of the funds directly in the targeted altcoins, and the remaining funds will be directed to other crypto-focused Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) and, possibly, to the derivatives market.

Bitcoin dominance, the share of BTC market capitalization of the total crypto market, is at 59.70% at press time on Wednesday. This indicates that Bitcoin dominates the entire crypto market, outpacing the altcoins.

Ethereum's struggle to gain strength against Bitcoin remains a headwind to an altcoin season. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at 0.03358 BTC, stabilizing above 0.03000 BTC after a decline from mid-August to early November. At the same time, CoinMarketCap's Altcoin Season Index at 19 indicates a Bitcoin Season, aligning with the BTC-dominant market sentiment. 

The total cryptocurrency market capitalization excluding Bitcoin (TOTAL2), at $1.19 trillion, approaches the apex of a descending triangle pattern on the daily chart — the November 21 low at $1.13 trillion as the base, with a resistance trendline connecting the highs of November 10 and December 9.

Typically, such patterns extend the decline, but the recovery in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 45 on the same chart reflects an underlying increase in buying pressure. 

If TOTAL2 exceeds the overhead trendline near $1.22 trillion, it could reverse the bearish trend and target the R1 Pivot Point at $1.98 trillion.

In short, Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto market, and the status quo could persist into early 2026.

Year 2025 was volatile, as crypto often is.  Among positive catalysts were favourable regulatory changes in the U.S., rise of Digital Asset Treasuries (DAT), adoption of AI and tokenization of Real-World-Assets (RWA).

Russia's largest bank Sberbank launched the country's first Bitcoin-backed corporate loan to miner Intelion Data. The pilot deal uses cryptocurrency as collateral through Sberbank's proprietary Rutoken custody solution.

Bitcoin (BTC) trades above $88,000 at press time on Tuesday, following a rejection at $90,000 the previous day. Institutional support remains mixed amid steady outflow from US spot BTC Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Strategy Inc.'s acquisition of 1,229 BTC last week.

Key Takeaways

Lighter does not run on general-purpose L2s; instead, it utilizes a custom ZK Rollup architecture optimized specifically for high frequency trading (HFT).

Replaces the capital inefficient AMM model with a central limit order book, delivering a Binance like experience in a decentralized environment. 

Uses ZK SNARKs to cryptographically prove that every order matches the Price Time Priority rule, completely eliminating exchange manipulation.

For over a decade, the crypto market has been dominated by a paradox: We trade decentralized assets on centralized platforms (CEXs) that operate as “Black Boxes.” Users deposit funds, place orders, and blindly trust that the exchange will match them fairly. However, history from Mt. Gox to FTX has repeatedly proven that “Don't trust, Verify” is the only true standard.

First generation DEXs (like Uniswap) solved the custody problem but failed on performance and slippage. Enter Lighter (Lighter.xyz). Backed by industry giants like a16z and Paradigm, Lighter promises to end the “Black Box” era by bringing Nasdaq level speed to Ethereum grade security. 

Lighter is a Decentralized Perpetual Futures Exchange (PerpDEX) that utilizes a Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) model. Unlike typical DEXs running on general purpose Layer 2s (such as Arbitrum or Optimism) where financial transactions must compete for bandwidth with gaming or NFTs, Lighter is built on a distinct ZK Architecture. It functions as a Layer 2 “tailor made” for finance, capable of processing tens of thousands of transactions per second with near zero costs. 

To grasp the essence of Lighter, one must look at the limitations of current infrastructure. General purpose Layer 2s like Arbitrum or Optimism operate like public highways where financial transactions must share bandwidth with everything from NFT minting to gaming. This creates latency and costs that are prohibitive for Market Makers who need to update quotes thousands of times per second.

However, to fully grasp Lighter's significance, we must view it not merely as an exchange, but as an infrastructure evolution: an App specific Rollup. 

Lighter opts for a Custom ZK Architecture, stripping away the overhead of a general purpose blockchain to dedicate 100% of its computational resources solely to order matching. Technically, it operates as a high performance Compute Engine atop Ethereum. It delivers the deep liquidity AMMs lack, backed by the mathematical certainty of ZK proofs. 

What is Lighter? – Source: Lighter

In essence, Lighter bridges Web2 performance (off chain matching) with Web3 guarantees (on chain settlement), transforming transparency from an optional feature into an enforced technical primitive.

To realize the vision of a high performance yet decentralized order book, the Lighter team engineered Lighter Core based on four immutable principles:

In computer science, building a Verifiable Compute Engine always involves trade offs. Lighter Core rejected two common approaches in favor of the most challenging, yet optimal, path:

Lighter's Choice: Succinct Proofs (ZK Proofs). Although historically costly and complex to develop, ZK allows for both vertical and horizontal scaling without compromising security. It decouples “execution” (fast, off chain) from “verification” (secure, on-chain).

Lighter Core is not just a smart contract; it is an orchestrated assembly of components:

This feature defines true ownership. In a worst case scenario, such as the Sequencer being compromised or attempting to censor your withdrawal, Lighter Core triggers the Escape Hatch mode.

The protocol allows users to submit a Priority Request directly on Ethereum. If the Sequencer fails to process this request within a predefined timeframe, the Smart Contract freezes the entire exchange. In this state, users can leverage the compressed Data Blobs previously published on Ethereum to reconstruct their account state and withdraw full asset value directly on chain, independent of the Lighter team or off chain coordination.

If Lighter Core is the “engine,” then the Order Book Tree is its most sophisticated “transmission.” To understand how Lighter operates smoothly while other ZK DEXs struggle with latency, we must dissect its data structure.

In traditional computer science, to match orders based on “Price Time Priority,” Matching Engines (like Binance's) typically use Linked Lists. But in the Zero Knowledge world, Linked Lists are a disaster. Why?

To prove an order is in the correct position within a linked list, the ZK Circuit must compute the Hash of the entire list. The complexity is linear: O(N).

The Consequence, the deeper the order book, the higher the computational cost and the slower the speed. This is why early DEXs defaulted to AMMs instead of Order Books.

The Lighter team didn't force a square peg into a round hole. They engineered the Order Book Tree, a hybrid structure combining a Merkle Tree and a Prefix Tree.

The genius lies in how they Encode Priority. Instead of using Timestamps which are susceptible to manipulation or desynchronization in decentralized networks, Lighter uses a Nonce. The Index of an order in the tree is hard coded.

An order with a better price and a lower Nonce (arrived earlier) automatically falls into the priority position within the tree without requiring any expensive sorting algorithms.

Thanks to this structure, every operation, insert, Cancel, or Match reduces complexity to O(Log N). Whether the order book has 10 orders or 10 million, the processing speed and ZK proof generation cost remain virtually constant. This is the key to unlocking High Frequency Trading (HFT) on chain.

Another fascinating detail found is the use of “Smart Internal Nodes.Standard Merkle Trees only store Hashes.  And lighter Trees store Aggregate Data like AskSizeSum or BidQuoteSum directly within the branch nodes.

By operating in a Stateless mode, the Prover bypasses the need to store massive amounts of order data, relying instead on ‘Path Witnesses' to verify execution against the State Root.

This is where the architecture shines. It transforms market integrity from a CEO's promise into a hard mathematical constraint. If a Sequencer tries to jump the queue or extract MEV, the underlying hash calculation fails, causing Ethereum to reject the proof immediately. In essence, the code enforces what regulators cannot.

If the Order Book Tree serves as the structural skeleton, the ZK Engine is the operational core enabling the system to achieve optimal cost efficiency. An analysis of Lighter's architecture reveals a divergent approach from the industry trend: instead of utilizing general purpose zkEVMs, the project has opted to build an App specific ZK infrastructure.

A significant challenge for current Layer 2 scaling solutions is the “technical debt” incurred from attempting to simulate the entire Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This often necessitates redundant opcodes that are unnecessary for specific financial tasks.

Lighter addresses this by engineering Custom Arithmetic Circuits from scratch.

Lighter's ability to offer zero trading fees for Retail Users does not stem from short-term subsidy strategies, but from the structural advantage of Multi Layer Aggregation.

The verification process operates as a data compression assembly line:

The economic consequence is that the Marginal Cost to verify an additional transaction on the network approaches zero. This creates a sustainable competitive advantage regarding operational costs.

Regarding security, Lighter's architecture establishes a rigid link between Off chain and On-chain data via Public Inputs (Commitments).

When the Prover generates a proof, the system mandates a commitment to a public input containing: the new State Root Hash, a summary of the Data Blob.

By enforcing a strict check between the Proof and the Commitment, the system cryptographically binds the public Blob data to the execution logic. This guarantees that the information users rely on for the Escape Hatch is identical to the verified input, effectively neutralizing any risk of Data Availability attacks.

Complex infrastructure projects like Lighter require substantial R&D resources. Therefore, analyzing the partner roster and cash flow model is a critical metric for assessing the project's long term viability.

Lighter's capital structure features participation from Tier 1 venture capital firms, including a16z (Andreessen Horowitz), Paradigm, Founders Fund, alongside angel investors from Robinhood and Coinbase.

Following the TGE event, LIT is now listed and liquid on major centralized exchanges. Below is the standard procedure to acquire LIT:

LIT is currently tradable on platforms including: BingX, MEXC, Gate.io, and BitMart. Note: Check the 24h Volume on CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap to select the exchange with the deepest liquidity to minimize slippage.

Once the purchase is complete, you have two options:

What is Lighter? 

Lighter is a decentralized perpetual futures exchange (DEX) operating on a specialized App specific ZK Rollup. Unlike traditional DEXs, Lighter offers the low latency matching and seamless experience of a CEX, while guaranteeing absolute transparency via mathematical proofs (ZK proofs) and offering strictly zero trading fees for retail users.

Is Lighter truly safer than CEXs like Binance or Bybit?  

Structurally, yes. On a CEX, you surrender asset control to the exchange (Custodial). On Lighter, you maintain Self custody. Assets reside in Ethereum Smart Contracts, not in Lighter's corporate wallets. Notably, the Escape Hatch mechanism allows you to withdraw funds even if the Lighter website goes down or the team disappears, as long as Ethereum remains operational.

Are there hidden terms behind the “Zero Fees” for retail? 

According to current documentation, there are no hidden trading fees. However, users must still pay a nominal Gas fee (typically a few cents) to Deposit or Withdraw assets between Layer 1 and Layer 2. Trading fees are cross subsidized by revenue generated from institutional clients (HFTs).

Does Lighter have a Token? What about Airdrop potential? 

Yes, Lighter officially launched its governance token, LIT (Lighter Infrastructure Token), in late December 2025. 25% of the total supply was distributed directly to the wallets of early participants (specifically those in Season 1 and Season 2 of the Points program). Notably, there is no “Claim” process required; tokens were airdropped directly to eligible addresses to mitigate phishing risks. A total of 50% of the supply is reserved for the community and ecosystem. Following the initial airdrop, the remaining allocation will fund future liquidity incentives and subsequent trading “Seasons.”

What do I need to start trading on Lighter? 

You need a standard Web3 wallet (such as MetaMask, Rabby, or WalletConnect) and collateral (typically USDC) on the Ethereum Mainnet. Since Lighter is a Layer 2, you will need to perform a “Deposit” action to bridge USDC into Lighter's smart contract before placing orders.

Dapper Labs' Layer 1 blockchain Flow is up and running again after a $3.9 million exploit on Dec. 27 that caused more than 24 hours of downtime, and a drastic drop in token price.

The FLOW token dropped 40% from a $280 million market capitalization to $170 million early Saturday morning. Despite resuming activity earlier today, FLOW holders are yet to experience any relief bounce.

According to the Flow Foundation, the incident occurred on Dec. 27, when an attacker exploited Flow's execution layer and transferred almost $4 million in crypto assets off the network before validators could come to a consensus to halt it. 

The foundation said that user balances were not affected, and the $3.9 million loss is “manageable.” Initially, Flow intended for the network to be back online within 4 to 6 hours of its incident report, however the process required a time extension for validator coordination, and Flow is back up and “Phase 1 operational” as of 10 a.m. EST today.

Leading bridge solutions including Stargate Finance and deBridge confirmed that both interoperability protocols will resume activity on Flow once the network is fully restored.

Just after noon EST today, the blockchain's development company Dapper Labs released a statement on X regarding the incident, confirming that the network is operational and stating, “What happened over the past 48 hours was a stress test of the ecosystem that Dapper helped build. The response required coordination across dozens of independent parties—validators, bridges, exchanges, protocol teams.”

On the back of the network's resumption, Dapper Labs touted the blockchain's validators' ability to reach a fully decentralized consensus to respond swiftly to the exploit. 

Initially, Flow planned to roll back the chain, which would revert the network to its pre-exploit state, meaning the $3.9 million in funds would be fully intact. However, after what included public responses from ecosystem participants, Flow ended up pivoting to an alternative solution which has been praised by affected third parties, such as deBridge.

DeBridge co-founder Alex Smirnov took to X to share his thoughts on the initial rollback plan yesterday where he said, “The rushed decision to roll back the chain will likely cause financial damage far exceeding the impact of the original exploit.”

Today Smirnov followed up on Flow's pivot stating, “Appreciate the turnaround from the Flow team and the collaborative effort to bring the ecosystem back to normal.”

Dapper Labs also said that Flow will publish more details in a post-mortem in the near future. The Defiant reached out to Flow for comments on the incident, but has not received a response as of publication time.

Flow touts itself as “the Home of Consumer DeFi,” and is the native blockchain of Dapper Lab's ecosystem, known for its work on mainstream-focused NFT products such as NBA Top Shot, CryptoKitties, and the Disney Pinnacle NFTs. 

Despite Dapper Lab's highly successful role in the early days of NFTs, the company didn't launch Flow until July 2022, after NFTs had begun to slow down, and the ecosystem was dominated by Ethereum and Solana. 

As a result, Flow has had a slow start, and didn't cross the $10 million total value locked (TVL) mark until 2023. The blockchain has had a strong 2025, however, seeing its TVL grow by as much as 210% from $38 million in January to a $118 million all-time high in November.

China has taken a decisive step in reshaping its central bank digital currency strategy, transforming the digital yuan from a non-yielding form of cash into an interest-bearing financial instrument. The move immediately sparked a surge of investor interest, with roughly $188 million flowing into digital yuan–linked stocks following the announcement.

On Monday, December 29, the People's Bank of China announced that starting January 1, 2026, commercial banks will begin paying interest on digital yuan (e-CNY) wallet balances. Under the new framework, e-CNY holdings will be treated more like bank deposits rather than simple digital cash in circulation.

Previously, the digital yuan functioned as a cash equivalent, generating no yield and limiting its appeal as a store of value. The policy shift represents a structural upgrade to the CBDC's role within China's financial system.

Markets reacted swiftly. According to trading data, Chinese investors poured approximately $188 million into digital yuan–related A-share stocks following the announcement.

One of the biggest beneficiaries was Lakala Payment, a major third-party payments provider involved in digital yuan infrastructure. Lakala reportedly captured around 30% of the total inflows, with its shares jumping more than 12% as investors positioned for increased CBDC adoption.

Other fintech and payment companies tied to digital yuan settlement, wallet services, and banking upgrades also saw heightened trading activity.

The introduction of interest fundamentally changes the incentives around holding e-CNY. Until now, users had little reason to keep balances in digital yuan wallets compared to platforms like Alipay or WeChat Pay, which offer access to yield-generating money market products.

By allowing interest on e-CNY balances, the PBOC is closing that gap, encouraging users to hold digital yuan rather than immediately converting or spending it. This also signals a deeper shift in classification: the digital yuan is moving away from pure M0-style cash toward a form of deposit-like money, potentially usable within bank reserve and lending frameworks.

Beyond domestic adoption, the change positions China's CBDC as one of the most economically integrated digital currencies issued by a major central bank. Interest-bearing functionality brings the digital yuan closer to the core of monetary policy transmission, something most CBDCs globally have so far avoided.

With the new rules taking effect on January 1, 2026, investors are already treating this as the beginning of a “Digital RMB 2.0” phase, one where infrastructure providers, not just consumers, stand to benefit the most.

As global central banks continue experimenting with digital currencies, China's move underscores a key lesson: adoption follows incentives, and yield may be the strongest one yet.

Two space telescopes really are better than one. This month NASA released a new image that combines observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Chandra X-ray Observatory of two spiral galaxies on a cosmic collision course.

The two space telescopes have very different trajectories—giving them each a heady vantage point on the universe. JWST orbits the sun and observes the cosmos in infrared light, whereas Chandra, which orbits Earth, is sensitive to the x-ray spectrum. The newly released image combines their observations into one, revealing the galaxies IC 2163 (the left-hand galaxy) and NGC 2207 (on the right) in a new light.

The pair are located some 120 million light-years from Earth. The larger galaxy, NGC 2207, is slowly stretching and stripping the smaller of the pair. Together they are joined in a slow, gravitational dance that will, billions of years from now, end in their merger into a single galaxy. In the image, mid-infrared data from JWST shows dust and other cooler matter in white, gray and red, while x-ray data from Chandra shows high-energy areas, including regions of intense star formation, in blue.

Did cameras finally spot the ocean's most elusive monster?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Humans spend nearly their entire lives on land, but the Earth we call home is really a water world. With 71 percent of the Earth's surface covered by water, this expansive ecosystem has been difficult to study, and many animals of the deep ocean remain a complete mystery. One of the most spellbinding of these animals is the colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni). When full-grown, this creature is about as long as a bus and weighs nearly 1,100 pounds. 

Believed to live in the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica, this immense cephalopod—the largest invertebrate species on the planet— has never been observed in its natural habitat. Scientists only get a good look at these animals when trawlers accidentally catch them in their nets. But a new kind of oceanographic study seems to have struck gold last year when international research team and non-profit called Kolossal appeared to have stumbled across a juvenile colossal squid during one of its four trips to Antarctica from December 2022 to March 2023.

The team used a novel approach for imaging the ocean—outfitting a polar tourism vessel called the Ocean Endeavor with a deep-sea camera. Thankfully, the research team released the footage, which the website IFLScience promptly posted to YouTube. 

“Antarctica is experiencing rapid and complex change, and it is critical to have a better understanding of these changes for the region's ocean ecosystems,” the Kolossal team wrote in a paper detailing the method in 2024. “The costs and logistical challenges to operate scientific research vessels prohibits the scaling of crucial science and discovery in the region. Yet, the tourism industry in Antarctica is growing rapidly, and collaboration between tourism companies and researchers provides important access to the region.”

While leveraging tourism for marine exploration is a logistical win-win, finding verified footage of a colossal squid is as hard as ever. Even the short clip of the above specimen isn't confirmed, as the video could be capturing an adult glass squid Galiteuthis glacialis or perhaps even a species completely unknown to science. The video is being peer-reviewed by experts, but it's unlikely that scientists will ever know for sure. But because footage of any squid species in the Southern Ocean is rare, the footage is a huge victory for marine biologists studying these famously elusive animals regardless of its contents. 

“The two known Cranchiidae taxa seen in the Antarctic are Galiteuthis glacialis and Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni,” Aaron Evans, who is peer reviewing the footage, told IFLScience. “The squid seen here could belong to different life stages of either of those taxa—and is an exciting example of wild cranchiid behavior, as I cannot think of existing video footage of either of those squid in their natural environment.”

Although the team's stated goal is to capture footage of an adult colossal squid in its natural environment, according to IFLScience, the camera filmed nearly 80 species. Among them were giant volcano sponges, Antarctic sunflower stars, and many other marine invertebrates. 

For now, the world's largest invertebrate species frustratingly remains one of the animal kingdom's largest mysteries. But as marine biologists team up with tourism vessels to explore the oceans, some of the our water planet's biggest questions could slowly be answered.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Swearing may unlock hidden strength, study finds","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251222080123.htm","Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:58:42 GMT","

Blurting out a swear word during a frustrating moment often brings a sense of relief. Research now suggests it may also offer a physical advantage. According to findings published by the American Psychological Association, swearing can help people perform better on tasks that demand strength and endurance by reducing mental restraint and encouraging greater effort.

""In many situations, people hold themselves back -- consciously or unconsciously -- from using their full strength,"" said study author Richard Stephens, PhD, of Keele University in the U.K. ""Swearing is an easily available way to help yourself feel focused, confident and less distracted, and 'go for it' a little more.""

The study was published in the journal American Psychologist.

Earlier Evidence Linking Swearing and Endurance

Past research by Stephens and other scientists has consistently shown that swearing is linked to improved performance in physically demanding situations. These effects have been observed in challenges such as keeping a hand submerged in ice water for longer periods and sustaining body weight during a chair push-up exercise.

""That is now a well replicated, reliable finding,"" Stephens said. ""But the question is -- how is swearing helping us? What's the psychological mechanism?""

How Swearing May Reduce Mental Restraint

Stephens and his research team suspected that swearing works by shifting people into a more disinhibited mental state. In this state, individuals may feel less restricted by social norms and internal hesitation, allowing them to apply more effort.

""By swearing, we throw off social constraint and allow ourselves to push harder in different situations,"" he said.

Testing the Effect in Controlled Experiments

To examine this idea, the researchers carried out two experiments involving a total of 192 participants. In both experiments, participants completed a chair pushup task while repeating either a swear word of their choosing or a neutral word every two seconds. After finishing the task, they answered questions about how they felt during the exercise.

The surveys assessed several mental factors associated with disinhibition. These included levels of positive emotion, how amusing participants found the task, how distracted they felt, and how confident they felt. The researchers also measured psychological ""flow,"" which describes a state of deep focus and immersion in an activity.

Why Swearing May Enhance Performance

The results reinforced earlier findings. Participants who swore during the chair pushup task were able to hold their body weight for significantly longer than those who repeated a neutral word. When the researchers combined data from the two experiments with results from an earlier study, they found that the performance advantage was linked to higher levels of reported psychological flow, distraction, and self-confidence, which are key elements of a disinhibited state.

""These findings help explain why swearing is so commonplace,"" said Stephens. ""Swearing is literally a calorie neutral, drug free, low cost, readily available tool at our disposal for when we need a boost in performance.""

Exploring New Situations Beyond Exercise

The research team plans to investigate whether the benefits of swearing extend beyond physical challenges. According to study co-author Nicholas Washmuth, DPT, of the University of Alabama in Huntsville, future studies will focus on situations where hesitation often limits performance.

""Our labs are now studying how swearing influences public speaking and romantic approach behaviors, two situations where people tend to hesitate or second-guess themselves,"" he said.

While the link between poor sleep and dementia has long been known, it was unclear whether poor sleep habits could cause dementia or whether poor sleep was an early symptom of dementia. However, new research has revealed that sleep quality may have a direct impact on the rate at which the brain ages.

""Our findings provide evidence that poor sleep may contribute to accelerated brain aging,"" explains Abigail Dove, a neuroepidemiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, ""and point to inflammation as one of the underlying mechanisms.""

The researchers assessed the quality of their sleep across five dimensions in 27,500 middle-aged and elderly people (average age 54.7 years) enrolled in the UK Biobank (a research institute conducting long-term follow-up studies of the effects of genetic predisposition and lifestyle on disease). Approximately nine years later, they scanned the participants' brains with MRI and used machine learning models to estimate their biological brain age.

The researchers quantified sleep quality based on chronotype (morningness or eveningness), duration of sleep, presence or absence of insomnia, presence or absence of snoring, and daytime sleepiness. Using these data, they categorized participants into three sleep patterns, finding that 41.2 percent had healthy sleep, 3.3 percent had clearly poor sleep, and 55.6 percent fell into the middle group.

The analysis showed that for every point decrease in the healthy sleep score, the difference between brain age and chronological age increased by approximately six months. The group with the poorest sleep quality showed that their brains were approximately one year older than their chronological age. This suggests that differences in sleep duration and sleep habits can significantly affect the rate at which the brain ages.

Researchers have found that a night-owl lifestyle, unhealthy sleep duration (beyond 7-8 hours), and snoring habits are particularly strongly associated with brain aging. They also found that the five factors that determine sleep quality interact with each other. For example, insomnia can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness, and a nocturnal lifestyle can lead to shorter sleep times.

To understand the mechanism by which poor sleep affects the brain, the research team also measured the level of low-grade inflammation in the body. Specifically, they used a combination of biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein levels, white blood cell and platelet counts, and the ratio of granulocytes to lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell), to analyze the role of inflammation in the relationship between sleep patterns and brain aging.

The results confirmed that higher levels of inflammation in the body tend to increase brain age. Mediation analysis (a method of analyzing the influence of variables intermediate in the causal relationship between two variables) found that inflammation explained approximately 7 percent of the association between intermediate sleep patterns and brain aging, and more than 10 percent of the association with poor sleep patterns. In other words, it is highly likely that poor sleep quality makes it easier for chronic inflammation to occur in the body, which in turn accelerates brain aging.

In addition to inflammation, there are several other ways that poor sleep can negatively affect the brain. One is through its negative impact on the glymphatic system, which primarily removes waste products from the brain during sleep. If toxic substances in the brain are not efficiently removed during sleep, this could impair the function of nerve cells in the long term. Researchers have also pointed out that poor sleep can worsen cardiovascular health, which indirectly damages blood flow and tissue in the brain.

As the first year of the Trump administration approaches its end, government cybersecurity experts and even some United States government officials are warning that recent White House initiatives—including downsizing and restructuring of the US federal workforce—risk setting the government back on improving and expanding its digital defenses.

Read more Expired/Tired/WIRED 2025 stories here.

For years, the federal government was playing catch-up on cybersecurity, scrambling to replace ancient software, apply security patches to newer systems, and deploy other baseline protections across a massive and disparate population of PCs and other gadgets. With so many agencies and offices that needed upgrading, it was slow going. But as repeated government data breaches drew urgent attention to the issue, and as the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency—founded in 2018—established itself during the early 2020s, minimum standards seemed to be rising. Now, with major staffing cuts at CISA and in other key departments across the government, that incremental progress could quickly erode.

“We've spent a lot of time trying to encourage the government to do more, and CISA was doing, you know, a better job,” retiring comptroller general Gene Dodaro told the US Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on December 16. He added that the Government Accountability Office has “a lot of open recommendations still for them to do. But I'm concerned that we're taking our foot off the gas at CISA, and I think we'll live to regret it.”

CISA lost about 1,000 people, more than a third of its staff, as a result of cuts that seemed to be motivated by the Trump administration's anger about the agency's election security work. Cybersecurity Dive reported in mid-November that the agency is planning to rebuild in 2026.

“The recent reduction in personnel has limited CISA's ability to fully support national security imperatives and administration priorities,” acting CISA director Madhu Gottumukkala wrote in a memo to staff at the beginning of November. He added that that agency has “reached a pivotal moment” but is “hampered by an approximately 40 percent vacancy rate across key mission areas.”

When asked for comment about staffing cuts at CISA and the administration's plans for maintaining and improving federal cybersecurity and critical infrastructure defenses, the White House referred WIRED to the Department of Homeland Security.

CISA director of public affairs Marci McCarthy told WIRED in a statement that the agency is focused on executing its statutory mission. “Claims that staffing adjustments are weakening cybersecurity miss the truth,” she said in the statement. “We are accelerating innovation, deepening operational collaboration, and directing resources where they yield the greatest return.”

This fall's weekslong government shutdown only added to concerns about the state of federal cybersecurity—creating the possibility of blind spots or gaps in monitoring while so many workers were furloughed and contributing in general to the already extensive IT backlog at agencies across the government.

“Federal IT workers, they are good jobs, there's not enough resources for the issues that they have to deal with,” one former national security official, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press, told WIRED. “It's always underfunded. They always have to catch up.”

Amélie Koran, a cybersecurity consultant and former chief enterprise security architect for the Department of Interior, notes that one of the most significant impacts of the shutdown likely involved disrupting, or in some cases potentially ending, relationships with specialized government contractors who may have needed to take other jobs in order to get paid but whose institutional knowledge is difficult to replace.

Koran adds, too, that given the limited scope of the continuing resolution Congress passed to reopen the government, “no new contracts and extensions or options are probably being done, which will cascade to next year and beyond.”

While it is unclear if the shutdown was a contributing factor, the United States Congressional Budget Office said more than five weeks into the ordeal that it had suffered a hack and had taken steps to contain the breach. The Washington Post reported at the time that the agency was infiltrated by a “suspected foreign actor.” And after years of incredibly consequential US government data breaches—including the 2015 Office of Personnel Management hack perpetrated by China and the sprawling, multi-agency breach launched by Russia in 2020 that is often called the SolarWinds hack—experts warn that inconsistent staffing and reduced hiring at key agencies like CISA could have disastrous consequences.

“When, not if, we have a major cybersecurity incident within the federal government, we can't simply staff up with additional cybersecurity resources after the fact and expect the same outcomes we would get from long-tenured staff,” says Jake Williams, a former NSA hacker and current vice president of research and development at Hunter Strategy.

Brain drain, Williams says, and any loss of momentum on digital defense, is a serious concern for the US.

“On a daily basis I'm worrying that federal cybersecurity and critical infrastructure protection may be backsliding,” Williams says. “We must stay ahead of the curve.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","AI-Powered Dating Is All Hype. IRL Cruising Is the Future","https://www.wired.com/story/expired-tired-wired-ai-powered-dating/","Wed, 31 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

I am, admittedly, a big flirt. I love everything about the exchange of getting to know another person. The playful banter. The rush of dopamine. The sexual subtlety and subtext of everything not said. Flirting, to me, remains one of the last human endeavors where people are intentionally trying to find common ground. It's pure possibility, absolute magnetism. It's also an art that can't be faked, or—despite Silicon Valley's best attempts—perfected by AI.

That, of course, didn't stop Big Dating from going all in on virtual intimacy this year, during which the focus shifted from endless swipes to AI-powered matchmaking. As the narrative around dating fatigue reached new heights, the trend toward sincere connection was an overdue correction by an industry that, across the last decade, built itself on ruthless scale, maniacal ambition, and profit incentives, only to realize that the answer was right in front of them all along: You win by investing in people.

The integration of AI tools wasn't simply about keeping up with the Joneses or leaning into new innovations (though it was some of that). For once it was more than just talk: Big Dating was seeking absolution for its sins.

Read more Expired/Tired/WIRED 2025 stories here.

Where dating apps once conspired to retain users by any means, AI presented an opportunity to connect people faster and, perhaps, forever. It led many companies to reconsider their user experience. According to a Pew Research Center study a few years ago, in the US, almost 60 percent of single adults said they were not currently looking for a relationship or casual dates. And while we aren't exactly in a romantic recession—active users remain high; not to mention that Facebook Dating is a secret hit among Gen Z—overall user engagement among several apps, according to analytics firm Apptopia, has decreased by 7 percent year-over-year. (Yes, even in spite of one Belgian artist's bizarre attempt to match people based on their browser history.)

It's not a crisis or anything of the sort—hundreds of millions of people still swipe, scroll, and like on a daily basis—Big Dating just desperately needed to repair its reputation. AI looked like an answer.

In October, Three Day Rule, the veteran matchmaking service, launched a matchmaker-trained AI app called Tai that offers real-time coaching. Grindr, which is on a quest to become the ultimate global gayborhood by going “AI native,” is using tools from Anthropic and Amazon on its wingman feature and chat summaries (though some users weren't happy about the app's broad embrace of machine tech). Iris, Rizz, and Elate also rolled out AI features to help users navigate the early talking stages.

In a year where everyone had Love Island USA on the brain, yearners made a comeback, right-wing influencers campaigned for a larger stake in the dating zeitgeist, and virtual relationships saw record growth—as anecdotally did divorces caused by AI affairs. (According to a report by TechCrunch, the AI companion market has grown more than 96 percent since 2024.) Tinder, meanwhile, underwent a brand refresh and tried to attract more Gen Z users. “The biggest issue that we're concerned with … is the bulk creation of new accounts,” Yoel Roth, head of trust and safety for Match Group, told WIRED in October following the launch of Tinder's mandatory face verification update.

But the push for an analog dating experience—for something more human, physical, and real—was just as intense as it was for AI.

What seems even more true today is that young people want better alternatives to dating apps. They're still hungry for love, they just no longer believe the solution is on their phone. I spoke with Eric Waldstein in February. He's the CEO of Beyond, a new social club built around modern relationships that encourages online and IRL interactions among its members. He told me he anticipated a trend toward more intentional, curated experiences “that give people something they can't get from an algorithm.” Boy, was he right. In the months that followed, even as AI streamlined our connections, another trend emerged with just as much force: People, it seemed, really just wanted to get to know someone in person without the barrier of a phone between them.

Good old-fashioned meet-cutes were making a comeback. On Instagram, influencer Laurie Cooper popularized “Sit at the Bar September.” Flirting parties popped up across Los Angeles. IRL dating events surged on ticketing platform Eventbrite in 2025, the company confirmed to WIRED. Friending events increased by 35 percent, compared to this time last year, with attendance at board game dating events up by 55 percent. Even some of the more promising apps of the moment rejected scale in favor of intention: Cerca paired people based on mutual connections, Breeze set out to reboot the blind date, and Timeleft offered to curate dinner parties for users with random groups of people in their city (the pitch: “turning strangers into friends”). I'm not a betting man, but expect offline-focused dating tech to dominate even more in 2026.

“People want digital to facilitate real-life interaction, not replace it,” Waldstein says. “I think people will start having a better understanding of what's influencing their triggers and what brings them peace, and as a result we'll see an increase in demand for authenticity.” He anticipates the shift will move “toward trust over reach” as singles look for an extra dose of social accountability in the next era of their dating experience.

There was no bigger theme for Big Dating in 2025 than getting people offline, with or without the help of AI, and back into the physical world, in search of an old architecture of connection.

Consider this the sign you've been waiting for. Get to it. Your person is out there.

In 2025, American and world leaders were preoccupied with wars in the Middle East. Most dramatically, first Israel and the United States bombed Iran's nuclear facilities. Some commentators feared that President Trump's decision to bomb Iran would drag the United States into the “forever wars” in the Middle East that presidential candidate Trump had pledged to avoid. The tragic war in Gaza had become a humanitarian disaster. After years of promising to reduce engagement with the region from Democratic and Republican presidents alike, it appeared that the US was being dragged back into Middle East once again.

I hope that's not the case. Instead, in 2026, President Trump, his administration, the US Congress, and the American people more generally must realize that the real challenges to the American national interests, the free world, and global order more generally come not from the Middle East but from the autocratic China and Russia. The three-decade honeymoon from great power politics after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War is over. For the United States to succeed in this new era of great power competition, US strategists must first accurately diagnose the threat and then devise and implement effective prescriptions.

This story is from the WIRED World in 2026, our annual trends briefing.

The oversimplified assessment is that we have entered a new Cold War with Xi's China and his sidekick, Russian leader Vladimir Putin. To be sure, there are some parallels between our current era of great power competition and the Cold War. The balance of power in the world today is dominated by two great powers, the United States and China, much like the United States and the Soviet Union dominated the world during the Cold War. Second, like the contest between communism and capitalism during the last century, there is an ideological conflict between the great powers today. The United States is a democracy. China and Russia are autocracies. Third, at least until the second Trump era, all three of these great powers have sought to propagate and expand their influence globally. That too was the case during the last Cold War.

At the same time, there are also some significant differences. Superimposing the Cold War metaphor to explain everything regarding the US-China rivalry today distorts as much as it illuminates.

First, while the world is dominated by two great powers, the United States remains more powerful than China on many dimensions of power—military, economic, ideological—and especially so when allies are added to the equation. Also different from the Cold War, several mid-level powers have emerged in the global system—Brazil, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa, among others—that are not willing to join exclusively the American bloc or the Chinese bloc.

Second, while the ideological dimension of great power competition is real, it is not as intense as the Cold War. The Soviets aimed to spread communism worldwide, including in Europe and the United States. They were willing to deploy the Red Army, provide military and economic assistance, overthrow regimes, and fight proxy wars with the United States to achieve that aim. So far, Xi Jinping and the Communist Party of China have not employed these same aggressive methods to export their model of governance or construct an alternative world order. Putin is much more aggressive in propagating his ideology of illiberal nationalism and seeking to destroy the liberal international order. Thankfully, however, Russia does not have the capabilities of China to succeed in these revisionist aims.

A third difference from the Cold War is the degree of economic connectivity between the United States and China and the global economy. Managing that interdependence prudently, rather than seeking to divide the global economy into red and blue teams again, is a new, unique challenge for American foreign policymakers.

A fourth difference is the degree of polarization among Americans, including on foreign policy issues. During the Cold War, American society did split on America's role in the world, especially regarding the war in Vietnam. However, a consensus prevailed for most of the Cold War regarding the necessity of containment as a grand strategy for dealing with the Soviet Union. Such widespread agreement about how to deal with China and Russia today does not exist. Some Americans, including President Trump from time to time, even think that Russian dictator Putin should be courted as a friend, not contained as an adversary.

So far in the second Trump administration, American foreign policy thinkers, both inside and outside the government, have not engaged in a serious discussion about a new grand strategy for prevailing in this new era of great power competition with China and Russia. Tragically, the Trump administration hastily destroyed some of America's most effective instruments of influence for competing with the Soviet Union last century and China this century, including the US Agency for International Development, Voice of America, Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Europe, and the multitudes of American nongovernmental organizations previously engaged in advancing democracy abroad. Trump also has shown no interest in strengthening the multilateral economic organizations—the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO—that proved so pivotal in supporting global capitalism during the Cold War and thereafter. His threats against enduring democratic allies, Canada and Denmark, are exacerbating tensions with our allies when we should be strengthening ties with them to address the autocratic axis of China and Russia. Trump has not even made clear whether he seeks to contain or join forces with Putin. His strategy for dealing with China is also very ill-defined. Some in his administration describe the Communist Party of China as an even greater threat to the United States than the Soviets or the Nazis. However, Trump himself never discusses the ideological or military dimensions of competition with Beijing, and instead talks mostly about striking a big economic deal with Xi. Trump has even authorized the export of sensitive technologies to China, rolling back export restrictions from the Biden era.

The year 2026 should mark the end of this moment of strategic uncertainty regarding America's foreign policy for competing with China and Russia. At the end of World War II, it took American leaders some time to realize the full dimensions of the new era of great competition—the Cold War. We are at a similar moment in history today. The sooner we engage in a serious debate about American grand strategy in the 21st century, the better.

Seattle cryptocurrency company Coinme said it reached an agreement with Washington state regulators to pause the temporary cease-and-desist order issued against it last month, clearing the way for the company to resume operations in the state.

The Washington State Department of Financial Institutions had ordered Coinme to stop transmitting money for customers, alleging the startup improperly claimed as its own income more than $8 million owed to consumers from unredeemed crypto vouchers.

Coinme said the order was stayed after it provided detailed financial records and operational information to regulators that clarified key details about its business practices. As a result, the company said, it will be able to “continue serving customers in Washington State while addressing any remaining concerns.” 

The state agency had been seeking to revoke Coinme's money transmitter license, impose a $300,000 fine, and ban CEO Neil Bergquist from the industry for 10 years. 

The agreement, laid out in a Dec. 23 consent order, requires Coinme to segregate Washington customer assets into dedicated accounts within 14 days, and move cash or cash equivalents tied to outstanding Washington kiosk transactions into a segregated account within 30 days. 

The order also requires the company to provide monthly compliance updates to regulators. The underlying charges remain unresolved and could still be litigated, according to the order.

“Our commitment to customer protection and regulatory compliance remains our top priority,” Bergquist said in a statement, noting that Coinme has had a collaborative relationship with the agency dating back to the company's founding in 2014.

Coinme operates what it calls the nation's largest cash-to-crypto network through partnerships with MoneyGram and Coinstar. The company had called the original charges an accounting dispute over a discontinued voucher product.

Over the last several years, fusion power has gone from the butt of jokes — always a decade away! — to an increasingly tangible and tantalizing technology that has drawn investors off the sidelines.

The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets.

The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes.

It doesn't hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what's known as scientific breakeven, and while it's still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound.

Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August, added $863 million to its coffers, bringing its total raised near $3 billion.

CFS's Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. 

Sparc's reactor is a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors.

The Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facility will be built near Richmond, Virginia, and Google has agreed to buy half its output.

CFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others.

Founded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. 

In December 2025, TAE announced that it would merge with President Donald Trump's social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group. The all-stock transaction would value the combined company at $6 billion. TAE would receive $200 million plus another $100 million upon filing paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEO of the combined company alongside Devin Nunes, who had been sole CEO of Trump Media.

The fusion startup had previously raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. Before the merger, TAE had raised a total of $1.79 billion, according to PitchBook.

Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft.

Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma's own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor's magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine.

The company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel's Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group.

Pacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target.

The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion's funding might be massive, but the startup hasn't gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that's common in biotech.

Shine Technologies is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it's starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn't picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it's developing necessary skills for when that time comes.

The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.

Now its third decade, General Fusion has raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital.

In General Fusion's reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine.

General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors. 

In August, they delivered somewhat, injecting $22 million in a pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat. Then in November, securities filings in Canada revealed that the company had raised $51.1 million in SAFE notes from nearly 70 investors, the Globe and Mail reported. Altogether, General Fusion has raised $492 million, according to PitchBook.

Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. 

The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup's ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company's magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business.

In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook.

Zap Energy isn't using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine.

Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel.

Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany.

Proxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a €130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures.

Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma's quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions.

With all the startups pursuing fusion power, it was perhaps inevitable that another would pop up to develop components that round out a power plant. The so-called balance of plant, or the parts that sit outside the reactor, range from gyrotrons that heat plasma to heat extraction systems to harvest power from fusion reactions to turn it into electricity. 

Kyoto Fusioneering has made an early bet that if even one fusion startup succeeds in generating enough power to sell to the grid, that the industry will need a supplier for the balance of plant and the expertise to integrate it into whichever fusion technologies win out.

Venture capitalists appear to agree, having invested $191 million in Kyoto Fusioneering. Investors include 31Ventures, In-Q-Tel, JIC Venture Growth Investments, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Investment.

Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry's decades of experience.

The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $162 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, and HV Capital with Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels.

Unlike many other fusion startups, First Light Fusion doesn't use magnets to generate the conditions necessary for fusion. Instead, it follows an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. 

But even then, First Light doesn't hew to orthodoxy. Most attempts at inertial confinement use lasers to do the dirty work, following the lead of the National Ignition Facility, which produced a groundbreaking experiment in 2022. Rather, First Light fires a projectile at a target using a two-stage gun; the first stage uses gunpowder to fire a plastic piston that compresses hydrogen to 145,000 psi, which then launches the projectile. The target is designed to amplify the force of the impact so it compresses the fuel to the point of ignition.

In March 2025, First Light announced that it would not pursue building its own power plant, instead offering its core technologies to other companies to build one. A spokesperson for First Light said that it is planning to build “pulsed power capability that would act as our demonstrator plant but would have other science and defense applications.” In other words, the company was dropping its plans for a power plan in a quest for revenue.

Based in Oxfordshire, UK, First Light has raised $108 million from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent, according to PitchBook.

Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that's behind the National Ignition Facility's breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF's setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage.

Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $100 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

Having a cuddly pet to return home to is one of life's great joys, and with the latest gadgets and AI technology, pet ownership becomes even more enjoyable and convenient. 

Here's a roundup of some gadgets that can be the perfect gifts for any pet parent.

Petlibro recently launched its AI-powered Scout Smart Camera, which gives pet owners real-time insights into what their little ones are up to. 

The app lets you control where the camera looks, and it can also automatically follow your pet as they move around. The camera has two-way audio, so you can talk to your pet if they're being naughty, and it can even make a little chirping sound to get their attention. Scout can recognize up to two pets, so you can keep track of them separately.

What makes this device special is the AI descriptions. Scout can recognize when your pet eats, drinks, uses the litter box, or just walks by. It takes pictures and saves daily highlights in the cloud for up to 30 days. To access the AI features, you need to sign up for the standard subscription for $12 a month, or the premium tier for $17 a month.

This new GPS pet tracker from Life360 is a lifesaver for anyone who worries about their furry friends wandering off. You can attach it to your pet's collar, and it connects to your phone to give you real-time location tracking. It even has geofencing, which alerts you if your pet leaves a safe area like your yard or neighborhood.

Additional helpful features include alerts to notify nearby pet owners in the area if your pet escapes, as well as a built-in light to help you locate your pet in the dark.

The tracker is offered in three colors: pink, navy, and black. To use all its features, users need to sign up for either the $14.99-per-month Gold plan or the $24.99-per-month Platinum tier.

The Polar Wet Food Feeder from Petlibro is all about keeping your cat's wet food fresh while you're away. It has three compartments and can hold up to 22.2 ounces, so you can be gone for up to 72 hours without worrying about your cat going hungry. The containers are cooled to keep the food fresh, and the bowl trays are BPA-free, dishwasher-safe plastic. 

The device comes with a mobile app that lets you control the feeder, set up your pet's feeding schedule, and get notified when your cat starts eating. The app will alert you if your home internet connection goes out, and in case of a power outage, the device can keep the food cold for up to 12 hours.

If you're fed up with pests and critters sneaking in through regular pet doors, this smart door system from Pawport is built from heavy-duty steel and aluminum, and features two solid deadbolts that can keep out unwanted animals, as well as rain and snow. A new model released this year connects an interior and exterior door through a tunnel-like enclosure for extra security.

Thanks to a tracker tag and motion-sensing tech, the door will open automatically when your pet approaches. There's also an app for remotely controlling the door, scheduling when it opens or closes, and issuing voice commands through Alexa, Siri, or Google. 

The PuraMax 2 model from PetKit is currently one of the most popular automatic litter boxes available on the market. It features odor control, a waste bin that's sealed to keep odors trapped inside, and a citrus-scented deodorizing spray that activates after every cleaning and at random times throughout the day.

The device's paired mobile app is also helpful for tracking your cat's health, as it logs how often your cat uses the box, for how long, when the cleaning cycle starts and ends, and when the deodorizing spray is released. It also tracks your cat's weight changes, which can help you spot potential health issues early.

True Ventures co-founder Jon Callaghan doesn't think we'll be using smartphones the way we do now in five years — and maybe not at all in 10.

For a venture capitalist whose firm has had some big winners over its two decades – from consumer brands like Fitbit, Ring, and Peloton, to enterprise software makers HashiCorp and Duo Security – that's more than armchair theorizing; it's a thesis on which True Ventures is actively betting.

True hasn't gotten this far by following the crowd. The Bay Area firm has largely operated under the radar despite amassing roughly $4 billion in assets under management across 12 core seed funds and four “select,” opportunity-style funds that it has used to further back portfolio companies that are gaining momentum. While other VCs have grown more promotional – building personal brands on social media and podcasts to attract founders and deal flow – True has gone in the opposite direction, quietly cultivating a tight network of repeat founders. The strategy seems to be working: according to Callaghan, the firm boasts 63 exits with gains and seven IPOs amid a portfolio of some 300 companies assembled over its 20-year history.

Three of True's four recent exits in the fourth quarter of 2025 involved repeat founders who came back to work with the firm again after previous successes, says Callaghan. Still, it's Callaghan's thinking about the future of human-computer interaction that really stands out in a sea of AI hype and mega-rounds.

“We're not going to be using iPhones in 10 years,” Callaghan says flatly. “I kind of don't think we'll be using them in five years – or let's say something different that's a little safer – we're going to be using them in very different ways.”

His argument is simple: our phones are lousy at being the interface between humans and intelligence. “The way we take them out right now to send a text to confirm this or send you some message or write an email – [that's] super inefficient, [and] not a great interface,” he explains. “[They're] prone to error, prone to disruption [of] our normal lives.”

So sure is he of this that True has been spending years exploring alternative interfaces – software-based, hardware-based, everything in between. It's the same instinct that led True to bet early on Fitbit before wearables were obvious, to invest in Peloton after hundreds of other VCs said ‘no thanks,' and to back Ring when founder Jamie Siminoff kept running out of money and even the judges on “Shark Tank” turned him away. Each time, the bet looked questionable, says Callaghan. Each time, the bet was on a new way for humans to interact with technology that felt more natural than what came before.

The latest manifestation of this thesis is Sandbar, a hardware device that Callaghan describes as a “thought companion” — or, in more mundane terms, a voice-activated ring worn on the index finger. Its singular purpose: capturing and organizing your thoughts through voice notes. It's not trying to be another Humane AI Pin or compete with Oura's health tracking. “It does one thing really well,” Callaghan says. “But that one thing is a fundamental human behavioral need that is missing from technology today.”

The idea isn't to passively record ambient audio but to be there when an idea strikes, or a juicy bit of gossip or fresh information makes its way to the wearer that they want to remember. It's attached to an app, leverages AI, and, according to Callaghan, represents a very different philosophy about how we should interact with intelligence.

What drew True to Sandbar founders Mina Fahmi and Kirak Hong wasn't just the product, though. “When we met Mina, we were just absolutely aligned on vision,” Callaghan recalls. True's team had met with numerous teams at work on alternative interfaces. But the approach of Fahmi and Hong – who previously worked together on neural interfaces at CTRL-Labs, a startup acquired by Meta in 2019 – stood out. “It's about what [the ring] enables. It's about the behavior it enables that we will very soon realize we can't live without.”

There's an echo here of Callaghan's old line about Peloton: “It's not about the bike.” To some, the bike – even its earliest iteration – was compelling. But Peloton was really about the behavior it enabled and the community it created; the bike was just the vessel.

This philosophy of betting on new behaviors — not just new gadgets — also explains how True has managed to stay disciplined about capital. Even as AI startups raise hundreds of millions at billion-dollar valuations out of the gate, True insists that it's able to stick to what it does best, which is to write seed checks of $3 million to $6 million for 15% to 20% ownership in startups that it often gets to see first.

Callaghan says True will raise more money to fund what's working, but he's not interested in raising billions of dollars. “Like, why? You don't need that to build something amazing today.”

That same measured approach colors his view of the broader AI boom. While he says (when asked) that he believes OpenAI could soon be worth a trillion dollars, and while he calls this the most powerful compute wave we've seen, Callaghan sees warning signs in the circular financing deals backing hyperscalers and their $5 trillion in projected CapEx spending on data centers and chips. “We're in a very capital intense part of the cycle, and that is worrisome,” he notes.

That said, he's optimistic about where the real opportunities lie. Callaghan thinks the greatest value creation is ahead of us – not in the infrastructure layer but in the application layer, where new interfaces will enable entirely new behaviors.

It all comes back to his core investing philosophy, which sounds almost romantic — the kind of pitch-perfect VC wisdom that would ring hollow from most people: “It should be scary and lonely and you should be called crazy,” Callaghan says about early-stage investing done right. “And it should be really blurry and ambiguous, but you should be with a team that you really believe in.” Five to ten years later, he says, you'll know if you were on to something.

Either way, based on True's track record of betting on hardware that many others missed – fitness trackers, connected bikes, smart doorbells, and now thought-capturing rings – it's worth paying attention when Callaghan says the phone's days are numbered. Being early is the whole point — and the trend lines support his thesis: the smartphone market is effectively saturated, growing at barely 2% annually, while wearables — smartwatches, rings, and voice-enabled devices — are expanding at double-digit rates. 

Something's shifting in how we want to interact with technology, and True is placing its bets accordingly.

Tade Oyerinde and Teddy Solomon know a few things about building communities that last.  

Afterall, Oyerinde is the founder and chancellor of the online school Campus, while Solomon is the co-founder behind the college social app Fizz. 

The two spoke at TechCrunch Disrupt this year, breaking down the strategies that helped them scale their companies while retaining consumer interest. 

Campus offers associate degrees in areas like information technology and business administration. It also offers certificates in specialities like cosmetology and phlebotomy. There are more than 3,000 students enrolled in Campus, and it employs more than 100 professors on at least a part-time basis, Oyerinde says.  

Oyerinde said Campus decided to launch à la carte courses since employers, in particular, have been asking for classes that can teach their employees individual skills like vibe coding.  

He's realized that a lot of people are looking to upskill and believes that in the future, everyone will have some sort of membership or subscription service that helps them develop new skills.  

“Everyone in this room, not just two-year degree-seeking people, will be able to go to Campus and learn with us,” he told the audience. “Live, online classes, taught by amazing people.”  

Oyerinde makes use of the Pell Grant to help keep the school affordable for most people. He also has a team of billionaires on his company's cap table — like OpenAI's Sam Altman and Discord's Jason Citroen — meaning he doesn't feel much pressure to focus on profits above all else, he said.

“They don't need the money,” he continued. “What they really want is to fundamentally shape the way that education works in this country for the better.”  

Fizz, meanwhile, operates on more than 200 college campuses and at one point operated in high schools across the country. It has raised more than $40 million with investors including Owl Ventures and NEA. 

Since launching in 2021, Solomon said the company had adopted features like a peer-to-peer marketplace that's listed more than 100,000 items, and a video element so people can write more than text posts.  

Now, the company is looking to build a product called Global Fizz to expand the product beyond the U.S. Solomon spoke more about that on TechCrunch's Equity podcast, where he mapped out the future of the company. 

Solomon told the audience that the company is looking at ways to monetize, focusing on ads in particular. “We've already worked with companies like Perplexity,” he said. 

“There are subscription models that have worked well with apps, but right now we're focused on our ads business, and we're focused on building a great product that keeps our users around and makes them happy.” 

After all, he said, “The users are everything.”

Before HD, almost all video was non-square pixels. DVD is 720x480. SD channels on cable TV systems are 528x480.

reply

Correct. This came from the ITU-R BT.601 standard, one of the first digital video standards authors of which chose to define digital video as a sampled analog signal. Analog video never had a concept of pixels and operated on lines instead. The rate at which you could sample it could be arbitrary, and affected only the horizontal resolution. The rate chosen by BT.601 was 13.5 MHz, which resulted in a 10/11 pixel aspect ratio for 4:3 NTSC video and 59/54 for 4:3 PAL.>SD channels on cable TV systems are 528x480I'm not actually sure about America, but here in Europe most digital cable and satellite SDTV is delivered as 720x576i 4:2:0 MPEG-2 Part 2. There are some outliers that use 544x576i, however.

F.ex. in case of a ""4:3 720x480"" frame… a quick test: 720/4=180 and 480/3=160… 180 vs. 160… different results… which means the pixels for this frame are not square, just rectangular. Alternatively 720/480 vs. 4/3 works too, of course.

Some modern films are still filmed with anamorphic lenses because the director / DP like that, and so we in the VFX industry have to deal with plate footage that way, and so have to deal with non-square pixels in the software handling the images (to de-squash the image, even though the digital camera sensor pixels that recorded the image from the lens were square) in order to display correctly (i.e. so that round circular things still look round, and are not squashed).Even to the degree that full CG element renders (i.e. rendered to EXR with a pathtracing renderer) should really use anisotropic pixel filter widths to look correct.

What you're referring to stems from an assumption made a long time ago by Microsoft, later adopted as a de facto standard by most computer software. The assumption was that the pixel density of every display, unless otherwise specified, was 96 pixels per inch [1].The value stuck and started being taken for granted, while the pixel density of displays started growing much beyond that—a move mostly popularized by Apple's Retina. A solution was needed to allow new software to take advantage of the increased detail provided by high-density displays while still accommodating legacy software written exclusively for 96 PPI. This resulted in the decoupling of ""logical"" pixels from ""physical"" pixels, with the logical resolution being most commonly defined as ""what the resolution of the display would be given its physical size and a PPI of 96"" [2], and the physical resolution representing the real amount of pixels. The 100x100 and 200x200 values in your example are respectively the logical and physical resolutions of your screenshot.Different software vendors refer to these ""logical"" pixels differently, but the most names you're going to encounter are points (Apple), density-independent pixels (""DPs"", Google), and device-independent pixels (""DIPs"", Microsoft). The value of 96, while the most common, is also not a standard per se. Android uses 160 PPI as its base, Apple has for a long time used 72.[1]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/fontblog/whe...[2]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/devi...

From what I recall only Microsoft had problems with this, and specifically on Windows. You might be right about software that was exclusive to desktop Windows. I don't remember having scaling issues even on other Microsoft products such as Windows Mobile.

If my memory serves, it was Apple that popularized high pixel density in displays with the iPhone 4. They haven't been the first to use such a display [1], but certainly the ones to start a chain reaction that resulted in phones adopting crazy resolutions all the way up to 4K.It's the desktop software that mostly had problems scaling.

                Reading time 3 minutes
      

Roughly 1,000 light-years away from Earth, a gigantic disk of gas and dust is swirling around a young star and giving rise to new planets. Not only is it the largest planet-forming disk astronomers have ever found, its behavior is different than any seen before.

The disk spans nearly 400 billion miles (640 billion kilometers)—that's about 40 times wider than our entire solar system. While it was first identified in 2016, astronomers have now used NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to capture the first image of this planetary nursery in visible light. The new images revealed an unusually chaotic environment, with wisps of material stretching farther above and below the disk than expected. Strangely, these extended filaments are concentrated on just one side of the disk.

The team published its findings on December 23 in The Astrophysical Journal, including a nickname for the baffling space object: “Dracula's Chivito,” a nod to the heritage of two of the researchers, one from Transylvania (home of Dracula) and one from Uruguay (home of the chivito, an iconic beefsteak sandwich). When viewed edge-on, the planet-forming disk resembles a sandwich, with a dark central lane flanked by white top and bottom layers of gas and dust.

“The level of detail we're seeing is rare in protoplanetary disk imaging, and these new Hubble images show that planet nurseries can be much more active and chaotic than we expected,” Kristina Monsch, study lead author and a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Astrophysics (CfA), a collaboration between Stanford University and the Smithsonian, said in a NASA statement.

“We're seeing this disk nearly edge-on and its wispy upper layers and asymmetric features are especially striking,” she added.

All planets form from disks of gas and dust encircling young stars. Astronomers have long believed that these protoplanetary disks were relatively orderly, serene environments where planets gradually coalesce over millions of years. Recent studies have challenged that assumption, pointing to greater complexity and diversity among these systems. Hubble's new image of Dracula's Chivito adds to this growing body of evidence.

“We were stunned to see how asymmetric this disk is,” co-author Joshua Bennett Lovell, also an astronomer at the CfA, said in the statement. “Hubble has given us a front row seat to the chaotic processes that are shaping disks as they build new planets—processes that we don't yet fully understand but can now study in a whole new way.”

The fact that Dracula's Chivito's extended filaments only appear on one side suggests that dynamic processes—like gas and dust falling into the disc, or other interactions with the space outside it—are shaping the celestial sandwich.

The disk obscures the young star (or stars) within it, but the researchers believe it could harbor either a single massive, hot star or a binary pair. The disk itself contains 10 to 30 times more mass than Jupiter, meaning there's enough material to form multiple gas giant planets. As such, Dracula's Chivito is basically a scaled-up model of what our solar system looked like 4.6 billion years ago.

“In theory, [Dracula's Chivito] could host a vast planetary system,” Monsch said. “While planet formation may differ in such massive environments, the underlying processes are likely similar. Right now, we have more questions than answers, but these new images are a starting point for understanding how planets form over time and in different environments.”

Dracula's Chivito is therefore a natural laboratory for studying planet formation, says Monsch. Hubble and other space telescopes, such as NASA's James Webb, will continue observing this unique disk to uncover what's shaping its bizarre structure.

NASA is seeking proposals for a new system to help spot and identify drones that may be flying over the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

The space agency recently put out a call for proposals for Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) detection and analysis services, which NASA is hoping to put into action by April 2026. The purpose of the system will be “to make rapid and critical decisions to protect NASA personnel, the public, launch vehicles, flight hardware, critical high value assets, and security interests,” according to the contract listing. It will have both fixed and mobile sensors.

The move comes shortly after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced it was banning new foreign-made drones and drone components, citing national security concerns.

Kennedy Space Center is NASA's primary launch site, including for the Space Launch System rocket that will carry the Artemis missions to the Moon, and houses facilities for research and commercial space ventures.

“All UAS flights over KSC property, whether inside or outside the security perimeter, are restricted and only occur with the approval of KSC Flight Operations,” NASA wrote in its proposal. It's not clear whether the agency has faced recent threats from drones, or if this is a precautionary move to protect its launch assets. It's also not clear what kind of drone detection systems are in use at the neighboring Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, home to classified military activities.

The drone detection system would detect and identify unknown UAS within a distance of at least 46 miles (64 kilometers), provide threat analyses, real-time detection and alerting capabilities, according to the call for proposal.

The recent ban on foreign-made drones stems from a defense bill that passed last year, which called for a review of the national security risks posed by the flying vehicles. In late 2024, there was a surge of reports of drones seen flying over New Jersey, but most experts say people were simply confused by traditional aircraft.

We can report at least one relevant siting: KSC's Visitor Center is reportedly running a holiday drone show featuring 600 autonomous aircraft.

Anyone who's watched more than a couple futuristic movies has probably witnessed a scene in which one of the characters pulls out a particularly compact computer so they can quickly hack into something. Youtuber High Tech Low Life (HTLL) saw them, too, and inspired by John Connor hacking an ATM with an Atari Portfolio in Terminator 2, he decided to roll his own cyberdeck.

A glance at the video frame below might make you think that HTLL just bought some fancy phone case and tweaked it. In reality, though, it wasn't as much of a project as it was a whole enterprise. He wanted to roll a computer, a decently-sized keyboard, a boombox, a huge battery, and an extension hub into his design, all with a carrying handle.

He accomplished that with aplomb, adding a phone holder with a magnetic USB-C port, a three-port USB hub, a 10,000 mAh battery, a wireless keyboard with an integrated touchpad (detachable, too!), and a Bluetooth amplifier plus a pair of 2-inch, 5W speakers. The call on the keyboard was key to the construct, as choosing a competent clicker of convenient caliber would dictate the overall dimensions of the case.

HTLL ended up going with a keyboard from Rii, but since that model only came with 2.4 GHz connectivity with a dongle, he was then compelled to add a USB hub. Next, he opted among different speaker sizes and chose the 2-inch as the Goldilocks one, as the smaller drivers didn't have the oomph he desired.

As any 3D printing enthusiast reading this will likely predict, designing the phone holder was one of the two hardest parts of the project. Despite having tons of hardware, he was ironically bereft of a 3D scanner. That made designing the holder a many-print affair, as finding the sweet spot between the holder being loose enough to fit the phone and tight enough to hold it in place was tricky. Figuring out just the right depth to fit the magnetic USB-C connector was a challenge, too.

The step of designing a competent hinge was equally tricky. 3D printing a hinge is easy enough, but HTLL wanted one that was both made of metal and was adjustable like laptop hinges are via a screw. He recommends ThinkPad hinges for your own DIY projects.

After some screws, washers, and foldable feet that turned out unnecessary, the project was complete. When folded, with the side carrying handle, the deck is reminiscent of 80s multi-cassette cases, except it's about half the volume. The next step could be adding a VR headset to it, and pretend you're Case from Neuromancer on his Ono-Sendai deck.

Cables and pipelines in the Gulf of Finland have been damaged four times in less than 1.5 years.

At around 5 a.m. local time, an undersea telecommunications cable between Estonia and Finland was damaged for the fourth time in roughly 1.5 years. Finnish special forces have taken control of the cargo ship Fitburg, detained its 14-member crew, and revealed that they were citizens of Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan. Authorities are currently investigating whether the vessel's movement and anchoring caused the incident, reports Postimees. Despite the damage, the owner of the cable claims connectivity remains intact due to extensive network redundancy.

Elisa, a leading telecom provider in Estonia and Finland and the cable's owner, alerted authorities under standard incident protocols at around 5 a.m. Although the fault was located inside Estonia's exclusive economic zone, the ship crossed into Finnish waters shortly afterward, which allowed Finnish authorities to detain the vessel and open a criminal case. When the ship was detained, its anchor chain was in the sea, the report notes.

Officials emphasize that the communications infrastructure between Estonia and neighboring countries is very redundant: Estonia is connected abroad via 12 international cables, so the loss of individual links does not translate into systemic outages.

“We could talk about a critical situation only if just one cable were still operational, but at the moment we have a significant margin,” said Liisa Pakosta, Estonia's justice and digital affairs minister. “It is also worth noting that such breakdowns are usually not even reported, because they occur fairly often. One of the cables runs between Läänemaa and Hiiumaa — it is not part of these 12 and is a local cable. But communications on Hiiumaa are also functioning.”

Automatic Identification System (AIS) records from MarineTraffic indicate that near the route of Elisa's submarine cable, Fitburg slowed from 8.9 to 7.3 knots, with a multi-minute data gap suggesting speed may have dropped even further. This naturally causes suspicions that the vessel's anchor hit the cable when the AIS was disabled.The ship in question is the Fitburg, a 132.2-meter general cargo vessel built in 2001. The vessel is currently owned by Turkey-based Fitburg Shipping Co Ltd (which happens to be a single-vessel company) and the ship sails under the flag of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as of August 1, 2025. Safety management and commercial operations of the vessel are handled by Istanbul-based Sarfo Denizcilik ve Ticaret A.Ş and Albros Shipping & Trading Co. For now, the actual beneficiaries of Fitburg Shipping Co Ltd and Albros are unknown. Meanwhile, there is a growing list of evidence that Albros manages vessels that carry cargo of Russia origin.This new cable damage episode adds to an already long list of similar incidents in the Gulf of Finland in recent quarters. In just 1.5 years, cables and pipelines in the Gulf of Finland were damaged three other times: On October 8, 2023 the Balticconnector gas pipeline, along with multiple telco cables between Estonia and Finland were damaged. On November 17, 2024, three undersea communications cables between Sweden and Lithuania were broken. And on December 28, 2024 the EstLink 2 power cable between Estonia and Finland was damaged. More broadly, there was about a half-dozen incidents involving damage of underwater cables and pipelines in the Baltic Sea in recent years.

Tensors FTW in Rubin, Feynman, and beyond.

This month, Nvidia rolled out what might be one of the most important updates for its CUDA GPU software stack in years. The new CUDA 13.1 release introduces the CUDA Tile programming path, which elevates kernel development above the single-instruction, multiple-thread (SIMT) execution model, and aligns it with the tensor-heavy execution model of Blackwell-class processors and their successors.

By shifting to structured data blocks, or tiles, Nvidia is changing how developers design GPU workloads, setting the stage for next-generation architectures that will incorporate more specialized compute accelerators and therefore depend less on thread-level parallelism.

 






Before proceeding, it is worth clarifying that the fundamental difference between the traditional CUDA programming model and the new CUDA Tile is not in capabilities, but in what programmers control. In the original CUDA model, programming is based on SIMT (single-instruction, multiple-thread) execution. The developer explicitly decomposes the problem into threads and thread blocks, chooses grid and block dimensions, manages synchronization, and carefully designs memory access patterns to match the GPU's architecture. Performance depends heavily on low-level decisions such as warp usage, shared-memory tiling, register usage, and the explicit use of tensor-core instructions or libraries. In short, the programmer controls how the computation is executed on the hardware.

 




CUDA Tile shifts programming to a tile-centric abstraction. The developer describes computations in terms of operations on tiles — structured blocks of data such as submatrices — without specifying threads, warps, or execution order. Then the compiler and runtime automatically map those tile operations onto threads, tensor cores, tensor memory accelerators (TMA), and the GPU memory hierarchy. This means the programmer focuses on what computation should happen to the data, while CUDA determines how it runs efficiently on the hardware, which ensures performance scalability across GPU generations, starting with Blackwell and extending to future architectures.

But why introduce such significant changes at the CUDA level? There are several motives behind the move: drastic architectural changes in GPUs, and the way modern GPU workloads operate. Firstly, AI, simulation, and technical computing no longer revolve around scalar operations: they rely on dense tensor math. Secondly, Nvidia's recent hardware has also followed the same trajectory, integrating tensor cores and TMAs as core architectural enhancements. Thirdly, both tensor cores and TMAs differ significantly between architectures.

 




From Turing (the first GPU architecture to incorporate tensor units as assisting units) to Blackwell (where tensors became the primary compute engines), Nvidia has repeatedly reworked how tensor engines are scheduled, how data is staged and moved, and how much of the execution pipeline is managed by warps and threads versus dedicated hardware. With Turing, tensors were used to execute warp-issued matrix instructions, but with Blackwell, things shifted to tile-native execution pipelines with autonomous memory engines, fundamentally reducing the role of traditional SIMT controls.

As a result, as tensor hardware has been scaling aggressively, the lack of uniformity across generations has made low-level tuning on warp and thread levels impractical, so Nvidia had to elevate CUDA toward higher-level abstractions that describe intent at the tile level, rather than at the thread level, leaving all the optimizations to compilers and runtimes. One bonus to this approach is that it can extract performance gains across virtually all workloads throughout the active life cycle of its GPU architectures.

Note that it does not abandon SIMT paths with NVVM/LLVM and PTX altogether; when developers need them, they can write appropriate kernels. However, when they need to use tensor cores, they must write tile kernels.

At the center of this new CUDA Tile stack sits CUDA Tile IR, a virtual instruction set that plays the same role for tile workloads that parallel thread execution (PTX) plays for SIMT kernels. In the traditional CUDA stack, PTX serves as a portable abstraction for thread-oriented programs that ensures that SIMT kernels persist across GPU generations. CUDA Tile IR is designed to provide that same long-term stability for tile-based computations: it defines tile blocks, their relationships, operations that transform them, but hides execution details that can change from one GPU family to another.

This virtual ISA also becomes the target for compilers, frameworks, and domain-specific languages that want to exploit tile-level semantics. Tool builders who previously generated PTX for SIMT can now create parallel backends that emit Tile IR for tensor-oriented workloads. The runtime takes Tile IR as input and assigns work to hardware pipelines, tensor engines, and memory systems in a way that maximizes performance without exposing device-level variability to the programmer.

 




In addition to Tile IR itself, CUDA 13.1 introduces another key component to bring CUDA Tile to life: cuTile Python, a domain-specific language that allows developers to author array- and tile-oriented kernels directly in Python.

For now, development efforts are focused primarily on AI-centric algorithms, but Nvidia plans to expand functionality, features, and performance over time, as well as to introduce a C++ implementation in upcoming releases. Tile programming itself is certainly not limited to artificial intelligence and is designed as a general-purpose abstraction. As Nvidia's CUDA Tile evolves, it can be applied to a wide range of applications, including scientific simulations (on architectures that support the required precision), signal and image/video processing, and many HPC workloads that decompose problems into block-based computations.

In its initial release, CUDA Tile support is limited to Blackwell-class GPUs with compute capabilities 10.x and 12.x, but future releases will bring support for 'more architectures' though it is unclear whether we are talking previous-generation Hopper or next-generation Rubin.

With CUDA Tile, Nvidia is reorganizing the CUDA software model around tensor-based execution patterns that dominate modern workloads. Traditional CUDA Tile will coexist with the proven SIMT model, as not all workloads use tensor math extensively, though the vector of industry development is more or less clear, so Nvidia's focus will follow it.

Nvidia's CUDA Tile IR provides abstraction that enables architectural stability needed for future generations of tensor-focused hardware, while cuTile Python (and similar languages), as well as enhanced tools, offer practical paths for developers to transition from SIMT-heavy workflows.

Combined with expanded partitioning features, math-library optimizations, and improved debugging tools, CUDA 13.1 marks a major milestone in Nvidia's long-term strategy: abstracting away hardware complexity and enabling seamless performance scalability across each GPU generation.

Beijing accuses the Netherlands of remaining indifferent and stubbornly insisting on its own way.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that the Netherlands should “immediately correct its mistakes and clear the obstacles to restoring the stability and security of the global semiconductor supply chain.” Beijing said this in relation to the ongoing Nexperia crisis, in which the Dutch government seized control of the chipmaker from its Chinese parent, Wingtech, allegedly to safeguard “crucial technical knowledge.” However, this move has resulted in a component shortage for the automotive industry, reports CNBC, especially as the company supplies approximately 70% of the global market for automotive chips.

Although Nexperia does not manufacture cutting-edge semiconductors like TSMC, it still makes the cheap, low-tech chips that all modern cars use. These range from chips for managing advanced battery and engine systems to those needed for lights, sensors, and electric window controls.

Because of this drama, autom manufacturers have braced for the resulting disruptions, with both Japanese and German auto manufacturers bracing for its impact as far back as October 2025. True enough, Honda has had to temporarily shut down five plants across Japan and China due to the chip shortage, with these assembly sites reverting to reduced output when they return online.

There have been conflicting reasons for the government takeover aside from the supposed illegal technology transfer. One report says that the Wingtech CEO misappropriated $200 million in Nexperia funds to rescue his own company, while there have also been suggestions that the U.S. was behind the move as it put Wingtech in its “Entity List” in December 2024, with the expanded “Affiliates Rule” putting Nexperia at risk of being included in the U.S. blacklist, especially as the Chinese company owns a 75% stake on the Dutch company.

While there have been attempts to resolve the issue, it seems that the Netherlands and China offices of the automotive chipmaker have yet to resolve anything. At the moment, Nexperia Netherlands has suspended wafer shipments to its China factory, so even though Beijing has already allowed the Dongguan plant to resume exports to automakers on a case-by-case basis, it's currently facing a significant gap in wafer supply. This has led to Nexperia China seeking new wafer suppliers to replace those that were supposed to come from the Netherlands, but it will likely take six months or more before it can qualify a new vendor.

In the meantime, automakers would have no choice but to reduce output and find alternative sources for their chip needs. This issue highlights the pitfalls of relying on just a few suppliers for the majority of our chip supply, with a disruption in just one of them having a ripple effect across the globe.

One small step for chips, one giant leap for a lack of impurities.

A team from Cardiff, Wales, is experimenting with the feasibility of building semiconductors in space, and its most recent success is another step forward towards its goal. According to the BBC, Space Forge's microwave-sized furnace has been switched on in space and has reached 1,000°C (1,832°F) — one of the most important parts of the manufacturing process that the company needs to validate in space.

“This is so important because it's one of the core ingredients that we need for our in-space manufacturing process,” Payload Operations Lead Veronica Vera told the BBC. “So being able to demonstrate this is amazing.” Semiconductor manufacturing is a costly and labor-intensive endeavor on Earth, and while putting it in orbit might seem far more complicated, making chips in space offers some theoretical advantages. For example, microgravity conditions would help the atoms in semiconductors line up perfectly, while the lack of an atmosphere would also reduce the chance of contaminants affecting the wafer.

These two things would help reduce imperfections in the final wafer output, resulting in a much more efficient fab. “The work that we're doing now is allowing us to create semiconductors up to 4,000 times purer in space than we can currently make here today,” Space Forge CEO Josh Western told the publication. “This sort of semiconductor would go on to be in the 5G tower in which you get your mobile phone signal, it's going to be in the car charger you plug an EV into, it's going to be in the latest planes.”

Space Forge launched its first satellite in June 2025, hitching a ride on the SpaceX Transporter-14 rideshare mission. However, it still took the company several months before it finally succeeded in turning on its furnace, showing how complicated this project can get. Nevertheless, this advancement is quite promising, with Space Forge planning to build a bigger space factory with the capacity to output 10,000 chips. Aside from that, it also needs to work on a way to bring the finished products back to the surface. Other companies are also experimenting with orbital fabs, with U.S. startup Besxar planning to send “Fabships” into space on Falcon 9 booster rockets.

Putting semiconductor manufacturing in space could help reduce the massive amounts of power and water that these processes require from our resources while also outputting more wafers with fewer impurities. However, we also have to consider the huge environmental impact of launching multiple rockets per day just to deliver the raw materials and pick up the finished products from orbit.

First-trimester exposure to nonbenzodiazepine sedative hypnotics (Z-drugs) was not associated with an increased risk for overall or organ-specific congenital malformations, in a large US cohort study spanning more than 4 million pregnancies. 

Modest effects for some rare, severe malformations, such as tetralogy of Fallot and neural tube defects, could not be ruled out, but the “signals” were not consistently identified, the researchers noted. 

Overall, the findings provide “reassurance” on the use of Z-drugs for sleep problems during pregnancy, the investigators, with first author Kelly Fung, MS, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, write. 

The study was published online December 23 in JAMA Psychiatry. 

Sleep disturbances are common in pregnancy and often treated with Z-drugs (zolpidem, eszopiclone, or zaleplon) when first-line behavioral interventions fail. 

However, there is limited data on the safety of Z-drugs for the developing fetus. Some previous reports have suggested possible associations with cardiac, gastrointestinal, and neural tube defects based on small numbers of exposed pregnancies.

To investigate further, Fung and colleagues analyzed Medicaid data from 2000 to 2018 as well as data from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Claims Database from 2003 to 2020. 

Among nearly 4.3 million pregnancies, first-trimester Z-drug exposure was documented in roughly 0.5%-0.6% of pregnancies, with zolpidem accounting for 92% of exposures.

After adjusting for confounding factors, there was no difference in risk for congenital malformations overall among infants exposed to Z-drugs in the first trimester compared with unexposed infants (pooled relative risk [RR], 1.01). 

Although adjusted pooled relative risks were elevated for certain rare outcomes, including abdominal wall defects (RR, 1.46), tetralogy of Fallot (RR, 1.45), and neural tube defects (RR, 1.62), these estimates were “imprecise” and only seen in the Medicaid cohort. Further, the absolute increase in risk for these malformations was small — roughly 1 case per 5000 treated pregnancies, the investigators reported. 

The results were generally consistent across multiple sensitivity analyses. 

“These findings suggest that Z-drug exposure in the first trimester of pregnancy is not associated with a meaningful elevation in the risk of congenital malformations overall, nor was there a consistent signal observed for organ-specific or uncommon, individual malformations examined,” the authors conclude. 

The study was funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Fung reported no relevant financial relationships.

A blood-based liquid biopsy combining cell-free and exosome-bound microRNAs detected early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) with strong overall diagnostic performance, high sensitivity for early stages, and efficacy in patients aged 20-35 years.

""While efforts to improve compliance with endoscopic screening in younger individuals continue, this blood test offers a complementary strategy. It may be a more appealing option for those hesitant about invasive procedures, potentially facilitating and encouraging participation in CRC screening among young adults who might otherwise avoid it,"" the authors write.

This study, led by Alessandro Mannucci, MD, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, California, was published online December 9 in Gastroenterology.

The modest sample size may have led to wide confidence intervals for some stage-specific estimates. The nature of the cohorts made it impossible to evaluate African American patients, a group with high mortality in early-onset CRC. The extracellular vesicle isolation method did not yield pure exosomes, even though it enriched the relevant content for detection.

This study received grants from the US National Cancer Institute, Istituto de Salud Carlos III, Fight Colorectal Cancer, and the Collaborative Group of the Americas on Inherited Gastrointestinal Cancer. The authors acknowledged support from multiple sources including the Zotti Prize, third edition. The authors reported no relevant financial relationships.

In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and a history of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), restarting oral anticoagulants significantly reduced the risk for ischaemic stroke and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) but increased the risk for recurrent ICH and major haemorrhage. No differences were observed in all-cause mortality or cardiovascular death.

""Our findings suggest that resuming oral anticoagulation after ICH may provide net benefit in appropriately selected patients with AF, primarily through the prevention of ischaemic stroke and other thromboembolic events. However, the decision to restart should be individualised, taking into account the underlying ICH phenotype (lobar vs non-lobar), baseline haemorrhagic risk, comorbidities, and the patient's competing ischaemic risk profile,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Nikolaos M. Papageorgiou, Second Department of Neurology, ""Attikon"" University Hospital, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece. It was published online on December 21, 2025, in Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders. 

The study included a small number of trials with modest sample sizes, resulting in imprecise estimates and wide prediction intervals. Variability in study design and follow-up duration contributed to heterogeneity. Follow-up duration varied substantially across studies, ranging from approximately 6 to 24 months, which may have influenced outcome comparability.

This study did not receive any specific funding. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

About 84% of patients receiving peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) in a real-world study did not have immediate allergic reactions during treatment, but factors such as physical activity and sleep deprivation may increase the likelihood of having a reaction that requires treatment with epinephrine.

Clinicians should “continue to educate the patient about how to recognize cofactors and manage anaphylaxis, monitor dietary intake, and adapt protocols for high-risk patients,” the authors of the study wrote.

Flore Amat, MD, PhD, Hôpital Robert-Debré, Paris, France, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on December 17, 2025, in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global. 

This study was limited by its retrospective design, incomplete documentation of immediate allergic reactions, variability in peanut OIT practices across centers, and lack of follow-up beyond 20 months.

Some researchers reported receiving consulting or lecture fees from Aimmune Therapeutics, ALK, Novartis, and Stallergenes Greer.

Researchers in Switzerland have conducted the first systematic study that demonstrated that even small variations in a person's genome can disrupt the therapeutic effects of monoclonal antibodies.

Reporting in the journal Science Translational Medicine, investigators at the University of Basel demonstrated on a broader scale what researchers in Japan first reported in 2014: A single genetic mutation in a gene encoding one complement protein, C5, can block the therapeutic effect of a monoclonal antibody, in this case eculizumab.

“We found that even the smallest possible change in a protein sequence, namely a substitution of one single amino acid, can be sufficient to reduce or completely abolish the binding of a therapeutic monoclonal antibody,” study co-senior author Lukas Jeker, MD, of University Hospital Basel and the University of Basel, Switzerland, told Medscape Medical News. 

“This essentially means that if a target protein happens to contain a mutation exactly where the antibody is supposed to bind, it can no longer bind and loses its ability to block the antigen.”

The researchers retrieved therapeutic antibody sequences from the Therapeutic Structural Antibody Database, which tracks antibody- and nanobody-based therapeutics recognized by the World Health Organization, then used corresponding Protein Data Bank files to link them to isotype-specific profiles. They mapped variants onto available three-dimensional structures of monoclonal antibody antigen complexes along with other computational and experimental analyses to identify variants resistant to specific monoclonal antibodies. 

Among the therapeutic antibodies the study identified that can be neutralized by this genetic canceling is rituximab, one of the seven monoclonal antibodies they selected for a more detailed analysis. They concluded that single nucleotide variants in the gene encoding CD20 in the MS4A1 genomic regioncan affect the binding of B-cell depleting antibodies such as rituximab. The research focused on antibodies mostly used in oncology, immunology, hematology, and neurology.

“For clinicians, the key message is that even highly effective therapies can fail if the patient target is genetically different,” said co-senior author of the study, Rosalba Lepore, PhD, MSc, also at University Hospital Basel and the University of Basel. 

The findings can also be useful in drug development in that it can help identify patients who would otherwise be nonresponsive to the therapy, she added. 

“At this point, the most immediate impact is that physicians should be aware that this can happen,” Jeker said. “It's not something you typically think about when you prescribe an antibody.”

Presently, no specific genetic tests exist to identify these genetic resistances, he said. And currently, if a monoclonal antibody that is supposed to work does not work in a patient, a physician can try an alternative monoclonal antibody targeting the same antigen if one is available, but it is right now mostly an empirical process, Jeker said. 

Their laboratory analysis found that both rituximab and ofatumumab bind to CD20, but the latter binds to variants that are resistant to the former. 

Testing for these variants is not currently practical in the clinic, Lepore said. “However, from a technical standpoint this would require to basically detect the variants, and this can be done by standard sequencing technologies that are widely available,” she said. 

“We still need more evidence that a genetic test can change clinical decision-making and lead to measurable benefits for patients,” Lepore said, “but from a technical point of view, I think we have all the tools available.”

For clinical practice, Jeker said, “you also need some standardization and the approval of the diagnostic test.”

Strengths of the study were its computational analysis along with the experimental validations of the selected antibodies, he said. “Together they make a very strong case.”

The key limitation is that “continuously more variants are being found because more individuals are being sequenced, so this a moving target,” he said. “In fact, we think we underestimated the variants.”

Future prospective clinical trials would be needed to validate the findings in clinical practice, Lepore said. “This is substantial information to establish clinical relevance beyond the experiential validation,” she said of their study. 

It would also be important to integrate these findings with a genetic test's cost effectiveness and measurable clinical benefit, she said. 

Jeker added that he would hope that clinicians would test patients who do not respond to monoclonal antibody therapy for resistant variants. “That could be easily done and that would be great for clinical validation,” he said. 

Jeker and Lepore are cofounders of and hold equity in Cimeio Therapeutics and hold patents and patent applications related to immune cell engineering. Jeker is also a Cimeio board member and reported having financial relationships with Novartis and Kyowa Kirin. Lepore is a consultant for Memo Therapeutics.

 December 31, 2025  

Exposure to common chemicals, particularly a combination of multiple chemicals, was associated with an increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS).

Investigators found that exposure to certain polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs), chemicals widely used in industrial applications and consumer products, was associated with roughly a twofold increased risk of the disease.

“We saw that several individual substances, such as PFOS [perfluorooctane sulfonic acid] and two hydroxylated PCBs, were linked to an increased odds for MS. People with the highest concentrations of PFOS and PCBs had approximately twice as high odds of being diagnosed with MS, compared with those with the lowest concentrations,” lead investigator Kim Kultima, PhD, Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Sweden, said in a release.

The study was published online December 17 in Environment International.

MS is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system. Its onset is influenced by a complex interplay of environmental and genetic factors, with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex carrying the highest genetic susceptibility.

Evidence points to a rise in the prevalence and incidence of autoimmune diseases such as MS, with endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) emerging as potential risk factors. Both PFAS and PCBs are classified as EDCs — synthetic chemicals that can interfere with hormonal and immune signaling.

Also known as “forever chemicals,” PFAS are widely used for their resistance to heat, water, and grease in products such as nonstick cookware, stain-resistant fabrics, food packaging, and firefighting foams. 

PCBs, which were banned in many countries decades ago, were historically used as insulating and cooling agents in electrical equipment and building materials. However, they are still present in the environment and food chain decades later. 

Research has linked PFAS and PCBs to dietary exposure, particularly through drinking water and fish consumption.

The investigators note that previous research has linked PFAS and PCB exposure to a range of immune-related and inflammatory conditions. However, evidence specifically examining their role in MS has been limited and inconsistent, with few large population-based studies and little attention to combined chemical exposure.

To examine the influence of chemical environmental exposure on the development of MS, the investigators analyzed blood from 1800 individuals who had recently been diagnosed with MS to investigate concentrations of these common environmental contaminants.

The study included 907 individuals with MS from the Swedish population-based Epidemiological Investigations of Multiple Sclerosis cohort and 907 randomly selected controls, matched for age (approximately 40 years), sex (about 75% female), and residential area.

Participants completed questionnaires detailing environmental exposures and lifestyle factors. Researchers analyzed serum samples for 24 PFAS compounds and seven HO-PCBs, selected for their environmental relevance, commercial use, and detectability using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, lifestyle factors, and established HLA-associated risk and protective variants, a doubling of serum 4-OH-CB187 concentrations was associated with an 8.5% increase in the odds of MS (odds ratio [OR], 1.085; 95% CI, 1.01-1.168; P = .026). 

Exposure to 3-OH-CB153 was associated with an 8.1% increase in MS odds (OR, 1.081; 95% CI, 1.029-1.137; P = 2.26×10–3), while exposure to PFOS — a common PFAS — was associated with a 10.3% increase (OR, 1.103; 95% CI, 1.007-1.211; P = .037).

When exposure was analyzed by concentration quartiles, higher levels of PFOS, 4-OH-CB187, and 3-OH-CB153 were associated with increased odds of MS. Participants in the highest exposure quartile of 4-OH-CB187 had more than double the odds of MS compared with those in the lowest quartile (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.49-3.59).

Additional analyses showed significant interaction with the HLA allele B*44:02. Although this allele is typically considered protective, each increase in PFOS exposure quartile among carriers was associated with more than a fourfold increase in MS risk.

“This indicated that there is a complex interaction between inheritance and environmental exposure linked to the odds of MS,” Kultima noted.

“We therefore think it is important to understand how environmental contaminants interact with hereditary factors, as this can provide new knowledge about the genesis of MS and could also be relevant for other diseases.”

Although the mechanisms linking these chemicals to MS risk remain unclear, both PFAS and HO-PCBs have been shown to disrupt the blood-brain barrier, potentially facilitating the entry of peripheral immune cells into the central nervous system. In addition, PFAS are thought to modulate immune function by influencing cytokine signaling, redox balance, and antigen-processing pathways. 

The observed mixture effect may reflect the simultaneous amplification of shared biological pathways, the authors wrote, noting that PFAS and HO-PCBs could contribute to MS risk through overlapping effects on immune regulation and neuroinflammation.

The investigators also outlined several study limitations. Exposure was assessed using a single serum sample collected after MS diagnosis, which they said raises the possibility of reverse causality and limits the ability to characterize long-term exposure.

They also noted that because MS likely begins years before clinical symptoms appear, measured exposures may capture only part of a more complex and prolonged disease process. 

The investigators also cautioned that because it was a case-control study, causality cannot be established. They further noted that the predominantly Swedish study population may limit the generalizability of the findings, and that analyses of interactions between chemical exposures and HLA alleles were constrained by limited statistical power, in part because HLA data were missing for about 20% of participants.

The study received support from: the Swedish Research Council, Swedish Society for Medical Research, Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation, NEURO Sweden, Region Uppsala, FORMAS Sweden, Åke Wiberg foundation, Forte Sweden, Swedish Foundation for MS Research, SciLifeLab & Wallenberg Data Driven Life Science Program, Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, and the National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden (NBIS) at SciLifeLab.

Treatment with dupilumab significantly improved outcomes for adults with allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS), based on new data presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (ACAAI) 2025 Annual Meeting.

The new study focused specifically on AFRS, a type of chronic rhinosinusitis for which no previous treatment was approved, said lead investigator Amber U. Luong, MD, professor and vice chair for academic affairs in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at the McGovern Medical School of the University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, in an interview. 

AFRS can cause signs and symptoms not seen in other types of chronic rhinosinusitis, such as thick mucus discharge, bone loss around the sinus cavities, and facial deformities, said Luong. “The data with dupilumab are the first-ever positive phase 3 results specifically in allergic fungal rhinosinusitis,” she said.

Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, inhibits the signaling of the interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-13 pathways. Dupilumab has been approved for a range of other conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic esophagitis, and bullous pemphigoid.

In the phase 3 LIBERTYAFRS-AIMS study, the researchers randomized 62 individuals aged 6 years and older with symptoms of AFRS to dupilumab or a placebo. All adults and adolescents weighing 60 kg or more received 300 mg every 2 weeks. Children and adolescents weighing between 30 kg and 60 kg received 200 mg every 2 weeks, while those weighing between 15 kg and 30 kg received 300 mg every 4 weeks. 

The mean age of the participants was 39.8 years, 27% were female. The primary endpoint was a significant change from baseline in Lund-Mackay CT, a radiological measure of blockage or inflammation in the paranasal sinuses.

After 52 weeks, significantly more patients in the dupilumab group met the primary endpoint, with a least squares mean (LSM) change from baseline of -9.17, compared to -1.81 in the placebo group (P < .0001). 

Patients treated with dupilumab also showed significant improvement compared with placebo patients across secondary endpoints including reductions in nasal polyps and nasal congestion, with LSM differences of -2.77 and -1.40, respectively, between the treatment and placebo groups from baseline to 52 weeks (P < .0001 for both). 

In addition, significantly fewer patients in the dupilumab group were treated with systemic corticosteroids or underwent surgery compared to the placebo group (3% vs 31%).

Overall safety profiles were similar between the dupilumab and placebo groups. The proportion of patients with any treatment-emergent adverse events 69.7% and 78.6%, respectively. However, no treatment-emergent serious adverse events were reported in the dupilumab group, and only two were reported in the placebo group.

The FDA has accepted the supplemental biologics license application for dupilumab in adults and children aged 6 years and older with AFRS for priority review. 

The findings were in line with the researchers' expectations, given dupilumab's approval for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and the shared underlying disease mechanism of both conditions, Luong said. Therefore, “it wasn't surprising to see that inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 with dupilumab resulted in significant improvements in signs and symptoms of disease, across all primary and secondary endpoint measures, compared to placebo,” she said. 

In the absence of approved treatments for AFRS specifically, patients are often managed with surgery followed by oral and/or topical corticosteroids, Luong said. However, disease recurrence can occur, meaning patients might need repeat surgeries or prolonged courses of corticosteroids, she said. “If approved, dupilumab would be the first medicine specifically indicated for AFRS, and it has already shown its potential to reduce key nasal signs and symptoms of disease and lower the risk of systemic corticosteroid use and/or need for surgery in this pivotal trial,” she added. 

The study met all primary and secondary endpoints at trial sites in multiple countries around the world where AFRS is predominant, Luong told Medscape Medical News. Given the relatively small trial size, the real-world impact of dupilumab on the disease will be interesting to understand if the indication is approved, she noted.

The study was supported by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. 

Luong disclosed serving on advisory boards for companies including GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, Amgen, Regeneron and Sanofi. Her institution also receives received research funding associated with participation in clinical trials sponsored by Sanofi, GSK, Eli Lily, and Insmed.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) alone achieves a 69.7% pooled 1- or 2-year systemic therapy-free survival rate across cancer types, with the highest rates seen in renal cell and prostate cancers. The strategy shows a favorable safety profile, with most studies reporting no grade 3 or higher adverse events.

“Our findings suggest that SBRT alone might be associated with substantial systemic therapy-free survival, particularly in prostate and renal cell cancers, with a favorable safety profile,” the study authors wrote. “Randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm outcomes and refine treatment strategies,” they concluded.

The study, led by Jonas Willmann, MD, of University Hospital Zurich in Zurich, Switzerland, was published online in JAMA Network Open.

Most studies were retrospective, and considerable heterogeneity was observed across patient populations, treatment protocols, and criteria for defining oligometastatic disease. Although systemic therapy-free survival was highest for patients with renal cell cancer, no clinical trials have compared SBRT against observation in those patients.

The authors reported various financial relationships outside of the submitted work. A full list of disclosures is available in the original article.

Women experienced worse functional outcomes up to 12 months after a first ischemic stroke compared to men, despite their improvements in activities of daily living (ADLs) from 3 to 6 months, a new study showed. Although both sexes showed improvement in neurologic outcomes, only men had cognitive gains within a year following the stroke.

""Since many people live with physical, cognitive and emotional challenges after stroke, it is important to find ways to improve recovery. Our study provides a better understanding of sex differences during stroke recovery,"" lead author Chen Chen, PhD, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, said in a press release.

The study was published online December 17 in Neurology. 

The study lacked data on the use of rehabilitative services. The analysis also relied on the assumption that data on outcomes were missing at random, which could have influenced the results. The study population primarily consisted of nonimmigrant Mexican American and non-Hispanic White American participants from a single community in south Texas, limiting generalizability. The assessment of cognitive outcomes was restricted to patients who could self-report.

The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health. The investigators reported no relevant financial relationships.

Intestinal Stem Cells (ISCs) derived from a patient's own cells have garnered significant attention as a new alternative for treating intractable intestinal diseases due to their low risk of rejection. However, clinical application has been limited by safety and regulatory issues arising from conventional culture methods that rely on animal-derived components (xenogeneic components). A KAIST research team has developed an advanced culture technology that stably grows ISCs without animal components while simultaneously enhancing their migration to damaged tissues and regenerative capabilities.

KAIST announced on December 23rd that a joint research team—led by Professor Sung Gap Im from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Dr. Tae Geol Lee from the Nano-Bio Measurement Group at the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science and Dr. Mi-Young Son from the Stem Cell Convergence Research Center at the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology has developed a polymer-based culture platform that dramatically improves the migration and regeneration of ISCs in a xenogeneic-free environment.

To overcome obstacles in the clinical application of stem cell therapies—such as the risk of virus transmission to patients when using substances derived from mouse fibroblasts or Matrigel—the joint research team developed ""PLUS"" (Polymer-coated Ultra-stable Surface). This polymer-based culture surface technology functions effectively without any animal-derived materials.

PLUS is a synthetic polymer surface coated via a vapor deposition method. By precisely controlling surface energy and chemical composition, it significantly enhances the adhesion and mass-culture efficiency of ISCs. Notably, it maintains identical culture performance even after being stored at room temperature for three years, securing industrial scalability and storage convenience for stem cell therapeutics.

Through proteomics analysis, the research team identified that the expression of proteins related to cytoskeletal reorganization significantly increased in ISCs cultured on the PLUS environment.

Proteomics Analysis: A method used to simultaneously analyze the types and quantitative changes of all proteins present within a cell or tissue.

Specifically, the team confirmed that increased expression of cytoskeleton-binding and actin-binding proteins leads to a stable restructuring of the internal cellular architecture. This provides the power source for stem cells to move faster and more actively across the substrate.

Real-time observations using holotomography microscopy revealed that ISCs cultured on PLUS exhibited a migration speed approximately twice as fast as those on conventional surfaces. Furthermore, in a damaged tissue model, the cells demonstrated outstanding regenerative performance, repairing more than half of the damage within a single week. This proves that PLUS activates the cytoskeletal activity of stem cells, thereby boosting their practical tissue regeneration capabilities.

The newly developed PLUS culture platform is evaluated as a technology that will significantly enhance the safety, mass production, and clinical feasibility of ISCs derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). By elucidating the mechanism that simultaneously strengthens the survival, migration, and regeneration of stem cells in a xenogeneic-free environment, the team has established a foundation to fundamentally resolve safety, regulatory, and productivity issues in stem cell therapy.

This research provides a synthetic culture platform that eliminates the dependence on xenogeneic components—which has hindered the clinical application of stem cell therapies—while maximizing the migration and regenerative capacity of stem cells. It will serve as a catalyst for a paradigm shift in the field of regenerative medicine.""

Plastic pollution does more than litter landscapes and oceans. According to a new perspective article published in Biocontaminant, viruses living on plastic surfaces may play an underrecognized role in spreading antibiotic resistance, raising concerns for environmental and public health worldwide.

When plastics enter natural environments, they quickly become coated with microbial biofilms known as the plastisphere. These plastic associated communities are already known hotspots for antibiotic resistance genes. The new study highlights that viruses, the most abundant biological entities on Earth, could be key players in moving these resistance genes between microbes.

""Most research has focused on bacteria in the plastisphere, but viruses are everywhere in these communities and interact closely with their hosts,"" said corresponding author Dong Zhu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Our work suggests that plastisphere viruses may act as hidden drivers of antibiotic resistance dissemination.""

Dong Zhu, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Viruses can transfer genetic material between bacteria through a process called horizontal gene transfer. In plastisphere biofilms, where microbes are densely packed, viruses may more easily shuttle resistance genes across species, including to potential pathogens. Some viruses also carry auxiliary metabolic genes that can boost bacterial survival under stressful conditions, such as exposure to antibiotics or pollutants, indirectly favoring resistant microbes.

The authors point out that viral behavior appears to differ between environments. In aquatic plastispheres, viruses are more likely to adopt life strategies that promote gene transfer, potentially increasing resistance risks. In soils, viruses may instead limit resistant bacteria by killing their hosts. These contrasting roles highlight the need to consider environmental context when assessing the risks of plastic pollution.

""This perspective emphasizes that antibiotic resistance linked to plastics cannot be fully understood without including viral ecology,"" said lead author Xue Peng Chen. ""Incorporating viruses into a One Health framework will help us better evaluate the long term consequences of plastic pollution.""

The authors call for future studies to directly measure gene exchange between viruses and bacteria on plastics and to refine methods for detecting virus encoded resistance genes. Such insights could inform environmental monitoring and plastic waste management strategies aimed at reducing antibiotic resistance risks.

Announcing a new publication for Acta Materia Medica journal. Heart failure (HF) remains a major global health challenge with limited therapeutic options, thus prompting the search for novel cardioprotective agents among traditional Chinese medicines.

In this study, screening of 828 herbal extracts in an oxygen glucose deprivation injury H9c2 cardiomyocyte model led to the identification of Euphorbia neriifolia L. extract (JM04) as a promising candidate. JM04 significantly increased cell viability while decreasing lactate dehydrogenase release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in both H9c2 and primary cardiomyocytes. In vivo, JM04 ameliorated cardiac function and attenuated myocardial fibrosis in isoproterenol-induced HF mice, as evidenced by echocardiography and histological analysis.

Network pharmacology and mechanistic studies revealed that JM04 modulated the Nrf2/ROS/HIF-1α axis by exerting free radical scavenging activity, activating the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, restoring mTOR phosphorylation, and enhancing HIF-1α expression, thereby protecting against cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, UPLC-MS/MS identified six active components consistent with network pharmacology predictions, thus highlighting its multicomponent and multitarget nature. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that JM04 exerts potent cardioprotective effects through integrated antioxidant and signaling modulation, and support its further development as a candidate botanical drug for HF intervention.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New computational method reconstructs how cells decide their fate","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251230/New-computational-method-reconstructs-how-cells-decide-their-fate.aspx","Wed, 31 Dec 2025 02:49:00 GMT","

Researchers from Kyushu University have developed an innovative computational method, called ddHodge, that can reconstruct the complex dynamics of how cells decide their fate. As reported in Nature Communications, this approach paves the way for a deeper understanding of the biological processes involved in development, regeneration, and disease.

Understanding how a developing cell chooses its destiny, such as differentiating into a nerve cell or a muscle cell, is a central challenge in biology and medicine. To study these mechanisms, scientists often rely on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)-a technology that reveals which genes are active within individual cells. While powerful, scRNA-seq is destructive, meaning that it can only provide one-time snapshots of cells, but not the evolution of their states over time.

Computational methods like RNA velocity have begun to tackle this limitation by inferring both the immediate future direction of a cell and the ""speed"" at which it advances toward it. However, a cell's state is defined by innumerable genes, placing it in a complex, high-dimensional space. As current techniques cannot accurately represent this full space, they compress it into far fewer dimensions, inevitably losing important information about the data geometry. As a result, it is impossible to consistently assess the stability of a cell state-that is, one cannot distinguish a highly plastic, unstable cell at a branching point from one that is deeply committed and stable.

Against this backdrop, Associate Professor Kazumitsu Maehara from Kyushu University's Faculty of Medical Sciences and Professor Yasuyuki Ohkawa from Kyushu University's Medical Institute of Bioregulation have developed ddHodge, a geometry-preserving method that can more accurately reconstruct cell state dynamics.

My background is in statistical science, and during my graduate training, I was exposed to HodgeRank, a method used in ranking problems such as PageRank. When I later moved into life-science research, I realized that the same mathematical idea could help interpret the complex, high-dimensional transitions in single-cell data.""

Kazumitsu Maehara, Associate Professor, Kyushu University's Faculty of Medical Sciences 

Their technique is based on Hodge decomposition, a powerful mathematical theorem, which they used to break down cells' motion across a landscape of possible states into three fundamental and measurable components. The first is the gradient, which is the overall directional flow across the landscape. The residual contains the curl and the harmonic components, which account for cyclical or rotational flows and can thus reveal repeating processes like the cell cycle.

""ddHodge can be viewed as an effort to adapt techniques and concepts developed in modern mathematical sciences, such as differential geometry and numerical computation, to the practical demands of life science data analysis,"" explains Maehara. The proposed framework utilizes geometric principles to approximate how cell states ""move"" on a lower-dimensional structure while preserving the shape information embedded in high-dimensional data, which is normally lost in standard methods that rely on dimensionality reduction.

When applying ddHodge to scRNA-seq data from approximately 46,000 mouse embryonic cells, the researchers found that over 88% of the gene expression dynamics during early embryonic development could be explained by the gradient component. This substantiated, with real-world data, the long-standing concept in developmental biology that cells differentiate by moving toward stable states and diverging away from ""branching points."" Moreover, by focusing on these unstable points, the researchers were able to identify key genes that drive or maintain cell state stability as cells commit to a lineage.

The researchers also evaluated ddHodge's performance using data simulations, revealing that even when given partial or noisy data, ddHodge was able to reliably reconstruct cell state dynamics, with around 100 times more accuracy than other conventional approaches.

Overall, ddHodge provides a reliable way to identify critical biological moments, such as the exact timing and location of cell fate decisions. ""ddHodge can quantitatively describe, within a high-dimensional space, in which direction, how fast, and how stably cells change. We expect it to contribute broadly to understanding diverse biological phenomena, including embryonic development, tissue regeneration, and cancer progression,"" adds Maehara. This tool could support the early detection of cell states relevant to disease states or regeneration, as well as help scientists analyze large-scale datasets used in pharma and biotech discovery pipelines.

Notably, ddHodge has many potential applications beyond biology and medicine. The researchers believe it could be used to provide insights into other complex processes that change over time, including material degradation, climate patterns, and socioeconomic behavior. Thus, ddHodge exemplifies how concepts from modern mathematics can be used to gain insights into processes and systems that would otherwise be obscured in giant high-dimensional datasets.

Diabetic kidney disease affects a growing proportion of people with diabetes and remains the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Clinically, the condition is marked by persistent proteinuria and a gradual decline in kidney filtration capacity. Current first-line therapies, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, typically slow renal function decline; however, sustained improvement is uncommon, and treatment-related adverse effects may limit long-term use. Increasing evidence suggests that chronic inflammation plays a central role in driving kidney fibrosis and functional loss in diabetes. Based on these challenges, there is a need to explore alternative or complementary treatments that can protect renal function by targeting inflammatory mechanisms.

Researchers from Guang'anmen Hospital of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, together with collaborators from multiple traditional Chinese medicine hospitals across China, reported (DOI: 10.1093/pcmedi/pbaf031) on November 14, 2025, in Precision Clinical Medicine the results of a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial evaluating a traditional Chinese herbal formula for diabetic kidney disease with macroalbuminuria. The 24-week study enrolled 120 patients and compared the therapy with the angiotensin receptor blocker irbesartan, assessing renal outcomes, safety, and symptom improvement. Mechanistic investigations combining proteomics, single-cell transcriptomics, and animal models were conducted to uncover inflammation-related pathways underlying the clinical effects.

The trial showed that both treatments achieved similar reductions in 24-hour urinary protein, a standard marker of kidney damage. However, patients receiving the herbal formulation experienced significantly better preservation of kidney function. Their estimated glomerular filtration rate increased over the treatment period, while it declined in the comparison group, and serum creatinine levels decreased rather than rising. Bayesian statistical analysis further supported a high probability that the herbal therapy provided meaningful renal benefits.

To understand why these differences occurred, the researchers conducted mechanistic studies. Olink inflammation proteomic profiling identified significant reductions in circulating inflammatory mediators, particularly CX3CL1 and MCP-1, following treatment. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of diabetic mouse kidneys revealed that these molecules are predominantly expressed in endothelial, mesangial, and tubular cells—key players in kidney inflammation and fibrosis. Treatment suppressed their expression in specific cell populations, suggesting a cell-type-resolved anti-inflammatory effect.

Animal experiments reinforced these findings. Mice receiving the herbal therapy showed improved renal biochemical markers and reduced structural damage, including less fibrosis and mesangial expansion. Together, the clinical and experimental results indicate that the therapy may protect kidney function by dampening inflammation-driven injury rather than acting solely through hemodynamic control.

""The most striking aspect of this study is the improvement in kidney function, not just stabilization,"" said one of the corresponding investigators. ""Many existing therapies slow decline, but few demonstrate an actual increase in filtration capacity. By integrating clinical trials with molecular and single-cell analyses, we were able to link these functional benefits to specific inflammatory pathways. This systems-level approach strengthens confidence that the observed effects are biologically meaningful and not simply statistical variation.""

If confirmed in longer and larger trials, these findings could expand treatment options for patients with diabetic kidney disease, particularly those who cannot tolerate standard medications or remain at high residual risk. The study highlights inflammation as a viable therapeutic target and suggests that multi-component therapies may exert synergistic effects on complex disease pathways. Beyond this specific formulation, the work provides a framework for integrating traditional medicine with modern clinical trials and omics technologies. Such approaches could accelerate the discovery of complementary therapies aimed at preserving kidney function and improving quality of life for millions of patients worldwide.

Cognitively activating teaching is recognized as an innovative and effective instructional approach, yet it is still underutilized worldwide. These practices require teachers to design challenging tasks, encourage open-ended reasoning, and engage students in active knowledge construction.

In the study led by Bellibaş from the Department of Public Policy, University of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, researchers have analyzed data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) 2018, covering 48 countries and economies. Using multilevel modeling, the findings show that teacher collaboration is a significant predictor of the use of cognitive activation strategies, even after controlling for teacher characteristics and school contexts. Their work was made available online on June 2, 2025, and was published in Volume 8, Issue 4 of journal ECNU Review of Education in November, 2025.

""Such collective endeavors, through positive interactions, could promote innovative teaching strategies and foster their motivation to transform classroom instruction,"" state Bellibaş et al.

The study also identifies the moderating role of collective teacher innovativeness, which can be defined as teachers' shared openness to new ideas and their willingness to experiment with new teaching approaches. In schools where innovativeness is high, the positive impact of collaboration on innovative teaching practices becomes notably stronger. Factors such as school size, location, and socio-economic composition also affect the prevalence of cognitively activating practices, raising equity concerns.

The study highlights the importance of fostering both collaboration and an innovative school climate to improve instructional quality globally. Encouraging collaborative professional cultures and fostering school environments that support innovation may lead to more widespread adoption of high-impact teaching strategies.

""Our findings underscore that simply encouraging collaboration is not enough; we must also actively cultivate an innovative school climate where teachers feel empowered to experiment with new ideas, ultimately leading to a more equitable and widespread adoption of high-impact teaching strategies worldwide,"" emphasize Bellibaş et al.

Children exposed to high levels of screen time before age two showed changes in brain development that were linked to slower decision-making and increased anxiety by their teenage years, according to new research by Asst Prof Tan Ai Peng and her team from A*STAR Institute for Human Development and Potential (A*STAR IHDP) and National University of Singapore (NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, using data from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort.

Published in eBioMedicine, the study tracked the same children over more than a decade, with brain imaging at multiple time points, to map a possible biological pathway from infant screen exposure to adolescent mental health. This is the first paper on screen time to incorporate measures spanning over ten years, highlighting the long-lasting consequences of screen time in infancy.

Importantly, the study focuses on infancy, a period when brain development is most rapid and especially sensitive to environmental influences. Furthermore, the amount and type of screen exposure in infancy are largely determined by parental and caregiver awareness and parenting practices, highlighting a critical window for early guidance and intervention.

The researchers followed 168 children from the GUSTO cohort and conducted brain scans at three time points (ages 4.5, 6, and 7.5). This allowed them to track how brain networks developed over time rather than relying on a single snapshot.

Children with higher infant screen time showed an accelerated maturation of brain networks responsible for visual processing and cognitive control. The researchers suggest this may result from the intense sensory stimulation that screens provide. Notably, screen time measured at ages three and four did not show the same effects, underscoring why infancy is a particularly sensitive period.

Accelerated maturation happens when certain brain networks develop too fast, often in response to adversity or other stimuli. During normal development, brain networks gradually become more specialised over time. However, in children with high screen exposure, the networks controlling vision and cognition specialised faster, before they had developed the efficient connections needed for complex thinking. This can limit flexibility and resilience, leaving the child less able to adapt later in life.""

Dr. Huang Pei, study's first author

This premature specialization came at a cost: children with these altered brain networks took longer to make decisions during a cognitive task at age 8.5, suggesting reduced cognitive efficiency or flexibility. Those with slower decision-making, in turn, reported higher anxiety symptoms at age 13. These findings suggest that screen exposure in infancy may have effects that extend well beyond early childhood, shaping brain development and behavior years later.

In a related study published in Psychological Medicine in 2024, the same team found that infant screen time is also associated with alterations in brain networks that govern emotional regulation - but that parent-child reading could counteract some of these brain changes.

Among children whose parents read to them frequently at age three, the link between infant screen time and altered brain development was significantly weakened. The researchers suggest that shared reading may provide the kind of enriched, interactive experience that passive screen consumption lacks, including back-and-forth engagement, language exposure, and emotional connection.

""This research gives us a biological explanation for why limiting screen time in the first two years is crucial. But it also highlights the importance of parental engagement, showing that parent-child activities, like reading together, can make a real difference,"" said Asst Prof Tan Ai Peng, Principal Investigator at A*STAR IHDP, Clinician-Scientist at NUS, and the study's senior author. The study was conducted in collaboration with researchers from the National University Hospital of Singapore, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, and McGill University. The findings provide an evidence base to guide early childhood policies and parenting practices, contributing to Singapore's efforts to maximize human potential from the earliest stages of life.

Cancer has long remained a leading cause of death worldwide and in Hong Kong, accounting for 30% of all disease-related deaths in the city in 2025. While chemotherapy remains a major treatment modality, its side effects and the risk of relapse challenges for patients. In recent years, Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has emerged by integrating immunology, cell therapy and gene technology, but it shows limited effectiveness against solid tumors, carries the risk of excessive immune responses, and can cost several million Hong Kong dollars per treatment. 

DC therapy separates monocytes from a patient's blood, co-cultures them with tumor antigens in vitro to generate mature dendritic cells, and reinfuses them into the body to stimulate the immune system attack cancer cells. Although DC therapy has milder side effects, its clinical outcomes remain variable and the manufacturing process is laborious and expensive. To address these bottlenecks, the team led by Professor Yung Kin-lam, Chair Professor of Biology and Neuroscience in the Department of Science and Environmental Studies and Associate Vice President (Knowledge Transfer and Sustainability) at EdUHK, developed a natural, non-toxic and highly biocompatible silica nanomatrix. This material safely and efficiently promotes DC maturation, markedly enhances T-cell recognition and killing of cancer cells, and helps to overcome tumor ""camouflage"" to improve targeting precision. Animal studies also show that the new technology can effectively inhibit tumor growth, prolong immune memory and strengthen the durability of the anti-tumor response. 

The study is led by EdUHK in collaboration with The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Baptist University, and Jinan University. The entire DC culture process takes place ex vivo, without relying on the patient's own immune status, thereby ensuring more consistent therapeutic outcomes. This approach is particularly suitable for patients with compromised immunity after chemotherapy. The platform has been designed with standardisation and large-scale manufacturing in mind, which will help lower production costs and accelerate clinical translation. 

Professor Yung noted that the new material has the potential to extend beyond cancer treatment. He explained: ""In the silica nanomatrix, dendritic cells adopt a distinctive Z-shaped morphology that increases their surface contact area, enabling more effective transmission of biophysical signals and setting them apart from conventionally cultured DCs. By harnessing biophysical cues instead of high-risk manipulations, our work offers a safer and more scalable pathway for DC vaccines. In future, we will explore the potential of these novel dendritic cells in systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis, with the aim of opening up new directions for immunomodulatory therapies.""

The research team plans to collaborate with hospitals and laboratories in Hong Kong and Mainland China to further accelerate cell culture protocols, evaluate therapeutic efficacy, and advance clinical research.

In a new study, Christine Agdestein has surveyed several aspects of the postnatal check-up. Agdestein is a specialist in general practice and a general practitioner, and is currently a PhD candidate at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The research project is part of her PhD.

""An important finding is that the majority are satisfied with the 6-week check-up with their GP. This is an important offer for those who have recently given birth. GPs have an important role in postnatal care,"" says Christine Agdestein.

Not much research has been done on the postnatal check-up before, and therefore it is extra rewarding that we can offer new knowledge. These are findings that can quickly be used in improvement work related to postnatal care.""

Christine Agdestein, Norwegian University of Science and Technology

The study was conducted together with four other researchers from NTNU and Nord-Trøndelag Regional Health Authority.

The study shows that satisfaction was strongly linked to being able to talk about the birth experience, that many relevant topics were raised during the consultation and that a gynaecological examination was included.

The topics that were most often considered important or very important:

The most important topics were also discussed most frequently.

Although the offer is perceived as positive and important, many women do not take advantage of the opportunity. The researchers found four main reasons:

Women who did not show up for the follow-up check-up after childbirth thus missed out on an important opportunity for support and health-promoting measures.

""Women with chronic diseases, high-risk pregnancies and complications during childbirth did not participate more often in the follow-up check-up than women with good health and uncomplicated births. This is worrying considering that these women have an increased risk of disease and mortality,"" says Christine Agdestein.

It is important to provide information about the postnatal check-up. In principle, the women should receive information both during pregnancy and from the maternity ward. Only 44 per cent stated that they had received information from the maternity ward.

52 per cent had received information about the service from a midwife in the municipality, and some had received information from their GP. 18 per cent received information from friends and 11 per cent from social media.

""We definitely see room for improvement here,"" says Agdestein. She also takes into account that some of those who have just given birth do not remember all the information that is given. Therefore, it can be important to design written information for the women, Agdestein believes.

It also emerged that 32 per cent of the women did not know that the service is free, which is important to make clear in the information provided.

""The odds of attending increase if you know that the consultation is free,"" the study shows.

A gynaecological examination was high on the list of what the women wanted during the postnatal check-up. Not everyone was offered this. The study shows a strong correlation between satisfaction with the postnatal check-up and having a gynaecological examination.

The women recommended that GPs should offer gynaecological examinations to a greater extent proactively.

""The study showed that some women find it difficult to ask to have their genitals examined. The findings show that it is important that they are offered a gynaecological examination, and then the women can decide for themselves whether they want and need it. Many people may have pain and tears after childbirth, and experience incontinence, so it is important that they are offered a gynaecological examination,"" says Agdestein.

40 per cent of the women responded that talking about mental health is important, and the topic was brought up in as many as 60 per cent of the consultations.

""This may indicate that GPs are focusing on mental health, and that is good. We see from other studies that the prevalence of postpartum depression has increased in Norway in recent years, so mental health is an important topic to talk about at the postnatal check-up,"" Agdestein emphasizes.

Based on the study, Christine Agdestein is working on a follow-up project, together with several of those who worked on the first study. The follow-up is specifically about tools to improve postnatal control.

""We have developed a tool and a prototype that is ready for testing. It is a tool that will be used by GPs and women in collaboration,"" says Christine Agdestein.

It will provide good information to the women about which topics can be addressed during the 6-week check-up and help the woman to prioritise what is most important to her. In this way, the GP can adapt the check-up to each individual.

""With this measure, we hope to improve both information and quality, which in turn can contribute to increased attendance and better benefit from the postnatal check-up.

""I started looking into this because, as a GP, I have followed up many women throughout pregnancy and the postnatal period. Then I saw that there was a great need for knowledge about postnatal care in the primary health service. I have gone from clinical practice, to research and now to improving practice,"" says Christine Agdestein.

The study was conducted as a questionnaire survey where the target group was all women who gave birth in Nord-Trøndelag Regional Health Authority for one year. 1119 women were in the target group, and 351 responded.

""The age, education and number of births for those who responded are comparable to women who gave birth in Norway in the same year. Thus, the results are also relevant in the rest of the country,"" says Agdestein.

She summarises that the most important findings are that one in four do not show up, that there is a need for better information, that it is important that the consultation covers many and relevant topics, including the experience of childbirth, and that the women should be offered a gynaecological examination.

""Our survey includes insight into the content of the consultations, and an analysis of the factors that affect whether the women are satisfied or not. This means that professionals can quickly address the findings to improve the service,"" concludes Christine Agdestein.

A recent study published in Engineering has unveiled a novel approach to generating functional organoids from human adult adipose tissue. This method, which bypasses traditional stem cell isolation and genetic manipulation, offers a more straightforward and scalable pathway for creating organoids that can be used in regenerative medicine and disease modeling.

The research, led by a team from the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine and the Shanghai Institute for Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, demonstrates the potential of human adult adipose tissue to differentiate into organoids representing all three germ layers - mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm - without the need for single-cell processing. By employing a specialized suspension culture system, the team developed reaggregated microfat (RMF) tissues that could differentiate into various functional organoids.One of the key findings of the study is the generation of humanized bone marrow organoids from RMF tissues. These organoids were able to support human hematopoiesis in immunodeficient mice, mimicking the structural and functional complexity of native human bone marrow. The researchers found that RMF pellets, when implanted into mice, underwent endochondral ossification, forming ossicles that contained both endosteal and perivascular niches. These ossicles supported the engraftment and differentiation of human hematopoietic stem cells, demonstrating their potential as a model for studying human hematopoiesis.In addition to bone marrow organoids, the study also explored the differentiation of RMF tissues into insulin-producing islet organoids. Using a refined four-stage protocol, the researchers guided RMF cells through definitive endoderm, pancreatic progenitor, endocrine progenitor, and β-cell stages. The resulting islet organoids were capable of secreting insulin in response to glucose stimulation, with a significant increase in insulin secretion under high-glucose conditions. When transplanted into diabetic mice, these organoids rapidly vascularized and reversed hyperglycemia, maintaining normal blood glucose levels for the duration of the study.The researchers also demonstrated the ectodermal differentiation potential of RMF tissues by generating neural-like tissues. RMF pellets were induced to form neurospheres, which then differentiated into neuronal and neuroglial lineages. The cells expressed markers for neural stem cells, mature neurons, and glial cells, indicating the successful conversion of adipose tissue into neural-like tissues.This study highlights the versatility and potential of human adult adipose tissue as a source for organoid generation. By avoiding complex cell isolation and genetic manipulation, the RMF-based strategy offers a more practical and clinically relevant approach to creating functional organoids. The findings suggest that adipose tissue could serve as a valuable resource for developing therapeutic applications in regenerative medicine, particularly for conditions such as diabetes and hematological disorders.The research underscores the importance of exploring alternative sources for organoid generation, especially those that can be easily accessed and processed. As the field of regenerative medicine continues to advance, the ability to generate functional organoids from readily available tissues like adipose tissue could pave the way for more efficient and accessible treatments.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New insights into the global expansion of Candida auris","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251230/New-insights-into-the-global-expansion-of-Candida-auris.aspx","Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:25:00 GMT","

The fungal species Candida auris is spreading across the globe, and gaining in virulence, according to a new review by a Hackensack Meridian Center for Discovery and Innovation (CDI) scientist and colleagues. 

But there are strategies available and underway to combat the invasive and drug resistant germ, according to the new review in the American Society of Microbiology journal Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews. 

The paper summarizes and analyzes the latest developments - and needs - in mycology in 2025. Neeraj Chauhan, Ph.D., of the CDI is co-author with: Anuradha Chowdhary, Ph.D., of the Medical Mycology Unit at the Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute at the University of Delhi, who is a global leader in identifying and combating fungal threats, and was one of the first scientists to identify C. auris as a major public health threat in India in 2014. She is also a visiting researcher at the CDI; and Michail Lionakis. M.D., Sc.D., who is chief of the clinical mycology program at the National Institutes of Health, and a physician-scientist who is one of the foremost fungal immunologists globally. 

Together, the trio find: 

Invasive fungal infections affect approximately 6.5 million people per year, with high mortality rates.

C. auris was first identified as a distinct species in 2009 in a sample from an ear of a patient in Japan, and has been spreading ever since. 

Theories often contend that the appearance and spread of C. auris is driven, at least in part, by climate change. 

The cell wall of C. auris is a unique adaptation compared to other fungal cousins, and its sugar-dense structure gives it advantages in drug resistance and host interactions. 

C. auris has also developed wily cellular strategies to survive, including morphogenesis in its ability to switch from yeast growth to filament-driven spread, as well as forming multicellular aggregates, and also switching its phenotypic genetic expression in response to its changing environment.

The fungus is also extremely successful in colonizing human skin, with the molecular evidence showing so far that the proteins of the cell wall attach like a kind of glue to mammalian cells - and even non-living surfaces. 

The host develops mechanisms to battle C. auris, but the science so far indicates the germ can develop proactive ways to evade the immune response. Yet new vaccination and treatment strategies are possible.

Four classes of antifungal drugs are currently available, with varying degrees of efficacy since they were developed in the latter half of the 20th century. 

Three new drugs are currently in trials or newly approved and in the pipeline for treatments relatively soon. 

Diagnostics still remain a challenge, since most conventional lab tests lead to misidentification as other related yeasts, which delays and complicates treatment. 

But awareness of the burden of this relatively-new scourge is growing - and research is now proliferating to catch up to clinical needs. 

""Taken together, these data underscore the need to develop novel antifungal agents with broad-spectrum activity against human fungal pathogens, to improve diagnostic tests, and to develop immune- and vaccine- based adjunct modalities for the treatment of high-risk patients,"" they write. ""In addition, future efforts should focus on raising awareness about fungal disease through developing better surveillance mechanisms, especially in resource-poor countries.

""All these developments should help improve the outcomes and prognosis of patients afflicted by opportunistic fungal infections,"" the authors conclude.

A recent study published in Engineering has shed light on the potential therapeutic effects of dihydrotanshinone I (DHT), a compound derived from the traditional Chinese herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, on ovarian cancer. The research, conducted by a team from Zhejiang Chinese Medical University and Jiangsu Normal University, reveals that DHT can induce autophagic cell death in ovarian cancer cells by disrupting the sortilin 1 (SORT1)-mediated autophagy-lysosome pathway.

Ovarian cancer is one of the deadliest malignancies affecting women, with the highest mortality rate among gynecological cancers. A distinguishing feature of ovarian cancer cells is their reduced autophagic flux compared to normal cells. This suggests that excessive autophagy activation or impaired autophagosome-lysosome fusion could lead to cancer cell death. The study investigated the effects of DHT on ovarian cancer cells, uncovering its mechanism of action through proteomic analysis and in vivo experiments.The researchers found that DHT suppressed ovarian cancer growth by targeting SORT1, a protein involved in the autophagy-lysosome pathway. In vitro experiments demonstrated that DHT promoted the formation of autophagosomes, indicated by the increased expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II), while inhibiting the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. This disruption in the autophagic flux led to the accumulation of autophagosomes and ultimately induced autophagic cell death in ovarian cancer cells.To validate these findings, the researchers utilized an orthotopic ovarian cancer model in mice. The results showed that DHT treatment significantly reduced tumor growth and weight, corroborating the in vitro observations. Additionally, DHT was found to decrease SORT1 expression in tumors, further supporting its role in disrupting the autophagy-lysosome pathway.The study also explored the interaction between DHT and SORT1. Co-immunoprecipitation and cellular thermal shift assays revealed that DHT directly targeted SORT1, promoting its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This degradation of SORT1 led to the release of autophagy-related proteins ATG5 and ATG16L1, which enhanced autophagosome formation and disrupted the autophagic flux.SORT1, encoded by the SORT1 gene, is primarily located on the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomal membranes, where it is involved in protein transport to lysosomes. Previous studies have shown that SORT1 mediates ovarian cancer progression by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. High SORT1 expression has been detected in over 75% of clinical ovarian tumor samples, making it a promising therapeutic target.The findings of this study highlight the potential of DHT as a novel therapeutic agent for ovarian cancer. By targeting SORT1 and disrupting the autophagy-lysosome pathway, DHT induces autophagic cell death, offering a new strategy for the treatment of this deadly disease. Future research may focus on further elucidating the underlying mechanisms and exploring the clinical applications of DHT in ovarian cancer therapy.

Despite major therapeutic advances, breast cancer remains prone to recurrence, particularly in patients with early-stage disease who appear disease-free after treatment. Follow-up care still relies largely on imaging and serum markers, tools that struggle to detect microscopic disease. Tissue biopsies provide valuable information but are invasive and cannot be repeated frequently, nor can they track tumor evolution over time. As a result, clinicians are often alerted to relapse only after metastases are established. These gaps have driven interest in liquid biopsy technologies that can monitor cancer at the molecular level through a simple blood draw. Based on these challenges, there is a pressing need to develop minimal residual disease (MRD)-based strategies that enable earlier, more precise monitoring of breast cancer recurrence.

In the review published (DOI: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2025.0431)online on November 28, 2025, researchers from the Cancer Hospital of China Medical University and the Cancer Hospital of Dalian University of Technology examine how minimal residual disease detection is reshaping breast cancer management. Published in Cancer Biology & Medicine, the article brings together clinical evidence, technological advances, and biological insights to show how ctDNA-based MRD testing can detect residual disease, anticipate relapse, and guide treatment decisions. The review positions MRD monitoring as a key step toward more adaptive, precision-oriented breast cancer care.

The review outlines two major ctDNA-based MRD detection strategies. Tumor-informed approaches analyze a patient's original tumor to design personalized assays capable of detecting ctDNA at extremely low levels, sometimes down to parts per million. These methods offer high specificity and allow clinicians to follow tumor evolution and emerging resistance. Tumor-agnostic approaches, which rely on fixed gene or methylation panels, trade some sensitivity for speed, standardization, and broader accessibility.

Across multiple clinical studies, ctDNA positivity after surgery consistently signals a dramatically higher risk of recurrence and shorter survival. In many cases, molecular relapse is detected 8 to 15 months before radiographic evidence appears. In the neoadjuvant setting, ctDNA dynamics closely track treatment response: early clearance predicts favorable outcomes, while persistent detection suggests resistance. Importantly, recent trials show that MRD-guided treatment adjustments—such as switching endocrine therapies or intensifying targeted regimens—can significantly extend progression-free survival. Together, these findings support MRD not just as a prognostic marker, but as an active decision-making tool that bridges the gap between standard treatment protocols and individualized care.

According to the authors, MRD detection fundamentally changes how clinicians think about relapse risk. ""ctDNA allows us to detect cancer activity that imaging simply cannot capture,"" they explain. By revealing molecular relapse early, MRD monitoring opens a critical window for intervention, when disease burden is still low. At the same time, the authors stress the importance of careful implementation, noting that assay standardization, optimal thresholds, and appropriate testing intervals must be clearly defined to avoid over- or under-treatment.

Looking ahead, MRD-guided monitoring could redefine post-treatment care in breast cancer. Patients with persistent ctDNA may be candidates for early therapeutic escalation, while those who remain MRD-negative could safely avoid unnecessary toxicity. Beyond clinical practice, MRD offers powerful advantages for drug development and clinical trials by identifying high-risk populations and enabling earlier outcome assessment. As technologies mature and costs decline, ctDNA-based MRD testing is expected to move from specialized settings into routine care, shifting breast cancer management from delayed detection toward timely, precision-driven intervention.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Immune cell energy metabolism shapes the progression of atherosclerosis","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251230/Immune-cell-energy-metabolism-shapes-the-progression-of-atherosclerosis.aspx","Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:33:00 GMT","

Two complementary studies reveal how an insufficient supply of energy in macrophages, key immune cells in artery walls, drives the progression of atherosclerosis - and how this knowledge could lead to better diagnostics and future therapies. The University of Eastern Finland was centrally involved in both studies.

Atherosclerosis - the buildup of fatty plaques inside arteries - is the leading cause of heart attacks and strokes worldwide. Although the role of cholesterol in plaque formation has long been a central focus, scientists increasingly recognise that the immune system plays a decisive role in determining whether plaques remain stable or become unstable and thus prone to rupture, which can lead to heart attacks or strokes.

In the two newly published studies, an international team of researchers showed that poor availability of the amino acid glutamine in macrophages can determine the worsening of artery plaques. The researchers also identified new ways to detect dangerous plaques.

Macrophages are the body's clean-up crew. Inside artery plaques, they ingest fats, remove dying cells and help repair damaged tissue. But to perform these protective tasks, macrophages require energy.

In the first study, published in Nature Metabolism, the researchers discovered that macrophages rely heavily on glutamine uptake from their environment to fuel their restorative functions. A specific transporter protein, SLC7A7, acts as a gateway that allows glutamine to enter the cell. When this gateway is blocked, macrophages lose energy and perform poorly, resulting in plaques that are larger and more unstable, which is a known risk factor for heart attacks and strokes in people.

Reduced activity of this pathway was linked to more dangerous plaque features also in human artery samples.

These findings suggest that restoring or supporting macrophage metabolism could one day help stabilise plaques and prevent heart attacks or strokes.""

Professor Minna Kaikkonen-Määttä, University of Eastern Finland

The second study, published in Cardiovascular Research, builds on this biological insight and moves toward the clinic. By studying macrophages with advanced single-cell technologies, the researchers identified protein markers such as TREM2, FOLR2 and SLC7A7 that highlight high-risk plaques.

Based on these markers, PET imaging could be used to detect inflammatory plaque activity rather than just the size of the plaques.

The researchers also found that soluble TREM2 in the blood may help distinguish between stable and symptomatic plaques, raising the possibility of a future blood test to identify patients at highest risk.

The research reflects close international collaboration, with the University of Barcelona contributing to both studies, among others. The first study was led by Université Côte d'Azur, while the second was co-led by the University of Turku.

A new research paper was published in Volume 17, Issue 11 of Aging-US on November 26, 2025, titled ""Epigenetic aging signatures and age prediction in human skeletal muscle.""

In this study, first author Soo-Bin Yang and corresponding author Hwan Young Lee from Seoul National University College of Medicine investigated how DNA methylation patterns in skeletal muscle change with age. Their findings offer a new and highly accurate method for estimating a person's age, with potential applications in forensic science and aging research.

Skeletal muscle is essential for movement, energy balance, and physical strength, functions that become more important to monitor as people age. This study improves our understanding of how muscle tissue changes over time at the molecular level. Unlike previous research, which mainly analyzed living individuals of European descent, this study used postmortem samples from an Asian population.

""We analyzed DNA methylation profiles from 103 pectoralis major muscle samples from autopsies of South Korean individuals (18–85 years) using the Infinium EPIC array.""

The researchers analyzed DNA from over 100 pectoralis major muscle samples taken from individuals aged 18 to 85. They identified 20 DNA methylation sites, called CpGs, that were strongly associated with age. These CpGs were found in genes involved in muscle function, stress response, metabolism, and age-related diseases. Using these markers, the team built two machine learning models to predict age: one using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and another using Single Base Extension (SBE). Both models were highly accurate, with average prediction errors between 3.8 and 5.5 years.

The new ""epigenetic clocks"" outperformed existing age-prediction models designed for other tissue types. However, when applied to cardiac and uterine muscle, these models showed much lower accuracy, reinforcing the need for tissue-specific approaches in molecular age estimation.

Beyond predicting age, the study also provides insight into how DNA methylation may affect muscle aging. Several of the identified CpGs were located in regions that regulate gene expression, being associated with a reduction of it in older muscle samples. Some of the affected genes are associated with sarcopenia, an age-related loss of muscle mass and strength.

Overall, this study introduces two reliable and cost-effective methods to estimate age from skeletal muscle, even when the DNA is partially degraded, making it especially useful in forensic settings. It also offers a path forward for developing future therapies that may slow age-related muscle decline and highlights how skeletal muscle aging can differ depending on population, tissue type, and anatomical location.

A recent study published in Engineering has shed new light on the role of the protein NSUN2 in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. The research, conducted by a team from Harbin Medical University, reveals that NSUN2, a member of the NOL1/NOP2/Sun domain family, significantly contributes to pathological cardiac hypertrophy by activating the LARP1-GATA4 axis, potentially offering a novel therapeutic target for heart failure.

The study began with the observation that NSUN2 expression levels were significantly elevated in both human hearts with heart failure (HF) and in mouse hearts subjected to hypertrophy induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and angiotensin II (Ang II) treatment. This finding prompted the researchers to investigate the specific function of NSUN2 in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Through a series of experiments involving cardiomyocyte-specific knockout and overexpression of NSUN2, the team discovered that NSUN2 plays a crucial role in regulating cardiac function and structure.In their experiments, the researchers found that cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of NSUN2 attenuated the reduced cardiac ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) observed in TAC-treated mice, while also reducing heart weight to tibial length (HW/TL) ratios. Conversely, cardiac-specific overexpression of NSUN2 led to pronounced cardiac remodeling, characterized by increased hypertrophic growth, cardiac fibrosis, and a significant decline in EF and FS. These results highlight the detrimental effects of NSUN2 overexpression on cardiac function and structure.Mechanistically, the study revealed that NSUN2 induces 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modification of La-related protein 1 (LARP1), thereby enhancing its mRNA stability. This process is mediated by Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1). The stabilized LARP1 then interacts with GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) mRNA, preventing its degradation and ultimately promoting a pro-hypertrophic phenotype. To validate this pathway, the researchers conducted RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays and found that LARP1 directly binds to GATA4 mRNA, protecting it from degradation.Further supporting this mechanism, the researchers demonstrated that silencing LARP1 partially attenuated TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Similarly, in mice with NSUN2 overexpression, knockdown of LARP1 significantly reduced the hypertrophic response, as evidenced by decreased expression of hypertrophic markers such as ANP and BNP. These findings underscore the importance of the NSUN2/LARP1/GATA4 axis in mediating cardiac hypertrophy.The study also explored the broader implications of NSUN2 regulation in cardiac health. By analyzing RNA sequencing data, the researchers identified numerous genes with altered expression in response to NSUN2 activity, many of which are involved in pathways related to cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. This comprehensive analysis provides a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying NSUN2's effects on cardiac function.The research published in Engineering offers valuable insights into the role of NSUN2 in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. By elucidating the NSUN2/LARP1/GATA4 axis, the study not only advances our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of these conditions but also highlights NSUN2 as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of heart failure. Future research may focus on exploring the therapeutic potential of targeting NSUN2 and its downstream pathways to mitigate cardiac hypertrophy and improve cardiac function.

Home » FIFA President Defends Ticket Prices for World Cup, Claming 150 Million Ticket Requests

FIFA President Gianni Infantino is pushing back against mounting criticism of the organization's World Cup 2026 ticket prices, arguing that record-setting demand validates FIFA's approach — even as fans and supporter groups continue to call the prices “extortionate” and out of reach for ordinary attendees.

Speaking Monday at the World Sports Summit in Dubai, Infantino said FIFA has already received more than 150 million ticket requests during the current ticketing phase, which runs through January 13, 2026. He framed that number as evidence of unprecedented interest in the first expanded 48-team World Cup, which will be staged across the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

“In the last few days, you have probably seen there is a lot of debate about ticketing and ticket prices,” Infantino said, before describing the volume of applications as “absolutely crazy” — a comment that underscores FIFA's central argument: demand is so high that the market will bear it.

Infantino also repeated FIFA's longstanding messaging that World Cup revenues are redistributed to support soccer development worldwide. “There is football because [of] and thanks to these revenues we generate with and from the World Cup, which we reinvest, of course, all over the world,” he said in Dubai.

The remarks are the first major public defense of ticket pricing from FIFA leadership since the latest application window opened in early December, triggering backlash as fans began sharing examples of steep face-value pricing for marquee games. According to published pricing details and prior reports, ticket prices have ranged from relatively lower-cost early-round options to several thousand dollars for premium matches — with the cheapest seats for the final reportedly priced in the four-figure range in some tiers, drawing sharp criticism from supporter organizations and media outlets.

FIFA has also pointed to affordability measures — including the introduction of a limited “supporter” ticket tier — after facing criticism over the sticker shock. But those lower-cost seats represent only a small slice of the overall inventory, leaving much of the public debate focused on the prices attached to high-demand games and later rounds.

While FIFA emphasizes record demand on the primary side, new data from Ticket Club's secondary marketplace points to a familiar pattern: a sharp surge immediately after the matchups and schedule dropped, followed by a gradual repricing as early seller optimism meets real buyer behavior.

According to Ticket Club's latest market snapshot, the overall average ticket price across all matches moved from $3,190 (Dec. 8) to $4,994 (Dec. 11), then eased to $3,805 (Dec. 17) and $3,697 (Dec. 30). In Ticket Club's framing, that represents a short-lived “FOMO tax” right after the announcement, with prices drifting lower as the initial frenzy fades — though the market remains meaningfully higher than it was on day one of matchup week.

Breaking the market out by round, Ticket Club's data suggests the Group Stage has stabilized relative to the early spike, while knockout rounds remain more volatile as sellers “test ceilings” for the later, higher-stakes matches:

Ticket Club also highlighted a continuing “host premium” for Group Stage matches featuring Mexico, the United States, or Canada — though that premium narrowed in late December. As of Dec. 30, Ticket Club data showed Group Stage games featuring host nations averaging $4,695 versus $2,443 for non-host matchups, roughly a 1.9× premium by their measurement.

Examples cited by Ticket Club include three openers priced well above the broader Group Stage average: Mexico vs. South Africa in Mexico City at $10,109, Canada vs. Playoff A in Toronto at $6,705, and United States vs. Paraguay in Inglewood at $6,531.

On the city level, Ticket Club's Dec. 30 snapshot showed Mexico City as the most expensive Group Stage market (average $5,443), while Monterrey ($1,851), Atlanta ($1,905), and Kansas City ($1,962) stood out as comparatively lower-priced “value hubs.”

The takeaway: even with record demand on the primary side, the early secondary market appears to be normalizing from its initial spike — not collapsing, but settling as sellers and buyers recalibrate after matchup week. With FIFA's current ticketing phase open until Jan. 13, and additional sales windows expected to follow, both primary and secondary pricing are likely to remain fluid as inventory, allocations, and fan expectations continue to shift.

MISSOURI (KOAM) -- The State of Missouri receives a $14.24 million grant to help strengthen security for FIFA World Cup events in Kansas City.

“As we plan with our local partners in Kansas City, we are taking into account every potential threat related to World Cup matches and other FIFA-related events,” said Department of Public Safety Director Mark James. “This includes being prepared for potential threats from hostile actors who utilize technology, including unmanned aircraft systems. The 2026 World Cup is a global event, and we will be fully prepared to detect and respond accordingly.”   

According to the Missouri Department of Public Safety, the funding is through the Federal Emergency Management Agency's new Counter Unmanned Aircraft Systems Grant Program.

All 11 states hosting or supporting FIFA World Cup matches in 2026 are receiving the grant.

States can use the grants to strengthen their ability to detect, identify, track, or mitigate drones.

“Kansas City will be one of the most exciting destinations in the world for soccer fans next year, and the State of Missouri is working with local officials and law enforcement partners to ensure visitors and residents are safe and secure at FIFA matches, Fan Festival, and all related events,” Governor Mike Kehoe said. “We appreciate the Trump Administration and FEMA acting swiftly to award this counter-drone funding, which will further strengthen our coordinated state and local security measures and represents a long-term investment in the security of the region.”

Kansas City is scheduled to host a total of six World Cup matches from June 16 through July 11.

Manchester City are reportedly in talks over the £30 million ($40m) loan-to-buy sale of Oscar Bobb as Pep Guardiola gears up to welcome Antoine Semenyo to the Etihad. City and Bournemouth have held constructive negotiations over the structure of Semenyo's £65m transfer, with all sides confident that the framework of the deal is now in place. The Ghana international has already given verbal approval to the switch, with formal steps set to begin once the January window opens on New Year's Day.

Despite the transfer edging closer, Semenyo played the full 90 minutes of Bournemouth's 2-2 draw with Chelsea in the Premier League on Tuesday night. That could mark his final appearance for the Cherries, bringing down the curtain on a spell that has elevated him into one of the division's most sought-after forwards. Club sources indicate the sale could be concluded within 48 hours, prompting recruitment staff to accelerate contingency planning in attack.

While Semenyo's arrival would add depth to Guardiola's front line, it also sharpens competition in areas where minutes are already scarce. Bobb is the clearest example of a player squeezed by City's abundance of attacking talent. The 22-year-old enjoyed a breakout start to last season before suffering a leg fracture that stalled his momentum. Subsequent setbacks have left him struggling to reassert himself, and there is a growing acceptance that regular football elsewhere may be essential for his development.

According to The Daily Mail,Borussia Dortmund currently lead the race, with talks progressing over a loan until the end of the campaign that would include an option to buy for around £30m. Sevilla and Atletico Madrid are also tracking the situation, while Premier League sides such as Crystal Palace and Bournemouth have made enquiries. Newcastle United are monitoring developments from a distance.

In other attacking positions, Omar Marmoush has seen his opportunities diminish as Guardiola has stepped back from deploying him on the left flank. The Egypt international is currently away at the Africa Cup of Nations, and while his role has reduced, City maintain that he remains part of their plans. Similarly, speculation around Savinho has been played down. The Brazilian recently committed his future to City after rejecting interest from Tottenham Hotspur in the summer. Guardiola has praised Savinho's improved defensive work rate, underlining why the club are unwilling to entertain offers unless something extraordinary materialises.

At Bournemouth, the impending loss of Semenyo has been met with regret rather than surprise. Head coach Andoni Iraola had been vocal about his hope to keep the forward for as long as possible. However, he acknowledged that circumstances were beyond his control. 

Last week, the Spaniard said: ""The more games Antoine can play for us, [the better]. If he can play years for us, it's much better! If it cannot be years, it can be months. If he can only play weeks, it is weeks but the more time he plays with us, the better for us. Antoine's situation is quite clear. Antoine is a massive player for us. Obviously, I don't want to lose him, but there are some situations that are not under my control.""

With Semenyo's exit looming, Bournemouth have begun exploring replacements and are reportedly keen on Brennan Johnson of Tottenham. Predominantly a winger but comfortable across the front line, Johnson's adaptability fits Iraola's tactical demands and he has emerged as a serious option, though Crystal Palace are thought to be leading the race for his services.

Liverpool host Leeds United on Thursday, less than a month since their last meeting at Elland Road. An awful lot has changed in the interim, though. Back on December 6, it appeared as if the wheels had well and truly come off Liverpool's season, with Mohamed Salah sensationally accusing Arne Slot of throwing him under the boss by once again benching him for a 3-3 draw that saw the Reds twice throw away the lead with more woeful defending from Ibrahima Konate & Co.

The result left the reigning Premier League champions 10th in the table, with just two wins from their preceding 10 games, meaning Slot's position had become a topic of widespread debate just six months after leading Liverpool to the title in his first season in charge.

Now, though, the seemingly resurgent Reds climbed to fourth after three consecutive victories, over Brighton, Tottenham and Wolves, while Slot de-escalated the Salah situation by welcoming the Egyptian back into the squad before he headed off on Africa Cup of Nations duty.

However, given the underwhelming nature of Liverpool's performances in their winning streak, it seems pertinent to ask, is Slot's side actually improving - or are they still flattering to deceive?

There are undeniable grounds for optimism around Anfield as Liverpool prepare to welcome in the New Year - not least because several of their summer signings are showing signs of belatedly settling into their new surroundings.

Sadly, their most expensive acquisition, Alexander Isak, is out of action until at least March with a broken leg sustained while scoring his second league goal for the club, and in light of his previous struggles to get himself match fit, the striker's debut season on Merseyside is already looking like a write-off.

Luckily for Liverpool, Hugo Ekitike hasn't just proven an excellent alternative to Isak; he's looked like the superior striker. Granted, the Reds recruitment team expected the former Eintracht Frankfurt forward to be good - just not this quickly. Only Erling Haaland had scored more non-penalty goals in this season's Premier League than Ekitike (eight) after 18 rounds of matches, with the France international having struck five times in his last four games.

The 23-year-old is clearly benefiting from a run of starts and his increased fitness levels - which Slot spoke about at length last week - have also allowed Ekitike to exert greater influence over Liverpool's play, as so thrillingly underlined by his fantastic assist for Florian Wirtz in Saturday's 2-1 win over Wolves:

Wirtz's goal was obviously his first since arriving at Anfield during the summer for an initial £100 million, and his relief was there for all to see as he wheeled away to celebrate.

It was also just reward for an outstanding individual display in which he constantly bamboozled the Wolves backline with his intelligent movement and fast feet, prompting former Liverpool striker John Aldridge to compare the diminutive German to the great Peter Beardsley.

Clearly, the weakness of the opposition cannot be overlooked, but it was the kind of decisive and dynamic display that had been coming. As Slot has been at pains to point out, Wirtz has actually been performing at a high level for some time now, looking more and more like his Bayer Leverkusen self with each passing game.

Again, part of the reason for that is the work being done in the gym, with the little bit of extra muscle Wirtz has put on since the start of the season aiding his adjustment to the rigours of English football.

""I know it's the hardest league in the world and I just have to get used to the physicality and the players around me on the pitch in the midfield,"" he told BBC Sport on Saturday. ""But every game I feel a bit better and I want to continue feeling like that.""

Jeremie Frimpong has had even more physical problems than Wirtz, with the Dutchman forced to sit out 14 of his first 27 games as a Liverpool player because of two separate hamstring issues, thus robbing him of any chance to build up some serious momentum since his own summer switch from Leverkusen. Just like Wirtz, though, Frimpong is finally primed to replicate the form that made him the scourge of defenders in the Bundesliga.

The versatile right-back has only 120 minutes since returning from injury, but has contributed two assists in that time, and when asked what Frimpong adds to Liverpool side after watching him set-up Ryan Gravenberch's opener against Wolves with a burst to the byline and a clever cut-back, Slot replied, ""Pace - that's what he has and that's so important in modern-day football.

""Because to create something against a low-block, teams that defend with so many players, usually teams break this down with set-pieces, but now that's not our biggest strength, so to have him available with his pace... [look at] the first goal we scored [against Wolves]: it was pure individual ability, [the kind of] pace I always wanted to bring in during the summer.""

Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting

Of course, Slot saying that set-pieces are not Liverpool's ""biggest strength"" is putting it very mildly. They're actually their biggest weakness - which is a major, major problem in a league where more than a quarter of the goals scored are now coming from non-penalty dead-ball situations (28.6 per cent). It's certainly no coincidence that Arsenal, the team with the best set-piece goal difference (+9) are also top of the table.

Nor is it an exaggeration to say that Liverpool's incessant set-piece struggles are the main reason why their title defence is already over before January, because of the 26 league goals they've shipped so far this season, 12 have come from corners (seven), long throws (two) and free-kicks (two) - which amounts to a frankly ridiculous 46%. It's a staggering statistic and one that nobody could have seen coming when one considers that Liverpool didn't concede once from a dead-ball delivery during the first half of the 2024-25 campaign. 

So, what's going wrong? After all, the Reds haven't significantly changed their approach to defending set-pieces, and, as Virgil van Dijk has pointed out, it's not a case of the Dutchman and his fellow defenders consistently being beaten in the air. On the contrary, Liverpool have won a greater share of their aerial challenges this season than any of their Premier League rivals (57.2%).

What Liverpool are no longer doing, though, is properly clearly their lines or reacting quickly enough to loose balls. ""It's something we have to improve,"" Van Dijk said on Saturday. ""I would say at least 75% of the time or even more, it's not even about the first contact. It's the second phase that is the killer.

""We have defended so many set-pieces very well. But the fact is we've conceded too many and we don't score enough."" Indeed, Liverpool have netted just three times from dead-ball deliveries, making for a minus-nine differential - the worst in the Premier League.

With all of that in mind, it's easy to understand why the club parted company with set-piece coach Aaron Briggs on Tuesday - because there had been no discernible evidence of improvement, even during their run of seven games without defeat in all competitions, with Liverpool conceding from corners in three of their past four outings.

It's difficult not to feel some degree of sympathy for Briggs, though, given the former first-team individual development coach was appointed to the position in September after Liverpool had failed to find a suitable external candidate for the role during the summer.

There's also no guarantee that Slot and his assistants now taking responsibility for set-pieces will bring about an immediate improvement - especially when one considers that only Manchester United and Arsenal (13) have scored more non-penalty set-piece goals than Liverpool's next opponents, Leeds, who stunned the Reds with an injury-time equaliser from a corner less than a month ago.

Of course, Liverpool have won four consecutive games in all competitions since their trip to West Yorkshire - but not once convincingly. They needed a ludicrous late penalty to beat Inter in a low-quality Champions League clash, while even Slot admitted that they were ""lucky"" to beat Brighton at Anfield on December 13.

The Reds were also toothless in the 2-1 win at Tottenham until Xavi Simons was sent off, and absolutely abysmal after Richarlison pulled a goal back for the hosts - even though Spurs played the majority of the 10 minutes of injury time with nine men following Cristian Romero's dismissal.

It felt like things were finally starting to click in a dominant first-half showing against Wolves at the weekend, but had it not been for a brilliant last-ditch challenge from Conor Bradley, Liverpool would have dropped points against arguably the worst team in Premier League history.

Once again, a dreadfully-defended corner altered the entire complexion of a game that Slot's side had been dominating, which only served to underline that the one-time 'mentality monsters' are seriously struggling from a psychological perspective.

However, some fans fear that there is also a physical aspect to the team's tribulations, because while the likes of Ekitike and Wirtz are finally looking fitter and stronger, key players such as Alexis Mac Allister and Gravenberch are struggling to match the intensity displayed by Dominic Szoboszlai on a weekly basis, resulting in a damaging imbalance in Liverpool's pressing game.

The overall result is that while the Reds are enjoying a greater share of possession than any other team in the Premier League this season and rank first for passes both into the final third and the penalty area, they're neither exerting anything like the same level of control over their opponents as last term nor killing games off, resulting in one nervy finale after another.

Evidently, just sorting out the set-pieces would go a long, long way towards turning Liverpool's campaign around. Slot says ""progress"" is being made, but only in the sense that their Achilles heel hasn't cost them any points in their last three Premier League games. The truth is that they've continued to struggle for consistency and composure during the worst run of good results the Premier League has seen since the very same side opened the current campaign with five successive victories.

In that sense, all Liverpool have really done since they last faced Leeds is bought themselves time, because while they've returned to winning ways, they're still not back to their best by any stretch of the imagination.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","VIDEO: Emi Martinez enraged by taunting Arsenal fans as Aston Villa staff forced to hold goalkeeper back in ugly scenes at Emirates Stadium","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/video-emi-martinez-enraged-taunting-arsenal-fans-aston-villa-staff-hold-goalkeeper-back-emirates-stadium/bltc12095e21395f200","Wed, 31 Dec 2025 10:19:11 GMT","

Emiliano Martínez was left seething over taunts from Arsenal supporters after Aston Villa suffered a 4-1 defeat at Emirates Stadium. Villa's 11-match winning streak was emphatically ended by the Gunners, who ran out comfortable winners in Tuesday night's Premier League clash. While the result itself was damaging enough, the ugly scenes that followed in the tunnel compounded Villa's misery.

Martinez endured one of his most uncomfortable evenings since joining Villa. The 33-year-old conceded four times as Arsenal delivered a ruthless attacking display to reassert their title credentials. The opening goal was particularly painful for the former Gunners goalkeeper. At a corner, he was outmuscled by returning defender Gabriel Magalhaes, failing to impose himself as the ball broke Arsenal's way. It set the tone for a night in which Villa were repeatedly second-best. Martinez could do little to prevent further strikes from Martín Zubimendi, Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Jesus, before Ollie Watkins grabbed a late consolation for the visitors. The tension truly boiled over after full-time. As Martínez headed towards the tunnel, Arsenal fans directed chants and insults his way, questioning his trademark bravado. One supporter was heard shouting: ""You're not dancing now, are you?"" while others mocked him, saying, ""You're rattled! F*** off, f*** off, f*** off! He's so rattled. Wakey wakey"", urging him to leave the pitch. Martínez turned back to respond, his frustration plain to see, before being pulled away by staff keen to avoid a full-blown confrontation. It was another flashpoint in a relationship that has steadily soured since his departure from north London in 2020.

Martinez spent a decade on Arsenal's books between 2010 and 2020, finally getting his chance to shine during Mikel Arteta's first season in charge. He played a key role in the club's last FA Cup triumph and followed it up with victory in the Community Shield. Yet his Arsenal career ended abruptly soon after, with the goalkeeper sold to Aston Villa in a £20 million ($27m) deal. The return of Bernd Leno left Martínez facing reduced opportunities, prompting his decision to seek regular football elsewhere. Since then, Arsenal supporters have shown little sympathy. On his first return with Villa in 2021, he was greeted with chants proclaiming Aaron Ramsdale to be superior. With Ramsdale now gone, it was David Raya's name echoing around the Emirates on Tuesday.

Much of the animosity stems from Martinez's frank reflections on his Arsenal exit. While he has often spoken warmly about the club, his suggestion that he was not trusted enough struck a nerve with sections of the fanbase. Speaking previously to Sky Sports, Martínez said: ""I just felt like they didn't trust me like they should have. When I was on a high, I still felt like they didn't deserve me because of the way they were treating me. They couldn't guarantee me the games I needed, so I thought that if they couldn't guarantee me the games I needed, then I'm moving on. 

""They didn't say to me that I wasn't going to play, they just didn't guarantee me the games that I wanted to play. So, after 10 years, I decided to leave, and it was very difficult. My family didn't understand why I was leaving when I was at such a good level at Arsenal, but it was my decision to leave and I'm really proud I did it. It was a gamble, but I always believe that if you stay in the comfort zone, you will never reach anything in life. I decided to take the step up.""

Villa manager Unai Emery was also involved in a minor tunnel controversy after appearing to miss the customary post-match handshake with Arteta. Emery later played down the incident, explaining that he had simply followed his usual routine and saw Arteta engaged with his staff.

The Villa boss explained: ""Yes, but it's simple. You can watch. After [finishing] the match, always my routine is quick, shake hands and go with my coaches, with my players, or go to the dressing room. And I was waiting, I was waiting. Of course, he was happy and he was with his coaches and I decided to go inside. But for me, no problem.""

Villa will be keen to respond quickly when they host Nottingham Forest on Saturday. Arsenal, meanwhile, have opened up a five-point gap at the top of the Premier League over Manchester City, who do hold a game in hand. With confidence surging and the Emirates once again a hostile place for visiting former heroes, Arteta's side have sent a clear message that they are not slowing down anytime soon.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Facing the media after a hugely disappointing performance from the Red Devils, the Portuguese tried to explain what went wrong, pointing to a lack of fluidity and the fact he's missing some key players.

Team Canada and Team China took the time to explore Sydney Wednesday before the start of the United Cup, visiting the Sydney Zoo where they interacted with kangaroos and koalas.

The Canadians in attendance were Auger-Aliassime, rising WTA star Victoria Mboko, Alexis Galarneau and Kayla Cross. One year ago, Mboko was outside the Top 300 in the PIF WTA Rankings. She enters the United Cup as World No. 18.

""I'm really excited. This is my first time playing such an event and playing the whole Australia swing, so there are a lot of new experiences and so many new things to come,"" Mboko said. ""I'm excited to play United Cup. It's a really fun event and to be here with Felix and the team, it's really great.""



Auger-Aliassime is flying higher than ever at No. 5 in the PIF ATP Rankings. A winner of 50 matches during the 2025 season, the Canadian will try to make a quick start to the new year Down Under. He is serving as playing captain for Team Canada.

""I have great memories playing in the past team events here in Australia,"" Auger-Aliassime said. ""We actually won with our team [the ATP Cup] in Sydney a couple years back, so it would be nice to get a win again.""



The Team China members who visited the Sydney Zoo were former WTA No. 31 Zhu Lin, Zhang Zhizhen (second from right), Te Rigele (far right), Wang Aoran (far left) and captain Wu Di (second from left).



Zhang and Zhu lead the way for the Chinese. Zhang has played the United Cup in each of the past two seasons, tallying a 1-2 singles mark each time. He is proud to represent his country on a global stage.

""This is always different. Also that is why United Cup is a little bit different [from] other tournaments,"" Zhang said. ""You have to fight for every point, even if you get one more point or one more set you are helping your team.""

The event began, in 2023, as a hopeful model of gender unity, in a sport that hasn't had a ton of it over the decades. Since then, it has established itself as a table-setting tournament that balances camaraderie with competition and showcases both tours in one place.It's still a hopeful way to begin. While United Cup may not inspire the intensity of Davis Cup or BJK Cup, or radiate the star power of Laver Cup, it's the only place where we see the men and women teaming up and hanging out on the sidelines, and then playing together for their countries, and for ranking points. From here, the tours mostly go their separate ways.As in seasons past, the 2026 edition will be an advertisement of the sport's depth, rather than its leading lights.

Like team events across all sports, United Cup begins with group play, before moving on to knockout rounds for the eight surviving nations. Here are a few potential highlights from the six three-team groups.Group AUSA, Spain, ArgentinaThe U.S. is the defending champion, and has the strongest one-two punch in Fritz and Gauff. But their match against Spain should be a battle. Fritz will face Jaume Munar, a competitor in the dogged Spanish tradition who had his best season in 2025. Gauff, meanwhile, will play another hard-charging, gradually-improving player in 40th-ranked Jessica Bouzas Maneiro. This will be their first meeting.Group BCanada, Belgium, ChinaCanada comes into 2026 hot, with a team led by Felix Auger Aliassime, who leapt from No. 29 to No. 5 last year, and Mboko, who leapt to Cinderella stardom with her title run in Montreal.I'm looking forward to seeing them play Belgium, which will have two low-key warriors, Zizou Bergs and Elise Mertens, in the singles positions.Group CItaly, France, SwitzerlandItaly vs. Switzerland will feature a battle of the generations on the men's side, between Flavio Cobolli, 23, and Stan Wawrinka, 40. More interesting, perhaps, will be the women's contest, between No. 8 Jasmine Paolini and No. 11 Belinda Bencic.

Success in United Cup doesn't necessarily beget more of the same. Last year Gauff and Fritz went 11-1 combined and swept Poland in the final, only to suffer upset losses at the Australian Open.That said, while this is a team event, there are plenty of intriguing individual storylines that will get underway over the course of its nine days. Here are a few.Coco Gauff: How is her serve journey coming?In August, Gauff hired a serve specialist, Gavin MacMillan, to fix her wayward delivery. The early results were encouraging: She won the title in Wuhan and made the semis in Beijing. Now we'll see what the stroke looks like after an off-season of work.Taylor Fritz: At 28, is he still climbing, or has he peaked?Fritz's road to the elite has been long and hard-earned, but with Alcaraz and Sinner ensconced at the top, he doesn't seem any closer to a Slam title. We'll see this year if he has any more gears to shift into.

Iconic Nico Hulkenberg onboards

The 2025 championship has certainly provided us will lots of unforgettable moments.

Anticipation was high ahead of the 2025 F1 season – and the campaign that followed more than matched up to those expectations.

A title fight that went down to wire, surprise podiums and numerous dramatic battles kept us entertained on track, while plenty of huge stories unfolded off it, from shock personnel changes through to intriguing driver market developments.

Join us as we take a look back at all of the key moments from an unforgettable year…

To celebrate F1's 75th anniversary, the season kicked off with the spectacular F1 75 Live launch event held at London's The O2 in February, where all 10 teams and their respective drivers unveiled their liveries for the season ahead.

It memorably marked Lewis Hamilton's first appearance as a Ferrari driver, while the new batch of rookies made their debuts. Comedian Jack Whitehall hosted proceedings, and there were also performances from musical guests including Kane Brown and Take That.

The Australian Grand Prix was the first race of a 24-round calendar and it proved to be a chaotic affair, with Lando Norris emerging as the winner following an event that featured changing weather conditions, Safety Cars and numerous crashes.

Team mate Oscar Piastri was amongst those to slide off track – but the Australian bounced back with victory in China one week later, kickstarting an early run of momentum that would see the 24-year-old take the championship lead at Round 5 in Saudi Arabia.

Speaking of China, Round 2 of the championship proved to be one of highs and lows for Ferrari. Hamilton returned to winning ways in the first Sprint of the campaign, converting pole position into P1 as the Briton gave the Scuderia's fans something to smile about.

However, Sunday's race proved to be much tougher. Charles Leclerc and Hamilton initially crossed the line in fifth and sixth respectively – but both were later disqualified, with the former's car found to be underweight in post-race checks while the rear skid block on Hamilton's SF-25 was found to be under the minimum thickness required in the technical regulations.

After being promoted to Red Bull from the team's sister squad for 2025, Liam Lawson faced a tricky start during the first two rounds of the campaign, recording a DNF in Australia before finishing outside of the points in China.

It was subsequently announced that the New Zealander would return to Racing Bulls as of Round 3 in Japan, marking a direct swap with Yuki Tsunoda as the Japanese racer became the latest to step up as Max Verstappen's team mate.

Another driver change took place at Alpine in May. Speculation had long been swirling over Jack Doohan's position at the team – and it was confirmed in the days after the Miami Grand Prix that he would be replaced by Franco Colapinto going forwards, with the Australian becoming first-choice reserve.

This was just one personnel change at the Enstone-based squad within a short space of time; it was announced only one day earlier that Team Principal Oliver Oakes had resigned with immediate effect.

Amid a dominant showing from McLaren during the early stages of the season – with Piastri and Norris responsible for seven wins in nine races, the other two victories belonging to Verstappen – Norris admitted that it was perhaps only a matter of time until he and his team mate came to blows on track.

Such an incident finally occurred at Round 10 in Canada. As they battled for P4 in the closing stages, Norris made contact with Piastri and suffered race-ending damage to his car, with the Briton later taking responsibility for what happened. George Russell, meanwhile, claimed a debut win of the season for Mercedes, while rookie team mate Kimi Antonelli scored his first F1 podium in third.

Formula 1 arrived on the big screen in June as F1 The Movie was released in cinemas. Filming of the motion picture – starring Brad Pitt as former driver Sonny Hayes, who makes a comeback to partner rookie Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris) at the fictional APXGP team – took place during actual Grand Prix weekends throughout the 2023 and 2024 seasons.

The drivers and teams got a first glimpse of the movie after attending a private screening in Monaco a few weeks earlier, with many voicing their approval of the film afterwards.

In terms of feel-good moments of the season, the British Grand Prix certainly provided some standout memories. After winning in Monaco for the first time earlier in the campaign, Norris added another iconic victory to his list by triumphing in front of his home crowd at Silverstone for the first time.

Joining him on the podium was Nico Hulkenberg, the Kick Sauber driver finally achieving a maiden top-three finish on his 239th attempt. It was a hugely popular result and one that the German hailed as “quite incredible”.

Just days after F1's visit to Silverstone, Red Bull announced that Team Principal and CEO Christian Horner would leave the team with immediate effect, bringing a sudden end to his long period in charge of the outfit.

With Horner exiting after some 20 years in the role, Racing Bulls' Laurent Mekies made the step up to replace him, while Alan Permane moved from Racing Director to Team Principal at the sister outfit as part of the reshuffle.

Another off-track matter involving Red Bull that led to much discussion during the first half of the season was the topic of Verstappen's future. Despite holding a contract to race for the Milton Keynes-based team until the end of 2028, speculation mounted linking the Dutchman to a Mercedes switch.

The rumours were put to bed when Verstappen confirmed just before the Hungarian Grand Prix that he would stay with the squad into 2026, while the Silver Arrows' line-up was made official in October as it was announced that Russell and Antonelli would remain with the team.

After an eventful first half of the campaign, Piastri had maintained his championship lead over Norris when F1 entered into its summer break following Round 14 at the Hungaroring, the Australian holding a nine-point margin over his team mate.

Red Bull, however, were at something of a low point going into the break. A difficult outing in Hungary had seen Verstappen finish down in ninth, meaning that the Dutchman was now 97 points adrift of Piastri in the drivers' standings.

While the remainder of 2025 was still to play out, a significant development for 2026 occurred when Cadillac – the 11th team set to join the grid next season – announced their driver line-up for their debut.

Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez were confirmed to make their returns to the grid with the American outfit, both bringing a vast amount of experience to the new operation.

When the campaign resumed at Zandvoort, Norris' title hopes looked to have taken a blow as smoke started to emerge from his MCL39 in the final laps, forcing the Briton to pull off track and retire from the race. With Piastri taking victory, the points margin had now opened up to 34 points.

While Norris faced heartbreak, it proved to be a much happier day for Isack Hadjar, the rookie scoring his debut F1 podium by crossing the line in third place for Racing Bulls.

Following the Dutch Grand Prix, Verstappen had found himself 104 points adrift of Piastri in the Drivers' Championship – but the four-time World Champion was not deterred, soon kickstarting a remarkable resurgence during the second half of the season.

This began with a victory one week later at Monza, the Red Bull man beating the McLaren duo to win with an impressive margin of 19 seconds.

Just as Verstappen looked to be on the up, a more challenging sequence started to unfold for Piastri at Round 17 in Azerbaijan. The championship leader hit the barriers during an eventful Qualifying before crashing out on Lap 1 of Sunday's race, marking his first DNF of the campaign.

It was a better weekend for Carlos Sainz, however. The Williams driver looked to have put a challenging start to his first season with the team behind him, recording the second fastest time in Qualifying and claiming a maiden podium for the Grove-based outfit in Sunday's race.

Another driver to have experienced mixed fortunes during the campaign so far was Antonelli, with the rookie enjoying a decent start to his maiden F1 season – which included a Sprint pole in Miami – before running into a difficult spell through the European leg.

The Italian's performance in Monza was labelled as “underwhelming” by Mercedes boss Toto Wolff – but he promptly delivered a much more promising P4 in Baku, leading to a stronger second half of the year for the youngster.

The chances of McLaren clinching a second consecutive Teams' Championship had long seemed likely, with the papaya squad building a sizeable points advantage over their rivals as the campaign progressed.

While Russell was the race winner at Round 18 in Singapore, a P3 and P4 for Norris and Piastri respectively was enough to secure the crown for the Woking-based outfit, their first back-to-back teams' titles since their run of four between 1988 and 1991.

As Piastri's spell off the podium continued, Norris was having a better run of form during the latter stages of the campaign. While both drivers were eliminated in a Lap 1 melee in the Austin Sprint – and lost out to Verstappen in Sunday's race – Norris put himself ahead via a dominant performance in Mexico.

Converting pole position into a commanding win – crossing the line with a whopping margin of 30 seconds over closest challenger Leclerc – Norris retook the championship lead from his team mate with four rounds still to go.

While Verstappen had continued to eat into his own points deficit in the standings – leading many to question if a fifth title could now be on the cards for the Dutchman – his charge looked to have hit a snag when he made a surprise Q1 exit in Qualifying for the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

After starting the race from the pit lane, Verstappen had his work cut out on Sunday at Interlagos – but the World Champion put in a stunning drive to climb right up to third place, ensuring that he was still very much in the fight prior to the final three races of the season.

Verstappen returned to the top step with another win in Las Vegas, while Norris and Piastri initially finished second and fourth respectively. However, it was announced after the race that both McLaren cars had been disqualified due to the rearmost skid wear being found to be below the minimum 9mm thickness required in the technical regulations.

The result had quite an effect on the Drivers' Championship, with it meaning that Verstappen was now equal with Piastri as both sat 24 points behind Norris entering into the last two rounds.

Prior to the penultimate event of the season in Qatar, Aston Martin announced a leadership reshuffle for 2026 that would see Adrian Newey – who had joined as Managing Technical Partner in March – take on the additional role of Team Principal.

Andy Cowell – who had previously held the position of Team Principal and CEO – will become Chief Strategy Officer, with the team stating that the change is designed to focus on Newey and Cowell's ""individual strengths and expertise, ensuring organisational efficiency"".

For some time earlier in the season, Ferrari had held P2 in the Teams' Championship. The Scuderia subsequently lost this to Mercedes after Round 17 in Azerbaijan, before retaking the position in Mexico thanks to a P2 finish for Leclerc.

Things seemed to quickly unravel during the final races, however. A double DNF in Sao Paulo saw the team slip back to fourth in the standings, a position that they were confirmed in prior to the finale in Abu Dhabi. Post-Qatar, a disappointed Leclerc said that he had “no words” after the squad had again struggled for performance.

The final pieces of the 2026 driver line-up puzzle fell into place just a few days before the last race of 2025, with Red Bull announcing that Hadjar would replace Tsunoda at the squad as Verstappen's team mate next year.

Tsunoda will take the role of test and reserve driver for both Red Bull and Racing Bulls, while the sister squad have recruited rookie Arvid Lindblad to fill Hadjar's vacancy, the youngster making the step up from F2 to partner the incumbent Lawson.

For the first time in 15 years, three drivers arrived at the finale with a chance to win the World Championship; Norris led the standings by 12 points from Verstappen, with Piastri 16 points adrift in third.

While a podium would be enough for Norris to seal the title, the Briton slipped to third on the opening lap and faced pressure from Leclerc, as well as a tense fight with Tsunoda later on. But the McLaren driver ultimately managed to hold on to that crucial P3, finishing behind Verstappen and Piastri to memorably clinch his maiden World Championship by two points.

Iconic Nico Hulkenberg onboards

From Netflix shows and grassroots programs to wild card triumphs and brand new partnerships, 2025 was the year F1 ACADEMY proved it's about much more than just what's on track. We look back at the moments that shaped the season off the track and left a lasting mark on the paddock and beyond...

It's been a full-on 2025 for F1 ACADEMY – the third season of the female-only single-seater series. On the track, we were treated to a fantastic title fight between Mercedes' Doriane Pin and Ferrari's Maya Weug that went down to the wire in Las Vegas, with Pin emerging victorious after a thrilling weekend of racing. But off the track, the series has grown and grown.

Whether it was a new Netflix docuseries, the myriad of exciting driver-brand partnerships, or best-selling books from icons of the sport, there's been plenty for fans to get stuck into over the year. Here are some of the best storylines away from the asphalt...

Enter the game-changer. May 2025 saw the launch of F1: The ACADEMY on Netflix – the Reese Witherspoon-produced rewind on the 2024 season, setting the tone for 2025.

With unprecedented behind-the-scenes access, the series went deep on what it takes to be an F1 ACADEMY driver – the sacrifices, the triumphs, the person behind the visor – and turned the racers into streaming stars.

If you're thinking Drive to Survive, think a little different: where DTS delivers on Formula 1's glamour and drama, F1: The ACADEMY focuses far more on the raw determination of young women fighting for their place in motorsport.

The series proved a hit with the critics – and with the fans, whose deeper connection with the drivers no doubt played a part in the growing audience in the grandstands at races around the globe.

2025 was a statement season for F1 ACADEMY and fashion/beauty brands, and marked many new partners fully committing to the sport for the first time.

Alba Larsen joined the grid backed by Tommy Hilfiger, with her car carrying the brand's statement red, white and blue colours throughout the season. However, this partnership extended well beyond the livery, with Larsen bringing the 'Tommy Girl' identity into the paddock and becoming something of a case study as to how personal style can sit comfortably alongside racing. Racing suits and fashion aren't mutually exclusive!

Charlotte Tilbury remained involved through driver Chloe Chong, continuing a partnership that has become familiar within the series, including providing the makeup for the drivers for the Netflix premiere. For the female-founded beauty brand, the focus stayed on supporting these young drivers as they develop their careers in motorsport, rather than simply increasing visibility of women in the sport.

Wella Professionals were the major new addition to the grid. The global haircare brand already has a history of backing women's sport, but has now made the move into motorsport for the first time through F1 ACADEMY. Their involvement added another dimension to the grid, centred on confidence and self-expression, and has been backing up and coming star Joanne Ciconte.

By the end of the season, these partnerships have clearly become a huge part of F1 ACADEMY's identity. Not a distraction from the racing, but a reflection of the drivers themselves as modern athletes competing at the highest level while defining who they are and want to be out of the cockpit.

When Joanne Ciconte rolled out for the Canadian round in her new Wella Professionals livery, the internet collectively cheered as the red, mermaid-inspired design took social media by storm. Here was a global beauty brand that believed in F1 ACADEMY enough to make it their first-ever motorsport sponsorship, which made the moment feel way more special than just a fresh paint job.

The partnership showed up around the paddock too. Wella, OPI and ghd set up styling stations in the Paddock Club, giving guests and drivers a chance to get quick touch-ups before heading out. Hair, nails, the small details that usually sit far away from a race weekend suddenly felt part of it. A few years ago, that might have raised eyebrows. In Montreal, it just felt normal.

The partnership inspired other groundbreaking activations to The Paddock Club over F1 ACADEMY race weekends. Wella, OPI, and ghd set up glam stations where guests – and, of course, drivers – could get race-ready touch-ups all weekend long. Hair styled, nails perfected, and most importantly, confidence boosted before heading trackside. These kinds of beauty services at a race weekend would have been dismissed as frivolous a few years ago. Now, thanks to F1 ACADEMY, they're not only acceptable but embraced as essential parts of both driver preparation and the fan experience.

For Ciconte, with her long curly hair, the support provided by Wella stretched beyond the track. ""I used to be really bad at maintaining [my hair],"" she told The Paddock Journal. ""When Wella came on board, they taught me so much, which I really needed."" It's a small detail that speaks to something larger: F1 ACADEMY is choosing partners who bring real change to the grid, helping these young drivers feel confident in every aspect of their lives, not just behind the wheel. Sometimes it's the off-track details that help everything else fall into place!

While the championship fight played out on track, Tommy Hilfiger racer Alba Larsen was busy elsewhere too. Still only 15 when she started it, her G.I.R.L. (Girls International Racing Lab) initiative began to gather real momentum during the 2025 season. Events across her home nation of Denmark brought over 400 girls into motorsport spaces that felt welcoming from the start, without the pressure or assumptions that tend to usually come with them. Her goals are even bigger for next year, as Alba aims to reach 15,000 girls globally.

That hard work off the track didn't go unnoticed by the racing community. In 2025, Alba received the FIA Women in Motorsport Award, as they recognised the impact G.I.R.L. was already having and the pathway it was starting to open up for young girls looking at racing for the first time.

When she wasn't racing or building a global grassroots movement, Alba was just as busy! Over the summer, she featured in a Vogue Scandinavia profile, she toured with her book The Fastest Girl in the World, and met young fans to sign copies, all while maintaining her racing schedule and making improvements all season long!

Now at just 17 years old, Alba has cemented herself as the template for the modern F1 ACADEMY driver: a racer by weekend, an author and activist by weekday, and a fashion muse year-round. She understood something fundamental that's reshaping motorsport: cultural impact and track performance aren't separate careers, they're two sides of the same ambition. 2025 was the year Alba proved you don't have to wait until after your racing career to make a difference or an impact off-track. You can do both, simultaneously, and do them brilliantly.

During mid-season, the wild card program delivered one of the year's best storylines. Esmee Kosterman, the Dutch driver who arrived at F1 ACADEMY as the Zandvoort Wild Card with TeamViewer, had everything to prove and nothing guaranteed beyond that race.

Kosterman became the highest points-scoring wild card driver of the entire season, performing so impressively that LEGO Racing signed her for their 2026 debut season. Her success also highlighted something crucial about F1 ACADEMY's philosophy: the doors aren't closed. If you're fast enough and talented enough, there's always a way in. The wild card program proved it in 2025, and it will continue to prove it as Esmee takes her LEGO Racing seat in 2026.

In October, as the championship fight intensified on track, off-track, a different kind of milestone was reached. Managing Director of F1 ACADEMY, Susie Wolff released her memoir, Driven, and it didn't take long for it to climb the Sunday Times bestseller list.

The timing felt perfect – Wolff's story was arriving to fans just as F1 ACADEMY was becoming more visible both inside and outside the paddock. In the book, she looks back at her own journey through motorsport, including the barriers she ran into and the moments that shaped how she approaches the sport now.

However, it isn't just a racing memoir; it's the roadmap for why F1 ACADEMY exists. Every partnership Wolff secured, every wild card driver who got their shot, every girl attending Alba's G.I.R.L. program, they're all living proof of the future Wolff envisioned when she created this series.

Wolff's motorsport journey is at the heart of F1 ACADEMY's successes. Her story and her presence is a big reason why so many young girls want to join the series because they can see themselves in her story, and now, they can see themselves on the grid.

If there was any doubt that F1 ACADEMY had become a cultural phenomenon, Las Vegas erased it sharpish! When the Hello Kitty partnership was unveiled at the most glittering race on the calendar, fans went wild. This iconic collaboration included a merch line featuring Hello Kitty and friends in racing gear, a sequin jacket that became instantly popular, and yes, even a Hello Kitty dog harness (because why not?).

The Hello Kitty Fanzone served food and drinks in Hello Kitty packaging that promptly became a collectors item. What's more Hello Kitty even waved the chequered flag following a wild reverse grid race.

But don't be fooled, this partnership wasn't just about selling merch. It has become clear that F1 ACADEMY understands something fundamental about modern sports: you can be serious about driver development while also being fun and engaging for all divisions of your fan base. The two aren't contradictions – they're complements.

LEGO also made its mark in Vegas, providing LEGO bouquets for the podium. Instead of flowers that wilt, drivers received buildable bouquets they could keep forever, and that fans could buy and build themselves. Even the victory celebrations became shareable, collectable moments. It was another sign of how F1 ACADEMY is rethinking every tradition through a more creative, culturally engaged lens.

As the season wound down, the news didn't really stop. Gatorade announced it would be coming on board for 2026, with a focus on female athlete performance and a sports science stance. The partnership will see them work closely with Lisa Billard, building hydration support around the specific demands she faces as a driver. This goes above and beyond sponsorship, it's research and development for women's sport, using F1 ACADEMY as a testing ground for performance science that could benefit sportswomen across all sports.

The season kicked off with three major announcements that signalled something different was coming. TAG Heuer became the Official Timekeeper, ""reinforcing its commitment to shaping the future of racing, ensuring that talent – not gender – determines success on the track."" TeamViewer and More than Equal joined as partners, bringing their platforms and resources to the series. Three significant partnerships before the season even started made one thing clear: F1 ACADEMY 2025 wouldn't just be about racing; it would be about cultural relevance.

LEGO Racing officially confirmed their 2026 entry with Esmee Kosterman behind the wheel. Alba's G.I.R.L. program continues its global expansion with ambitious targets. One announcement rolled into the next, and together they painted a picture of where F1 ACADEMY is heading next.

This season made it clear that F1 ACADEMY isn't just about what happens on track anymore. Fashion, culture, grassroots projects, and racing all found space to coexist, and the drivers were at the centre of it all! The brands getting involved weren't there to plaster logos on cars, but wanting to work with the drivers, support them in different ways, and trying new things along the way.

The Gatorade partnership represents the next evolution: Lisa Billard now has hydration and performance support built around her needs as a female athlete, with the research feeding back into broader sports science. The fashion and beauty collaborations have given drivers a chance to express themselves beyond the helmet. Alba Larson's G.I.R.L. programme continued to grow, connecting hundreds of girls to motorsport in a way that feels tangible and hopeful.

And then there was Vegas. Hello Kitty waving the chequered flag felt playful and a little surreal, but it went down a treat, and a perfect snapshot of what F1 ACADEMY had become in 2025. Racing, culture, and creativity all at once, with plenty still to come next year!

During the broadcast, which was taped on Dec. 7, the president predicted that the 2025 ceremony would draw in the best ratings yet.



		By McKinley Franklin, Alex Weprin 

	December 30, 2025 8:49pm	




	The ratings for the 2025 Kennedy Center Honors, hosted by Donald Trump, dropped to a new all-time low, with the telecast averaging 3.01 million viewers, according to Nielsen Live + Same Day Panel + Big Data. 


	Last year's show averaged 4.1 million viewers, per Nielsen, meaning this year's honors dropped 26 percent in viewership year-on-year. However, Nielsen has changed its methodology since then, launching what it calls its “Big Data + Panel” system which combines its traditional panel data with data from smart TVs and set-top boxes.

	This year's ceremony saw Trump host, and the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Kiss, Gloria Gaynor, Michael Crawford and George Strait honored. During the show, which was taped on Dec. 7, the president predicted that the broadcast would draw in the best ratings yet. He shared a similar sentiment during an event held a day before the Honors were filmed.


	“I believe — and I'm gonna make a prediction — this will be the highest-rated show that they've ever done, and they've gotten some pretty good ratings, but there's nothing like what's gonna happen tomorrow night,” Trump said. “We never had a president hosting the awards before. This is a first. I'm sure they'll give me great reviews, right? You know, they'll say, ‘He was horrible. He was terrible. It was a horrible situation.' No, we'll do fine. I've watched some of the people that host. Jimmy Kimmel was horrible, and some of these people, if I can't beat out Jimmy Kimmel in terms of talent, then I don't think I should be president.”


	Before the show aired on Dec. 23, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he was named host of the Honors  “at the request of the Board, and just about everybody else in America.” 

	











	“Tell me what you think of my ‘Master of Ceremonies' abilities,” he wrote. “If really good, would you like me to leave the Presidency in order to make ‘hosting' a full time job?” 


	Preliminary ratings had viewership sitting at 2.65 million, though an insider predicted that the final numbers would ultimately deliver a higher total.


	The honors aired on CBS and Paramount+ amid news of Trump's plans to rename the Kennedy Center to The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.


	“The Kennedy Center Board of Trustees voted unanimously today to name the institution The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts,” the Kennedy Center's vice president of public relations, Roma Daravi, said in a statement at the time. “The unanimous vote recognizes that the current Chairman saved the institution from financial ruin and physical destruction. The new Trump Kennedy Center reflects the unequivocal bipartisan support for America's cultural center for generations to come.”


	The decision has drawn much blowback, including by members of the Kennedy family. It also resulted in musician Chuck Redd dropping out of a planned performance at the Kennedy Center on Christmas Eve. Redd told the Associated Press, “When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert.” 


	Somewhat lost in the shuffle of this year's award show was the fact that CBS' deal to televise the event has now ended, meaning that the Center will be bringing the TV and streaming rights to market in the next few months.

	











	Normally those are numbers that would not draw many bidders, but this is no ordinary show. While it isn't clear if Trump intends to host the event again, the show will be another opportunity for a media company to do a deal with Trump, and there is no shortage of companies that could be willing to engage.


	CBS' window to renew the deal lapsed earlier this year, but that was a decision made by the previous ownership. It is entirely possible that Paramount CEO David Ellison is willing to ink a new deal to keep the show in-house. And then there is Netflix, which has the streaming rights to the Kennedy Center's other big program: The Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, which was awarded to Conan O'Brien earlier this year.


	Netflix has a deal to acquire Warner Bros., and Paramount is also pursuing a bid. Both could face regulatory scrutiny and might find a deal for the show more appealing in that environment. Still other companies, like Versant or Fox, may be interested in cutting a deal knowing that they may want to pursue acquisitions in the future.

Two sexual assault lawsuits have claimed Perry has abused actors looking for opportunities in Hollywood. The mogul's lawyer denies the accounts and calls them ""a $77 million money grab scam.""


							By 

	Winston Cho



	The first lawsuit against Tyler Perry accusing him of leveraging his power in Hollywood to sexually assault aspiring male actors in his orbit was filed in June. Another lawsuit was filed Dec. 26, with the entertainment mogul characterizing claims from both of the accusers as a shakedown. But his legal troubles may just be beginning.


	“There's now two of these lawsuits,” Jonathan Delshad, a lawyer for both Perry accusers, tells The Hollywood Reporter. “There may be more coming.”




	In a statement, Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Perry, denied the allegations. “I said it before and I will say it again,” he said. “This is nothing but a $77 million money grab scam.”

	For years, Perry has been viewed as a Hollywood success story. He runs Tyler Perry Studios, a 330-acre lot on a former Confederate army base that employs more than 500 people. It's been championed as a crowning achievement for Black creativity and ownership in the entertainment industry, though there have been indirect criticisms within some corners of Hollywood, including by Donald Glover's Atlanta and Aaron McGruder's The Boondocks.


	Some of the references in those shows mirrored allegations advanced by Derek Dixon, who said Perry groped him while alluding to the filmmaker engaging in a pattern of exploiting male actors in his productions. For years, Perry has “been using his power and influence to molest, abuse, and sexually assault impressionable and vulnerable employees and actors who look to him for guidance and mentorship while pursuing their dreams,” Dixon, an actor on Perry's The Oval, alleged. That was followed by the filing of a second lawsuit, this time by Mario Rodriguez, an actor who appeared in Boo! A Madea Halloween and accused the mogul of multiple instances of assault across several years at his Los Angeles home.

	











	In the wake of the complaint, friendly communications between Perry and Rodriguez after the alleged assaults have surfaced. The messages show the two communicating as recently as August, with Rodriguez asking the mogul for help amid financial distress. “Feel sick most days. Never told anybody this but my mom and everybody is starting to notice my broke ass,” he wrote in the Aug. 31 note, per messages that TMZ and Page Six published. “Don't have insurance.”


	In another alleged text sent last year, Rodriguez thanked Perry “for everything” the mogul had done for him. “I just wanna tell you that your boy right here appreciates you more than anything,” he wrote. Perry responded, “You don't have to give me a thing or pay me a thing. I'm just glad you're good.”


	The Associated Press reported that the communications show that they “remained in contact years after Rodriguez alleges their interactions ended.” And The Los Angeles Times, pointing to claims from Rodriguez that he cut off contact with Perry in 2019, wrote that the messages “seem to show otherwise.” But Delshad views the messages as showing a lopsided power dynamic in which Perry felt compelled to pay back Rodriguez for the alleged assaults.


	“Why is he holding himself out as available for favors?” Delshad says. “That's the larger context to this. This isn't normal behavior from a billionaire producer toward an inconsequential actor who had a tiny role in one of his movies.”


	According to the complaint, Rodriguez agreed to meet Perry multiple times across several years, even after he claimed to have been assaulted. The actor was given money on some occasions, including after an alleged assault in which Perry tried to unbuckle the actor's pants, the lawsuit said. In total, Perry, unprompted, gave Rodriguez $10,000, per the complaint.

	











	“They may say that Tyler Perry is just a philanthropic guy and that he does this for everyone and, maybe he does, but it seems unlikely,” Delshad says. “I would imagine his phone would be blowing up from hundreds of thousands of actors who played small roles in his movies.” 


	He adds, “Why did Mario feel comfortable enough to ask him for money and why did [Perry] respond four years after they made a movie together?”

The director details the clever way he would stay alive if he suddenly found himself on the ill-fated ship. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


Titanic is the most popular disaster-survival film of all time. 


	But if you found yourself on the “ship of dreams” on the night of April 15, 1912, what could you have done to survive its sinking? 




	We asked the film's Oscar-winning writer-director James Cameron during our interview for last week's Hollywood Reporter cover story and the ever-resourceful filmmaker gave a rather clever answer.


	First, our phrasing of the question was specifically chosen: “If you were traveling by yourself as a second-class passenger on Titanic when it hit an iceberg, what would you have done?”

	“Traveling by yourself” because a man traveling with his family is presumably going to prioritize their survival instead of his own. And “second class” because we all know from watching Cameron's film that some third-class passengers found themselves trapped below decks and were pretty much doomed, while first-class passengers had the best shot at securing an easy seat on the lifeboats (even though Second Officer Charles Lightoller mistakenly took the captain's order of “women and children first” to mean “women and children only,” which resulted in some boats not being filled to capacity).


	Turns out, Cameron has played this game himself.  


	“I think there were interesting ways to what-if or second-guess the whole thing,” Cameron says. “One I like to play with my Titanic experts is — with what we know now, and if you had the captain's ear — how could you save everybody? The other is: What if you're a time traveler, you go back and want to experience the sinking, and your little time-travel thing that gets you back fails, and you're like, ‘Oh f–k, I'm really on the ship, I've got to get off it.'”

	











	Assuming you couldn't get a seat on a lifeboat the normal way, Cameron says that your best move would be to stand on the side of the Titanic and wait for a lifeboat to launch during the early part of the evacuation. Then you jump off the Titanic and swim to the newly launched boat. As long as the boat wasn't too far away, you'd survive the brief plunge into the 28-degree water — and the lifeboat passengers would likely pull you aboard given that people would be watching from the rails of the ship.


	“Most people wouldn't have had the courage to jump into the water,” Cameron says. “They couldn't quite believe that the ship was really going to sink. But if you knew for sure it was going to sink and you weren't on a lifeboat, you jump in the water next to the boat the second it casts off. Once they rowed away, you were screwed. Are they going to let you drown when Titanic is still there and everybody is watching? No, they'd pull you in, and the officers would go, ‘Well, f–k, there's nothing I can do about that.' Boat four would be a good one for this.”


	In the 1997 film, of course, Cameron's hero, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), reasons the best move is to stay on the ship as long as possible. Which made sense given the amount of information he had at the time — not knowing rescue from another ship wouldn't arrive until roughly two hours after Titanic sank. An even better move would have been for Rose (Kate Winslet) to stay on the lifeboat, giving Jack a better shot at survival on that floating door. But that's all part of the movie's appeal; there's a play-along factor where the audience can ask themselves what they would have done at various turning points.

	











	Cameron's latest, Avatar: Fire and Ash, is now in theaters.

	As 2025 comes to a close, Addison Rae can update her resume to read pop artist, film star, TikTok heavyweight and now festival headliner.  


	On Monday night, Dec. 29, the alternative pop artist added a new chapter to her career when she headlined Australia's Beyond The Valley, marking her first-ever festival appearance.


	“Wow, you all like to party out here in Australia. I am very impressed,” she told onlookers mid-set, the final spot of the night at the Valley Stage. “This is my first time performing at a festival and this is quite the welcome. So thank you so much.”

	On the night, the Louisiana-born, New York City born-and-raised singer performed “Aquamarine,” “High Fashion,” “Headphones On,” “Fame Is a Gun” and, of course, “Diet Pepsi,” her first Billboard Hot 100 hit.


	Rae chose a fine moment to enter festival-land. Presented at Barunah Plains, an historic sheep station in west Victoria, BTV this year celebrates its 10th edition. EDM superstar Dom Dolla is on New Year's Eve countdown duties.


	Last month, Rae completed the Australian lap of The Addison Tour, a headline trek in support of her debut LP Addison, which opened at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 and No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Chart.


	In an August Billboard cover story, Rae told senior writer Kristin Robinson about embracing new adventures, from music to acting. “I really just never give up and never quit, no matter what,” she said. “Really, what it comes back to is that I'm fearless — I'm not afraid of much. It doesn't really take me much to try something new and go all in, and here, I went all in.”

	











	Rae is staying in the Australian sun for a little while longer. She's booked to perform at Wildlands festival in Brisbane on Thursday, Jan. 1, and heads west for the Perth show on Jan. 3. Her 2026 tour dates include Lollapalooza Chile, Argentina and Brazil, Coachella, and Spain's Primavera Sound.

International TV Co-Editor


HBO Max will be available in two more territories on Canal+ as the French powerhouse strikes a fresh multi-year, multi-territory agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD).


	The agreement renews HBO Max in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungrary and Romania on Canal+, but will also see the streamer distributed via Canal+ in Belgium and Austria. 


	HBO Max has rolled out to major European markets over the past year or so and will soon go live in the UK, where it has previously been unable to launch due to WBD's long-running deal with Sky.

	Canal+ and WBD said today's partnership marks a “major milestone in the development of their collaboration on an international scale.”

	Overall, the agreement covers the distribution of HBO Max, the renewal of several WBD channels and the renewal of the exclusive pay-TV window for Warner Bros. movies, which land on Canal+ six months after their theatrical release in France. 


	Around 12 WBD channels have been renewed across territories in Africa on MultiChoice Group, the firm that Canal+ acquired earlier this year. CNN International and Cartoon Network will air exclusively in South Africa and non-exclusively in other territories. A number of other networks have also been renewed in African markets.


	Canal+ also has distribution deals in place with Netflix and could become an important player if Netflix's acquisition of WBD goes through, which will give Netflix control over two of the world's biggest streamers.

Welcome to Rendering, a Deadline column reporting at the intersection of AI and showbiz. Rendering examines how artificial intelligence is disrupting the entertainment industry, taking you inside key battlegrounds and spotlighting change makers wielding the technology for good and ill. Got a story about AI? Rendering wants to hear from you: jkanter@deadline.com.


This edition: Why Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker‘s idea to deepfake cinemagoers into movies was typically prescient.


	Charlie Brooker is the grandmaster of predicting how the human experience could be shaped by technology. Whether it's Domhnall Gleeson's replicant boyfriend pre-dating grief chatbots, creepy social credits systems, or killer robots, Black Mirror is often the dystopian nightmare we come to recognize in reality.

					Karen Glass Dies: Former Disney Exec & 'A Pickleball Christmas' Producer Was 63		
			








	With that in mind, my ears pricked up when Brooker cheerily sketched out an AI vision to boost cinema ticket sales during an on-stage interview in 2025. He proposed scanning the faces of cinemagoers as they enter the theater and then using AI to cast them “randomly” in the actual movie. “So imagine if you went to see Raiders of the Lost Ark and you don't know if you're going to be Indiana Jones, or a melting Nazi,” he told the Edinburgh TV Festival.


	This was August. Little more than a month later, OpenAI launched Sora 2, allowing users to insert themselves into infinite movie realms through its “Cameos” feature. The results went astoundingly viral. Brooker's prescience had struck again.


	The screenwriter touched on something fundamental about how AI content is being voraciously consumed as novelty. “It's telling, isn't it, that a lot of the AI-generated imagery you see is a remix of other things,” Brooker said. 


	But does it have the legs to walk into cinema theaters? The technology is there, but it's fair to say that storytelling and audience expectations are not — and that's before you even start considering the ethics for performers and privacy.

	











	Attempts to revolutionize the cinema experience through innovation have flopped. Theaters flirted with choose-your-own-adventure-style ideas (something Brooker pulled off on Netflix with Bandersnatch), with little traction. 3D is now largely seen as a gimmick. And in 2013, the Dutch film APP allowed users to synchronize and expand the storyline via their phones, but it did not make the switch to Hollywood. 


	“People just don't go to the cinema for this stuff,” says Sarah Atkinson, professor of screen media at King's College London. Julian Hanich, professor of film studies at the University of Groningen, is equally skeptical. “The pleasure of watching a film is partly based on self-extending into a different world,” he explains. “If you are already part of that world through AI, that's kind of contradictory.”


	It's perhaps instructive that the two exhibition executives approached for this Rendering column did not wish to speak about deepfaking their audience members into works of art. And Brooker would likely be the first to acknowledge the pratfalls of such an endeavor. 


	But that's not to say movie studios are dismissing these ideas. The best indication of this was Disney's shock deal to hand over characters from titles like Frozen and Toy Story to Sora, with the best user-generated videos set to be hosted on Disney+. 


	It's not quite Brooker's cinema vision, but who would have predicted at the start of 2025 that Disney superfans could star in AI-generated videos on the Mouse House's own streaming service? It would have sounded very Black Mirror.

This is the dumbest thing i read all year.

I find, that this so called AI expert and his rendering column is unfortunately really out of touch with what's seriously going on in the industry. Sorry.

I go to the movies to escape myself, not to see myself on a huge screen

Dreadful idea.

Here's an idea. Lower your prices.

clean the floors, bathrooms, stop the ads– we're leaving home not to see ads and to get into an immersive experience that we chose on purpose, not what you choose to show us because someone paid you. Go find some gold in your mine and don't forget to be honest and to declare it on your taxes

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	The official ratings for the 48th Annual Kennedy Center Honors are in, and the Dec. 23 telecast averaged 3.01 million viewers on CBS, according to Nielsen Live + Same Day Panel + Big Data. 


	That is an all-time low audience for the annual special, down from 4.1M Live+Same Day viewers last year when it aired on a Sunday with a football-boosted 60 Minutes lead-in. This year, the event was broadcast on a Tuesday.


	Established in 1978 to celebrate “individuals whose unique contributions have shaped our world,” the Kennedy Center Honors recognized Sylvester Stallone, Michael Crawford, KISS, George Strait, and Gloria Gaynor at the 2026 ceremony, which for the first time ever was hosted by a sitting U.S. President in Trump who previously headlined the NBC reality series The Apprentice.

	“At the request of the Board, and just about everybody else in America, I am hosting the event,” he wrote on Truth Social Dec. 23, plugging the special to his followers. “Tell me what you think of my ‘Master of Ceremony' abilities. If really good, would you like me to leave the Presidency in order to make ‘hosting' a full time job?”




			Watch on Deadline		







	This year's Kennedy Center Honors was held amid a series of controversial moves surrounding the institution since Trump returned to office in January. They have included replacing most members of the Board of Trustees appointed by his Democratic predecessors, Trump becoming Chairman and, most recently, the name change of the memorial to The Trump Kennedy Center, which was announced Dec. 18, after the Kennedy Center Honors ceremony had taken place Dec. 7 but before its telecast aired on CBS Dec. 23. There have been a string of cancellations for previously scheduled performances as a result, including several over the past week.

Don't you mean “The Donald J. Trump Center of Dishonor”?

Trump is all about ratings. Always has been. His personally hosted awards show had the lowest rated in the history its broadcast. He can't deny the ratings nor blame anyone but himself.

Not that he will of course accept blame for anything. Never has and never will. But reality is reality no matter how much he denies it. Like saying an election he lost was stolen or that prices aren't higher because of his tariffs. The man is the gold (orange) standard for denying accountability.

lol. lmao even.

‘Completely talentless and LOWEST RATINGS ever. Why is this man still on the air?'

At the same time – YES – please leave the Preidency to make this your full time job, and then we can cancel you.

Everything taco touches turns to crap

The Kennedy family has been at the forefront of tragedy and heartbreak with the deaths and accidents of loved ones for generations.

Most recently, the clan mourned the death of Tatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of late President John F. Kennedy, after a battle with leukemia on Dec. 30.

The journalist's passing reignited chatter of the “Kennedy Curse,” which refers to the continuous tragic deaths within the family from illnesses and crashes to assassinations.

He didn't report the accident until 10 hours later and claimed he attempted to save Kopechne.

The lawyer died in August 2009 at the age of 77.

David Anthony Kennedy died of an overdose at a Palm Beach hotel in Florida on April 25, 1984. He was 28.

Michael tied the knot to his wife, Victoria Denise Gifford, in 1981, and they separated the same year that he died. They shared three kids: Michael, Kyle and Rory.

John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife Carolyn Bessette, and her sister Lauren Bessette died after their small plane plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Martha's Vineyard on July 16, 1999.

At the time, John, who was 38, was the pilot of the single-engine plane, and Caroline, who was 33, and Lauren, who was 34, were strapped into their seats.

The couple tied the knot in 1996 and didn't have kids before their deaths.

Kara Kennedy, the daughter of the late Edward Kennedy, died of heart failure after working out at a gym in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 16, 2011.

According to a coroner's report, the granddaughter of Robert F. Kennedy, had a mixture of different drugs in her system, including prescription substances, methadone and alcohol.

Hill was found unresponsive after going into cardiac arrest at her family's Hyannis Port , Mass., compound on Aug. 1. 

Before her tragic death, Hill wrote about depression and suicide in high school.

Maeve Fahey Kennedy McKean, the granddaughter of Robert F. Kennedy, and her 8-year-old son, Gideon, drowned in the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland on April 2, 2020. She was 40. 

The mother-son duo had gotten into a canoe to fetch a soccer ball that fell into the water when Gideon was playing with friends.

According to Maeve's husband, David, the water was choppy and the two “got farther out than they could handle, and couldn't get back in,” he previously told the Washington Post.

Maeve's body was found on April 6, and Gideon's on April 8.

Maeve and David wed in 2009 and also shared kids Gabriela and Toby.

Schlossberg died after battling a rare form of cancer at the age of 35, her family announced.

She was diagnosed with the condition in May 2024, but kept it underwraps until releasing an essay with the New Yorker in November 2025.

At the time, the writer shared her cancer “could not be cured by a standard course,” and doctors had only given her a year to live.

Reflecting on the diagnosis, she wrote, “I did not — could not — believe that they were talking about me.” 

“I had swum a mile in the pool the day before, nine months pregnant. I wasn't sick. I didn't feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew,” Schlossberg added.

She is survived by her husband, George Moran, whom she wed in 2017, and their two kids.

Bikini-clad Alessandra Ambrosio posed for her boyfriend in a sultry new set of beach snaps. 

The Victoria's Secret Angel was pictured modeling a royal blue seashell-studded thong bikini on the rocky beaches of Pernambuco, Brazil on Tuesday. 

She wore her brunette locks loose around her shoulders while posing in the sunshine, accessorizing with layered necklaces and a pair of sunglasses for the impromptu tropical shoot.

Boyfriend Buck Palmer — who rocked a coordinating blue ball cap and black swim trunks — crouched down to take a shot of his girlfriend as she posed in the shallow waters.

At one point, the model kicked up her feet and reclined against the black rocks for another sultry photo. In yet another snap, daughter Anja, 17, joined the supermodel as Palmer caught the moment. 

Palmer and Ambrosio were caught by a nearby photographer's lens flirting in the shallow waters and embracing in a passionate kiss, as well. 

Ambrosio, 44, has been sharing bikini-clad photos from her holiday vacation, where she's been spotted frolicking in the waves with Palmer, 43, and other pals.

On Friday, she modeled an animal print bikini in snapshots shared to Instagram, and on Sunday she layered a green two-piece swimsuit with a plunging, butter-yellow coverup while wading in the ocean. 

“Feeling the energy of Noronha and being blessed by salty water, sunsets and this magical island!” she captioned an upload, which included an affectionate selfie with the Australian jewelry designer.

On Monday, Ambrosio shared a montage of videos from the beach getaway, at one point dancing at sunset with Palmer in a pink bikini with a matching coverup. 

She labeled the clip, “A few moments of magic ✨🏝️💖” 

The dreamy holiday vacation comes two months after Ambrosio and her lookalike daughter made a rare red carpet appearance alongside Palmer at the Bravo Film Festival in Los Angeles.

All three posed at the event, with Anja — whom the model shares with ex-fiancé, Jamie Mazur, along with son Noah, 13 — wearing a black halter dress, and Ambrosio donning a white gown with a sheer mermaid skirt.

Palmer wore a black suit with a satin lapel, and beamed alongside Ambrosio and her daughter ahead of “The Secret Agent” screening.

Ambrosio and Palmer confirmed their relationship back in December 2024, holding hands at an Art Basel event in Miami.

In March, she opened up about the romance in rare comments. 

“We just love life to the fullest,” Ambrosio told Us Weekly at the time. 

“We love living life and spending time together and enjoying every little thing. I guess it's the little things, sometimes, that count more. Whatever we do, we both just have this passion for life.”

Jessica Alba and Cash Warren's eldest daughter, Honor, is headed to Yale University in August.

The 17-year-old's college plans were revealed on Dec. 17 in a sweet Instagram post from her elite private high school, Crossroads School for Arts & Sciences.

In the graphic, an adorable photo of Honor as a toddler can be seen above the college's name and logo.

The graphic also reads that she will study English and Film Studies at Yale, where her father also attended college.

“Honor is headed to Yale University!!” the caption began. “We are so proud of Honor and it's an HONOR to send her off 💙 GO BULLDOGS #honorisabulldog.”

Dozens of the teen's classmates filled the comments section with congratulatory messages. 

Honor's younger sister, Haven, 14, also showed her support in the comments, with a few red heart emojis.

Alba shares three kids — daughters Honor and Haven, as well as son Hayes, 7 — with her ex-husband.

In February, the actress filed for divorce from Warren after nearly 17 years of marriage, and the exes requested joint physical and legal custody of their kids.

Since their split, the duo have seemingly been able to co-parent amicably. Alba and Warren reunited to celebrate Easter with their children back in April. 

The “Honey” star took to Instagram on at the time and posted a family snap of all five of them smiling. 

“Easter Sunday w the fam 💐🐰🫶🏽,” Alba captioned the pic.

The “Fantastic Four” actress and the former film producer reunited again in October to watch Honor's tennis match, but this time things appeared a bit frostier between the exes. 

In photos obtained by Page Six, the Honest Company founder and Warren kept their distance as they walked next to each other near the courts.

An eyewitness told the Daily Mail that Alba barely acknowledged her ex and they sat separately during the match before briefly conversing. 

Both parties have moved on with new people. 

Alba is currently dating actor Danny Ramirez. She soft-launched their romance via Instagram in October after being linked for months. 

Meanwhile, Warren was linked to model Hana Sun Doerr, 25, and 20-year-old Seanna Pereira over the summer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Brooke Shields' Daughter to Make Acting Debut on Hallmark Channel","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/brooke-shields-daughter-rowan-henchy-acting-debut/","Wed, 31 Dec 2025 02:53:55 GMT","

Ten years after she last played Charlotte Thornton on “When Calls The Heart,” actress Brooke Shields shocked Hearties in October 2025 with the news she'd be returning to the Hallmark Channel series for season 13, premiering on January 4, 2026.

Turns out that wasn't the only surprise Shields, 60, had up her sleeve. In an interview with Parade on December 29, the legendary actress revealed her 22-year-old daughter Rowan will join her onscreen for her acting debut — and a moment that's especially meaningful for Shields. 

Shields first appeared on “When Calls The Heart” as a guest star in 2016, playing the mother of Daniel Lissing's character, Mountie Jack Thornton. She arrived in Hope Valley on horseback to check on her son, who went on to marry the show's lead character Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow), and father “little Jack” (Hyland Goodrich). But in the season five finale, Jack died in a landslide during a training mission with other Mounties. 

In teasers for season 13, set in 1922, Charlotte is seen back in Hope Valley and seemingly supporting the new love that's blossomed between Elizabeth and Mountie Nathan Grant (Kevin McGarry). They were last seen trying to access a new treatment for little Jack, who was diagnosed with diabetes in season 12. In fact, the season ended with them heading to stay at Charlotte's boarding house.

Charlotte's unexpected return was an easy yes for Shields, who told Parade, “Little Jack having diabetes in an era when nobody knew about it, and refrigeration wasn't a thing, was compelling to me. I have a Type-1 diabetic daughter who was diagnosed at age 14, and this is the first major television series script that came across my desk that had a legitimate Type-1 diabetes storyline, and that definitely hit home for me.”

Shields and her eldest daughter, Rowan Henchy, told People in 2024 that Henchy had been diagnosed with diabetes as a high school freshman in 2018. Now an advocate for others navigating the disease, frequently showcasing the patches she wears to pump medicine and monitor her blood sugar levels, Henchy has since graduated from college. 

Interested in a career behind the scenes, she got to join her mom on the set of “When Calls The Heart” in Vancouver while she was filming. To their surprise, the show's producers and writers said they planned to write a small part for Henchy, Shields told Parade. 

“So, I get to have a scene with my daughter, who has never done anything like that before,” Shields said. “I'm just sitting there thinking that at 60 years old it has culminated into this really feel-good, positive goodwill that I'm being invited to still play in and do, and share it with my daughter.”

Shields told Parade she's thrilled to be back on “When Calls The Heart,” noting that “the show has such a special place in the zeitgeist. The fans are incredibly generous, and it's been fascinating to see how the series has matured over the years.” 

That includes, Shields said, how it's continued to portray strong women in the early 1900s. She told Parade, “I read the scripts, and it dealt very honestly and appropriately with women in this time of their lives.”

“They have to pick themselves up,” she said, describing the show's female characters. “Charlotte does things on her own. She opened her own boarding house with her own money and did things that women weren't often doing in that time period. She's not relying on a man, and it's an interestingly modern feminist approach in the best of ways.” 

“When Calls The Heart” season 13 premieres on January 4 at 8 p.m. Eastern time and will be available to stream the following day via Hallmark+. 



I'm thrilled to have Brooke Shields back as Charlotte Thornton. I'm just disturbed  to hear her tell Nathan he is honourable and as good a man as her son Jack. Does she know the part he played in Jack's death and kept it from Elizabeth for years? That was not honourable and he is definitely not worthy to try and fill Jack's shoes. Jack and Elizabeth were the legacy Mountie and teacher lovestory and it's disrespectful to try and replace him.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","The Family Tatiana Schlossberg Leaves Behind","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/tatiana-schlossberg-kennedy-family-children-husband/","Wed, 31 Dec 2025 15:02:59 GMT","

Tatiana Celia Kennedy Schlossberg died from cancer on Tuesday, December 30. She was 35. Schlossberg was an environmental journalist and author; she was also the daughter of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg and the granddaughter of former President John F. Kennedy. This is the family she leaves behind. 

The JFK Library Foundation announced Schlossberg's passing on behalf of the family. “Our beautiful Tatiana passed away this morning. She will always be in our hearts,” a post on Instagram reads. It is signed by “George, Edwin, and Josephine Moran, Ed, Caroline, Jack, Rose, and Rory.” 

George refers to her husband, George Moran. The couple met at Yale University and married in 2017, People reports. They have two children, a son, Edwin, and a daughter, Josephine. 

Ed and Caroline refer to her parents. She was the middle child in the family, with an older sister, Rose, and a younger brother, Jack. Although they were a private family, they were also a loving one, and they helped support Tatiana emotionally throughout her battle with cancer. Rose even donated her stem cells. 

Schlossberg chose to keep her life private, but she did share her battle with cancer publicly in an November 2025 essay for The New Yorker. She titled it, “A Battle With My Blood.” In the essay, she revealed she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia after giving birth to her second child. 

“My parents, Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg, had brought my two-year-old son to the hospital to meet his sister, but suddenly I was being moved to another floor,” she wrote. She revealed how her daughter “was carried off to the nursery.” She continued, “My son didn't want to leave; he wanted to drive my hospital bed like a bus. I said goodbye to him and my parents and was wheeled away.”

She was shocked to learn of her cancer and how she would need immediate treatment, including chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant. “I did not — could not — believe that they were talking about me,” she shared. Just the day before, she had “swum a mile in the pool” while nine months pregnant. She continued, “I didn't feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew.”

In her essay, Schlossberg shared how her parents and siblings had been helping to raise her two young children. They had also been attending her hospital appointments. “They have held my hand unflinchingly while I have suffered, trying not to show their pain and sadness in order to protect me from it,” she wrote. “This has been a great gift, even though I feel their pain every day.”

Maria Shriver shared a touching tribute to her cousin Tatiana Schlossberg hours after her passing on Tuesday, December 30. 

Shriver took to Instagram shortly after news of Schlossberg's passing to share a touching tribute in honor of her cousin. 

“I return to this space today to pay tribute to my sweet, beloved Tatiana, who left this earth today. I return to this space to pay tribute and honor her loving and supportive family, who came together and did everything they possibly could do to help her. I return to this space heartbroken because Tatiana loved life. She loved her life, and she fought like hell to try to save it,” Shriver began. “I cannot make sense of this. I cannot make any sense of it at all. None. Zero.”

Shriver continued, “Tatiana was a great journalist, and she used her words to educate others about the earth and how to save it. She created a beautiful life with her extraordinary husband George, and children Eddie and Josie. She fought like a warrior. She was valiant, strong, courageous.”

The Kennedy family has endured multiple tragedies over the years, including the deaths of late President John F. Kennedy, Schlossberg's maternal grandfather, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and John F. Kennedy Jr. 

Shriver—who is the first cousin of Schlossberg's mother, Caroline Kennedy—remarked on Kennedy's strength through the tragedy of losing her daughter, after losing her father at a young age.

“My heart has always been with my cousin Caroline ever since we were little kids. My entire being is with her now. What a rock she has been. What a source of love she has been with Ed, Rose, Rory, Jack, George, Eddie, Josie, and all of Tatiana's cousins and friends and the amazing doctors who tried so hard,” she continued. 

Schlossberg opened up about her cancer diagnosis in a deeply personal essay published by The New Yorker in November. She revealed that doctors discovered her disease while she was in the hospital after giving birth to her second child, daughter Josie, in May 2024.

“A few weeks ago, Tatiana wrote so beautifully about her diagnosis and her battle with this horrendous disease. If you haven't read her words, please honor her by doing so (the article is linked in my stories). Her piece is extraordinary,” Shriver added in her Tuesday tribute. “Whatever your faith, please pray for Tatiana and her grieving family. Tatiana was the light, the humor, the joy. She was smart, wicked smart, as they say, and sassy. She was fun, funny loving, caring, a perfect daughter, sister, mother, cousin, niece, friend, all of it.”

She went on to promise to “make sure Eddie and Josie know what a beautiful, courageous spirit their mother was and will always be. She takes after her extraordinary mother, Caroline.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Teyana Taylor and Aaron Pierre Split Up After a High-Profile Year","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/teyana-taylor-aaron-pierre-break-up/","Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:54:20 GMT","

Teyana Taylor and Aaron Pierre have reportedly called it quits after less than a year of dating. The two have gone their separate ways following weeks of online speculation about the status of their relationship, according to Page Six. The reason for the split has not been made public.

The breakup comes during a major career moment for Taylor, who is entering awards season with momentum behind her work in film and music. While the romance captured public attention throughout 2025, the timing now places the split alongside one of the most high-profile chapters of her professional life.

Taylor, 35, and Pierre, 31, first sparked dating rumors in early 2025 after attending the Fifteen Percent Pledge Gala in Los Angeles together. Their connection quickly drew attention, especially after they were spotted at the Vanity Fair Oscars party soon after. Pierre later appeared in a short film tied to Taylor's 2025 album, “Escape Room,” where the two shared a steamy on-screen moment that fueled further buzz.

By June, Taylor made the relationship Instagram official, posting a birthday tribute to Pierre alongside photos from his celebration. The couple continued to step out together, including at the BET Awards, where Taylor described Pierre as “very gentle,” adding that he allowed her to feel “safe” and not “in survival mode,” per Page Six.

Pierre was equally supportive in public. During a panel promoting “Escape Room,” he praised Taylor, calling her “really one of one.” The pair were frequently seen coordinating outfits and appearing side by side while promoting the project, which later earned Taylor a Grammy nomination. Their last notable public appearance together was at the London premiere of Taylor's film “One Battle After Another.”

Even at the height of their visibility, Taylor was careful about labels. In a November cover story with The Hollywood Reporter, she referred to Pierre as her “apple pie” and said they were each other's “safe space,” but stopped short of calling him her boyfriend. “If that's something that I decide to say, then it's going to be something that we say together,” she explained, according to Essence.

Taylor echoed that sentiment in an August interview with HOT 97, describing their bond as “very healthy,” “soft” and “safe,” and calling it “one of the best feelings I ever had.”. Pierre shared a similar tone in an October interview with Men's Health, saying it was a “joy” to support Taylor publicly and that “anything that feels right feels easy.”

The split arrives as Taylor heads into awards season with a Golden Globe nomination for “One Battle After Another” and growing Oscar buzz. She is also building on the success of “Escape Room,” which marked a major return to music after previously stepping away from the industry.

As Taylor once said while reflecting on her approach to relationships, “If that's something that I decide to say, then it's going to be something that we say together.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Vicki Gunvalson's Business Is Going Up for Sale","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/vicki-gunvalson-coto-insurance-update-rhoc/","Wed, 31 Dec 2025 05:01:00 GMT","

Vicki Gunvalson was part of the original cast of Bravo's “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” when it premiered in 2006. Throughout her 13-season run, Gunvalson was known for being a self-made woman working as the founder and president of Coto Insurance. In fact, in later seasons, she's even gotten her son, Michael Wolfsmith, involved, serving as the company's very own vice president.

Now that Gunvalson has officially been invited back as a main cast member for season 20, fans may no longer see the OG of the OC perfecting the feng shui of the Coto Insurance office. During an interview at BravoCon 2025, Gunvalson revealed she's making some surprising new moves with her business, changes that may come as a shock to longtime viewers.

Vicki Gunvalson was given her orange back at BravoCon 2025 and will officially be joining the women of  “The Real Housewives of Orange County” for season 20. Not only was it one of the most surprising moments to come out of the event, but fans have now learned that Gunvalson has major plans with her Coto Insurance business.

While speaking to Heather Dubrow backstage, where she asked several Housewives what they were “manifesting” for the 2026 year, Gunvalson shockingly shared, “I'm manifesting enjoying my life more. I've been working too hard for too long.”

She continued, “My business is going up for sale. I'm still going to be retained as a significant other.”

Gunvalson explained that she wants more free time to enjoy life, and boy, does she deserve it. “I want to do what I want to do, I want to get up, I want to work out more, I want to learn how to dance. I don't know how to dance. And I want to travel more. That's my goal. It's not work all day every day 10 hours a day.”

Over the years, fans followed Gunvalson as she grew her business, starting from a home office and ultimately expanding into a full-fledged Coto Insurance office in Orange County.

Toward the end of the year, Gunvalson and RHOC star Tamra Judge stunned fans by reuniting after a major falling out earlier in 2024. 

In a Nov. 7 Instagram post, Judge partnered with FlavCity Cafe Instant Lattes, a brand she noted is free of toxic ingredients. In the clip, Judge is shown texting Gunvalson to meet up, where the two hug it out and chat about the product. She captioned the post, “Reunited… and leaving the toxic behind.”

The next day, Judge shared a photo alongside Gunvalson from the shoot, and wrote, “My friend, my soulmate, my sister 👯‍♀️🍊 #RHOC.”

Just a few days before their shoot, Judge discussed their “love-hate relationship” with Us Weekly.

“We've had a lot of ups and downs in our 20 years. I always say, we're like sisters,” she shared, adding, “It's that love-hate relationship all the time. I'm talking sisterly love. Like, you have little arguments. And then being on a show together, there's always ups and downs — especially the type of show that we were on together.”

Fans are excited to see what's to come when these two friends come together again for season 20.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:indiewire.com","It's Going to Be a While Before ‘Pluribus' Season 2, Says Vince Gilligan","https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/when-is-pluribus-season-2-vince-gilligan-1235170485/","Wed, 31 Dec 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

Editor's Note: The following story contains spoilers for Season 1 of “Pluribus.”

The first season of Apple TV's acclaimed sci-fi drama “Pluribus” just wrapped on Christmas Eve, but audiences are already pining for news of the next chapter. 

The nine-episode series from “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul” creator Vince Gilligan seemingly came out of nowhere in November, creating a frenzy at the tail end of 2025, which was a largely uneventful year for original drama television. Set primarily in Gilligan's go-to destination of Albuquerque, New Mexico, “Pluribus” kicks off with all but 12 people on Earth being infected with an alien virus that joins them into a mysterious hive mind. While the virus' global effects are seemingly positive — creating a communal society full of smiling faces and absent of violence, bigotry, and class systems — on a person-to-person level, the results are less comforting. Individuals aren't “I” but “we,” and all distinguishing personality traits have simply disappeared.

At the center of all of this is a short-tempered romantasy novelist named Carol, played by Rhea Seehorn, who is one of the “lucky” few to be unaffected by the virus — though, as she finds out during the first season, that's only temporary. As Episode 9 comes to a close, Carol gets the news that “the Others,” as she calls them, are closing in on a way to bring her into the hive, setting up a nail-biting Season 2. (The first season is currently the #1 show on Apple TV.)

 










But exactly when that second season will make its way to screens is the question on viewers' minds, especially after Gilligan and executive producer Gordon Smith told The Hollywood Reporter after the finale that it could be a while. 

“It's going to frustrate some folks, just to be honest. We work at the speed we work at, much like glaciers melt at the speed that they melt at. For my own sake, as much as anybody, selfishly, I wish we could get this job done quicker because I don't know how many years I've got left. I still want to do more things, but I go slower than I used to. So it's going to be a while between seasons; it just is,” Gilligan told the publication, elaborating on Smith's comment that the series “will be back as soon as humanly possible.”

In another post-finale interview, this time with Entertainment Weekly, the duo doubled down on refusing to rush toward Season 2, with Smith quipping that they're at least pointed in the right direction and Gilligan defending their creative process. 

“As much as I am so grateful for the fans digging this show, we've always found our best way to proceed is to be in our bunker creating this thing and not pay too much attention to reactions of any sort, positive or negative,” Gilligan said. “We're kind of the first fans of this show, the first viewers of the show, and we kinda try to make ourselves happy.”

 










Those comments didn't sit well with eager “Pluribus” devotees, who logged onto social media in recent days to lament the team's lack of progress and express frustration over shows taking so long between seasons these days. And we're not talking about just any sci-fi fans here: Even Stephen King joined in the call for a speedier timeline, tweeting, “Vince Gilligan says he's in no hurry to get going on Season 2 of PLURIBUS. Understood, but hey, Vince, if you're listening: I'm not getting any younger.”

For now, there isn't a set date for Season 2 to start filming, which means it'll likely be 2027, at the absolute earliest, before viewers get to find out what Carol plans to do with the atom bomb the Others gifted her at the end of Season 1.

2025 has come to an end, and with it comes a lot of reflection, both in terms of how the world has changed over the last 365 days and in terms of the art that has come out and helped shape the way we look at our reality. 2025 has been, like most post-COVID years, terrifying, confusing, and just generally restless. But one can't deny that it was a good year for film.

To write about film in the 2020s is to spend a lot of mental energy worrying about the future of the medium, with seismic business deals looming to reshape the industry's future and declining box office suggesting that cinemas are increasingly less central to the culture. 2025, though, despite some box office flops and lean months to its name, offered up occasional causes for optimism. A completely original blockbuster like “Sinners” could become a runaway box office hit and inspire audiences to come back to theaters for a second, third, even fourth viewing. “One Battle After Another,” “Weapons,” and “Marty Supreme” similarly did great business, suggesting a real appetite for original stories driven by directorial vision over IP filmmaking. The future of film feels very uncertain, but its present isn't so bad, all things considered.

Late December and early January tends to be catch up time for a lot of people interested in film, allowing us to catch up on last year's best releases before the 2026 film calendar hits its stride. And thankfully, streaming makes it easier to find these films than ever. Many of the best films of the year can be found on platforms like HBO Max, which hosts “One Battle After Another,” “Sinners,” and so much more. Other streamers like Netflix and Amazon also have their own great movies like “28 Years Later” and “Black Bag” to check out, and those venturous enough can check out specialty streamers like The Criterion Channel and Mubi for indie and foreign gems like “Caught by the Tides” or “The Mastermind.”

Here are the 35 best movies from 2025 that are already streaming. All of the films listed can be found on streaming without rental. Entries are listed in alphabetical order. 

Read our review: “Zombie movies are scary because they render the intimate so impersonal that we have to admit there's no difference between them, and “28 Days Later” is perhaps the scariest of them all because its zombies — who succumb to infection almost as fast as they run — make it all but impossible to escape that fact. The genius of Boyle's strange but satisfying “28 Years Later” is that it sprints toward that same idea in search of salvation. Wildly unexpected for a film that's been promised for so long (even if its atheistic bent and penchant for huge narrative swings are the classic hallmarks of a collaboration between Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland), this tense and tender post-apocalyptic drama contends that to exist in denial of death is to corrupt the integrity of life itself.”

Read our review: “Steven Soderbergh's cooly romantic ‘Black Bag' might present itself as a chatty little thriller in the vein of John le Carré, but this slinky movie's semi-compelling spycraft is almost entirely in the service of testing the marriage between two of Britain's most elite security operatives — of asking just how much full transparency really matters between two people who have always been faithful to each other where it counts. Every couple has its secrets, but at what point does love threaten to become a cover story for each partner's own private missions?”

Read IndieWire's Review: “Australian filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou solidified A24's signature horror reign with 2022's twisted and evil-spirits-summoning ‘Talk to Me,' about a party game gone horrifyingly awry for a group of teen friends. They've upped the stakes with a more gruesomely disturbing but seriously, conceptually half-baked new thriller, ‘Bring Her Back,' in which Sally Hawkins is psychotically good and in an unhinged, manically grieving form we've never seen her in.”

Read our review: “Imagine if Michael Haneke's ‘Funny Games' were instead about a pair of lone-wolf, conservationist vigilantes trying to save the world instead of two sociopathic twinks wanting to tear it down, and you'll have some idea of the hyper-contained, rigorously controlled torture chamber that is Yorgos Lanthimos' ‘Bugonia.'”

Read our review: “A searching and scattershot portrait of displacement that's as likely to resonate with Jia Zhang-ke devotees as it is to mystify those who are new to his work, “Caught by the Tides” finds the Chinese auteur returning the most pivotal characters and locations that have defined his movies over the last two decades. Then again, perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never left them.” 

Read our review: “An action film as only “Cure” and “Pulse” director Kiyoshi Kurosawa would think to make one, “Cloud” leverages the social disaffection at the heart of his analog horror masterpieces into a sterile — but eventually bullet-filled — morality tale about the dehumanizing nature of digital communication. The first hour is a slow accumulation of the petty crimes (and other various insults) that the internet allows people to commit against one another from a distance, and with the benefit of anonymity. The second hour observes what happens when those petty crimes reach a critical mass, and the animus that's been welling up on social media spills into the real world with the deadly force of a double-barreled shotgun. Not timely at all!”

Read IndieWire's Review: Ahead of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, political commentators on both sides of the aisle compared the fraught voting process to a kind of national biopsy. Now, “Come See Me in the Good Light” — a striking and airy documentary about genderqueer poet Andrea Gibson and their harrowing battle with ovarian cancer — is premiering at Sundance 2025 against a flurry of new anti-LGBTQ steps recently taken by President Trump.” 

Read our review: “Co-written with Enda Walsh and Alice Birch from a novel by Ariana Harwicz, ‘Die My Love' is a two-hour cinematic miasma of what it's like to be in postpartum depression hell and possessed by a sexual appetite that could never possibly be quenched by even someone as hot as Robert Pattinson. As such, it will be a tough sell for even Lawrence's most ardent fans. The story offers little to hook us onto other than Grace's constant flailing through psychosis, visually realized by cinematographer Seamus McGarvey with the feeling of a bad dream you wake up from in a heated, unforgiving sweat. The atmosphere of this fugue-state-turned-panic-attack of a film is never not intoxicating. As Grace spins out in a hothouse countryside beset by ever-buzzing flies — inescapable swelter and tall grass abound — you can all but feel the ticks and Lyme disease consuming you.”

Read our review: “The first truly modern American Western, or at least the first one that has the nowness required to mention Pop Crave by name, Ari Aster's “Eddington” is also the first major Hollywood movie that's been willing to see the COVID pandemic for the hellacious paradigm shift that it was — as the moment when years of technologically engineered polarization tore a forever hole in the social fabric of a country that was already coming apart at the seams.” 

“Few other filmmakers would have the chutzpah required to make a “No Country for Old Men” riff that hinges on mask mandates and the murder of George Floyd, and we should probably all be grateful that none of them have tried. But Aster, who's exclusively interested in making the kind of films that should be reviewed straight onto a prescription pad, is too beholden to his neuroses for his latest movie to play like a cheap provocation. This time, however, there's a good chance those are your neuroses, too.”

“Stemming from a collective sickness to the same degree that “Beau Is Afraid” was born from some very personal trauma, “Eddington” — the tagline for which reads: “Hindsight is 2020” — only wields its what's the opposite of nostalgia? specificity as a means to an end. It might set the scene with a little “remember how it felt to wait in line outside the pharmacy?” fun, but Aster's bleakly funny and brilliantly plotted assessment of how fucked we've become since then soon leverages those fun memories into a far more probing story about the difficulties of sharing a town between people who live in separate realities.”

Read our review: “Carson Lund's directorial debut shares its name with a slow-moving pitch that has largely been forgotten by modern baseball players — and it's a fitting title for a film that embraces the leisurely pacing of America's national pastime. Television executives have spent countless hours in recent years obsessing over how to make baseball games move faster, but many a true devotee will tell you that part of the game's charm lies in its ability to facilitate socialization. A few seconds between pitches gives the first baseman time to exchange pleasantries with the runner trying to steal second, and spectators can usually find time to buy a hot dog without worrying about missing anything important. ‘Eephus' is a film that understands this, and the script (which Lund co-wrote with Michael Basta and Nate Fischer), shuffles along with the rhythm of a baseball game. Exposition comes out in brief two-sentence exchanges between pitches and longer asides between innings, allowing audiences to experience the game with the same cadence that the players do.”

Read IndieWire's Review: “In ‘Familiar Touch,' filmmaker Sarah Friedland's achingly intimate drama, we follow Ruth as she attempts to acclimate to her new life (and where it will eventually take her) over the course of her early days in the home and, specifically, in its memory care unit. Friedland, who also wrote the film‘s script, is not given over to histrionics or blaring displays of emotion, instead asking us to follow Ruth and experience the world through her eyes. The impact is profound.”

Read our review: “The high-rise restaurant disaster that kicks off ‘Final Destination Bloodlines' has a ‘Looney Tunes' quality to it that some critics will falsely pin on a single falling piano. Yes, there is a thousand-pound string instrument that comes crashing down several stories before flattening a bratty kid in a bow tie. But that's just the cherry on top of a perfectly cartoonish opening to the best film this fiendish horror franchise from the 2000s has ever known. Delivering the most visually impressive, emotionally compelling, and quick witted ‘Final Destination' to date, co-directors Zach Lipovsky and Adam Stein work wonders with a reboot that shouldn't land nearly as well as it does.”

Read our review: “Jacob Elordi plays the reanimated, sutured-from-refuse corpse known as Victor Frankenstein's monster in the most psychologically complex portrayal of the creature since Boris Karloff threw a little girl into a lake. In past versions or retreads, the monster is sometimes the butt of the joke, or simply called Frankenstein (even though that's his maker's name) and afforded little emotional window in service of broader paeans to the dangers of playing God and meddling with natural law. Elordi moves with the physically searching quality of a marionette newly detached from its strings. As the creature, he comes to acquire a voice and autonomy and personhood that transcend any kind of nonverbal grunting often assigned to this character.”

Read our review: “Tim Robinson's obsessive and volatile (but also hyper-earnest) screen persona so perfectly crystallizes a modern form of impotent male rage that it's become a language unto itself on the internet, where everyone leads with their id. But Andrew DeYoung's frequently hilarious ‘Friendship' — which stretches its star's comic schtick to multiplex dimensions in a movie that feels very much like a feature-length ‘I Think You Should Leave' sketch — helps clarify that Robinson's humor is rooted in confusion more than anything else.”

Read our review: “Words like ‘bold' and ‘daring' and ‘wild' will be thrown around — really, have already been thrown around — in regards to Nia DaCosta's ‘Hedda,' one of the more original and thrilling adaptations of a classic work in recent memory. The same words apply to the title character at the film's center, the inscrutable and seemingly unscrupulous Hedda Gabler (a magnetic Tessa Thompson), here yanked firmly from the late 19th century setting of Henrik Ibsen's iconic play into the '50s, and not missing a single trick along the way.” 

Read our review: “Titled like a sequel, plotted like a remake, and shot with enough of its own singular verve to ensure that most people never think of it as either of those things, Spike Lee's deliriously entertaining — if jarringly upbeat — “Highest 2 Lowest” modernizes the post-war anxieties of Akira Kurosawa's “High and Low” for the age of parasocial relationships.” 

Read our review: “Shot on film with the grainy warmth that evokes a sleepy 1970 New England municipality as much as it does actual movies from the ‘70s, ‘The Mastermind' is Reichardt's version of a heist movie — meaning that the filmmaker hijacks conventions laid by filmmakers like Jean-Pierre Melville and Sidney Lumet for a spin that still retains her patient bent for long, luxuriating takes. Here, Josh O'Connor plays J.B. Mooney (what a name!), an art thief who falls down a hole of his own digging, as a poorly hatched job to rip off a series of Arthur Dove abstract paintings from a fictional Massachusetts museum sends his private and family lives careening out of his grasp.”

Read our review: “Additively adapted from Edward Ashton's novel ‘Mickey 7,' Bong's latest film plays like a mega-mix of the director's most familiar tropes. Like ‘Snowpiercer,' it's set in a bleak-as-hell future where the Earth has become an unlivable ruin, and some portion of the survivors have squirreled themselves away inside of a massive vehicle that appears as if it might fall apart at any minute. In this case, that vehicle is a government spaceship rather than a privately owned train, it contains a small fraction of the world's population rather than the whole thing, and it's traveling to investigate the ice planet Niflheim — a potential site for human relocation — rather than just going around in circles, but the socioeconomic conditions aboard the vessel are all too familiar. If anything, they're actually even more stratified than they were in Ed Harris' wildly uneven design.” 

Read our review: “Alain Guiraudie‘s extraordinary and wonderfully twisted new queer noir, “Misericordia,” begins on a long, snaking, winding drive and ends with a man and a woman, who are unrelated and unmarried, in bed, and a light turned out. The French director of “Stranger by the Lake” and “Staying Vertical” reunites with cinematographer Claire Mathon (“Portrait of a Lady on Fire”) for a bleakly funny tragicomedy about how teenage desires, when left unsublimated, rear their grotesque head into your adulthood.”  

Read our review: “Writing about spoofs is sort of like dancing about architecture: Film critics almost never get paid to do it. Indeed, Akiva Schaffer's ‘The Naked Gun' might be the first theatrically distributed movie of its kind since the likes of ‘They Came Together' (2014), ‘Fifty Shades of Black' (2016), and ‘Bohemian Rhapsody' (2018), all of which already felt like relics from a time when audiences were accustomed to such gleefully absurd gag-a-thons — a time when men were men, women were women, and O.J. Simpson was a Scandinavian detective named Nordberg.” 

“We used to live in a country where comedy was an entire genre unto itself, as opposed to a brief distraction that a squinty-eyed Chris Pratt tried in vain to search for between action scenes. But good news! Just like open political bribery and a monopolistic control over the entertainment industry, Paramount is taking a bold step towards making theatrical comedies viable again.” 

“And while the prospect of retooling a cop sendup like ‘The Naked Gun' might seem to smack of the same reactionary conservatism that has spurred the rest of America's recent comeback stories (e.g., measles, coal mines, the McDonald's Snack Wrap), Schaffer's version manages to capture the classic spoof magic without turning back the clock. That's a delicate tango in the context of an increasingly rare — or all but obsolete — studio movie that exists for no other purpose than to make people laugh, but it's one this hilarious new take on the old ZAZ masterpiece pulls off with a rose between its teeth.” 

Read our review: “If the best way to criticize a movie, as Cahiers du Cinéma critic Godard once said, is to make one, then director Richard Linklater's answer to making a tribute to “Breathless” might instead be to not quite criticize but certainly to subvert the tropes of movies about moviemaking. His black-and-white “Nouvelle Vague,” itself a meticulous recreation of a movie made in 1959 with all the celluloid, Academy-ratio crackle and pop, is more New Wave hangout movie than cinema history, with the parade of faces and names inspiring knowing chuckles in the cinephile audience.” 

Read IndieWire's Review: “Decades of mediocre Sundance movies — and some very good ones, too — have conditioned us to expect certain things from culturally specific dramas about young people who return home from the big city and find themselves struggling to reconcile modern identity with family tradition. These characters invariably feel at odds with the heritage that forged them, only to discover something vital and profound about the past they were so quick to leave behind. At the end of the story, they return to their fast-paced lives in London or L.A. or wherever with a new sense of self-possession — one that reflects the grace and strength they've inherited from the generations who came before them.”

“Rungano Nyoni's lucid and incandescently furious ‘On Becoming a Guinea Fowl' is a stiff middle finger to such wishful thinking. Set in a middle-class Zambian suburb that's located at a well-trafficked but poorly maintained intersection between global influences and Bemba mores, the ‘I Am Not a Witch' filmmaker's second feature tells the story of a Westernized young woman who's forced to hold her extended family tree together by its roots during a crisis that leaves her wanting to rip the whole thing out of the earth with her bare hands.”

Read our review: “Until his monumental new film, Paul Thomas Anderson had only made a single narrative feature set in the 21st century, and that movie — a love story about a plunger salesman who hoards pudding cups, gets extorted by the owner of a phone sex line, and shares an iconic kiss to the sound of a Shelley Duvall song from 1980 — was less of its time than out of it. After that came an origin story about the birth of American capitalism, two post-war fables about people trying to sow their own visions of the future, a patchouli-scented lament for the lost promise of '60s counterculture, and a star-crossed romance set against the 1973 oil crisis.” 

“At a certain point, Anderson's seeming attachment to the past became conspicuous enough that it began to appear as if he might be mystified, scared, and/or bored of the modern world to some degree, and therefore arguably less relevant to it.” 

“Enter: ‘One Battle After Another,' the power and the mercy of which lies in how it simultaneously functions as both a backboard-shattering windmill dunk on that line of attack and an open-hearted surrender to its merits.”

Read our review: “The question Alex Ross Perry asked himself before embarking on the mad, four-faced project that is ‘Pavements' was: ‘What if Pavement was the most important band of all time?' It's a fun idea, and Perry's commitment to the bit cannot be questioned. An off-Broadway jukebox musical named after their breakthrough debut studio album ‘Slanted and Enchanted,' a fake ‘Bohemian Rhapsody'-style biopic starring Joe Keery and Jason Schwartzman, a museum exhibition Perry helped devise and that brims with mostly unimportant memorabilia, and an actual documentary all exist in service of ‘Pavements.' If the assignment in making a film about Pavement was part sincere, part fuck-you, a dash of incoherent anti-establishment thought and a tablespoon of self-indulgence, ‘Pavements' understands it perfectly. Making a film about the band any other way seems like a complete waste of time.”

Read our review: “Shot almost entirely by police body cams and interrogation room CCTVs, Geeta Gandbhir's unforgettable documentary crystallizes the horrors of stand-your-ground laws by examining their effects through the lens of a single case — one that harrowingly illustrates the defects of castle doctrines (among other policy failures) by painting a microcosmic portrait of white America's inability to parse between fear and anger.”

Read our review: “If family is the sharpest and most cutting of double-edged swords, few storytellers have ever wielded it with more violent enthusiasm than Wes Anderson, whose movies often start with — and then scab over — the seemingly mortal kind of wound that only a severed relationship can leave behind, and only a carefully mended one can ever hope to fix. In that sense and several others, ‘The Phoenician Scheme' is the most enthusiastically violent film that Anderson has made thus far.”

Read our review: “A raw and riveting documentary that skeptically re-examines the appeal, legacy, and ethicality of “To Catch a Predator,” David Osit's “Predators” certainly doesn't make the case that the child predators featured on the show were undeserving of scorn (and in profound need of help). And yet, as both a filmmaker whose work (“Mayor,” “Thank You for Playing”) has always been compelled by moral inquiry, as well as a person for whom “To Catch a Predator” triggered a swirl of conflicting emotions, Osit is haunted by his enjoyment of a show that was ultimately less interested in crime than punishment. Hansen's theatrics helped paved the way for a media landscape driven by humiliation rituals, and “Predators” leverages the success of that NBC program — along with the tragedy of how it ended, and the YouTube vigilantes who've iterated on its format with even less oversight than Hansen ever had — into a probing investigation of its own.” 

Read our review: “A bloody, muscular, barrelhouse of a vampire movie that throbs like the neck of a blues guitar on fire, Ryan Coogler's “Sinners” is the first story the “Creed” director has ripped straight from his own guts. And yet, it thrillingly continues his post-“Fruitvale Station” tradition of filtering real and imagined Black histories through the prism of blockbuster entertainment, and in a way that recognizes genre as a living connection between the past and the future, as opposed to seeing it as a necessary evil of funding his art in the present.”

Read our review: “Inspired by the loss of the director's wife, “The Shrouds” is a grief story as only David Cronenberg would ever think to shoot one: Sardonic, unsentimental, and often so cadaverously stiff that the film itself appears to be suffering from rigor mortis, as if its images died at some point along their brief journey from the projector to the screen. And really, what else would you expect? I suppose it's possible that the story's deeply personal context might have spurred Cronenberg to push against the tender sterility of his recent features, or even dare to expose the soft underbelly that's always been hiding inside his tumorous body of work and its many layers of scary-beautiful new flesh. If so, it almost immediately becomes clear that he had zero interest in accepting that invitation.” 

Read our review: “A woman sits alone in a dark room, staring at the wall in front of her. Days go by; the paltry sunlight shifts here and there, her outfit changes, yet her dull demeanor remains. She spills some rice, adds some plants, eventually makes space for a mop and bucket. On and on and on.” 

“This is an accurate summary of Karan Kandhari's ‘Sister Midnight,' but one that's also woefully incomplete. The rest should be saved for seeing it yourself, to gain some context for what keeps the woman in that room, for the many birds (and the goat), and for where Chhaya Kadam from ‘Laapataa Ladies' fits in.” 

Read our review: “Let's hear it for concise loglines. Consider the first film from Eva Victor, comedian and social media star, who makes an absolutely major debut with her “Sorry, Baby.” Per official press materials and Sundance releases, the film's synopsis is: “Something bad happened to Agnes. But life goes on… for everyone around her, at least.” Both simple and secretive, hinting at drama and revelations, and promising to root us firmly in Agnes' world.” 

“That's certainly all true of “Sorry, Baby,” but no quick hit of words could ever accurately convey the power and potency of Victor's debut, a darkly funny and enormously tender film that, yes, is about what happens after the worst occurs, but with plenty of room to weave the light next to the dark. Something bad happens to Agnes, but Victor is a wise enough creator to understand that's only part of the story, because that's only part of life itself. And while Victor's film might be rooted specifically in Agnes' story and the bad thing at its center, in its specificity, there's still tremendous room for wider recognition and and revelation.”

Read IndieWire's Review: “Boris Lojkine's new film ‘Souleymane's Story' follows its eponymous immigrant over the course of two days leading up to his asylum interview with OFPRA. A straightforward social realist drama, it invokes the traditions of films like ‘I, Daniel Blake' and ‘Tori and Lokita' by illustrating the Sisyphean tasks that vulnerable people can be subjected to while navigating the government bureaucracies that are ostensibly supposed to help them. But it also applies a modern touch to the subgenre by placing the unique challenges posed by the gig economy front and center.”

Read our review: “‘Train Dreams,' overall, is a lonely movie, with Edgerton in every scene, the most intimate experiences of his later life often residing in dreams — a few characters come in and go like figments of Robert's imagination, something he is often questioning himself. Kerry Condon plays a forester named Claire with whom Robert has a platonic connection, who becomes a kind of mirror for which to Robert to finally pour out his pent-up grief after an earlier grand-scale tragedy. His years worth of grief are like a clogged gutter that desperately need emptying. Speaking of that, Bentley and team vividly construct a wildfire set piece that feels eerily realistic and threatening right now of all times.”

Read our review: “Even before Rian Johnson‘s much-anticipated third Knives Out mystery world premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (as all of Johnson's wily whodunits have), word was already out that this was a bit darker. After all, it's right there in the title, ‘Wake Up Dead Man,' which doesn't fuss about with the fact that as fun as these capers are, they're still about murders. And Johnson himself didn't shy away from that early buzz, telling the crowd assembled at the Princess of Wales Theater on Saturday night that, if ‘Knives Out' was a more cozy mystery and ‘Glass Onion' was a bigger, sunnier deconstruction of the genre, ‘Wake Up Dead Man' was his dip into more Edgar Allan Poe-tinged waters.”

Read our review: “Zach Cregger's ‘Weapons' isn't a basement movie to nearly the same degree that his 2022 debut ‘Barbarian' is a basement movie (few things are!), but this sad, sprawling, and fun-as-hell vision of suburban despair takes similar pleasure in leveraging a high-concept premise for ‘low' genre thrills. Or, what happens in burying a nightmare under the floorboards until the grief and trauma it invariably represents gets subsumed by the full-body shiver of the fact that people were living on top of it the whole time.”

	When reflecting on 2025, Jessie J said it was “one of the hardest but most magical years of my life.”


	Earlier this year, the singer shared that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer and has since updated fans throughout her journey, including sharing the “lows and highs” following her recovery post-surgery.


	“This is an honest story post that will get blown up l'm sure. But who cares,” Jessie wrote in an Instagram Story posted on Dec. 30. “As truthfully in a world full of ‘everything is fine, I'm happy, l'm good, life is perfect' there is Grief hurt pain sadness heartbreak and reflection and processing happening this time of year for many of us, along side the good and great or on it's own.” 


	“This year has been heavy and hard in many ways for all of us, for me personally one of the hardest but most magical years of my life. Personally and professionally,” the singer continued. “But all the sadness has come up this week, it's the first time l've stopped (working and being in public in months) So l'm crying a lot. Writing shit down feeling really low tbh. The lowest | have felt in a while.” 

	











	Jessie added that she was feeling an “accumulation of stuff just making its way to the surface” and that she was “letting it out.” The artist advised, “Don't hold it in people. We are not superhuman or meant to be happy and positive all the time. It's healthy and normal to cry.” 


	Before ending her note, she wrote, “Sending love to anyone feeling this way too right now. No positive end to this. Just I'm with ya. It's shit sometimes.”

	











	In September, Jessie took to the stage for the first time following her breast cancer surgery, a heartfelt moment that also marked the first time her two-year-old son saw her perform live. “I'm just so grateful to be here, you have no idea how grateful I am to see so many of you singing along after all these years,” she told the crowd gathered at BBC Radio 2 In the Park festival in Essex, before sharing that “another special thing that's happening today is that my son is seeing me sing on stage for the first time.”

Travis Kelce would prefer not to recall his time on a reality dating show. On the Dec. 31 installment of his “New Heights” podcast, the football star confirmed that he would rather have his “gooch waxed” than be subject to episodes of Catching Kelce.


	During the “No Dumb Questions” segment of New Heights, which Travis helms with his brother Jason Kelce, the Chiefs player was asked, “Would you rather be forced and tortured watching Catching Kelce on a loop for the rest of your life or get Brazilian waxed like Jason?” 


	Travis quickly responded, “I'd rather get Brazilian waxed. Are you kidding me?”


	Jason, who was waxed for charity earlier this year, agreed: “Yeah. Just rip it off. Easy decision.”


	Despite the pain, Travis affirmed, “But yeah, I'd rather just get my gooch waxed.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







Catching Kelce aired for seven episodes in 2016 on E!. It featured Travis dating 50 women, one from each state, in his pursuit of love. He previously said he agreed to star in the series because he needed cash.

	











	“I was so bad financially my first couple years,” he told The Pivot. “I literally went through my first couple checks like it was nothing. My season checks, all that. I was having so much fun, buying whatever the hell I wanted to do, going wherever the hell I wanted to… So I heard about the situation where I can make six figures in two weeks? I was like … ‘This is actually starting to sound a little better.'”

	











	Earlier this year, he admitted on the Bussin' With the Boys podcast that the series was “the worst thing I ever did.” “It didn't set me up for anything,” he said. “I didn't realize what reality TV really was.”


	Travis recently found lasting love with Taylor Swift. The couple announced their engagement in August. “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,” they wrote in a joint post on Instagram.


	The singer revealed in October that the sweet moment was a long time coming. During an appearance on Heart Breakfast, Swift said she started floating inspiration for her ring to the athlete about 18 months prior by showing him videos of recent work from designer Kindred Lubeck. They were only a few months into their relationship by then, but when she knew, she knew.

	Travis ultimately opted for a grand surprise that followed the taping of Swift's appearance on his New Heights podcast. “He really crushed it in surprising me,” Swift said on The Graham Norton Show. “While we were talking on his podcast, he had a complete garden built out the back of his house to propose in. He went all out, 10 out of 10.”


	Swift stopped by New Heights earlier this year to promote her most recent LP, The Life of a Showgirl. While on the podcast, Swift reflected fondly on how Travis went about courting her. “This kind of felt more like I was in an '80s John Hughes movie, and he was standing outside of my window with boom box, just being like, ‘I want to date you,'” she said. “This is sort of what I've been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager.”

	Jon Blistein



MTV will shut down many of its last dedicated 24-hour music channels after today, Dec. 31.  


	The move, announced back in October, will affect channels around the world, with the U.K. seeing five different MTV stations going dark. These include MTV Music, MTV 80s, MTV 90s, Club MTV, and MTV Live. As Consequence notes, MTV Music — which launched in 2011 — notably ended its run by airing the Buggles' “Video Killed the Radio Star,” the first visual to air when MTV launched in the United States in 1981. 


	MTV's parent company, Paramount Skydance, is also expected to shutter music-only channels in Australia, Poland, France, and Brazil. Reps for MTV in the U.S. did not immediately return a request for comment regarding the full slate of channels that are set to go dark.


	Despite axing much of its dedicated music programming, MTV's flagship channels are still expected to keep broadcasting in the U.K. and elsewhere. Like in the U.S., these channels primarily air massively popular reality programs, as opposed to music videos. 

	











	The changes at MTV come as Paramount Skydance aims to cut costs following its blockbuster (and controversial) merger earlier this year. But CEO David Ellison is reportedly still keen on revitalizing MTV and other cable channels, though it's still unclear exactly what that will entail.

	In September, The Wall Street Journal reported that Ellison had fielded ideas for MTV from major players in the music industry like Irving Azoff, Lucian Grainge, and some big-name artists. There have also reportedly been discussions about turning MTV into an online streaming service that could potentially rival Spotify or YouTube. 

	











	The decision to cut MTV's musical-only channels wasn't the only cost-cutting measure the Paramount took this year. Back in February, when the Skydance merger was still in the works, MTV announced that it would shutter several awards shows, including the MTV Europe Music Awards and MTV Latin America's MIAW Awards (formerly known as the Millennial Awards).

	The K-pop label Ador has filed a lawsuit against ousted NewJeans member Danielle, seeking approximately $30 million (43.1 billion Korean won) in damages. The lawsuit also lists a member of Danielle's family and Ador's former CEO Min Hee-jin as defendants, the BBC reports.


	The new suit comes days after Ador and its parent company, HYBE, revealed that they had ended their contract with Danielle amid wider talks with NewJeans members to return and end a protracted dispute. In that statement, Ador signaled their intention to take legal action, saying they believed Danielle's family member and Min Hee-jin “bear significant responsibility for causing this dispute and for the delays in NewJeans' departure and return.”


	HYBE and Ador did not immediately return Rolling Stone's request for comment.

	In November, all five members of NewJeans — Hyein, Haerin, Hanni, Danielle, and Minji — signaled their intention to return to Ador after their efforts to cut ties with their label failed in South Korean court. That same month, Ador announced that Hyein and Haerin would rejoin the group. In the statement announcing the decision to terminate Danielle's contract earlier this week, the label said Hanni had also “decided to stay with Ador,” and that Minji remains “in ongoing conversations” with the label.

	The dispute between NewJeans and Ador dates back to fall 2024, when the band announced their decision to cut ties with the label. The move came after HYBE fired Min Hee-jin — who was instrumental in developing NewJeans — after accusing her of trying to take Ador independent (which Hee-jin denied). At a press conference, the members of NewJeans also accused Ador of “manipulation,” “mistreatment,” “deliberate miscommunications,” and workplace harassment. (ADOR denied the claims.)

	











	The members of NewJeans attempted to rebrand and relaunch as NJZ, but HYBE/Ador quickly took the group to court. In March, right before their first show, a court put a stop to the NJZ rebrand, while a subsequent June ruling held that the K-pop group must honor their contractual obligations through 2029. The members of NewJeans had originally seemed intent on appealing the decision before ultimately deciding to open up talks of a return with Ador.

MISSISSIPPI — As revelers ring in the New Year and scan the skies for fireworks, Mississippians hoping to spot something more otherworldly may want to temper their expectations.

A new study ranks Mississippi among the worst states in the nation for reported UFO sightings, with just 7.82 sightings per 1 million residents each year. The analysis, conducted by social casino website McLuck, examined reports filed with the National UFO Reporting Center between 2020 and 2024.

Full disclosure: Last year a different company put out a different study based on different criteria that said we're the 4th most likely to see a UFO, so really, is any of this for anything more than fun?

By contrast, Vermont tops the list as the state where residents are most likely to report seeing a UFO, averaging 33 sightings per 1 million residents annually. New Hampshire and Idaho followed closely behind, with more than 31 sightings per 1 million residents each year.

Mississippi ranked 48th out of 50 states, with 115 reported sightings over the five-year period. October was the most common month for sightings in the state, while 9 p.m. was the most frequent time of day, according to the study.

It should be noted that Mississippi had a very noteworthy sighting that has been discussed at length in Pascagoula in 1973.

Texas, despite having one of the highest total numbers of reported sightings, ranked last overall when population was taken into account, with just 7.01 sightings per 1 million residents annually.

In a release sent Tuesday, McLuck researchers calculated sightings per capita to better reflect how likely residents are to report unexplained objects in the sky, rather than simply tallying raw numbers. They also analyzed patterns by month and time of day.

Across much of the country, summer evenings appear to offer the best chance of spotting a UFO. August was the most common month for sightings in four of the top five states, and 9 p.m. emerged as the most frequent time nationwide.

Vermont led all states with 107 sightings reported from 2020 to 2024. August accounted for the largest share, and nearly a quarter of all reports in the state occurred around 9 p.m. New Hampshire posted similar trends, with August and early nighttime hours leading the way.

Idaho, Maine and Oregon rounded out the top five. Idaho saw a sharp increase in reports from 2023 to 2024, while Maine experienced a 29% year-over-year rise during the same period. Oregon, meanwhile, recorded a decline in sightings last year despite ranking high overall.

Joerg Nottebaum, a spokesperson for McLuck, said seasonal and behavioral factors likely play a role in the trends.

“Our study reveals the states with the highest number of UFO sightings over five years, finding that the summer months are the best time of year to spot one,” Nottebaum said. “This is probably due to the lighter evenings and Americans spending more time outside, which could increase their chances of spotting these phenomena.”

Interest in UFOs remains strong nationwide. More than 60% of Americans believe the U.S. government is hiding information about UFOs and extraterrestrial life, according to a recent YouGov survey cited by McLuck.

While Mississippi may not be a hotspot for reported sightings, researchers note that location, weather patterns and population density all influence reporting rates. For hopeful skywatchers in the Magnolia State, the study suggests that fall evenings — particularly in October — may offer the best chance, however slim, of spotting something unexplained.

For those determined to improve their odds this New Year's, the data point north — preferably toward Vermont — and suggest stepping outside just after dark, eyes on the sky.

This study analyzes reports submitted to the National UFO Reporting Center between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2025, to identify which US states have the highest number of UFO sightings. The total number of yearly sightings per 1 million residents was then calculated for each US state to determine a fairer ranking. 

In addition, the months and hours of the day where UFO sightings are most likely to occur, both at state and national levels.

The study also highlights the states that experienced the largest increase in UFO sightings in 2024 compared to 2023.

More from The Sun

The site was going to play a crucial role in defending Britain if nuclear war ever broke out

AN abandoned RAF site dubbed Britain's ‘Area 51' is a magnet for UFO hunters, urban explorers and conspiracy theorists who believe it was once home to government investigations into aliens. 

From the outside, Rudloe Manor in Wiltshire looks like your typical 17th century Grade II listed house set in quiet rural surroundings.

But in 1950 it was taken over and became home to the RAF's police and secret service personnel, covering espionage and counterintelligence.

And thanks to documents released in 2010 it emerged it also dealt with sightings of UFOs, leading to rumours it was hiding parts of flying saucers and even extra-terrestrial corpses recovered from crashes.

Urban explorer Gareth Smith told The Sun: “I've been to Rudloe a total of five times in the past 15 years. The last time I went was a year ago, and it's almost like nature is taking it back.

“I've been there in the daytime and at night, and it's pretty spooky. Inside the buildings there are brambles growing through the walls, upturned desks and chairs, and you definitely feel on edge, as well as the adrenalin pumping.

“Seeing it over the years, every time I went there I went into a different building, and the change is kind of apocalyptic.”

The base was also featured on an episode of the American TV show Ancient Aliens that explores the theory that this was top-secret government research on aliens.

Top secret documents declassified in 2010 confirmed RAF Rudloe, between Corsham and Box in Wiltshire, WAS used as a UFO intelligence base.

It was home to the Flying Complaints Flight, a unit of the RAF Police which gathered reports of UFO sightings near RAF bases and passed them to the Ministry of Defence headquarters.

Ministers heard weekly reports of UFO sightings and Churchill once even ordered one reported meeting between RAF planes and a UFO to be kept secret for at least five decades in order to prevent “mass panic”. 

This is what led to it being dubbed the country's ‘Area 51', after the US Air Force's military base associated with extra-terrestrial  activity including the infamous Roswell incident and government cover-ups.

Wiltshire has long been an epicentre of strange activity, including crop circles, UFOs, and mysterious ancient sites like Stonehenge. 

And to add further intrigue, the base sits on top of a vast maze of underground tunnels and bunkers built in old Bath Stone quarries that was essentially a city able to house as many as 4,000 people.

Government ministers would also have been evacuated to here in case of a nuclear attack on Britain, and there was even a section dedicated to the Royal Family. 

There was also a BBC TV studio that the government would have used to broadcast to the nation while war raged above ground.

Although Rudloe Manor is now a separate dwelling belonging to a local family, the RAF site and its 40 prefabricated buildings still lay abandoned, surrounded by security fences topped with razor wire.

Today, a metal gate covers the old entrance bearing the sign ‘private, keep out', windows of the huts are boarded up or smashed out, while several oil tanks capable of holding 6,000 gallons lie peeling, covered in graffiti and vandalised.

Dog walkers use the old access road for exercise, but locals remain tight-lipped for fear of inviting more conspiracy theorists or intruders.

Despite the efforts made to secure the compound, those determined enough to battle through the brambles and scale or slip through the fencing have been able to explore the eerily quiet site and its abandoned buildings.

Gareth added: “I've explored the camp but never got into the house itself, it would have been pointless. It was left for 20 years in a state of dilapidation. I know someone who's really into UFOs who got into Rudloe Manor, but it was just a shell, just rooms blocked off with breeze blocks and in a complete state of disrepair.

“I've only been in the old RAF buildings though. I just find the way somewhere can be left as it was with signs of what used to go on there just fascinating.

“It became known as the UK's Area 51 because of the rumours of UFO investigations and then some suggested there were old parts of the spacecraft or even aliens. 

“It doesn't make sense there was anything like that, because it was a non-flying military base, it had no runways. They would have investigated reports of the unexplained in the air, and I'm sure that's still done somewhere else today.

We've always known about the UFO rumours, some people want it to be true because it's more interesting

“We've all seen videos of unexplained objects in the air, or UFOs, but personally I think most things can be explained, so I think it's a pretty bold claim there was ever anything like that at Rudloe, other than documents.

“Last year when I went, I didn't get past the boundary because there was security to stop the many people they had breaking in there.”

A source close to the new owners of Rudloe Manor claims the property, which lay empty for 20 years before it was renovated, is still regularly targeted for its historical link to the UFO reports.

They told The Sun: “People talk of Rudloe Manor like it's still connected to the RAF base, but it's just a family home now and has been since it was sold in 2021.

“That hasn't stopped people breaking in sadly. It's happened at least twice in the past few months, with people even trying to take pictures of the children.”

One woman who did not want to be identified said: “We've always known about the UFO rumours, some people want it to be true because it's more interesting.

“The tunnels have long been closed, some of them are believed to be demolished when some of the old Rudloe buildings were crushed into the ground.

“Some people believe parts of a spaceship housed there, but I don't think it is true.

“I'd love for them to open it for tours, especially to see what the Queen's chambers would have looked like.”

						THE mystery surrounding Area 51 has always entertained the public eye, with many theorising what lies behind the top-secret government base.					

Area 51 is located in the southern portion of Nevada, just 83 miles north-northwest of Las Vegas, and is the common name of a highly classified at the United States Air Force facility within the Nevada Test and Training Range.

The airbase is commonly believed by many to be the home of the development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems.

The US Air Force acquired the site in 1955.

However, the CIA never acknowledged the existence of the facility until June 2013, following a Freedom of Information Act request filed in 2005.

The intense secrecy surrounding the base has made it the frequent subject of conspiracy theories, as some believe the facility is used to house alien technology or extraterrestrial life.

The base has never been declared a secret base, but all research and occurrences in Area 51 are Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information.

Conspiracy theorists believe the facility is used to store, examine and reverse engineer crashed alien spacecraft, including material supposedly recovered from the 1950s Roswell crash.

The so-called Roswell incident is one of the most discussed and controversial UFO theories in history.

History.com calls the Roswell incident the “mother of all UFO sightings.”

In July 1947, a rancher found “mysterious debris” and soldiers from a nearby base came to collect the materials.

Then came a giant leap as newspapers reported that a “flying saucer” went down in a New Mexico city.

Forget the grainy footage of 'flying saucers' or the campy sci-fi tropes of little green men from Mars; the search for extraterrestrial life has officially moved from the fringes of the paranormal into the prestigious halls of mainstream science.

For decades, admitting to a belief in aliens was enough to have an academic's credibility questioned, but a profound shift in the scientific zeitgeist is underway. Today, it is no longer the conspiracy theorists making the loudest noise—it is the astrophysicists, and they are armed with data.

A startling new consensus is emerging among the experts tasked with studying the stars. According to data highlighted by Science Focus, the stigma surrounding the 'E.T.' question has all but evaporated. In a recent survey of 1,055 scientists (including 521 astrobiologists), a staggering 86.6 per cent of respondents agreed that extraterrestrial life almost certainly exists somewhere in the vastness of the cosmos.

This isn't just a hopeful hunch; it is a calculated conclusion based on the sheer scale of a universe that seems increasingly hospitable. The study, published in Nature Astronomy and led by Peter Vickers of Durham University, also revealed that 58.2 per cent of astrobiologists believe intelligent alien life is out there.

At the heart of this changing perspective is the Copernican principle—the scientific idea that Earth is not special, but merely one of countless similar worlds. In our own Milky Way alone, there are between 100 billion and 400 billion stars.

When you zoom out to the observable universe, the numbers become truly incomprehensible: roughly 100 sextillion stars. To put that in perspective, there are 13.33 billion times more stars in the sky than there are individual grains of sand on every beach and desert on Earth.

Against this backdrop, the recent passing of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has served as a timely reminder of our cosmic connectivity. First detected on 1 July 2025 by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey in Río Hurtado, Chile, the object emerged from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius at a blistering 137,000 miles per hour.

While scientists like Mike Garrett, the Sir Bernard Lovell Chair of Astrophysics at the University of Manchester, maintain that such objects are likely natural, their presence proves that material from other star systems can and does reach our own.

Garrett argues that the ingredients for life—carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen—are far from rare. They are the common currency of the universe, found on comets, asteroids, and distant exoplanets alike.

'We now know that most stars have a planetary system,' Professor Garrett explains. 'That means there are loads of places where life can arise. Besides, simple life arose so quickly on Earth; to me, that's a key sign that it must be happening elsewhere.'

The challenge is no longer debating 'if' life exists, but determining exactly 'where' and 'how' we can find it. The search has moved beyond looking for microbial 'biosignatures' to a more ambitious hunt for 'technosignatures'—measurable evidence of past or present technology, such as radio leakage or atmospheric pollutants.

In fact, recent research from the University of Manchester suggests that human-made radar from international airports could be detected by advanced civilisations up to 200 light-years away—meaning the same applies to us searching for them.

Mike Garrett remains optimistic about our chances of a breakthrough. 'We're in a much better position to discover it now than we were five years ago,' he notes. 'Everything is going in the right direction for detection.' The rapid acceleration of computing power, digitisation, and artificial intelligence is providing researchers with the tools to sift through astronomical data at speeds previously thought impossible.

As we peer deeper into the dark through the lenses of the James Webb Space Telescope—which has already captured 3I/ATLAS using its Near-Infrared Spectrograph—and anticipate the arrival of more interstellar visitors, the scientific community is bracing for a discovery that would change everything.

Having reached its closest point to the Sun on 29 October 2025 at a distance of 1.36 AU, 3I/ATLAS is now on its way out of our system, leaving behind a legacy of data. We are no longer looking at a silent, empty void, but a universe potentially teeming with stories that have yet to be told. The 'fantasy' of alien life is fast becoming the most anticipated reality in human history.

Sometimes a musician can be so otherworldly that we have a hard time coming up with anything else to give credit to. Yes, some musicians seem to be sourcing power from something supernatural. They don't seem to be on the same playing field as us—like no amount of practice or training could ever measure up to the skill or the oddball artistry they exhibit. The three rock artists below have been accused of practicing the occult. Whether or not those claims are valid, the rumors are unstoppable. 

It all started with Robert Johnson, an early blues guitarist who became a myth when a story circulated that he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for supernatural musicianship. Johnson's story inspired many others, forging an ironclad connection between music and the dark forces. 

While those claims have never been proven, the myth hasn't stopped building. Countless movies, songs, and other folktales have been written about meeting the devil at the crossroads. It's imagery that sticks around. 

Rock artists have long been associated with the occult. While many musicians attempt to push back against that notion, a few help proliferate it—Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page being one. His offenses include buying the famous occultist Aleister Crowley's former home, opening up an occult bookstore, and the plethora of creepy notions he helped inject into Zeppelin's catalog. 

Though it seems Page is likely more of a hobbyist than a believer, his interests outside of music certainly add some color to his career. 

One look at Marilyn Manson had people accusing him of Satanic rituals and other occult practices. He's certainly got the look of someone who'd be into that kind of thing, and while we don't like to judge a book by its cover, Manson's demeanor is more than a coincidence. 

Manson is a shock artist, hellbent on turning heads. In doing this, he's racked up some interesting anecdotes and also criminal investigations. The fact that he named himself after infamous cult leader Charles Manson should say everything that needs to be said. At any rate, Manson hasn't done much to dispel his occult rumors. In fact, it seems like he rather enjoys being a point of contention.

Police officers discovered the victim's lifeless body inside the cell, with blood staining the surrounding walls

A FORMER Discovery Channel star has reportedly confessed to strangling his cellmate after a “higher power” told him to do so.

Chad Ollinger, 41, is accused of murdering fellow inmate Christopher Kelly at the Clark County Detention Center in Nevada.

Authorities say Ollinger admitted to the killing, claiming it was “righteous” because he believed Kelly was a paedophile. 

He said this belief came from a supernatural ability to read people's minds.

Correctional officers discovered Kelly “lying motionless inside a cell” during routine checks on Friday night. 

He had suffered multiple injuries and was given first aid, but was pronounced dead at the scene.

An arrest report noted there was blood splattered all over the walls of the cell.

According to police, Ollinger told investigators he possessed a special power that allowed him to know things about others that most people could not. 

He claimed he needed no proof of Kelly's alleged crimes because he could “see into his mind.”

Ollinger allegedly told detectives in interview: “Good luck cracking the case.”

Police reports say Ollinger climbed onto Kelly's bunk, restraining him in a chokehold while he lay facing the wall, and holding him until he stopped breathing. 

He then allegedly dragged Kelly down and struck his head against the metal bedframe to ensure he was dead. 

Investigators say Ollinger expressed no remorse and claimed he did not care if he spent the rest of his life in prison.

Ollinger has since been rebooked on a murder charge and appeared before a judge, who ordered a mental health evaluation before the case can proceed.

The accused previously appeared on several episodes of Discovery Channel's Mystery at Blind Frog Ranch.

This follows Ollinger and his father, Duane, as they search for a long-rumoured Aztec treasure on their 160-acre property in Utah's Uinta Basin.

The pair have spent more than a decade excavating the land, convinced it holds a fortune worth millions.

Jail records show Ollinger was arrested on October 27 as a fugitive from another state. 

He is also facing a contempt of court charge. 

He has had prior run-ins with law enforcement, including an arrest last year for avoiding police before later posting bond.

It remains unclear why his cellmate was being held at the detention centre.

NEW YORK (WABC) -- As we head into a new year, many people turn to the stars for guidance, checking their horoscopes or sometimes looking to psychics about what's to come. But the two men at the center of this story have been using those gifts for something very different.

You might call them the definition of an unlikely duo, one's a psychic, the other an FBI agent. They're real-life friends and partners who have worked together for the past 25 years tracking some of the most notorious criminals.

And now, John Edward and Bob Hilland are sharing some of the inner workings of cases they've collaborated on in a new book, it's called Chasing Evil.

Joelle Garguilo sat down with them both to talk about the book, how their unlikely partnership started, and how they've helped in countless chilling cases as they hunted evil together.

Joelle Garguilo: I think maybe a good place would be your first impressions of one another. And I say that because, Bob, you were a little skeptical, as I would imagine people in your field are.

Bob Hilland: Yeah, 100%. I heard him on the radio several times, and I thought it was utterly ridiculous, how could people believe this? I heard him one day and I had this response that I needed to figure out if he was a con or not. And it just so happened I had many cases. One of them involved a woman and a couple who disappeared at the hands of one guy, and there were no witnesses to lead to a suspect. So I brought that case to him to vet out, was he a con or was he legit?

Joelle Garguilo: And when that meeting happened, you started to read him.

John Edward: Yeah, I didn't really trust his intentions, the reason why he was there, because I don't do police work. I don't do investigative work. My passion is to help people, everyday people. Help them maybe become unstuck or connect with their family members and friends. But this came in and I kind of felt a sense, we'll call it a sense of duty. He kind of tested me, right? He brought me control items, and then I wound up reading for him. And I think that's where the journey began. The journey began where I gave him information that I could not possibly know, that was later confirmed by his family. And then that kind of cracked open the potential.

Joelle Garguilo: So much of your job must be being faced with skepticism and criticism. Do you feel like that?

John Edward: It is, and it should be. I think we have to approach everything in life as a critical thinker. We have to be skeptical. We have to say, ""I'm not sure."" I want people to be seekers and explorers, and if they're a seeker and an explorer, that can lead to discovery. I came into the subject matter very skeptical. I've remained skeptical in my mindset. I'm always looking for validation and information within a reading that I'm the one who's doing it. I'm always looking to help back it up.

Joelle Garguilo: You didn't want anybody to know about this. Then why do the book now?

John Edward: The book Chasing Evil starts with a little boy named Noah. And when that case gets resolved, for the very first time in our three decades of doing this, it was something that I heard in his voice, it was something that I felt, and there was a press conference that was happening. Up until that moment, it'd always be, ""Please don't use my name,"" and he used to jokingly say, ""No worries, I want to keep my job."" So we were in perfect alignment there. Something seemed to shift when it came to that case. And I think what's important is that folks like Bob don't always get that validation, and I think this is kind of an opportunity for him to be validated in his personal life.

Bob Hilland: We've been on quite a journey for many years. I wrote the first draft of this book probably six or seven years ago. It was just cathartic to get it out. And then as I concluded my career at the Bureau and moved on to my new career, he and I would have many conversations about, ""Hey, maybe it's time we start putting this together."" Because we've been on quite a ride for a long time.

Joelle Garguilo: Can you talk about some of the cases, at least the ones that we read about in this book?

Bob Hilland: There's the Yale University student Annie Le, who was murdered and killed. There is the Michael Vick dog fighting case. There is a guy by the name of John Smith, and then there are some overseas experiences in places like Afghanistan and Kazakhstan.

Joelle Garguilo: If we go into the Annie case at Yale, so here you are, you're there, and you can't find her. You call John, and then what happens?

Bob Hilland: There were a lot of investigators from many agencies looking for this poor young girl. It was obvious that she had been assaulted and likely killed, and the question was, where was her body? It's like looking for a needle in a haystack, but you don't know which haystack you're looking in. I think the second day, I'm at the laboratory where she was last seen. I was with the Connecticut State Police, the FBI. They were giving me the walkthrough, and at that moment, John called me from Ireland and said, ""Hey, wherever you are right now, she's there."" I said, ""What do you mean she's there?"" He said, ""Wherever you are right now."" And if you've ever seen him, once he starts getting information, it comes quick. Now you have to understand, I was not the lead investigator. I was just one of many people helping out in this case, and I'm surrounded by colleagues and associates. And John says, ""Hey, wherever you are, did they find a mini-refrigerator?"" So now I have to turn to these folks who don't even know me and say, ""Hey guys, I got a crazy question. Any chance you came across a mini-refrigerator?"" And they looked at me like, ""Yeah. Where is it?"" So now this group of six or seven of us are walking through the labyrinth of these hallways. John's on the phone talking to me, ""She's there."" And now we're face to face with this mini-refrigerator. And John says, ""You there?"" I said, ""Yeah."" And he says, ""All right, there's a door on the right, and there's a door on the left."" And I said, ""That's right."" He says, ""She's in the door on the left."" I said, ""Guys, we need to go in there."" They open the door, and keep in mind, the whole place had already been searched thoroughly. And John says, ""Hey, she's in the pipes. She's like between pipes or something."" And we're looking through this room, four or five of us, and it's a rather large room, but she's not there. And he's on the phone adamant. I said, ""I'm sorry, John. We've all looked. She's not here."" The next day, perhaps, I'm driving back to DC and my phone lights up from one of my colleagues. He says, ""Bob, you're not gonna believe this. We found her."" I said, ""Where'd you find her?"" She was in the wall between the bathroom and the room. She was between the pipes.

Joelle Garguilo: How does that happen? I know it's gotta be so hard to explain it.

John Edward: So when I'm working with energies, every single person I sit in front of is a case to me. Every person is a case. And I have to figure out who's coming through, how did they pass, and what is their story? What Bob did with me is, if I was a flashlight, he just directed my ability to use it in a different capacity.

Joelle Garguilo: When I did ask ""Why now?"", there's a part of me that almost thought a different reason why now, because there are some cases in this book where the body was never found. The people were never prosecuted. And in a sense, I thought maybe for you, Bob, this was your way to give justice to the victims.

Bob Hilland: You can be the best FBI agent or investigator, run everything to the ground, and sometimes the cases don't work out like you want. When the readers go through this book, I think they're gonna feel like they're a part of these investigations when they hear the conversation between John and I, but I really hope they take away that we cared about these people. We cared about their families, the sacrifices we both made going through this personally and professionally.

Joelle Garguilo: Yeah. What do you guys love about this relationship, this friendship?

John Edward: Not the height difference.

Joelle Garguilo: I know. But also we should say you are, what, six foot eight?

Bob Hilland: I am. Six foot eight. I am.

Joelle Garguilo: Yeah.

Bob Hilland: Well, I think for me, there's been a lot of laughs, a lot of tears, a lot of growth, and sometimes the only way you grow is through pain, and there's been some of that too, right? I mean, not between us, but in the journey we experienced together. We all have, I think, a lot of acquaintances in our life. We have few brothers. He's one of mine.

Joelle Garguilo: Do you feel like you were supposed to come together?

John Edward: I do. I think everything happens for a reason. I think for everybody that's watching this, there are things that are taking place that are acting as catalysts for change.

Joelle Garguilo: Not that this is about that, but for the skeptics out there, what would you say?

John Edward: Stay skeptical, but don't be cynical.

Bob Hilland: I would say that I was that guy. I am that guy. God forbid that any of these people who are skeptical, if they had somebody close to them that disappeared and they had the best investigator working the case, and that investigator ran every lead to the ground. And despite everything, they couldn't find a loved one. But I happen to have this buddy here who may be able to say, ""Hey, maybe look over there."" Would they not want me to talk to him? I went from this black-and-white young guy where life is this. If I can change, you know, I'm the son of Archie Bunker, if I can change, anybody can.

Joelle Garguilo: What's it like for you when you're introducing new people to your friend and you know that they are skeptics, and all of a sudden, he does what he does?

Bob Hilland: Yeah. It's funny. Those moments, and there were a few of them. There was another one with the Secret Service. It sounds crazy, but I felt like I was proud of him. Like, this is my buddy.

Alastair Gunn

Humans love conspiracy theories. From the JFK assassination, the Illuminati and the ‘deep state', to vaccine distrust and ‘chemtrails', the modern world is awash with beliefs in collusion and hoaxes. 

How and why these baseless claims arise, and what maintains them, are complex questions. But one thing's for sure: contrarian narratives are not going away.

Here are 10 widely held falsehoods concerning space and our place within it, which we examine rationally.

It's safe to say they don't stand up to scrutiny…

Let's start with perhaps the strangest conspiracy theory of all: that Earth is flat.

The basic premise is that ancient cultures were right – Earth is a circular disc that is perfectly stationary while the sky rotates above it.

Furthermore, the idea that Earth is a sphere is a villainous lie spread across millennia by an evil, secret establishment.

There are many reasons (or excuses) flat Earthers give for this belief: Earth looks flat; we don't feel Earth moving; NASA has faked images of the spherical Earth; gravity doesn't exist; ships don't sink below the horizon; the tides are caused by Earth moving up and down; explorers who have discovered the edge of the world have been silenced; the Moon generates its own light; artificial satellites don't exist… and so on.

All of these can be easily disproved or logically discounted.

Disproving the flat-Earth hypothesis is surprisingly easy – so easy that the Greek philosopher Eratosthenes did it in 240 BC. 

You can actually perform a similar proof yourself. All you need are two synchronised clocks, two sextants(or other devices for measuring angles in the sky), a car and a friend. 

If you and your friend stand exactly 111km (68.9 miles) apart, but are at the same longitude, and both measure (at the same time) the angle of the star Polaris above the horizon, you will find the angle differs by 1˚.

There are only two possible explanations for this. First, if Earth is flat, Polaris is 6,371km (3,959 miles) above Earth's surface.

Second, if Earth is a sphere, it has a radius of 6,371km.

We can go further and disprove the first possibility.

If Polaris were only 6,371km high, then if you travel 6,371km from the North Pole on a flat Earth, you have made an equilateral triangle and Polaris would be 45˚ above your horizon.

But do the measurement yourself and you will find Polaris is actually 32.6˚ above the horizon. This is irrefutable proof that Earth is a sphere, of radius 6,371km. Case disproved. 

Sadly, NASA is the recipient of much distrust and derision from conspiracy theorists.

The agency is accused of faking climate-change data, faking the Apollo 13 disaster and faking Martian surface rovers.

But these accusations are dwarfed by the claim that humans never went to the Moon, a belief even more ubiquitous than the flat-Earth theory. 

The idea has a long history, first appearing even before the first Apollo landing, and was undoubtedly given a boost by the 1977 movie Capricorn One, in which a manned mission to Mars is faked by NASA.

Conspiracy theorists point out that there are no stars in the sky in images taken from the lunar surface.

Or that shadows, backgrounds, and even footprints do not appear as expected.

They also often refer to the US flag ‘waving' when the Moon has no atmosphere, or that astronauts would be killed by radiation while passing through Earth's Van Allen belts. 

Actually, all of the ‘proof' for a faked Moon landing can be easily refuted.

For example, there are no stars in the lunar sky because photos were taken in full sunlight and therefore with short exposures.

The US flag only ‘flutters' when it is moved by an astronaut.

The Van Allen belts present no danger to astronauts during the short time they spent within them. 

But can we prove that humans went to the Moon? Yes, we can.

NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has imaged several of the Apollo landing sites from lunar orbit.

Lunar module descent stages, the tracks of lunar rovers and even disturbances by the astronauts themselves can clearly be seen. 

Plus, laser ranging of the Moon is only possible because Apollo astronauts left behind special mirrors for the task.

Unfortunately, even these proofs are often discounted as merely part of the conspiracy and therefore faked.

The Apollo project employed about 400,000 people for a decade and cost about £19.1bn ($25.8bn) – more than £180bn or $250bn in today's money.

Were all these people part of the conspiracy? What about scientists who have analysed Apollo rock samples? Has NASA managed to dupe all these people too? 

Frankly, it would be far more costly and difficult to fake the Moon landings than to actually go to the Moon. 

Modern science is pretty confident that Earth cannot be the only place in the Universe where life has emerged.

The Universe is so huge, so full of stars and planets, and so old, that life – even intelligent civilisations – probably exist elsewhere.

Currently, however, we have no evidence of life beyond our tiny planet. 

This has not stopped the rise of the ‘alien conspiracy', which proposes that governments around the world are already suppressing knowledge of, and contact with, alien beings. 

This broad conspiracy theory includes the myth of ‘Area 51', the appearance of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), abductions and experimentation by aliens, and the Roswell incident.

Aligned with this is the belief that Earth was visited in prehistory by ‘ancient astronauts', or that recently discovered interstellar asteroids or comets are really alien spacecraft. 

Despite often-cited ‘evidence' for aliens (and their collusion with governments), none of it stands up to thorough scientific scrutiny.

Claims are not repeatable, measurable, testable or unambiguous.

Most can be discounted, and those that can't do not necessarily imply alien involvement; other unproven but possible explanations can easily be put forward.

Case unproven. 

In July 1976, NASA's Viking 1 orbiter took an image of the Martian surface that seemed to show a human face on Mars.

Later analysis showed that the face was just a trick of the light, the result of specific viewing and illumination angles. 

Subsequent high-resolution imagery has revealed the face to be a perfectly natural Martian hill with some depressions that can, under the right conditions, give the appearance of a face.

Despite this, some commentators have declared this as evidence of lost Martian civilisations and ruined ancient cities. 

A popular conspiracy theory holds that an extraterrestrial craft, dubbed ‘Black Knight', is in orbit around Earth, and that its existence is being covered up.

This seems to be an amalgam of various myths and misunderstandings, and was probably inspired by a NASA photo of space debris taken during a Space Shuttle flight in 1998. 

The idea that Earth will be destroyed by a collision with a planet called Nibiru was first proposed in 1995 by Nancy Lieder, a Wisconsin woman who claims to have been abducted (and implanted) by aliens.

The ‘Nibiru cataclysm' has since gained widespread attention. 

There is no scientific evidence of a planet on a disastrous collision course with Earth.

There is a small possibility of a large Planet 9 (or Planet X) floating somewhere in the farthest reaches of the Solar System.

This could explain the observed clustering of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). Even if eventually found, however, it would not be a threat to Earth. 

Some claim the Moon is hollow and may be an alien spaceship. This theory gained traction in the 1970s following several pseudoscientific publications. 

It's easy to show that the Moon isn't hollow.

Data from seismometers placed on the Moon by Apollo astronauts, and countless orbital observations, clearly show the Moon has a solid interior with a thin crust, thick mantle and dense core.

During its mission to Saturn in 1981, NASA's Voyager 1 probe discovered an odd hexagonal cloud feature around the planet's north pole.

The Cassini mission confirmed it to be about 14,500km (9,009 miles) long.

Such an odd shape, which doesn't often occur in nature, has led some to suggest intelligent design. 

Numerous studies have shown that such shapes can easily form in turbulent rotating fluids. Nature can always surprise us. 

In the 1960s, a myth about a ‘lost day' gained traction among evangelists.

An engineer named Harold Hill claimed that while working for NASA, a missing time period was uncovered when calculating space probe trajectories.

He claimed this proved the biblical story of God making the Sun stand still during Joshua's battle with the Amorites.

Hill never worked for NASA, and the story is completely undocumented. Still, many believe that NASA found a missing day and is hiding the truth.

More hoax than conspiracy, the infamous ‘green Moon' meme began in 2016 with a single Facebook post claiming that on 29 May the Moon would turn green due to an alignment with Uranus, the first since 1847.

The hoax has resurfaced annually ever since. Despite its increasingly tongue-in-cheek tone, it's still believed far and wide. 

Sadly, no amount of reasoned debate can shake these 10 beliefs for true conspiracy followers.

Arming ourselves with clear, testable evidence is the best defence – but perhaps the healthiest response is to accept these theories as an often humorous quirk of human nature.

Fan theories and conspiracies are nothing new in the world of gaming and there's a recent Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 one which has been completely shut down by a developer.

Pretty well ever since it was announced open lobbies would be returning in Black Ops 7, there has been all kinds of speculation about how much skill is actually taken into account.

Open lobbies mean that SBMM (skill-based matchmaking) is minimally considered (but not entirely ignored) when deciding who players will be up against.

Although it was welcomed with open arms during the Beta in October, and continues to be a very popular choice among Black Ops 7 players, there have been constant claims Activision has been tweaking it.

The latest came on 26 December, when one X / Twitter user posted: ""They have cranked the ever living f*** out of SBMM for the Christmas noobs lmaoooo. I've been finding nothing but master prestige players in every lobby.""

""Christmas noobs"" refers to new Black Ops 7 players that have got the game for Christmas.

And in response, Treyarch design director Matt Scronce himself shut down the claims. He simply replied: ""No they haven't.""

Conspiracy debunked.

Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is out now on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC.

As space travel advances, colonization of other planets edges closer to reality. But should we spread to other parts of the galaxy?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The idea of humans living beyond Earth was once only possible in science fiction, but now space agencies are making plans to bring space colonization closer to reality. NASA and SpaceX are exploring long-term missions to the moon and Mars, while astronomers continue to discover potentially habitable exoplanets orbiting distant stars beyond our solar system.

Supporters of planetary colonization argue that becoming a multi-planet species could safeguard us from potentially Earth-ending events. However, it will require an enormous effort to colonize another planet or moon. And if we look beyond Mars, potentially habitable planets may take thousands of years to reach.

But as technology advances and space agencies consider long-term human settlements on other planets, a more fundamental issue now beckons — not whether we can expand to other worlds, but whether we should.

Renowned investor Michael Burry on Wednesday said he is not currently shorting Tesla shares after calling the electric vehicle maker ""ridiculously overvalued.""

In a social media post on X, the Scion Asset Management founder responded to a user asking if he would bet against Tesla, saying, ""I am not short."" 

Burry, who earned his reputation by successfully predicting the collapse of the U.S. housing market that led to the 2008 global financial crisis, clarified his position after describing Tesla as ""ridiculously overvalued"" in a separate post.

""The Big Short"" investor made the same assessment of Tesla's stock valuation to subscribers to his new paid Substack newsletter earlier in the month. 

Burry recently made headlines with a tech short bet. He said some of America's largest companies were using aggressive accounting to inflate their supposed profits from the artificial intelligence boom.

Burry's latest comments on Tesla come shortly after the company took the unusual step of publishing delivery estimates that appear to indicate a lower-than-expected outlook.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of vehicle sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.

Tesla on Monday compiled an average estimate for 1.6 million vehicle deliveries in 2025, down roughly 8% from 2024 and putting the company on track for its second straight annual drop.

Tesla has endured a roller-coaster ride this year. The company, whose stock recently notched an all-time closing high of $489.88, saw shares collapse in the first quarter amid stiff competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, and reputational fallout from Musk's incendiary political rhetoric. 

Shares of Tesla were up slightly in afternoon trading Wednesday. The company's stock has gained more than 12.5% in 2025.

Tesla endured tough year in part thanks to some consumers' distaste for Elon Musk's embrace of rightwing politics

Tesla has taken the unusual step of publishing sales forecasts that suggest 2025 deliveries will be lower than expected and future years' sales will be well below targets set by its chief executive, Elon Musk.

The US electric vehicle maker published figures from analysts suggesting it will announce 423,000 deliveries during the fourth quarter of 2025, in a new “consensus” section on its investor website. That would represent a 16% decline from the final quarter of 2024.

The estimates suggested that Tesla would deliver 1.64m cars in 2025 as a whole, down from 1.79m in 2024. Deliveries are then estimated to rise to 1.75m in 2026 and 3m in 2029.

Musk claimed at a shareholder meeting in November that the company was aiming to produce 4m cars a year by the end of 2027.

Tesla's shares are valued at $1.4tn (£1.04tn), making it worth more than the next 30 carmakers combined despite its output being less than a fifth of that of Japan's Toyota. Musk's Tesla shares, as well as his stake in the rocket company SpaceX, have made him by far the world's richest man, with a fortune estimated at $623bn, according to Bloomberg.

However, much of Tesla's valuation has been based on shareholder hopes that Musk will lead the carmaker to become the global leader in self-driving technology and robotics more generally.

When it comes to actual sales, Tesla has endured a tough year in part thanks to distaste among some consumers for Musk's embrace of rightwing politics.

In 2024, Musk was the biggest donor to the election campaign of Donald Trump and then launched an effort to cut government spending with the Department of Government Efficiency (or Doge). His alliance with the US president did not survive the summer, with Trump instead scrapping buyer subsidies worth $7,500 a vehicle and slashing supportive regulations for electric cars.

The estimates published by Tesla this week are lower than other compilers have suggested. An average of forecasts by investment banks compiled by Bloomberg suggested that Tesla would deliver 440,907 vehicles in the fourth quarter.

Investment banks often publish sales and profit forecasts for large companies in order to judge the prospects for share price movements. “Missing” consensus forecasts often result in share price declines, and vice versa for a “beat”.

The forecasts for later years are also far below Musk's stated targets. In November, Musk said the carmaker was trying to increase production by 50% by the end of 2026, and to produce 4m cars by the end of 2027, according to a transcript compiled by AlphaSense, a data company. However, the forecasts suggest the carmaker will hit the 3m mark only in 2029.

Tesla shareholders in November approved a $1tn compensation plan for Musk, in part on the basis of Tesla delivering 20m cars. Of those cars, 10m will have to have active subscriptions for “full self-driving”, its autonomous software, in order for Musk to qualify for the payment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Begum's lawyers argue she was child trafficking victim when she travelled to live under IS in Syria in 2015

The European court of human rights has questioned the UK government over its 2019 decision to remove Shamima Begum's British citizenship.

Lawyers in Europe have asked how Begum's treatment complies with the UK's responsibilities to victims of trafficking.

The intervention has encouraged Begum's lawyers and fuelled Conservative and Reform accusations of meddling by foreign judges and their calls to leave European human rights treaty.

In 2015, as a 15-year-old schoolgirl, Begum left her east London home and travelled with two friends to live under territory held by Islamic State (IS). She was “married off” to an IS fighter with whom she had three children, all of whom died in infancy.

In 2019, the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, revoked her citizenship on grounds of national security, in a decision upheld in the court of appeal last year and backed by the current government.

Campaigners and Begum's lawyers argue she was the victim of child trafficking. Begum, now 26, remains stateless in a Syrian refugee camp.

A document published by the European court this month confirms that Begum is challenging Javid's decision under article 4 of the European convention on human rights – a prohibition of slavery and forced labour.

The case was lodged in December 2024, after she was denied the chance to challenge the removal of her British citizenship at the UK's supreme court.

Among four questions posed by judges in Strasbourg to the Home Office, they asked: “Did the secretary of state have a positive obligation, by virtue of article 4 of the convention, to consider whether the applicant had been a victim of trafficking and whether any duties or obligations to her flowed from that fact, before deciding to deprive her of her citizenship?”

Birnberg Peirce Solicitors, which is representing Begum, said the court's communication “presents an unprecedented opportunity” for the UK and Begum to “grapple with the significant considerations raised in her case and ignored, sidestepped or violated up to now by previous UK administrations”.

One of the lawyers, Gareth Peirce, said: “It is impossible to dispute that a 15-year-old British child was in 2014-15 lured, encouraged and deceived for the purposes of sexual exploitation to leave home and travel to [IS-controlled] territory for the known purpose of being given, as a child, to an [IS] fighter to propagate children for the Islamic State.”

She added: “It is equally impossible not to acknowledge the catalogue of failures to protect a child known for weeks beforehand to be at high risk when a close friend had disappeared to Syria in an identical way and via an identical route.

“It has already been long conceded that the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, who took the precipitous decision in 2019 very publicly to deprive Ms Begum of citizenship, had failed entirely to consider the issues of grooming and trafficking of a school child in London and of the state's consequent duties.”

Pierce said the challenge came as the current government had made protections for victims of grooming and trafficking a national priority.

A Home Office spokesperson said any decision made to protect national security would be robustly defended. They added: “The government will always protect the UK and its citizens. That is why Shamima Begum – who posed a national security threat – had her British citizenship revoked and is unable to return to the UK.”

The shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, said Begum had “no place” in the UK because of her support for violent extremists. In a post on X, he wrote: “It is deeply concerning the European Court of Human Rights is now looking at using the ECHR to make the UK take her back.”

Also on X, Richard Tice, Reform's deputy leader, wrote: “ECHR can jog on….none of their business …just another reason why we must leave this foreign court.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A leading American bourbon maker is being walloped by waning Canadian demand for its products in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's illogical trade war. 

Jim Beam announced last week that it is halting production at one of its Kentucky distilleries in 2026. Its Clermont facility is a victim of the White House's short-term thinking on tariffs. Bourbon, of course, needs years of aging before it is ready for sale, making trade tensions a veritable risk. 

Naturally, U.S. tariffs sparked a boycott of American products in Canada this year. The Liquor Control Board of Ontario, one of the world's largest purchasers of alcohol, for example, responded appropriately by pulling U.S. brands off its shelves. The liquor boards of other provinces followed suit in solidarity. 

Those strategic decisions to shun U.S. alcohol, however, still amounted to missed opportunities for many of Canada's small and craft alcohol producers. That's because a slew of interprovincial trade barriers prevent them from seamlessly selling their products to consumers in other provinces. 

Ontario changes to alcohol sales could lead to higher prices next year

It is a quintessential example of how persistent provincial protectionism scuttles national goals – even when there is widespread public support for expanding internal trade.

“When American liquor products were pulled from stores' shelves across Canada as a response to U.S. tariffs, it opened shelf space that could – and should – have been filled by Canadian producers,” states a research report by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, or CFIB, a small-business lobby group.

“Instead, rigid interprovincial rules and excessive red tape have left small businesses unable to expand beyond their home provinces, leaving significant growth potential untapped.”

Aptly titled “Bottled Up: Small business barriers to interprovincial alcohol trade,” the report from November argues that U.S. tariffs highlight the need to strengthen our domestic markets.

As of 2021, Canada had an estimated 830 breweries, 508 wineries and 191 distilleries, and domestic products account for more than half of all alcohol sales.

Nonetheless, the industry is facing headwinds. 

In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, federal and provincial governments earned $13.5-billion from the sale of alcohol, a decline of 0.5 per cent from the previous year, according to Statistics Canada.

The federal agency, which noted that prices of alcoholic beverages increased by 2.5 per cent, pointed to a “historic drop” in the volume of alcohol sales during that fiscal year (a reduction of 3.8 per cent to 2.98 billion litres).

Canadians bought a lot less beer, wine and spirits. By contrast, there were increased sales of ciders, coolers and cannabis.

Those shifting trends stem, in part, from price sensitivity (Statscan points to a link between higher incomes and increased consumption) and changing consumer preferences. Many young adults, for instance, are teetotallers.

But small producers also face artificial barriers to commercial success because of a patchwork of provincial regulations.

“Canada's alcohol trade landscape is highly fragmented. Each province and territory maintains its own regulatory frameworks, licensing requirements, markup structures, and distribution systems,” the CFIB report states. 

“For small producers, this means navigating a patchwork of rules and duplicative paperwork, paying multiple fees, and often waiting months for approval to enter a new province.”

The Canadian Free Trade Agreement, signed in 2017, deliberately excluded alcohol to fortify provincial control. Then, in a show of discord, Alberta boycotted B.C. wine in retaliation for Victoria's efforts to block the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion the following year.

Although all provinces (and one territory) have since signed memoranda of understanding to allow direct-to-consumer alcohol sales by May, 2026, the CFIB is right to be critical of the slow pace of change and the potential for more red tape.

Small producers already face differing provincial rules for labelling, product registration, reporting obligations, markup rates and even laboratory testing.

“For example, a malt-based product approved for sale in Alberta will face additional testing when applying for a listing in B.C., slowing market entry and increasing production costs,” CFIB's report states.

Information gatekeeping by provincial authorities also scuppers expanded sales.

One CFIB member quoted in the report, a representative from an unidentified Ontario distillery, said it best: “Liquor boards aren't there to try and help you, they're there to stop you.”

Ouch. 

Internal trade barriers also hurt consumers by stifling competition, inflating prices and limiting choice.

CFIB makes sensible recommendations to dismantle interprovincial trade barriers, including by simplifying licensing and distribution processes.

Paternalism over alcohol sales ought to be a relic of the past. After all, Mr. Trump's tariffs underscore the folly of Canadian provinces waging a trade war against themselves.

Australia's Predictive Discovery said on Wednesday shareholders of Robex Resources RBX-X approved a US$1.45-billion merger, paving the way to create ‍a ​mid-tier gold producer in West Africa.

At Robex's special meeting, around 94.54 per cent of votes backed the deal under which Predictive would acquire the Canadian gold miner with Robex shareholders receiving 7.862 fully paid ordinary shares in ⁠Predictive for each Robex share.

Post-merger, Robex shareholders would own around 46 per cent of the combined entity.

The tie-up would create a more diversified gold producer in West Africa, combining Predictive's Bankan project with Robex's Kiniero mine, which has recently ‌commenced commissioning activities.

These ‍assets, located just 30 kilometres apart in Guinea, offer ‍significant operational synergies.

The merged entity would have a ‌market capitalization of around US$2.4-billion, as per LSEG ⁠data.

Shares of the company fell as much as 5.2 per cent earlier ​in the session before closing 3.9 per cent down.

Robex shareholders approve $1.45-billion merger with Australia's Predictive Discovery

“Investors sell on uncertainty, not headlines,” said Greg Boland, market strategy consultant at Moomoo Australia, adding that the drop in the share price reflects integration and execution risks, dilution concerns, as ​well as profit-taking after a strong rally in gold prices.

Predictive, headquartered in Western Australia, was once at the centre of a potential bidding war with fellow miner Perseus Mining circling the firm as well.

Earlier in December, gold miner Perseus PRU-T tabled a takeover offer valuing ⁠Predictive at US$1.4-billion, higher than Robex's US$880-million bid ⁠earlier in October.

However, on December 11, Perseus dropped its pursuit of Predictive after rival ‌bidder Robex had hiked its offer to US$1.45-billion.

The deal comes at a time of surging gold prices, repeatedly hitting record highs. The bullion has gained over 60 per cent this year and was set to log its best ‌year since 1979.

Cash, checks, and money orders that millions of immigrants rely on to support loved ones abroad will see new costs.

Truthout's December fundraiser is our most important of the year and will determine the scale of work we will be able to do in 2026. Please support us with a tax-deductible donation today.

This article was originally published by Documented, an independent, non-profit newsroom dedicated to reporting with and for immigrant communities in New York City. The original article can be accessed here.

The holiday season is here, a time when countless immigrants in the United States are sending a little extra money back home to their families. But now, many are bracing for a new financial hurdle: effective January 1, 2026, a federal 1% remittance tax will go into effect, adding a new cost to the cash, checks, and money orders that millions of immigrants rely on to support loved ones abroad.

The U.S. is the world's largest sender of remittances, with an estimated $93 billion sent abroad through formal remittances in 2024. A significant portion of that comes from immigrant workers, people for whom remittances are not discretionary, but essential to their families. 

In New York City alone, residents send approximately $10 billion to relatives overseas and were charged more than $500 million in transfer fees to do so. The addition of the federal 1% remittance tax would pull an additional $100 million from immigrant households on top of the existing fees. 

For individuals like Steve, a Guatemalan construction worker in New York City who regularly sends money back home, remittances are a lifeline for his family. “It is very important to send money to my family back home, to my daughter and son who are in school [there]. They really need that money. As soon as I get paid, I first pay my rent, take care of my bills and the rest goes to my kids in Guatemala.” 

The new tax, introduced as part of President Donald Trump's Big, Beautiful Bill earlier this year in July, threatens to make an already costly lifeline even more burdensome for low-income workers for whom every dollar, and every gesture of support, carries extra weight. Under the new policy, the sender will be responsible for paying the tax. 

Steve, who requested that Documented only use his first name to protect his privacy, emphasizes that, for him, every dollar counts. Once the new tax takes effect, if a person were to send $1,000 to a relative abroad, they'd have to pay an additional $10 in remittance tax. And while $10 may not seem like a lot, that's $10 being taken away from Steve's family in Guatemala, where the purchasing power of that $10 would be significant.Individuals who send money through digital transfers using services such as Wiseapp, or Remitly, will not be subject to this 1% federal tax, but for many who are not adept with navigating digital platforms, sending money orders or cash remains the preferred method. 

Steve has always sent money home via cash at a physical location like MoneyGram, as he feels he isn't tech savvy enough to use digital transfers. 

According to a 2025 global remittance survey by Visa, 67% of individuals prefer sending money to a bank account digitally via an app, and 40% prefer to send money from physical locations, such as banks or money transfer storefronts.

Samia Fawad, a home-health aide in Queens, who has a elderly parents back home in Pakistan says she sends money to them regularly, about once a month, which helps fund their “basic necessities.” Samia says she used to send money to her family through money orders, but now she is preparing to send money via digital transfers to avoid the new tax. However, she points out, the fee on digital platforms is also costly. 

“The platform I currently am using to send money back home charges a fee when I send less than $200,” she said adding, “another platform charges a $9 fee on wire transfers. That's $9 taken away from my family — which is about 2,500 PKR — enough for basic household grocery items in Pakistan that can last for a week.” Samia typically sends back less than $200, which means she regularly incurs that $9 fee on her transactions.

Ariel Tang, a tax accounting professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, explains that Samia's experience is not unique. 

“Places like Western Union and MoneyGram — they already charge a certain percentage fee and depending on the exchange rate it can add more costs,” she said. “The total cost is about 3-5% on the amount being sent simply paid in transfer fees, so adding a 1% increase can certainly be burdensome for immigrants when they transfer money.”

An earlier version of the bill included a 5% remittance tax specifically targeting non-citizens, such as green card and visa holders. That provision was later revised and replaced with a flat 1% tax on anyone who sends money abroad, regardless of immigration status.

The Center for Global Development, a nonpartisan think tank focused on reducing global poverty through economic research, finds that the 1% remittance tax is likely to discourage people from sending money through formal channels or even altogether.

“During the holiday season, when individuals are sending money back to family abroad, we may see more of an uptick in the amount being sent in before the bill takes effect in just a month,” says Tang. 

With the tax increase set to begin in January, Steve worries the costs going forward will stack up quickly. “Back home, they're waiting for my help,” he says, “the tax won't stop me from sending money to my kids but it will mean that I will have more fees to keep up with.”

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The advice that legendary investor Warren Buffett offered on investing and life over the years helped earn him legions of followers who eagerly read his annual letters and filled an arena in Omaha every year to listen to him at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meetings. 

Buffett's last day as CEO is Wednesday after six decades of building up the Berkshire conglomerate. He'll remain chairman, but Greg Abel will take over leadership.

Here's a collection of some of Buffett's most famous quotes from over the years:

___

“Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.”

That's how Buffett summed up his investing approach of buying out-of-favor stocks and companies when they were selling for less than he estimated they were worth. 

He also urged investors to stick with industries they understand that fall within their “circle of competence” and offered this classic maxim: “Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget Rule No. 1.”

___

 “After they first obey all rules, I then want employees to ask themselves whether they are willing to have any contemplated act appear the next day on the front page of their local paper to be read by their spouses, children and friends with the reporting done by an informed and critical reporter.

“If they follow this test, they need not fear my other message to them: Lose money for the firm and I will be understanding; lose a shred of reputation for the firm and I will be ruthless.”

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




That's the ethical standard Buffett explained to a Congressional committee in 1991 that he would apply as he cleaned up the Wall Street investment firm Salomon Brothers. He has reiterated the newspaper test many times since over the years.




___

“You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.”

Many companies might do well when times are good and the economy is growing, but Buffett told investors that a crisis always reveals whether businesses are making sound decisions.

___

“Who you associate with is just enormously important. Don't expect that you'll make every decision right on that. But you are going to have your life progress in the general direction of the people you work with, that you admire, that become your friends.”

Buffett always told young people that they should try to hang out with people who they feel are better than them because that will help improve their lives. He said that's especially true when choosing a spouse, which might be the most important decision in life. 

___

“Our unwavering conclusion: never bet against America.”

Buffett has always remained steadfast in his belief in the American capitalist system. He wrote in 2021 that “there has been no incubator for unleashing human potential like America. Despite some severe interruptions, our country's economic progress has been breathtaking.”

NEW YORK, December 31, 2025, 12:28 ET — Regular session

Strategy Inc shares fell 1.8% to $152.88 in midday trading on Wednesday, tracking a more than 1% dip in bitcoin.

The software company — formerly MicroStrategy — has become a volatile bitcoin proxy because it holds the token on its balance sheet and regularly raises money to buy more. That structure is back in focus as investors weigh the trade-off between added bitcoin exposure and shareholder dilution. Strategy

A Form 8-K dated Dec. 29 showed Strategy bought 1,229 bitcoins for $108.8 million between Dec. 22 and Dec. 28 at an average price of about $88,568 per coin, funded by selling 663,450 shares through its at-the-market program. The filing put total holdings at 672,497 bitcoins and said roughly $11.7 billion of common stock remained available for sale under the program. SEC

At bitcoin's latest price of about $87,516, that stash would be worth roughly $58.9 billion.

Other crypto-linked stocks were mixed: Coinbase fell 1.2% and Marathon Digital slipped 1.5%, while miner Riot Platforms rose 1.6%.

At-the-market offerings allow a company to sell newly issued shares into the market at prevailing prices, typically in small increments. For investors, the benefit is fresh capital to deploy quickly — and the cost is dilution as the share count rises.

Strategy traded between $152.53 and $157.48 on the day.

Chairman Michael Saylor posted “Back to Orange” on social media ahead of the disclosure, a phrase long associated by followers with fresh bitcoin buying. Barron's

Traders are likely to keep keying off bitcoin's direction into year-end trading and whether Strategy continues tapping equity markets for more purchases. The company is expected to report quarterly results in early February, according to Zacks' earnings calendar. Zacks

For now, the stock's day-to-day path remains tightly tied to bitcoin's swings, with financing headlines adding another layer of volatility.

Key Takeaways

The Neo blockchain, often referred to as the “Chinese Ethereum” due to its smart contract capabilities and focus on digital assets, has been rocked by a public feud between its co-founders, Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang. 

This dispute centers on financial transparency, control over the project's treasury, and allegations of governance hijacking.

As of Dec. 31, the co-founders had exchanged pointed allegations on X, with each believing the other was to blame for opacity and potential resource waste. 

Neo co-founder Erik Zhang accused Da Hongfei of failing to disclose Neo Foundation finances and urged a complete, verifiable report. 

He said Hongfei will step back from Neo mainnet work, effective Jan. 1, 2026, to focus on NeoX and SpoonOS. 

Hongfei replied  that Zhang controls most NEO funds and consensus power, stating that one person should not run the project. He had long pushed for moving NEO/GAS to NF multisig wallets, but Zhang had repeatedly delayed the transfer. 

“Before today, I avoided raising this publicly to protect community confidence and to give space for an orderly resolution. That silence was born of the hope that he would honor his promise. That restraint has now been misinterpreted. I should have done this earlier.”

This has sparked concerns about Neo's future stability, particularly considering its history of pivots from Antshares to Neo, as well as migrations such as N3. 

The controversy between the two founders of the popular blockchain network highlights deeper issues in decentralized project management, where personal control over funds can undermine community trust.

The latest spat between the two co-founders stems from a protracted historical conflict of oversight. 

Zhang alleged that Hongfei approached him privately, before 2025, claiming that joint oversight was inefficient and suggesting that one of the founders step down. 

The co-founder allegedly agreed to withdraw, believing it would benefit Neo. 

Zhang realized that Hongfei was working on AEON, a new blockchain project with its own coin that might potentially utilize Neo's resources. 

This motivated Zhang to return and question what he regarded as a conflict of interest.

According to Zhang, a phone call agreement was reached, where Hongfei would disclose financial reports and shift focus to side projects, such as NeoX, a cross-chain bridge, and SpoonOS, an operating system layer for Neo.

Erik posts publicly on Dec. 31, accusing Da of failing to honor the agreement. He demands the immediate disclosure of NF assets and expenditures, stating that Da will no longer handle Neo mainnet matters as of Jan. 1, 2026.

Da responds, countering that Erik controls the “super majority” of NEO/GAS in personal custody, refusing to transfer to multisig wallets despite promises. Da pledges a full 2025 financial report in Q1 2026 and vows to pursue treasury transfer through “all available remedies.

Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang established Antshares in 2014, which was later rebranded to Neo in 2017 amid China's blockchain boom. Da Hongfei, who is sometimes referred to as the public face, has prioritized company development, collaborations, and ecosystem expansion. 

The current spat revolves around the NF's treasury—estimated to include significant NEO/GAS holdings and allegations that one founder has monopolized access, leading to a “black box” of unaccounted expenditures.

Community sentiment reflects displeasure with both parties for undermining confidence. Users and analysts describe it as a “governance breakdown” and a “trainwreck,” seeking rapid disclosures to restore credibility. 

Some note danger signals, such as blocked access to reports, which mimic bigger blockchain governance flaws encountered in projects like Mantra DAO.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Blockchain Based Taxi App","https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/blockchain-app/","Wed, 31 Dec 2025 04:30:20 GMT","

Blockchain in New York's taxi headlines is mainly about one company: TADA. The story is not that New York taxis have suddenly switched to crypto payments. It is about a ride hailing platform that says it uses smart contracts and plans to enter the New York City market by June 2026, positioning itself as a lower cost alternative to Uber and Lyft.

TADA is a ride hailing platform that promotes itself as driver focused. Its core claim is that blockchain based smart contracts help connect drivers and riders more directly, with clearer and more predictable rules around fares and payouts.

The company does not position itself as a crypto trading app or a token driven service. Instead, blockchain is presented as backend infrastructure used to improve transparency and reduce disputes.

The New York story is about a planned market entry, not a live launch. Reporting consistently frames TADA's NYC move as a target for June 2026.

The intent is to compete directly with Uber and Lyft in one of the most regulated and operationally demanding ride hailing markets in the world.

In this context, “blockchain based” refers to the use of smart contracts and verifiable transaction logic. The goal is to make fare calculation, driver payouts, and platform rules more transparent.

It does not mean that all ride data is public or that riders interact with a public ledger. The emphasis is practical rather than ideological. This sits squarely within how Blockchain Technology is often used as a coordination and trust layer rather than a fully open system.

TADA is widely described as operating on a “zero commission” model. Unlike traditional ride hailing platforms that take a percentage of each ride, TADA promotes a flat software fee approach.

The pitch to drivers is simple. If the platform does not take a cut of every fare, drivers can keep more of what they earn. This economic structure is central to how TADA markets itself in every region it operates.

TADA is reported to already operate in parts of Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. These markets are often cited as proof points for the platform's driver friendly model.

In the United States, TADA has also been associated with trial activity in Denver. That city is often referenced as a testing ground ahead of a much larger and more complex market like New York.

Public comments about the New York expansion have been attributed to co founder Kay Woo, who has framed the move as an attempt to offer a genuine alternative in cities where drivers face high platform commissions.

The messaging consistently focuses on fairness, transparency, and sustainability rather than rapid growth at any cost.

Launching in New York City is not just about releasing an app. A successful rollout would require compliance with local taxi and limousine regulations, large scale driver onboarding, reliable dispatch in dense traffic conditions, and strong customer support.

Smart contracts alone do not solve these challenges. The technology needs to translate into clear benefits that riders and drivers can feel immediately.

What is clear:

What is not confirmed:

Uber and Lyft are not just apps. They are deeply optimized marketplaces with pricing engines, incentive systems, and local playbooks refined over years.

TADA's challenge is not technological novelty. It is economic pressure. If a flat fee, low take model can work at scale in New York, it raises uncomfortable questions about commission heavy platforms.

At the same time, riders care about reliability first. Price, availability, and support will matter more than the underlying technology label.

This story is a case study in how business models and infrastructure choices intersect.

Smart contracts can improve trust and clarity, but they do not replace operational excellence. Lower platform fees can attract drivers, but only if rider demand is consistent. Transparency must show up in simple, visible ways inside the app.

For teams building in this space, understanding smart contract systems through a Blockchain Course helps with infrastructure design, while an AI Course is relevant for pricing, matching, fraud detection, and customer support automation.

Execution focused teams often also lean on a Tech Certification to align architecture with production realities, and a Marketing and business certification to understand driver acquisition and city by city expansion strategy.

New York's “blockchain based taxi app” narrative is primarily about TADA, a ride hailing platform planning a June 2026 entry into the NYC market. The platform promotes smart contracts and a zero commission economic model aimed at drivers.

The app is not live in New York today. Its success will depend far more on execution, compliance, and rider experience than on the blockchain label itself. The reason the story matters is simple. If TADA can scale a low fee model in one of the hardest ride hailing markets in the world, it could force a rethink of how these platforms operate.

The Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in December withdrew its previously issued guidance concerning the meaning of the term “actual delivery” in the Commodities Exchange Act (CEA) as it applies to digital asset transactions. In a brief statement in the Federal Register, the agency said it was voiding the “in order to reevaluate such guidance in light of further developments during the past 5 years” in the spot market for virtual currencies and derivatives.

The statement also pointed to the ongoing work of the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets as a reason for withdrawing the earlier guidance.

“After careful review, the Commission believes that the Final VC Actual Delivery Guidance is likely outdated and thus provides limited value to market participants and, further, may conflict with the ongoing work of the Commission necessary to implement the President's Working Group's recommendations,” the statement said.

The CFTC historically has maintained that speculative commodities transactions involving leverage or margin are futures contracts subject to the agency's jurisdiction. But certain transactions are exempt from regulation under the CEA, including those that result in “actual delivery within 28 days.”

However, the agency has long struggled to define the term “actual delivery” and has issued evolving interpretive guidance over the years, according to client bulletin by Benesch on the CFTC's latest move. In 2013, the CFTC issued a “final interpretation” of “actual delivery” in the context of margined, financed or leveraged retail commodity transactions generally. And in 2020, it issued the now-withdrawn “interpretive guidance” setting out the agency's views on determining whether actual delivery has occurred with respect to virtual currencies.

Benesch speculates that one reason behind the CFTC's withdrawal of the 2020 guidance is to clear the field for a new statutory framework for digital asset markets currently being debated in Congress. Notably, the withdrawal statement did not replace the 2020 guidance, perhaps out of concern that any new guidance could become entrenched before a new statutory regime potentially renders it obsolete.

Whether such new statutory framework is forthcoming in the near term, however, is an open question. Action on digital asset market legislation has stalled in the Senate amid partisan differences. According to Decrypt, some crypto industry insiders now view the legislation as far too complicated and touching on too many politically sensitive issues to pass before Congress effectively grinds to a halt ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

Others see less urgency in is passing market-structure legislation in 2026, per Decrypt. They point to key victories for the industry in new regulations issued by CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that will be difficult for a new administration to unravel, even in lieu of new legislation.

“As soon as we get a token safe harbor, it's over for market structure,” one crypto policy leader told Decrypt, referring to an SEC exemption for crypto projects expected to roll out in January.

For now, however, uncertainty reigns. The prevailing official guidance on whether digital currency transactions are exempt from futures regulation under the “actual delivery” standard has been voided without being replaced and any legislative path forward on clarifying the rule may be blocked at least until 2027.

Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT), the company behind Truth Social, said Wednesday it plans to distribute a new digital token to shareholders through a deal with Crypto.com.

The token will be issued using Crypto.com's Cronos blockchain. Trump Media said in a press release that once the program launches, each shareholder would receive one token for every whole share of DJT held.

Token holders may also periodically receive rewards throughout the year, including potential benefits or discounts tied to Trump Media's products, such as Truth Social, the Truth+ streaming service and Truth Predict, the company said.

U.S. president Donald Trump is the majority owner of Trump Media and Technology  and has spoken favorable about the crypto industry in 2025, stating in November that he wants the U.S. to become a ""bitcoin superpower.""

“We look forward to utilizing Crypto.com's blockchain technology and improving regulatory clarity to implement this first-of-its-kind token distribution, reward Trump Media shareholders, and promote fair and transparent markets,” CEO and chairman Devin Nunes said in a statement.

Shares of Trump Media rose in pre-market trading, with DJT up to $12.97, a gain of 3.18%. Crypto.com's native token, CRO, initially jumped 3.8% following the announcement before giving back some of those gains.

Trump Media said additional details about the token distribution are expected to be announced in the new year.

In the mid-1920s, two absolute giants in the world of physics, Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein, theorized the existence of a strange quantum state of matter that'd eventually be named in their honor: the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The 20th century luminaries figured that if particles  were cooled to ultracold temperatures—mere fractions of degrees away from absolute zero (-459.67 °F)—and kept at low densities, they'd form an indistinguishable whole. 

Fast-forward some 70 years later, scientists from the University of Colorado at Boulder proved Einstein and Bose correct. Since then, BECs have been a vital tool for exploring the quantum properties of atoms, and a series of advancements—whether getting the particles even cooler or getting them to form diatomic molecules—have made them more and more useful in the search for the underlying physics that governs the universe. 

Now, physicists from Columbia University—in collaboration with Radboud University in the Netherlands—have taken the next step of this century-long BEC journey by creating a sodium-cesium condensate that's only five nanoKelvin above absolute zero. While that's an impressively cold temperature, the most important part of this impressive piece of experimental physics is that the resulting BEC is dipolar, meaning it has both a positive and a negative charge. 

 The team utilized a previously peer-reviewed technique that uses microwaves to cross “the BEC threshold,” according to a press statement. The results of this study were published in the journal Nature.

“By controlling these dipolar interactions, we hope to create new quantum states and phases of matter,” Columbia postdoc Ian Stevenson, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. 

Microwaves are usually associated with heating things up, but study collaborator Tijs Karman from Radboud University suggested that microwaves can act like shields and essentially protect molecules from lossy collisions while hot molecules are removed from a sample, which has an overall cooling effect. The team tried the microwave technique in 2023, but this new study added a second microwave field that proved more effective at creating the desired BEC. 

“We really have a good idea of the interactions in this system, which is also critical for the next steps, like exploring dipolar many-body physics,” Karman, who was also a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “We've come up with schemes to control interactions, tested these in theory, and implemented them in the experiment. It's been really an amazing experience to see these ideas for microwave ‘shielding' being realized in the lab.”

The creation of this dipolar BEC opens the door to the creation of many other forms of exotic matter, such as “exotic dipolar droplets, self-organized crystal phases, and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices,” according to the paper. But those are only a few of the dozens of possible applications that this new BEC could help realize. Because this experiment enables precise control over quantum interactions—according to Jun Ye, an ultracold scientist at UC-Boulder—the impacts on quantum chemistry could also be pretty profound.

The universe's little-known fifth state of matter continues to surprise us more than a century after its startling introduction into the known world of physics.

Hidden Guests: Migrating Cells and How the New Science of Microchimerism is Redefining Human Identity Lise Barnéoud, transl. Bronwyn Haslam Greystone Books (2025)

The chimaera of Greek mythology was “an evil creature with a lion's head, a goat's body, and a serpent's tail”, notes journalist Lise Barnéoud in Hidden Guests. Humans are also chimaeras — thanks to the presence of cells that are not our own inside our bodies.

Could baby's first bacteria take root before birth?

Could baby's first bacteria take root before birth?

Mothers carry cells that came from their biological children, passed across the placenta when the baby was in the womb. Likewise, children carry cells that were transferred to them in utero from their mothers — some of which might even be from the child's maternal grandmothers, older siblings or twin.

These ‘microchimeric' cells have been found in every organ that has been studied so far. But they are also rare — much rarer, for example, than the trillions of microorganisms that reside in our guts, on our skin and in many other organs. We carry only one microchimeric cell for every 10,000 to 1 million of our own cells.

In Hidden Guests, the author invites readers to learn about the pioneering “microchimerists” — scientists who discovered these fascinating shared cells. She also challenges us to consider the broader implications for health and science, and the philosophy of the fact that we are all chimaeras.

Microchimeric cells were, we learn, discovered through a series of accidental observations. In the late 1800s, pathologist Georg Schmorl described ‘giant cells' in the lungs of people who had died from eclampsia — a life-threatening inflammatory condition that can occur during pregnancy. These giant cells resembled the cells of the placenta, leading Schmorl to suggest that fetal cells passing into the bloodstream of mothers was the norm, rather than the exception.

The probiotic home: where microbes are welcome guests

Then, in 1969, a team studying immunity in pregnant people detected white blood cells that contained the Y chromosome in the blood of individuals who would eventually give birth to boys1. For more than two decades, it was presumed that these microchimeric cells were a temporary feature of pregnancy. It wasn't until 1993 that geneticist Diana Bianchi found cells with Y chromosomes in women who had given birth to sons between one and 27 years earlier2.

This finding overturned the dogma that children inherit genes from their parents and never the other way around — these transferred fetal cells move through the family tree, travelling ‘backwards in time' from children to their mothers. Bianchi and others would go on to show that these cells have remarkable regenerative properties — promoting wound healing in mothers by transforming into blood vessels or skin cells.

Microchimerism also calls into question a central tenet of immunology: that the immune system works by classifying cells in a binary fashion, as ‘self' or ‘non-self'. Under this simplistic model, microchimeric cells should trigger an immune response and be rejected by the body — but they do not. Barnéoud challenges readers to consider whether forcing microchimerism-related discrepancies to fit into existing immunological rules is appropriate, instead of allowing these cells to influence new immunological rules.

At around the same time that Bianchi was making her groundbreaking discovery, rheumatologist Lee Nelson also found Y-chromosome-containing cells in people who had previously given birth to sons3. Nelson was studying autoimmune diseases, which disproportionately affect middle-aged women, and at the time were thought to be caused by hormone imbalances.

A preprint version of the article is available at bioRxiv.

Single-cell large language models (scLLMs) capture essential biological insights from vast single-cell atlases but struggle in out-of-context applications, where zero-shot predictions can be unreliable. To address this, here we introduce a single-cell parameter-efficient fine-tuning (scPEFT) framework that integrates learnable, low-dimensional adapters into scLLMs. By freezing the backbone model and updating only the adapter parameters, scPEFT efficiently adapts to specific tasks using limited custom data. This approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, reduces parameter tuning by over 96% and decreases GPU memory usage by more than half, thus substantially enhancing the accessibility of scLLMs for resource-constrained researchers. When validated across diverse datasets, scPEFT outperformed zero-shot models and traditional fine-tuning in disease-specific, cross-species and undercharacterized cell population tasks. Its attention-mechanism analysis identified COVID-related genes associated with specific cell states and uncovered unique blood cell subpopulations, demonstrating the capacity of scPEFT for condition-specific interpretations. These findings position scPEFT as an efficient solution for enhancing the utility of scLLMs in general single-cell analyses.

The violin plots benchmark native, finetuned scGPT, and scPEFT using scGPT pre-trained weights from whole human data, pan-cancer data, and lung-specific data. Statistical significance between scPEFT and other models was assessed using a paired two-sided Student's t-test across the five-fold validation results (n = 5 independent validation tests). On each box, the central mark indicates the median, and the bottom and top edges of the box indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles. The whiskers extend to the most extreme data points without outliers, and the outliers are plotted individually as circles.

a-d, Confusion matrices for native, finetuned scLLMs, and scPEFT with (a) scBERT, (b) Geneformer, (c) scFoundation and (d) scGPT as respective backbones. Each cell reflects the percentage of instances from the row-defined cell type that are predicted as the column-defined cell type. High values along the diagonal indicate accurate predictions, while off-diagonal values represent misclassifications. The results exhibit the superior performance of scPEFT, particularly in identifying rare cell types (proportion < 5%). Notably, CD4+ enriched proliferation T cells were accurately identified by native scLLMs but misclassified by finetuned models, demonstrating an instance of catastrophic forgetting. This issue was not observed by scPEFT and was marked by the red boxes. e, Bar plot depicting the proportion of each cell type in the dataset.

Notably, multiple cell types were accurately identified by native scLLMs but misclassified by their finetuned models, demonstrating clear instances of catastrophic forgetting. This issue was not observed by scPEFT and was marked by the red boxes. e, Bar plot depicting the proportion of each cell type in the dataset.

Histograms of differential attention scores were derived from (a) native, (b) finetuned scGPT, and (c) scPEFT models, respectively, in analysis of COVID-related cell-state-specific genes in Memory CD8+ T cells versus Naïve Memory CD8+ T cells. Histograms were generated for the top, middle, and last Transformer layers in these models. Red crosses mark the bins where genes of interest (CCL5, GZMK, and CST7) were located.

The COVID-related cell-state-specific genes were analyzed in the comparisons of (a) Memory CD8+ T cells versus Naïve Memory CD8+ T cells, and (b) Effector Memory CD8+ T cells versus Memory CD8+ T cells, respectively. Volcano plots of Differential Gene Expression (DEG) analysis are colored by differential attention scores from native scGPT, finetuned scGPT, and scPEFT trained on the COVID dataset. The top attention genes of interest were highlighted with their names. Dot size reflects the genes' adjusted p-values from DEG. Statistical significance was determined using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test with Benjamini-Yekutieli false discovery rate control. n = 1950 and 973 cells were used for the test cases, respectively.

n = 5 independent validation tests were conducted. On each box, the central mark indicates the median, and the bottom and top edges of the box indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles. The whiskers extend to the most extreme data points without outliers, and the outliers are plotted individually as circles.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Oh No! A Free Scale That Tells Me My Stress Levels and Body Fat","https://www.wired.com/story/factor-withings-deal/","Wed, 31 Dec 2025 12:31:00 GMT","

I will admit to being afraid of scales—the kind that weigh you, not the ones on a snake. And so my first reaction to the idea I'd be getting a free body-scanning scale with a Factor prepared meal kit subscription was something akin to “Oh no!”

It's always bad or shameful news, I figured, and maybe nothing I don't already know. Though, as it turned out, I was wrong on both points.

Factor is, of course, the prepared meal brand from meal kit giant HelloFresh, which I've tested while reviewing dozens of meal kits this past year. Think delivery TV dinners, but actually fresh and never frozen. Factor meals are meant to be microwaved, but I found when I reviewed Factor last year that the meals actually tasted much better if you air-fry them (ideally using a Ninja Crispi, the best reheating device I know).

Especially, Factor excels at the low-carb and protein-rich diet that has become equally fashionable among people who want to lose weight and people who like to lift it. Hence, this scale. Factor would like you to be able to track your progress in gaining muscle mass, losing fat, or both. And then presumably keep using Factor to make your fitness or wellness goals.

While your first week of Factor comes at a discount right now, regular-price meals will be $14 to $15 a serving, plus $11 shipping per box. That's less than most restaurant delivery, but certainly more than if you were whipping up these meals yourself.

If you subscribe between now and the end of March, the third Factor meal box will come with a free Withings Body Comp scale, which generally retails north of $200. The Withings doesn't just weigh you. It scans your proportions of fat and bone and muscle, and indirectly measures stress levels and the elasticity of your blood vessels. It is, in fact, WIRED's favorite smart scale, something like a fitness watch for your feet.

Anyway, to get the deal, use the code CONWITHINGS on Factor's website, or follow the promo code link below.

The scale that comes with the Factor subscription is about as fancy as it gets: a $200 Body Comp scale from high-tech fitness monitoring company Withings. The scale uses bioelectrical impedance analysis and some other proprietary methods in order to measure not just your weight but your body fat percentage, your lean muscle mass, your visceral fat, and your bone and water mass, your pulse rate, and even the stiffness of your arteries.

To get all this information, all you really need to do is stand on the scale for a few minutes. The scale will recognize you based on your weight (you'll need to be accurate in describing yourself when you set up your profile for this to work), and then cycle through a series of measurements before giving you a cheery weather report for the day.

Your electrodermal activity—the “skin response via sweat gland stimulation in your feet""—provides a gauge of stress, or at least excitation. The Withings also purports to measure your arterial age, or stiffness, via the velocity of your blood with each heartbeat. This sounds esoteric, but it has some scientific backing.

Note that many physicians caution against taking indirect measurements of body composition as gospel. Other physicians counter that previous “gold standard” measurements aren't perfectly accurate, either. It's a big ol' debate. For myself, I tend to take smart-scale measurements as a convenient way to track progress, and also a good home indicator for when there's a problem that may require attention from a physician.

And so of course, I was petrified. So much bad news to get all at once! I figured.

Anyway, it didn't quite turn out that way. Sure, I got some news that wasn't news at all: I am no longer at my high school wrestling weight. I am, at 6'1"", on the wrong side of 200 pounds to gain any particular congratulations about my body mass index. My body fat percentage is too high, and my complementary lean muscle percentage therefore too low. The smart scale, like my smart doctor, would like me to go to the gym and to eat a bit more like Jack Sprat than his wife.

This is the scolding I expected. But the rest of the numbers were actually a bit heartening. Whatever the raw numbers, the visceral fat index known to indicate all sorts of terrible troubles fell in the OK range. So did my stress levels, my water content, my bone mass, and my pulse rate. My arterial stiffness was seemingly precisely age-appropriate. There's hope for me yet, it would appear.

The stats amounted to a bit of encouragement that the situation remained quite retrievable. And while the granular detail about fat-muscle percentage wasn't flattering, the detail gives me multiple paths for improvement.

It caused me to think about a friend of mine, who complained daily that his scale showed no improvement even though he quit drinking and has been hitting the gym. Clearly, he looks fitter, but he had no means of measuring his progress. He's been losing heart. He probably needs this scale, or another smart scale a bit like it. But at least in my case, the ability to gain ground multiple ways amounts to its own form of inspiration.

Note that the raw information I described comes free with the scale, but to get full access to all the health data and improvement plans Withings offers, you'll need the company's Withings+ subscription. At a cost of $8 to $10 a month, the subscription service will offer advice on what to do with the new data points you've been offered, as well as some more sophisticated health trend data.

Factor meals aren't free, if that subscription is part of what helps you meet your fitness and wellness goals. A gym membership also, presumably, costs. Have you considered hard labor?

In any case, the one thing that's free is the scale, after your first few weeks of the meal kit. To get access to the deal, use the promo code CONWITHINGS or click on the button below. Take note that it's a “while supplies last” kinda deal. Which is to say, sooner is better than later if you want to ensure availability.

This seems really similar to the motivations around masked language modeling. By providing increasingly-masked targets over time, a smooth difficulty curve can be established. Randomly masking X% of the tokens/bytes is trivial to implement. MLM can take a small corpus and turn it into an astronomically large one.

If you sat down to solve a problem you've never seen before you wouldn't even know what a valid “later state” looking like.

The happy Tetris bug is also a neat example of how “bad” inputs can act like curriculum or data augmentation. Corrupted observations forced the policy to be robust to chaos early, which then paid off when the game actually got hard. That feels very similar to tricks in other domains where we deliberately randomize or mask parts of the input. It makes me wonder how many surprisingly strong RL systems in the wild are really powered by accidental curricula that nobody has fully noticed or formalized yet.

I'm not sure what the author expects the program to do when there's an internal logic error that has no known cause and no definite recovery path. Further down the article, the author suggests bubbling up the error with a result type, but you can only bubble it up so far before you have to get rid of it one way or another. Unless you bubble everything all the way to the top, but then you've just reinvented unchecked exceptions.At some level, the simplest thing to do is to give up and crash if things are no longer sane. After all, there's no guarantee that 'unreachable' recovery paths won't introduce further bugs or vulnerabilities. Logging can typically be done just fine within a top-level exception handler or panic handler in many languages.

Yes, sometimes, the compiler or the hardware have bugs that violate the premises you're operating on, but that's rare. But most non pure algorithms (side effects and external systems) have documented failure cases.

If you see it you immediately know the class of error is purely a logic error the programmer made a programming mistake. Logging it makes it explicit your program has a logic bug.What if you didn't log it? Then at runtime you will have to deduce the error from symptoms. The log tells you explicitly what the error is.

> The compiler is always angry. It's always yelling at us for no good reason. It's only happy when we surrender to it and do what it tells us to do. Why do we agree to such an abusive relationship?Programming languages are a formal notation for the execution steps of a computing machine. A formal system is always built around rules and not following the rules is an error, in this case a malformed statement/expression. It's like writing: afjdla lkwcn oqbcn. Yes, they are characters, but they're not english words.Apart from the syntax, which is a formal system on its own, the compiler may have additional rules (like a type system). And you can add even more rules with a static analysis tool (linter). Even though there may be false positives, failing one of those usually means that what you wrote is meaningless in some way. It may run, but it can have unexpected behavior.Natural language have a lot of tolerance for ambiguous statements (which people may not be aware of if they share the same metaphor set). But a computer has none. You either follow the rules or you do not and have an error.

                Reading time 3 minutes
      

The new year is almost here, and before we start thinking about Star Wars, The Avengers, or Christopher Nolan, let's slow things down a bit. While the rest of 2026 is obviously loaded with very exciting, very big movies, the next three months have some pretty interesting, intriguing, and highly anticipated films too. Plenty to hold our interest before the more traditionally blockbuster-filled months.

Like what, exactly? Below are our 10 most anticipated genre films releasing from January through the end of March.

Justin Long, Jermaine Fowler, CM Punk, and more star as Los Angeles police officers who find themselves face-to-face with some very unnatural things in the middle of a gang war. We've heard that things get really wild and that it's a very good time.

When he's framed for the murder of his wife, Chris Pratt has to use an advanced law-enforcement AI that he himself invented to prove his innocence in a very short amount of time. The trailers have been cool, so we're hoping for a ride.

Any time Pixar releases a movie, you have to take notice, and its first 2026 release (the other being Toy Story 5) is the hilarious-looking story of a woman who puts her consciousness in an animal and mistakenly convinces them to try and overtake humanity.

The legendary Sam Raimi returns to the genre that made him famous with this intense-looking thriller about two co-workers who end up deserted on an island together. Rachel McAdams and Dylan O'Brien star, and we're praying for a little of that Raimi magic.

Sam Rockwell stars in this bonkers-looking time travel tale about a man who is sent into the past to try to save the future. Or something like that. It seems insane, and we can't wait.

We loved Radio Silence's 2019 film about a woman stuck in the middle of a family's sick game, and now we are counting the days to its follow-up, which returns to the story soon after the events of the first. Add a bunch of new actors into the mix, and this could be as special as the original.

Nia DaCosta's follow-up to last year's excellent Danny Boyle sequel appears as if it's taking the 28 Years franchise to some bold new places. Plus, the buzz is so good about this one, Sony has already greenlit its sequel.

The year 2025 brought us one great Frankenstein movie, and we think 2026 is going to do the same. Maggie Gyllenhaal returns to the director's chair with this punk rock take on the classic monster story from the woman's point of view. Hamnet's Jessie Buckley and Batman himself, Christian Bale, star as the creatures.

It's a bummer that Scream 7 won't directly follow the story set up by the previous two Scream movies, but we're still holding out hope. Neve Campbell is back in an expanded role, and franchise co-creator Kevin Williamson directs for the first time in the series. Both suggest good things. Also, each Scream film brings its own unique surprises, so we're expecting nothing less from this one.

For the first time in over a decade, Phil Lord and Chris Miller are directing a new film, and this one looks special. It's based on a book by The Martian author Andy Weir; Ryan Gosling stars as a man trying to save the world in deep space. To do so, he'll have to team up with an alien. If the movie is half as wonderful as the book, this one is going to be an all-timer.

On its face, it's a fast-growing chipmaker capitalizing on a strong market. The truth is more complex.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


China's largest domestic memory maker ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT), is preparing for a major IPO in Shanghai, aiming to raise roughly $4.2 billion USD to expand production and fund next-generation DRAM development. On its face, it's a straightforward business story: a fast-growing chipmaker capitalizing on a strong market. Viewed through the lens of today's global RAM shortage, the move is more interesting and more complicated.

As reported by the South China Morning Post, news of the IPO hasn't come out of the blue; it isn't the first time we've heard about this, but this time the announcement is official, and CXMT's timing isn't accidental. The company nearly doubled its revenue year-over-year in 2025 and expects to swing back into profitability, largely thanks to a rebound in DRAM pricing. That rebound, in turn, is being driven by an unusually strong mix of demand from AI infrastructure, cloud providers, and device manufacturers, all competing for a finite supply of memory chips. In other words, CXMT is going public during one of the most memory-hungry periods the industry has ever seen.

CXMT isn't a household name outside China, but it's not a small player. By production volume, it's now the world's fourth-largest DRAM manufacturer, supplying memory for everything from smartphones and PCs to servers used by major Chinese tech firms. The company's IPO pitch is straightforward: expand wafer capacity, modernize fabrication lines, and invest in future DRAM technologies. In theory, that should be good news for the global memory market. More fabs, more output, more competition — all things that usually help stabilize prices.

To some extent, that's true; if CXMT can satisfy a larger share of China's domestic demand, that potentially reduces pressure on the rest of the market. Every server or laptop built with locally sourced memory is one less unit competing for supply from market leaders Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron.

The complication is timing. Memory manufacturing doesn't scale quickly; new fabs take years to build and qualify, and even upgrades to existing lines take time to produce usable output. The money CXMT is raising now won't translate into meaningful global supply increases overnight. At the same time, demand isn't standing still. AI workloads continue to soak up enormous amounts of memory, and not just high-end HBM but also conventional DRAM for servers, storage systems, and supporting infrastructure. Large customers are increasingly locking in long-term supply contracts, which reduces the amount of memory that ever reaches the open market.

 




That means CXMT's expansion may help stabilize things in the medium term, but it's unlikely to provide immediate relief for PC builders or consumers wondering why DDR5 prices are still elevated. It's also worth noting what CXMT is not doing: the company isn't racing to flood the market with ultra-cheap consumer RAM. Like every other major memory manufacturer, it's prioritizing higher-margin products and long-term customers. That's just how the economics work now.

In fact, it's possible that CXMT's expansion could make things worse in the near term; after all, as companies like CXMT ramp up, they compete for the same fabrication equipment, materials, and engineering talent as Samsung, Micron, and SK hynix. That competition can actually tighten supply elsewhere, especially for legacy memory nodes that consumer hardware still relies on. The result is what we're already seeing: higher prices, longer lead times, and fewer options at the low end of the market.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Another wrinkle is the question of how quickly CXMT can realistically advance its manufacturing technology. South Korean prosecutors have indicted multiple former Samsung employees over allegations that proprietary DRAM process technology was leaked to CXMT — claims Samsung has said are tied to CXMT's recent progress at advanced nodes like 10nm. The situation highlights how difficult and resource-intensive cutting-edge memory development really is. Whether through legitimate R&D or contested technology transfer, moving the needle on modern DRAM production is slow, expensive, and heavily constrained, which means even aggressive expansion plans don't guarantee rapid gains in usable supply.

Still, that doesn't make the IPO meaningless. In the longer run, additional capacity is still additional capacity. If CXMT succeeds in scaling production efficiently, it could eventually help absorb some of the demand growth that's currently pushing prices upward. It also adds another serious player to a market that's been dominated by three companies for years, which is generally healthy for competition.

The main point to consider is that CXMT's IPO isn't a sign that the RAM shortage is about to end, but it's also not proof that things will get worse. It's better understood as part of a slow rebalancing of the memory industry as it adapts to a world where AI, cloud computing, and high-density systems are the norm.

For PC builders and hardware enthusiasts, the takeaway is mixed: relief is unlikely in the immediate future, but the long-term supply picture is at least moving in the right direction. Whether that translates into cheaper RAM on store shelves depends on how quickly global production can catch up to an industry that's suddenly very, very hungry for memory.

Early breastfeeding, particularly during the first 4 months of life, was associated with fewer emotional and behavioural problems in children at the age of 4 years. Children breastfed for this duration had reduced internalising and externalising problems, aggressive behaviour, and symptoms related to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). No additional benefit was observed beyond 8 months of breastfeeding.

""Rather than considering breastfeeding as an isolated determinant, it should be understood as part of a broader biopsychosocial network that includes parental emotional health, caregiving practices, early attachment, and family environment,"" the authors wrote. ""These findings reinforce the importance of promoting breastfeeding as a strategy not only for nutritional benefits but also for supporting early emotional development and mental health,"" they added.

This study was led by Vargas-Pérez Susana and Hernández-Martínez Carmen, Rovira i Virgili University, Tarragona, Spain. It was published online on December 24, 2025, in the European Journal of Pediatrics.

The intensity of breastfeeding could not be evaluated because the feeding frequency and breastfeeding type were not measured. Retrospective parent reports of breastfeeding and outcomes may have introduced shared informant bias. Cohort attrition and differences between the two study populations may have limited generalisability.

Open access funding was provided by the CRUE-CSIC agreement with Springer Nature. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

A smartphone app-based study found that patients with advanced ovarian or metastatic breast cancer spent approximately 7 hours weekly on cancer-related tasks and averaged 4.2 out-of-home cancer-related care episodes over 28 days. At-home tasks accounted for a median of 209 minutes (3.5 hours) per week, and the median travel time per out-of-home episode was 35 minutes, with time spent traveling and waiting for care often exceeding time spent receiving care.

“Future work should refine time burden measures by understanding how participants report each care component,” the authors write. “Next steps include examining demographic and clinical factors linked to time burdens and quantifying their impact on patient and caregiver quality of life, employment, and financial outcomes, with the end goal of reducing time burden through patient-centered interventions.”

The study, led by Rachel I. Vogel, PhD, University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, was published online December 16 in JAMA Network Open.

The study had several limitations, including its pilot design. The exclusion of non-English speakers and a sample restricted to women with advanced ovarian or metastatic breast cancer limited generalizability of the study findings. The 28-day monitoring window prevented assessment of time burden near diagnosis or over longer treatment periods. 

The study was supported by a National Cancer Institute grant from the National Institutes of Health. Some authors reported receiving grants from various sources. Two authors reported being cofounders of Daynamica, Inc. Full disclosures are noted in the original article.

Rough Draft Atlanta


					Hyperlocal news for metro Atlanta				




Rough Draft is a clever, curated, and concise email to help you stay up-to-date.

At the halfway point of the ongoing Random Selection Draw ticketing phase, the FIFA World Cup 2026 is already breaking records with over 150 million ticket requests submitted to date by fans from over 200 countries.

According to a press release, the outcome of the current phase that opened on Dec. 11 means the World Cup is oversubscribed over 30 times based on verified individual credit card numbers submitted with each ticket application. 

The demand also represents 3.4 times more than the overall number of spectators who have attended the 964 matches that make up all 22 editions of the competition combined since 1930, the release said.

“The FIFA World Cup 2026 is set to be the greatest and most inclusive show on the planet, with more than 150 million tickets already requested in only the first 15 days, making this edition 30 times oversubscribed – a true showcase of incredible demand from fans from over 200 countries,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a statement.”

The Random Selection Draw ticketing phase remains open until Jan. 13 at 11:00 a.m., and the timing of a ticket request within this window does not affect the chances of success. Fans can enter the draw and find full details at FIFA.com/tickets. Following the closing of the current phase, a draw will take place, giving all fans equal chances of success. 

Those who are unsuccessful will have the opportunity to secure their seats during the subsequent sales phases as additional tickets are made available. The newly introduced Supporter Entry Tier will be available at the fixed price of $60 per ticket for each of the 104 matches, including the final.

The World Cup is estimated to bring around 300,000 visitors to Atlanta in June and July 2026. As one of 16 host cities, Atlanta will host eight World Cup matches at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, including one semifinal.

Luka Modric has named Jose Mourinho as the toughest manager of his illustrious career, claiming the legendary boss is so intense that he once made Cristiano Ronaldo cry in the Real Madrid dressing room. The Croatia and AC Milan midfielder has worked under several world-class coaches during his sparkling spell in football, but he has labelled the Portuguese as the strictest of them all.

Ahead of what turned out to be Mourinho's final season in charge of Real, the Special One brought Modric to the Bernabeu after a €30 million (£26m/$35m) deal was agreed with Tottenham Hotspur in August 2012.

Joining a star-studded Real squad containing the likes of then-captain Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos and Karim Benzema, Modric lifted his first trophy with the Spanish giants later that month, making his debut in the second leg of their victory over fierce rivals Barcelona in the 2012 Spanish Super Cup.

However, the 2012-13 campaign ended in disappointment for both Modric and Mourinho as Real ultimately finished second in La Liga - 15 points behind Tito Vilanova's Barcelona - while they were also beaten in the Spanish Cup final by city rivals Atletico Madrid.

Los Blancos also bowed out of the Champions League at the semi-final stage, losing 4-3 on aggregate to German heavyweights Borussia Dortmund, who were managed by Jurgen Klopp at the time.

However, spending the next 12 seasons of his career with Real, Modric ended up lifting countless honours with the club.

The 40-year-old won three Champions League titles in a row from 2016 to 2018 under Zinedine Zidane's stewardship, while he also won Europe's premier club competition in 2022 and 2024 under Carlo Ancelotti's guidance.

Replicating his remarkable performances at club level on the international stage, Modric also helped Croatia claim the bronze medal at the 2022 World Cup under Zlatko Dalic's tutelage.

Blessed with the fortune of having played under a number of world football's leading coaches, Modric had a clear answer when he was asked to name who he would describe as being the fiercest.

In an interview with Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, Modric opened up about his relationship with Mourinho, saying: “[He is] special. As a coach and as a person. He was the one who wanted me at Real Madrid. Without Mourinho, I would never have arrived. I'm sorry I only had him for one season.”

Delving deeper into what makes Mourinho so successful as a manager, Modric revealed the former Chelsea and Manchester United boss - who is now in charge of Benfica - once reduced his former Real team-mate and current Al-Nassr striker Ronaldo to tears after becoming infuriated with the forward's attitude off-the-ball.

Modric added: “I saw him (Mourinho) make Cristiano Ronaldo cry in the locker room, a man who gives his all on the pitch, because for once he didn't chase the opposing full-back. Mourinho is very direct with the players, but he's honest. He treated Sergio Ramos and the new arrivals the same way: if he had to tell you something, he'd tell you. Max (Allegri, Modric's current Milan manager) is like that too: he tells you to your face what's right and what's wrong. Honesty is fundamental.”

After ending his 13-year spell with Real by joining Italian giants Milan on a free transfer in the summer, Modric has continued to defy age and expectations at the San Siro, having played a key role in helping Allegri's side rise to second in the Serie A table.

Describing his new manager Allegri as a “master”, Modric said: “He has an incredible personality. He's a bit like (Carlo) Ancelotti: sensitive, funny, and loves to play pranks. But on the pitch, as a coach, he's a master. He knows football like few others. I didn't know him that well, but I'm happy he's my coach now.”

Modric will return to the field when Milan travel to Cagliari in the league on Friday. They will then play two games in a week when they entertain Genoa on Thursday, 8 January before making the trip to Fiorentina three days later.

The CBS News boss trolls Clooney's move to France and issues him an open invitation. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


CBS News boss Bari Weiss is sending a message to George Clooney after the actor criticized her management of the news network. 


	The editor in chief issued an open invitation for Clooney to visit her newsroom and playfully mocked his move to France. 




	“Bonjour, Mr. Clooney!” wrote Weiss in a statement shared with The New York Post. “Big fan of your work. It sounds like you'd like to learn more about ours. This is an open invitation to visit the CBS Broadcast Center, where I'm spending the holidays working to relaunch the Evening News with my colleagues. Tune in January 5.”

					Bari Weiss Says Pulling '60 Minutes' Story ""May Seem Radical"" But Necessary for ""Integrity of the News""		
			









	The statement was apparently in response to an interview Clooney gave to Variety, where the actor said, “Bari Weiss is dismantling CBS News as we speak. Am I worried about film studios? Sure. It's my business, but my primary loyalty is to my country. I'm much more worried about how we inform ourselves and how we're going to discern reality without a functioning press.”

	Clooney also criticized CBS and ABC for settling costly lawsuits filed by President Trump that many felt were specious. “If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go, fuck yourself,' we wouldn't be where we are in the country,” Clooney says. “That's simply the truth.”


	Clooney previously co-wrote and directed the 2005 film Good Night, and Good Luck, chronicling legendary CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (played by David Strathairn). Clooney also recently played the role himself in Broadway production of the film.

	











	France recently granted citizenship to Clooney, his wife Amal, and their twins, Ella and Alexander.


	“I was worried about raising our kids in L.A., in the culture of Hollywood,” Clooney told Esquire in an interview published in October. “I don't want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don't want them being compared to somebody else's famous kids.”


	According to NBC News, the Clooneys live in a luxury 18th century villa outside the town of Brignoles in southern France.


	Weiss has come under criticism for her handling of CBS News since Paramount CEO David Ellison hired the Free Press founder in October. Amid fears that Weiss doesn't have enough experience for the role and would shift the organization politically to the right, Weiss recently held a 60 Minutes report on Trump's immigration policies that alleged human rights abuses at a prison in El Salvador.


	“No amount of outrage — whether from activist organizations or the White House — will derail us,” Weiss wrote in a staff memo defending the decision. “We are not out to score points with one side of the political spectrum or to win followers on social media. We are out to inform the American public and to get the story right.”


	In response to Weiss' decision and comments, 60 Minutes correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi sent her colleagues a message challenging Weiss' decision and depiction of the story's vetting. “Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and standards and practices. It is factually correct,” Alfonsi wrote. “In my view, pulling it now — after every rigorous internal check has been met — is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”

The battle between former colleagues Megyn Kelly and Mark Levin takes a nasty turn as conservative civil war intensifies. Levin calls Kelly a ""degenerate bigot."" Kelly brands the Fox anchor ""a bitter old man."" 


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	Right-wing talking heads like Megyn Kelly and Mark Levin once reserved their sharpest slings for liberals, immigrants and Joe Biden. But suddenly they're dropping their biggest bombs on each other.


	Kelly, a former Fox News anchor and NBC host, has been engaged in an increasingly ugly social-media shootout with her former Fox News colleague Mark Levin, the longtime host of the syndicated The Mark Levin Show and star of Fox News' weekend staple Life, Liberty & Levin.




	The two veteran anchors have been feuding since a Turning Point USA convention in mid-December, when Ben Shapiro‘s keynote speech attacking right-wing conspiracists like Tucker Carlson triggered a mini meltdown in MAGA-world. After lashing out at Shapiro and seemingly aligning herself with Carlson, Candace Owens and Jack Posobiec, Kelly took heat from former friends and supporters who accused her of trading her credibility for clicks. But what began as a debate over principles and tactics has taken an increasingly personal turn in recent days, with Levin denouncing his former Fox colleague as a “degenerate” and “laughingstock,” and Kelly dismissing Levin as an “irrelevant, bitter man.”

	The bad blood between the former colleagues escalated on Tuesday when Levin's latest anti-Kelly screed appeared on X. “Meg Kelly, whose ratings were so bad on NBC she became a laughingstock, was canned for promoting blackface on Halloween,” Levin wrote, referencing Kelly's untimely departure from the Today show in 2018. “You see, she was always a degenerate bigot. This is why she's cool with Candace Owens and Jack Posobiec. This is why she slobbers over Qatarlson. She's part of the Woke Reich — the queen of the modern Klan.  More to come.”

	But Kelly claimed to be unfazed. “You're just upset bc I'm not afraid of you or your baseless slurs,” she quickly clapped back on her former Fox News colleague. “You're an old, irrelevant, bitter, angry man who could never make it in the Fox News primetime. We used to laugh at you there for your red-faced tantrums over … everything.”


	The growing ideological rifts within the MAGA movement burst into the open at AmericaFest, Turning Point USA's annual conference, when Ben Shapiro took to the stage and called out what he referred to as “grifters” in the conservative movement. “The conservative movement is in serious danger, from charlatans who claim to speak in the name of principle but actually traffic in conspiracism and dishonesty, who offer nothing but bile and despair,” he said, in a speech that earned him a standing ovation from the crowd.


	Shapiro also rapped Kelly, along with Carlson and Steve Bannon, for their failure to renounce the conspiracy-minded podcaster Owens, who has repeatedly suggested, without evidence, that Charlie Kirk, Turning Point's late co-founder, was assassinated in September as part of a global conspiracy that may have involved the Israeli government, the FBI and Kirk's widow, Erika. (Owens responded to Shapiro's remarks by calling him “a midget” and blaming Jews for the slave trade. Kelly has claimed that critics like Shapiro and CBS News president Bari Weiss have been motivated by their support of Israel.)


	At Fox, where Kelly once served as a popular primetime anchor, the network's usually voluble anchors have stayed silent as their onetime colleagues battle it out. No Fox News personality, other than Levin, has mentioned the contretemps. “It's like crazy person versus crazy person. Who you gonna root for in that fight?” one longtime Fox News producer wryly tells The Hollywood Reporter. Fox News honchos are also not taking sides. Reps for the network did not respond to THR‘s request for comment.

The show featured the star's greatest hits and signature choreography, telling the story of her lengthy career.


													By
												

	Melinda Sheckells



	As soon as the curtain fell in 2018 on her 120-show $100 million-grossing Jennifer Lopez: All I Have residency at Planet Hollywood, the speculation began on when — not if — J.Lo would return to Las Vegas.


	After seven years, she announced plans for the new Up All Night Live while hosting the American Music Awards in May 2025. On Dec. 30, after months of rehearsal and teasers on her social media, the fervor came to fruition, as Lopez transported the sold-out audience of more than 4,000 at The Colosseum at Caesars from fantasy to reality and back again in a feverish haze of gyrating bodies and miles of sequins.


	Always known for making a major entrance, Lopez launched the 120-minute pop, R&B and Latin music and dance odyssey with a spectacular Broadway-themed opener that included “Let Me Entertain You” from the musical Gypsy; 1999's “Waiting for Tonight” mashed-up with West Side Story's “Mambo”; an ultra-jazzy “Jenny From the Block”; and finished with 2007's “Do It Well.”


	This set the tone for a night where Lopez framed her best moments not as a greatest hits revue but as a living timeline of “J.Lo the artist” chronicled through music, choreography and costuming. In a toast to their early aughts reign as the terry-cloth sweatsuit king and queen, Ja Rule joined Lopez on stage for their hits “Ain't It Funny” and “I'm Real.”


	The most significant difference from her last Vegas show? Lopez's participation in Up All Night Live as narrator, speaking candidly about reinvention, resilience and the discipline it has taken to get her here and back again. Those reflections gave emotional ballast to the high-gloss production designed for spectacle on Las Vegas' most storied stage, which Adele, Cher, Mariah Carey and Celine Dion have graced.


	Here's a look at Lopez's full opening night setlist for Up All Night Live at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace.

NY & Broadway Editor


UPDATED with Disney statement: A Walt Disney World worker was bowled over by a 400-pound runaway boulder that's part of the park's Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular in Orlando, Florida, with video of the incident making the social media rounds yesterday.


	The boulder prop now appears to have been removed from the attraction after the accident.


	In a statement to Deadline, a Disney spokesperson said, “We're focused on supporting our cast member, who is recovering. Safety is at the heart of what we do, and that element of the show will be modified as our safety team completes a review of what happened.”

	The worker, or cast member in the parlance of the Disney theme parks, can be seen in widely shared video attempting to halt the faux-boulder after the sphere bounced off its proper course. Audience members including many children watch as the unidentified employee is knocked to the ground, his head seemingly bloodied.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The employee is then lifted to his feet by other park workers. In video circulating today, the boulder stunt is absent from the attraction, possibly indicating that Disney World has removed the large prop.


	In one video making the rounds – watch it below – a man shooting cell phone video Tuesday can be heard jokingly tell his family, “It's coming right for us,” apparently thinking the audience-bound bouncing boulder was all part of the show. After the worker is knocked down and other workers come to his aid, a woman can be heard saying, “Wait, like, for real?” The man taking the video then says, “It's alright girls, it's ok…He literally saved our lives.”

	











	The social media videos began circulating Tuesday, December 30. Scott Gustin, a frequent blogger on theme parks and all things Disney, was the first to report the incident, confirming that it happened Tuesday and that the cast member received immediate care.


	Another blogger, Blog Mickey, posted video today purportedly of the Indiana Jones attraction with the boulder stunt notably absent. (Watch that video below.)


	The Indiana Jones attraction is a 30-minute show re-creating scenes and stunts from the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark.

Gigi and Bella Hadid's secret half-sister, Aydan Nix, said her siblings have been “warm and generous” since she met them in 2023.

“My sisters (along with the rest of the family) have been nothing but warm and generous. They have made space for me in ways they didn't have to,” the fashion designer wrote in a new essay for the Cut.

Nix was born from a brief relationship her father, Mohamed Hadid, had over 20 years ago with Terri Hatfield Dull.

The real estate developer, 77, also shares Bella, 29, Gigi, 30, and son Anwar, 26, with ex-wife Yolanda Hadid and daughters Marielle, 45, and Alana, 40, with his first wife, Mary Butler.

Nix, 23, said her half-brother, Anwar, “called [her] his baby sister the first time we ever spoke on the phone,” and that “Bella calls me her twin.”

“My mom couldn't even tell our voices apart when we first spoke to her on the phone,” the aspiring influencer told the outlet.

Nix shared that her siblings have also helped her learn more about their Palestinian heritage.

“Alana sent me resources and inspired me to become active in the fight for Palestine's freedom,” she penned.

“I watched Anwar's film ‘Walled Off.' Gigi took me for my first Palestinian meal and taught me the names of different dishes,” Nix added.

Additionally, Nix's supermodel sisters have also helped her get her foot into the fashion world after she recently graduated from the Parsons School of Design in New York.

“Gigi introduced me to her friend Gabriella Karefa Johnson, whom I had admired not only for her styling but for her strong convictions and values,” she wrote in the Cut essay. 

“I started assisting her when times were especially busy. My first day on set was a Victoria's Secret campaign. I worked 17 hours that day,” Nix added. 

“I was exhausted, but I had never in my life felt more fulfilled. I felt like I had finally found the thing that I was supposed to do.”

Despite her flourishing relationship with her siblings, Nix admitted to feeling “like the odd one out” due to not sharing her childhood with them.

“No sleepovers, no shared holidays, no borrowing clothes, no inside jokes, no stories woven together,” she explained in her essay.

“They had a lifetime of memories, and I felt like the odd one out,” Nix wrote.

In May, the identity of Gigi and Bella's secret half-sister was revealed to be Nix.

“Over 20 years ago, our dad, while single, had a brief relationship that led to a pregnancy,” Gigi and Bella told the Daily Mail in a statement.

“Aydan was born and raised in Florida, growing up with the man she lovingly knew as her father until his sudden passing when she was 19,” the models added.

Gigi and Bella said Nix “decided to take a genetic test out of curiosity,” which led her to discover “a biological connection” to the cover girls.

The trio “first connected in late 2023″ and Bella and Gigi “embraced Aydan with open arms.”

Mohamed briefly dated Dull following his 2001 divorce from Yolanda.

The Daily Mail reported that their fling ended shortly before Dull discovered she was pregnant.

You've probably never cirque-d like you can with Paranormal Cirque.

The human circus — eschewing animal acts for dazzling derring-do from acrobats and athletes — is making its South Florida debut Jan. 9-19 in a big-top tent to be set up in Miramar Regional Park. And unlike other circuses that crisscross Broward and Palm Beach counties, Paranormal Cirque is not for the whole family.

“We're bringing our R-rated horror circus with a haunted attraction pre-show,” says Steve Copeland, a comedian and spokesman with Cirque Italia, the show's Bradenton-based producer. “It's rated R cuz there's lots of bad language, there's adult humor, there's skimpy and revealing costuming. No nudity, unless you maybe buy the performers a couple drinks, but no nudity in the show itself. Miramar better get ready for a heck of a good time.”

According to Copeland, some of the acts include:

“We're a strictly non-animal circus, although some of our performers do eat like animals,” he adds. “You're going to see awesome acrobatics, beautiful aerial acts, you're going to see feats of strength and daring and death-defying death stunts — all with a horror theme. So all of the acts are performed by zombies, by ghosts, by werewolves, by vampires. There's also a lot of comedy, which people don't expect. In fact, a lot of the R rating comes from the comedy.”

Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to see Paranormal Cirque, but teenagers (ages 13 through 17) can attend as long as they have an adult guardian.



Copeland continues, “And in addition to two hours of Vegas quality R-rated power circus entertainment, you get a haunted attraction free show that begins an hour before show time and it's free with the admission ticket. So, you don't have to pay anything extra, it's included in the price of the ticket. And it's a walk-through haunted house starring the same performers that you're going to see in the show. They're going to scare the heck out of you. So, maybe bring a change of underwear.”

The show's parent company, Cirque Italia, was started by Manuel Rebecchi in 2012 and now has seven touring companies. Rebecchi is the nephew of the late Moira Orfei, a famous Italian circus performer and actor.

Paranormal Cirque runs Jan. 9-19 at Miramar Regional,16801 Miramar Parkway. Tickets range from $20-$65. To purchase, go to paranormalcirque.com.

Ten Truly Strange UFO Encounters



      by Preston Dennett
    


      So many UFO encounters of all different kinds, coming from all over the world! Each documented case adds to our knowledge of UFO activity, the ET agenda, and the extraterrestrial presence on our planet. This video presents ten unique UFO stories coming from all over the world. Sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters with a dazzling variety of humanoids, and even one account of a little-known UFO crash. These cases give us a fascinating glimpse into what it's like to have a UFO encounter, and also provide a wide variety of compelling evidence for the reality of the phenomenon, including medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions, landing traces and even photographs. How many documented cases will it take before all humanity accepts the fact that we are not alone?
    


      BRITAIN'S EARLIEST HUMANOID? In the summer of 1901, Frank (age 10) was walking near his home in Bournbrook in West Midlands, England when he saw what looked like a strange metallic hut sitting in a field. Out stepped two strange humanoids wearing gray jumpsuits and helmets with antennae. One of the figures gestured for Frank to keep back. As Frank stepped back, the humanoids returned to the craft which began to glow with light. With no conception of UFOs or ETs, it would be years before Frank understood what happened.
    


      DEATH VALLEY UFO CRASH. On August 19, 1949 two prospectors, Buck Fitzgerald (age 73) and his friend Mase Garney were in Death Valley when a silver flying saucer zoomed overhead and crashed into the desert floor. Two short humanoids jumped out, saw the prospectors, and took off running. Buck and Mase chased them, but soon lost sight of them. Returning to the crash-site, the saucer was gone! The case was widely published in newspapers, and was one of several similar incidents to occur in the 1940s.
    


      CAUGHT IN THE SPOTLIGHT. Around 7:00 pm on August 19, 1949, Sgt. Donald Berger shone an 8-million candlepower searchlight into the night skies of Norwood, Ohio as part of a publicity stunt for the local festival. To his and everyone's amazement, a glowing disc appeared in the searchlight beam. One month later, it happened again. And over the next year, eight similar incidents followed. Sometimes the disc released smaller craft. Witnesses managed to capture photos and films. Something truly strange was happening over Ohio. It was an obvious display, and was seen by thousands. In fact, the incidents were so widely viewed, that they were impossible to coverup, though the military certainly tried.
    


      A FOILED ABDUCTION. Early one evening in June 1960, the children of Mr. and Mrs. LeMarquands were playing outside their home in Thompson in Manitoba, Canada when a whirlwind began to swirl around them. Looking up, they all saw a strange craft. That's when one of the children began to rise up from the ground toward the UFO. One of the neighborhood boys saw it happening, ran over, and quickly grabbed the girl, preventing her from being pulled into the craft. She had no memory of any of it, but her parents saw the whole thing happen, as did four neighbors.
    


      CHASED BY A UFO. It was 5:00 pm, August 24, 1967 as Ron Hydes drove his motorcycle on a highway south of Wodongo, Australia. Without warning, a blinding light shone from above. Stopping, he was amazed to see a metallic saucer landed along the road, along with two silver-suited humanoids. One of them beckoned for him to come closer. Terrified, Ron hopped on his motorcycle and fled. Only then did he see that the UFO was following him. Then, to his dismay, it zoomed ahead of him on the road and began to wait for him!
    


      THE ALIENS IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE. On a Sunday afternoon in October 1974, Alain and Patrick were driving out of their hometown in Aisne, France and noticed five very strange-looking short figures. They were four-feet-tall, wore robes, and had yellow skin, long black hair, and enormous round black eyes like billiard balls. One of the figures was only ten feet away from them and when Patrick opened the car window, it waved for the two witnesses to come closer. Frightened, the witnesses drove off. Unknown to them, someone else also saw the strange beings.
    


      “DON'T LET IT GET ME!” Around 10:30 pm on October 28, 1976, Richard Britt and his son Richie returned to their home in Lake View, SC and saw a strange light whizzing over the trees. Richard went inside, but Richie remained outside. Moments later, the light reappeared and suddenly zoomed forward, hovering in perfect silence only feet away from him. He now saw that it was a saucer and looking at him through a large porthole was a very strange creature. Richie had the impression that it was out to get him. He was so traumatized, he was unable to speak about it until the next morning. That's when they found some startling physical evidence where the craft had hovered.
    


      THE ITALIAN ROBOT. It was just past midnight on August 31, 1977 and two college students were walking just outside of the town of Sturno, Italy and noticed some strange lights alongside the road. Looking more closely, they saw a giant silver robotic figure. They ran back to town and got more witnesses. Frightened, all the witnesses fled and got even more witnesses, beginning an encounter with a landed UFO and a silver humanoid that would last for several hours and leave the citizens of the town in shock. And when landing traces were discovered, the case received even more attention.
    


      THE ETS IN THE VILLAGE. When night arrived on September 1, 1978 in the small village of Llanerchymedd, Wales, many residents of the town noticed a strange object in the sky. Without warning, the object landed in a nearby field. Shortly later, three humanoids exited and began to walk around. As more and more people in the town witnessed the spectacle, panic swept through the town. Police were called. By then the UFO had departed But the encounter wasn't over yet! When the police left, the UFO returned, and so apparently did the entities.
    


      THE SAUCER ON THE BACK PORCH. Around 4:00 am on February 7, 1981, Cindy Gaffney was woken up in her home in crowded suburb of San Francisco, California by a loud buzzing noise. To her shock, she saw that a small glowing white flying saucer had landed directly on her neighbor's cemented back porch. She woke up her husband who also saw and heard the craft. She called the police, but they didn't believe her or didn't care. Cindy was on her own! When the craft finally departed, it left behind a strange mark on the cement.
    


      These ten truly strange UFO encounters are just a small sampling of the huge number of cases occurring all over the world. They show how mindboggling complex the UFO phenomenon is, and the many strange things that happen when ETs make contact with humans. The truth can no longer be denied. There are too many cases to ignore. The evidence speaks for itself. We are not the only intelligent beings living in this universe, and many of them are regularly visiting our planet. We are not alone!

Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have exchanged New Year's greetings, with both praising steady relations between the two countries.

Moscow and Beijing have deepened cooperation since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. The two countries describe their ties as a strategic partnership “without limits.” Both countries nearly doubled bilateral trade from 2020 to 2024, surpassing $240 billion last year.

Putin wished Xi and the Chinese people well, saying the China-Russia strategic partnership had continued to develop throughout 2025.

Xi sent reciprocal greetings to Putin and the Russian people on Tuesday, saying bilateral relations had made further progress and noting that the two leaders had met twice during the year in Beijing and Moscow. He added that the two countries supported each other in multilateral forums, including the UN.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin also exchanged New Year's messages, Chinese state media said.

Earlier in December Putin signed a decree allowing visa-free entry to Russia for Chinese citizens, granting them stays of up to 30 days. The move mirrored Beijing's earlier decision to extend the same access to Russian citizens. In September, China introduced the measure on a one-year trial basis to further facilitate travel between the two countries.

During his annual end-of-year Q&A session last week, Putin described relations with Beijing as stable and trusting, adding that the two countries' foreign ministries remain in regular contact and coordinate approaches on key global issues.

Depending on where you live, relying on a postmark to prove you mailed your tax return, mail-in ballot, bill payment or any other time-sensitive document by a specific date may no longer work as you expect.

As the U.S. Postal Service continues implementing operational changes in an effort to shore up its finances and modernize its infrastructure, the agency expects an increase in delays between when you mail something and when it is postmarked, according to a public notice in the Federal Register that took effect Dec. 24. A postmark shows the date your mail was processed, and historically has been applied the same day you mail an item. 

However, due to limiting pickups at many postal locations and mail now often traveling farther to regional processing centers where the postmark is applied, ""the postmark date does not inherently or necessarily align with the date on which the Postal Service first accepted possession of the mailpiece,"" the notice reads.

While households increasingly use digital options to file taxes, pay bills and handle other personal business, there are still people who use the Postal Service for time-sensitive mail.

Of the 163.6 million tax returns received by the IRS this year, about 10 million were not filed electronically, according to the agency's latest data. About 29% of voters mailed in their ballots last year, according to USAFacts. And 13% of households paid their bills by mail last year, according to the Postal Service's 2024 Household Diary Study. 

""Consumers have always assumed that the post office will postmark their mail on the day they take it to the post office or drop it in a box,"" said Edgar Dworsky, founder of advocacy site Consumer World and a former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts who focused on consumer protection. ""Who would expect it could be several days before it has a postmark on it?""

While the Postal Service said in the notice that it is not changing how it postmarks mail — that has always been done at its processing facilities — the agency has added language to its Domestic Mail Manual to clarify for the public when postmarks are applied.

In 2021, USPS unveiled an initiative called Delivering for America to improve its financial condition, which included increasing postage prices and redesigning its network and processing operations.

Changes to transportation schedules and the consolidation of processing facilities under that initiative mean many post offices that previously sent mail twice a day to a hub now do so only once in the morning, according to new research from the Brookings Institution. Under the new network, roughly 26% of post offices are within 50 miles of their assigned regional center, and another 26% are between 150 and 500 miles away, according to the research.

The upshot is that some mail generally doesn't begin moving through the system until at least the following day, resulting in the postmark not being applied the day you mailed that item. In some cases — i.e., ahead of weekends or holidays — it could take longer than a day for that crucial stamp to be applied.

The importance of ensuring your mail is postmarked in time applies to a range of documents or forms that have deadlines. For example, ballots that are mailed can require a postmark by a specific date to be counted, as can federal and state tax returns and certain legal documents.

If someone wants to ensure ""that the postmark aligns with the date of mailing, the customer may take the mailpiece to a post office, station or branch and request a [manual postmark] at the retail counter,"" according to a statement issued by the Postal Service.

Asking a postal clerk to manually postmark something costs nothing. Or, you can pay $5.30 to send a time-sensitive document via certified mail, which includes a receipt for the sender as well as a return receipt showing when it was delivered and who signed for it. Alternatively, a certificate of mailing, which you keep for your records, costs $2.40 and shows the date you mailed something.

""Waiting in line at the post office is never fun, but you get that proof of timely mailing,"" said Josh Youngblood, an enrolled agent and founder of The Youngblood Group in Dallas. ""The reality is, otherwise, you are at the mercy of whenever that postmark gets applied.""

Given the possibility of a delay, you may want to explore electronic filing or payment options when available. Or, give yourself a deadline to mail something important well ahead of the official due date.

Ahead of tax filing season, it's worth taking note of the possible delay. While April 15 is when federal taxes are due, the IRS considers any tax return postmarked on or before April 15 as being filed on time, even if it's not received until days later.

So if you are prone to waiting until the last minute to file taxes and do not do it electronically, you can't assume dropping off your return at the post office or putting it in a mailbox means it will get postmarked that day.

""If I'm mailing something to the IRS, I'm going to go into the post office to the actual person, where they stamp it,"" Youngblood said.

If your tax return is postmarked late and you owe taxes, you may face penalties and interest. ""There is a penalty for filing late, and even a day late is still late,"" Youngblood said.

For individual tax returns — i.e., your Form 1040 — the penalty for filing a late return is 5% of the tax due for each month or partial month the return is late, capping out at 25%. On top of that, the penalty for paying late is 0.5% of your unpaid balance per month, also capped at 25%. Interest is also charged on unpaid balances, accruing daily at the federal short-term rate plus 3%.

However, if you have filed and paid taxes owed on time over the previous three years, you can request that the penalties be waived, Youngblood said.

Highlights

Amid the rising competition in the global digital finance space, the United States is facing an increasing risk of losing its hold. Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, has shared this stark warning as China emerges as a strong rival.

Notably, Coinbase's Faryar Shirzad sounded an alarm on the potential consequences of the prevailing uncertainty surrounding stablecoin regulations in the US. He warned that China's latest CBDC initiatives have bolstered the country's push for dominance in the digital finance space, effectively sidelining the US.

Coinbase's chief policy officer, Faryar Shirzad, took to X to share concerns about the rising competition from China in the digital finance economy. He stated that the US lawmakers are giving China and other global rivals a strategic advantage by limiting rewards on US-based stablecoins. He added in the X post,

“Tokenization is the future and the GENIUS Act was a visionary move by POTUS and Congress to ensure US dollar stablecoins issued under US rules would be the primary settlement instrument of the future.”

Although the GENIUS Act has been signed into law, the bill currently prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying interest. It only allows third-party rewards, which marks a point of focus in the ongoing Senate negotiations surrounding the market structure legislation. While banks and financial institutions argue against these rewards, citing risks, crypto exchanges and platforms advocate the reward system. They claim that limiting stablecoin rewards may hamper innovation.

Significantly, the Coinbase executive's warning comes in response to China's latest decision to pay interest on its CBDC, the digital yuan. Taking effect on January 1, 2026, the People's Bank of China is allowing commercial banks to pay interest on e-CNY holdings under a new framework.

As noted by PBOC Deputy Governor Lu Lei, under the new framework, China's digital yuan will perform as a “digital deposit currency/.” The move is part of the country's growing efforts to boost the e-CNY's adoption worldwide.

However, the Coinbase executive sees this as a significant threat to the US's dominance in the global digital finance space. He believes that addressing the concerns surrounding the GENIUS Act and stablecoin rewards has now become a matter of urgency. He noted, “If this issue is mishandled in Senate negotiations on the market structure bill, it could hand our global rivals a big assist in giving non-US stablecoins and CBDCs a critical competitive advantage at the worst possible time.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Researchers find ADHD strengths linked to better mental health","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251223084852.htm","Wed, 31 Dec 2025 15:51:49 GMT","

Adults with ADHD who are aware of their personal strengths and actively use them tend to report better overall well-being, a higher quality of life, and fewer mental health challenges, according to a new international study.

The research was released during October's ADHD Awareness Month, which this year highlights ""the many faces of ADHD."" Scientists from the University of Bath, King's College London, and Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands collaborated on the first large-scale effort to measure psychological strengths associated with ADHD.

Large Study Compares Strengths in Adults With and Without ADHD

Published in Psychological Medicine, the study examined 200 adults diagnosed with ADHD and 200 adults without ADHD. Participants were asked how strongly they identified with 25 positive traits, including creativity, humor, spontaneity and hyperfocus. Researchers defined these traits as ""things [they] do well or best.""

ADHD is commonly discussed in terms of difficulties such as impulsivity, forgetfulness, and trouble sustaining attention. This study points to a different perspective by emphasizing the importance of recognizing and making use of strengths.

Luca Hargitai, lead researcher from the Department of Psychology at the University of Bath, said: ""These exciting findings give us an indication of which positive qualities may be tied to ADHD and thus can be considered ADHD-related strengths. It can be really empowering to recognise that, while ADHD is associated with various difficulties, it does have several positive aspects.""

Key Strengths More Commonly Endorsed by Adults With ADHD

Compared with participants without ADHD, those with ADHD were more likely to strongly identify with 10 specific strengths. These included:

Despite the well-documented challenges adults with ADHD often face in work, relationships, and mental health, the study found they were just as likely as neurotypical participants to recognize and use their strengths in everyday life.

Using Strengths Tied to Better Mental Health Across Groups

Across both groups, individuals who had greater awareness of their strengths and applied them more frequently reported clear benefits. These included:

Dr. Punit Shah, senior author and Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Bath, said: ""Our findings highlight that knowing that we have certain skills and positive qualities at our disposal and using these strengths where appropriate can be beneficial for our well-being. This might sound obvious, but now that our research confirms this hypothesis, we can start designing psychological supports with this fresh evidence.""

Support for Strengths-Based Approaches in ADHD Care

The results add weight to strengths-based approaches in mental health care. While this framework is increasingly used in autism services, it has received far less attention in ADHD. Potential applications include psychoeducational programs, coaching, and customized therapies that help people identify and apply their strengths more effectively.

Dr. Shah added: ""The next step now is to investigate whether interventions that promote the recognition and use of personal strengths can offer tangible improvements in mental wellbeing for adults with ADHD. People with ADHD and other neurodivergences have been calling for this for a long time and we are excited to have some of the first research to support this.""

Why Comparing ADHD and Neurotypical Strengths Matters

Senior author Assistant Professor Martine Hoogman of Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands emphasized that research into ADHD-related strengths is still developing. She noted that many previous studies focused only on people with ADHD.

""Research on ADHD-related strengths is still in its early stages. Most studies ask only people with ADHD about their strengths, but we also asked neurotypical people. We found that people without ADHD recognise many of the same strengths, though only those with ADHD endorse some of them. This helps us better understand ADHD strengths.

""It's important to educate people with ADHD not just about challenges, but also about their potential strengths to improve quality of life and reduce risks in work or education.""

Research Funding

The study was supported by funding from the UK Economic and Social Research Council and the Dutch Research Council.
