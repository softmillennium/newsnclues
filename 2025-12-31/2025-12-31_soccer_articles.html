Facing the media after a hugely disappointing performance from the Red Devils, the Portuguese tried to explain what went wrong, pointing to a lack of fluidity and the fact he's missing some key players.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emiliano Martínez was left seething over taunts from Arsenal supporters after Aston Villa suffered a 4-1 defeat at Emirates Stadium. Villa's 11-match winning streak was emphatically ended by the Gunners, who ran out comfortable winners in Tuesday night's Premier League clash. Martinez endured one of his most uncomfortable evenings since joining Villa. The 33-year-old conceded four times as Arsenal delivered a ruthless attacking display to reassert their title credentials. At a corner, he was outmuscled by returning defender Gabriel Magalhaes, failing to impose himself as the ball broke Arsenal's way. It set the tone for a night in which Villa were repeatedly second-best. Martinez could do little to prevent further strikes from Martín Zubimendi, Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Jesus, before Ollie Watkins grabbed a late consolation for the visitors. Martinez spent a decade on Arsenal's books between 2010 and 2020, finally getting his chance to shine during Mikel Arteta's first season in charge. He played a key role in the club's last FA Cup triumph and followed it up with victory in the Community Shield. Yet his Arsenal career ended abruptly soon after, with the goalkeeper sold to Aston Villa in a £20 million ($27m) deal. The return of Bernd Leno left Martínez facing reduced opportunities, prompting his decision to seek regular football elsewhere. Since then, Arsenal supporters have shown little sympathy. With Ramsdale now gone, it was David Raya's name echoing around the Emirates on Tuesday. Much of the animosity stems from Martinez's frank reflections on his Arsenal exit. While he has often spoken warmly about the club, his suggestion that he was not trusted enough struck a nerve with sections of the fanbase. Speaking previously to Sky Sports, Martínez said: "I just felt like they didn't trust me like they should have. When I was on a high, I still felt like they didn't deserve me because of the way they were treating me. "They didn't say to me that I wasn't going to play, they just didn't guarantee me the games that I wanted to play. So, after 10 years, I decided to leave, and it was very difficult. It was a gamble, but I always believe that if you stay in the comfort zone, you will never reach anything in life. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Villa manager Unai Emery was also involved in a minor tunnel controversy after appearing to miss the customary post-match handshake with Arteta. Emery later played down the incident, explaining that he had simply followed his usual routine and saw Arteta engaged with his staff. The Villa boss explained: "Yes, but it's simple. Of course, he was happy and he was with his coaches and I decided to go inside. Villa will be keen to respond quickly when they host Nottingham Forest on Saturday. Arsenal, meanwhile, have opened up a five-point gap at the top of the Premier League over Manchester City, who do hold a game in hand. With confidence surging and the Emirates once again a hostile place for visiting former heroes, Arteta's side have sent a clear message that they are not slowing down anytime soon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester City are reportedly in talks over the £30 million ($40m) loan-to-buy sale of Oscar Bobb as Pep Guardiola gears up to welcome Antoine Semenyo to the Etihad. Club sources indicate the sale could be concluded within 48 hours, prompting recruitment staff to accelerate contingency planning in attack. While Semenyo's arrival would add depth to Guardiola's front line, it also sharpens competition in areas where minutes are already scarce. Subsequent setbacks have left him struggling to reassert himself, and there is a growing acceptance that regular football elsewhere may be essential for his development. Sevilla and Atletico Madrid are also tracking the situation, while Premier League sides such as Crystal Palace and Bournemouth have made enquiries. Newcastle United are monitoring developments from a distance. In other attacking positions, Omar Marmoush has seen his opportunities diminish as Guardiola has stepped back from deploying him on the left flank. The Egypt international is currently away at the Africa Cup of Nations, and while his role has reduced, City maintain that he remains part of their plans. Similarly, speculation around Savinho has been played down. Guardiola has praised Savinho's improved defensive work rate, underlining why the club are unwilling to entertain offers unless something extraordinary materialises. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. At Bournemouth, the impending loss of Semenyo has been met with regret rather than surprise. Head coach Andoni Iraola had been vocal about his hope to keep the forward for as long as possible. However, he acknowledged that circumstances were beyond his control. If he can play years for us, it's much better! If he can only play weeks, it is weeks but the more time he plays with us, the better for us. Obviously, I don't want to lose him, but there are some situations that are not under my control." Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting With Semenyo's exit looming, Bournemouth have begun exploring replacements and are reportedly keen on Brennan Johnson of Tottenham. Predominantly a winger but comfortable across the front line, Johnson's adaptability fits Iraola's tactical demands and he has emerged as a serious option, though Crystal Palace are thought to be leading the race for his services.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA President Gianni Infantino is pushing back against mounting criticism of the organization's World Cup 2026 ticket prices, arguing that record-setting demand validates FIFA's approach — even as fans and supporter groups continue to call the prices “extortionate” and out of reach for ordinary attendees. Speaking Monday at the World Sports Summit in Dubai, Infantino said FIFA has already received more than 150 million ticket requests during the current ticketing phase, which runs through January 13, 2026. He framed that number as evidence of unprecedented interest in the first expanded 48-team World Cup, which will be staged across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. “In the last few days, you have probably seen there is a lot of debate about ticketing and ticket prices,” Infantino said, before describing the volume of applications as “absolutely crazy” — a comment that underscores FIFA's central argument: demand is so high that the market will bear it. Infantino also repeated FIFA's longstanding messaging that World Cup revenues are redistributed to support soccer development worldwide. “There is football because [of] and thanks to these revenues we generate with and from the World Cup, which we reinvest, of course, all over the world,” he said in Dubai. The remarks are the first major public defense of ticket pricing from FIFA leadership since the latest application window opened in early December, triggering backlash as fans began sharing examples of steep face-value pricing for marquee games. According to published pricing details and prior reports, ticket prices have ranged from relatively lower-cost early-round options to several thousand dollars for premium matches — with the cheapest seats for the final reportedly priced in the four-figure range in some tiers, drawing sharp criticism from supporter organizations and media outlets. READ MORE: FIFA World Cup Ticket Pricing Widely Condemned as Prices Surge to Thousands FIFA has also pointed to affordability measures — including the introduction of a limited “supporter” ticket tier — after facing criticism over the sticker shock. While FIFA emphasizes record demand on the primary side, new data from Ticket Club's secondary marketplace points to a familiar pattern: a sharp surge immediately after the matchups and schedule dropped, followed by a gradual repricing as early seller optimism meets real buyer behavior. In Ticket Club's framing, that represents a short-lived “FOMO tax” right after the announcement, with prices drifting lower as the initial frenzy fades — though the market remains meaningfully higher than it was on day one of matchup week. Ticket Club also highlighted a continuing “host premium” for Group Stage matches featuring Mexico, the United States, or Canada — though that premium narrowed in late December. As of Dec. 30, Ticket Club data showed Group Stage games featuring host nations averaging $4,695 versus $2,443 for non-host matchups, roughly a 1.9× premium by their measurement.</p>
