In a statement to Deadline, a Disney spokesperson said, “We're focused on supporting our cast member, who is recovering. Safety is at the heart of what we do, and that element of the show will be modified as our safety team completes a review of what happened.” Latest Death At Walt Disney World Resort Ruled A Suicide; Third Fatality In 10 Days Guest Dies In Apparent Suicide At Walt Disney World Hotel Audience members including many children watch as the unidentified employee is knocked to the ground, his head seemingly bloodied. The employee is then lifted to his feet by other park workers. In one video making the rounds – watch it below – a man shooting cell phone video Tuesday can be heard jokingly tell his family, “It's coming right for us,” apparently thinking the audience-bound bouncing boulder was all part of the show. After the worker is knocked down and other workers come to his aid, a woman can be heard saying, “Wait, like, for real?” The man taking the video then says, “It's alright girls, it's ok…He literally saved our lives.” The social media videos began circulating Tuesday, December 30. Scott Gustin, a frequent blogger on theme parks and all things Disney, was the first to report the incident, confirming that it happened Tuesday and that the cast member received immediate care.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As soon as the curtain fell in 2018 on her 120-show $100 million-grossing Jennifer Lopez: All I Have residency at Planet Hollywood, the speculation began on when — not if — J.Lo would return to Las Vegas. After seven years, she announced plans for the new Up All Night Live while hosting the American Music Awards in May 2025. On Dec. 30, after months of rehearsal and teasers on her social media, the fervor came to fruition, as Lopez transported the sold-out audience of more than 4,000 at The Colosseum at Caesars from fantasy to reality and back again in a feverish haze of gyrating bodies and miles of sequins. Always known for making a major entrance, Lopez launched the 120-minute pop, R&B and Latin music and dance odyssey with a spectacular Broadway-themed opener that included “Let Me Entertain You” from the musical Gypsy; 1999's “Waiting for Tonight” mashed-up with West Side Story's “Mambo”; an ultra-jazzy “Jenny From the Block”; and finished with 2007's “Do It Well.” In a toast to their early aughts reign as the terry-cloth sweatsuit king and queen, Ja Rule joined Lopez on stage for their hits “Ain't It Funny” and “I'm Real.” The most significant difference from her last Vegas show? Lopez's participation in Up All Night Live as narrator, speaking candidly about reinvention, resilience and the discipline it has taken to get her here and back again. Those reflections gave emotional ballast to the high-gloss production designed for spectacle on Las Vegas' most storied stage, which Adele, Cher, Mariah Carey and Celine Dion have graced.

Editor's Note: The following story contains spoilers for Season 1 of “Pluribus.” The first season of Apple TV's acclaimed sci-fi drama “Pluribus” just wrapped on Christmas Eve, but audiences are already pining for news of the next chapter. The nine-episode series from “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul” creator Vince Gilligan seemingly came out of nowhere in November, creating a frenzy at the tail end of 2025, which was a largely uneventful year for original drama television. Set primarily in Gilligan's go-to destination of Albuquerque, New Mexico, “Pluribus” kicks off with all but 12 people on Earth being infected with an alien virus that joins them into a mysterious hive mind. While the virus' global effects are seemingly positive — creating a communal society full of smiling faces and absent of violence, bigotry, and class systems — on a person-to-person level, the results are less comforting. Individuals aren't “I” but “we,” and all distinguishing personality traits have simply disappeared. Related Stories A Simple Plan to Save ‘Stranger Things' from Hollywood's Tired Franchise Trap Here's What's Entering the Public Domain in 2026 So it's going to be a while between seasons; it just is,” Gilligan told the publication, elaborating on Smith's comment that the series “will be back as soon as humanly possible.” In another post-finale interview, this time with Entertainment Weekly, the duo doubled down on refusing to rush toward Season 2, with Smith quipping that they're at least pointed in the right direction and Gilligan defending their creative process. “As much as I am so grateful for the fans digging this show, we've always found our best way to proceed is to be in our bunker creating this thing and not pay too much attention to reactions of any sort, positive or negative,” Gilligan said. Those comments didn't sit well with eager “Pluribus” devotees, who logged onto social media in recent days to lament the team's lack of progress and express frustration over shows taking so long between seasons these days. And we're not talking about just any sci-fi fans here: Even Stephen King joined in the call for a speedier timeline, tweeting, “Vince Gilligan says he's in no hurry to get going on Season 2 of PLURIBUS. Understood, but hey, Vince, if you're listening: I'm not getting any younger.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The CBS News boss trolls Clooney's move to France and issues him an open invitation. CBS News boss Bari Weiss is sending a message to George Clooney after the actor criticized her management of the news network. “Bonjour, Mr. Clooney!” wrote Weiss in a statement shared with The New York Post. Bari Weiss Says Pulling '60 Minutes' Story "May Seem Radical" But Necessary for "Integrity of the News" The statement was apparently in response to an interview Clooney gave to Variety, where the actor said, “Bari Weiss is dismantling CBS News as we speak. Clooney also criticized CBS and ABC for settling costly lawsuits filed by President Trump that many felt were specious. “If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go, fuck yourself,' we wouldn't be where we are in the country,” Clooney says. Clooney previously co-wrote and directed the 2005 film Good Night, and Good Luck, chronicling legendary CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (played by David Strathairn). “I don't want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don't want them being compared to somebody else's famous kids.” Weiss has come under criticism for her handling of CBS News since Paramount CEO David Ellison hired the Free Press founder in October. Amid fears that Weiss doesn't have enough experience for the role and would shift the organization politically to the right, Weiss recently held a 60 Minutes report on Trump's immigration policies that alleged human rights abuses at a prison in El Salvador. “No amount of outrage — whether from activist organizations or the White House — will derail us,” Weiss wrote in a staff memo defending the decision. In response to Weiss' decision and comments, 60 Minutes correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi sent her colleagues a message challenging Weiss' decision and depiction of the story's vetting. “In my view, pulling it now — after every rigorous internal check has been met — is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

The new suit comes days after Ador and its parent company, HYBE, revealed that they had ended their contract with Danielle amid wider talks with NewJeans members to return and end a protracted dispute. In that statement, Ador signaled their intention to take legal action, saying they believed Danielle's family member and Min Hee-jin “bear significant responsibility for causing this dispute and for the delays in NewJeans' departure and return.” HYBE and Ador did not immediately return Rolling Stone's request for comment.

The members of NewJeans had originally seemed intent on appealing the decision before ultimately deciding to open up talks of a return with Ador.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Travis Kelce would prefer not to recall his time on a reality dating show. On the Dec. 31 installment of his “New Heights” podcast, the football star confirmed that he would rather have his “gooch waxed” than be subject to episodes of Catching Kelce. During the “No Dumb Questions” segment of New Heights, which Travis helms with his brother Jason Kelce, the Chiefs player was asked, “Would you rather be forced and tortured watching Catching Kelce on a loop for the rest of your life or get Brazilian waxed like Jason?” Jason, who was waxed for charity earlier this year, agreed: “Yeah. Despite the pain, Travis affirmed, “But yeah, I'd rather just get my gooch waxed.” Catching Kelce aired for seven episodes in 2016 on E!. It featured Travis dating 50 women, one from each state, in his pursuit of love. “I was so bad financially my first couple years,” he told The Pivot. “I literally went through my first couple checks like it was nothing. I was like … ‘This is actually starting to sound a little better. “I didn't realize what reality TV really was.” During an appearance on Heart Breakfast, Swift said she started floating inspiration for her ring to the athlete about 18 months prior by showing him videos of recent work from designer Kindred Lubeck.

Swift stopped by New Heights earlier this year to promote her most recent LP, The Life of a Showgirl. “This kind of felt more like I was in an '80s John Hughes movie, and he was standing outside of my window with boom box, just being like, ‘I want to date you,'” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Titanic is the most popular disaster-survival film of all time. But if you found yourself on the “ship of dreams” on the night of April 15, 1912, what could you have done to survive its sinking? We asked the film's Oscar-winning writer-director James Cameron during our interview for last week's Hollywood Reporter cover story and the ever-resourceful filmmaker gave a rather clever answer. First, our phrasing of the question was specifically chosen: “If you were traveling by yourself as a second-class passenger on Titanic when it hit an iceberg, what would you have done?” And “second class” because we all know from watching Cameron's film that some third-class passengers found themselves trapped below decks and were pretty much doomed, while first-class passengers had the best shot at securing an easy seat on the lifeboats (even though Second Officer Charles Lightoller mistakenly took the captain's order of “women and children first” to mean “women and children only,” which resulted in some boats not being filled to capacity). “I think there were interesting ways to what-if or second-guess the whole thing,” Cameron says. “One I like to play with my Titanic experts is — with what we know now, and if you had the captain's ear — how could you save everybody? “They couldn't quite believe that the ship was really going to sink. No, they'd pull you in, and the officers would go, ‘Well, f–k, there's nothing I can do about that.' Which made sense given the amount of information he had at the time — not knowing rescue from another ship wouldn't arrive until roughly two hours after Titanic sank. An even better move would have been for Rose (Kate Winslet) to stay on the lifeboat, giving Jack a better shot at survival on that floating door. But that's all part of the movie's appeal; there's a play-along factor where the audience can ask themselves what they would have done at various turning points. Cameron's latest, Avatar: Fire and Ash, is now in theaters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gigi and Bella Hadid's secret half-sister, Aydan Nix, said her siblings have been “warm and generous” since she met them in 2023. They have made space for me in ways they didn't have to,” the fashion designer wrote in a new essay for the Cut. Nix was born from a brief relationship her father, Mohamed Hadid, had over 20 years ago with Terri Hatfield Dull. “Alana sent me resources and inspired me to become active in the fight for Palestine's freedom,” she penned.

Gigi took me for my first Palestinian meal and taught me the names of different dishes,” Nix added. Additionally, Nix's supermodel sisters have also helped her get her foot into the fashion world after she recently graduated from the Parsons School of Design in New York. “Gigi introduced me to her friend Gabriella Karefa Johnson, whom I had admired not only for her styling but for her strong convictions and values,” she wrote in the Cut essay. “I started assisting her when times were especially busy. My first day on set was a Victoria's Secret campaign. I worked 17 hours that day,” Nix added. “They had a lifetime of memories, and I felt like the odd one out,” Nix wrote. In May, the identity of Gigi and Bella's secret half-sister was revealed to be Nix. “Aydan was born and raised in Florida, growing up with the man she lovingly knew as her father until his sudden passing when she was 19,” the models added. Mohamed briefly dated Dull following his 2001 divorce from Yolanda. The Daily Mail reported that their fling ended shortly before Dull discovered she was pregnant.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Welcome to Rendering, a Deadline column reporting at the intersection of AI and showbiz. Rendering examines how artificial intelligence is disrupting the entertainment industry, taking you inside key battlegrounds and spotlighting change makers wielding the technology for good and ill. Got a story about AI? Rendering wants to hear from you: jkanter@deadline.com. This edition: Why Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker‘s idea to deepfake cinemagoers into movies was typically prescient. Whether it's Domhnall Gleeson's replicant boyfriend pre-dating grief chatbots, creepy social credits systems, or killer robots, Black Mirror is often the dystopian nightmare we come to recognize in reality. Streamer Report Card: Streaming Reached A Profit Turning Point In 2025, But Major Players Still Wonder How To Measure Success Karen Glass Dies: Former Disney Exec & 'A Pickleball Christmas' Producer Was 63 With that in mind, my ears pricked up when Brooker cheerily sketched out an AI vision to boost cinema ticket sales during an on-stage interview in 2025. “So imagine if you went to see Raiders of the Lost Ark and you don't know if you're going to be Indiana Jones, or a melting Nazi,” he told the Edinburgh TV Festival. Little more than a month later, OpenAI launched Sora 2, allowing users to insert themselves into infinite movie realms through its “Cameos” feature. The screenwriter touched on something fundamental about how AI content is being voraciously consumed as novelty. “It's telling, isn't it, that a lot of the AI-generated imagery you see is a remix of other things,” Brooker said. But does it have the legs to walk into cinema theaters? The technology is there, but it's fair to say that storytelling and audience expectations are not — and that's before you even start considering the ethics for performers and privacy. Attempts to revolutionize the cinema experience through innovation have flopped. 3D is now largely seen as a gimmick. “People just don't go to the cinema for this stuff,” says Sarah Atkinson, professor of screen media at King's College London. It's perhaps instructive that the two exhibition executives approached for this Rendering column did not wish to speak about deepfaking their audience members into works of art. But that's not to say movie studios are dismissing these ideas. The best indication of this was Disney's shock deal to hand over characters from titles like Frozen and Toy Story to Sora, with the best user-generated videos set to be hosted on Disney+. It's not quite Brooker's cinema vision, but who would have predicted at the start of 2025 that Disney superfans could star in AI-generated videos on the Mouse House's own streaming service?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bikini-clad Alessandra Ambrosio posed for her boyfriend in a sultry new set of beach snaps. The Victoria's Secret Angel was pictured modeling a royal blue seashell-studded thong bikini on the rocky beaches of Pernambuco, Brazil on Tuesday. She wore her brunette locks loose around her shoulders while posing in the sunshine, accessorizing with layered necklaces and a pair of sunglasses for the impromptu tropical shoot. Boyfriend Buck Palmer — who rocked a coordinating blue ball cap and black swim trunks — crouched down to take a shot of his girlfriend as she posed in the shallow waters. At one point, the model kicked up her feet and reclined against the black rocks for another sultry photo. Palmer and Ambrosio were caught by a nearby photographer's lens flirting in the shallow waters and embracing in a passionate kiss, as well. Ambrosio, 44, has been sharing bikini-clad photos from her holiday vacation, where she's been spotted frolicking in the waves with Palmer, 43, and other pals. On Friday, she modeled an animal print bikini in snapshots shared to Instagram, and on Sunday she layered a green two-piece swimsuit with a plunging, butter-yellow coverup while wading in the ocean. “Feeling the energy of Noronha and being blessed by salty water, sunsets and this magical island!” she captioned an upload, which included an affectionate selfie with the Australian jewelry designer. She labeled the clip, “A few moments of magic ✨🏝️💖” The dreamy holiday vacation comes two months after Ambrosio and her lookalike daughter made a rare red carpet appearance alongside Palmer at the Bravo Film Festival in Los Angeles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ten years after she last played Charlotte Thornton on “When Calls The Heart,” actress Brooke Shields shocked Hearties in October 2025 with the news she'd be returning to the Hallmark Channel series for season 13, premiering on January 4, 2026. Turns out that wasn't the only surprise Shields, 60, had up her sleeve. Shields first appeared on “When Calls The Heart” as a guest star in 2016, playing the mother of Daniel Lissing's character, Mountie Jack Thornton. They were last seen trying to access a new treatment for little Jack, who was diagnosed with diabetes in season 12. In fact, the season ended with them heading to stay at Charlotte's boarding house. I have a Type-1 diabetic daughter who was diagnosed at age 14, and this is the first major television series script that came across my desk that had a legitimate Type-1 diabetes storyline, and that definitely hit home for me.” Shields and her eldest daughter, Rowan Henchy, told People in 2024 that Henchy had been diagnosed with diabetes as a high school freshman in 2018. Now an advocate for others navigating the disease, frequently showcasing the patches she wears to pump medicine and monitor her blood sugar levels, Henchy has since graduated from college. “So, I get to have a scene with my daughter, who has never done anything like that before,” Shields said. “I'm just sitting there thinking that at 60 years old it has culminated into this really feel-good, positive goodwill that I'm being invited to still play in and do, and share it with my daughter.” That includes, Shields said, how it's continued to portray strong women in the early 1900s. She told Parade, “I read the scripts, and it dealt very honestly and appropriately with women in this time of their lives.” “They have to pick themselves up,” she said, describing the show's female characters. She opened her own boarding house with her own money and did things that women weren't often doing in that time period. She's not relying on a man, and it's an interestingly modern feminist approach in the best of ways.” I'm thrilled to have Brooke Shields back as Charlotte Thornton. Does she know the part he played in Jack's death and kept it from Elizabeth for years? Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Teyana Taylor and Aaron Pierre have reportedly called it quits after less than a year of dating. The breakup comes during a major career moment for Taylor, who is entering awards season with momentum behind her work in film and music. Pierre later appeared in a short film tied to Taylor's 2025 album, “Escape Room,” where the two shared a steamy on-screen moment that fueled further buzz. By June, Taylor made the relationship Instagram official, posting a birthday tribute to Pierre alongside photos from his celebration. The couple continued to step out together, including at the BET Awards, where Taylor described Pierre as “very gentle,” adding that he allowed her to feel “safe” and not “in survival mode,” per Page Six. During a panel promoting “Escape Room,” he praised Taylor, calling her “really one of one.” The pair were frequently seen coordinating outfits and appearing side by side while promoting the project, which later earned Taylor a Grammy nomination. Their last notable public appearance together was at the London premiere of Taylor's film “One Battle After Another.” Even at the height of their visibility, Taylor was careful about labels. In a November cover story with The Hollywood Reporter, she referred to Pierre as her “apple pie” and said they were each other's “safe space,” but stopped short of calling him her boyfriend. Taylor echoed that sentiment in an August interview with HOT 97, describing their bond as “very healthy,” “soft” and “safe,” and calling it “one of the best feelings I ever had.”. Pierre shared a similar tone in an October interview with Men's Health, saying it was a “joy” to support Taylor publicly and that “anything that feels right feels easy.” The split arrives as Taylor heads into awards season with a Golden Globe nomination for “One Battle After Another” and growing Oscar buzz.
