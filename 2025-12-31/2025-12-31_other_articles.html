                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (WABC) -- As we head into a new year, many people turn to the stars for guidance, checking their horoscopes or sometimes looking to psychics about what's to come. But the two men at the center of this story have been using those gifts for something very different. You might call them the definition of an unlikely duo, one's a psychic, the other an FBI agent. They're real-life friends and partners who have worked together for the past 25 years tracking some of the most notorious criminals. And now, John Edward and Bob Hilland are sharing some of the inner workings of cases they've collaborated on in a new book, it's called Chasing Evil. Joelle Garguilo sat down with them both to talk about the book, how their unlikely partnership started, and how they've helped in countless chilling cases as they hunted evil together. Joelle Garguilo: I think maybe a good place would be your first impressions of one another. And I say that because, Bob, you were a little skeptical, as I would imagine people in your field are. I heard him on the radio several times, and I thought it was utterly ridiculous, how could people believe this? And it just so happened I had many cases. One of them involved a woman and a couple who disappeared at the hands of one guy, and there were no witnesses to lead to a suspect. So I brought that case to him to vet out, was he a con or was he legit? Joelle Garguilo: And when that meeting happened, you started to read him. John Edward: Yeah, I didn't really trust his intentions, the reason why he was there, because I don't do police work. Help them maybe become unstuck or connect with their family members and friends. But this came in and I kind of felt a sense, we'll call it a sense of duty. He brought me control items, and then I wound up reading for him. And I think that's where the journey began. The journey began where I gave him information that I could not possibly know, that was later confirmed by his family. And then that kind of cracked open the potential. Joelle Garguilo: So much of your job must be being faced with skepticism and criticism. I think we have to approach everything in life as a critical thinker. We have to say, "I'm not sure." I came into the subject matter very skeptical. I'm always looking for validation and information within a reading that I'm the one who's doing it. I'm always looking to help back it up. Joelle Garguilo: You didn't want anybody to know about this. John Edward: The book Chasing Evil starts with a little boy named Noah. And when that case gets resolved, for the very first time in our three decades of doing this, it was something that I heard in his voice, it was something that I felt, and there was a press conference that was happening. Up until that moment, it'd always be, "Please don't use my name," and he used to jokingly say, "No worries, I want to keep my job." So we were in perfect alignment there. And I think what's important is that folks like Bob don't always get that validation, and I think this is kind of an opportunity for him to be validated in his personal life. Bob Hilland: We've been on quite a journey for many years. I wrote the first draft of this book probably six or seven years ago. And then as I concluded my career at the Bureau and moved on to my new career, he and I would have many conversations about, "Hey, maybe it's time we start putting this together." Joelle Garguilo: Can you talk about some of the cases, at least the ones that we read about in this book? Bob Hilland: There's the Yale University student Annie Le, who was murdered and killed. There is the Michael Vick dog fighting case. There is a guy by the name of John Smith, and then there are some overseas experiences in places like Afghanistan and Kazakhstan. You call John, and then what happens? Bob Hilland: There were a lot of investigators from many agencies looking for this poor young girl. It's like looking for a needle in a haystack, but you don't know which haystack you're looking in. They were giving me the walkthrough, and at that moment, John called me from Ireland and said, "Hey, wherever you are right now, she's there." I said, "What do you mean she's there?" He said, "Wherever you are right now." And if you've ever seen him, once he starts getting information, it comes quick. Now you have to understand, I was not the lead investigator. I was just one of many people helping out in this case, and I'm surrounded by colleagues and associates. And John says, "Hey, wherever you are, did they find a mini-refrigerator?" So now I have to turn to these folks who don't even know me and say, "Hey guys, I got a crazy question. Any chance you came across a mini-refrigerator?" And they looked at me like, "Yeah. John's on the phone talking to me, "She's there." And he says, "All right, there's a door on the right, and there's a door on the left." I said, "Guys, we need to go in there." They open the door, and keep in mind, the whole place had already been searched thoroughly. And John says, "Hey, she's in the pipes. She's like between pipes or something." And we're looking through this room, four or five of us, and it's a rather large room, but she's not there. The next day, perhaps, I'm driving back to DC and my phone lights up from one of my colleagues. He says, "Bob, you're not gonna believe this. John Edward: So when I'm working with energies, every single person I sit in front of is a case to me. And I have to figure out who's coming through, how did they pass, and what is their story? What Bob did with me is, if I was a flashlight, he just directed my ability to use it in a different capacity. Joelle Garguilo: When I did ask "Why now? ", there's a part of me that almost thought a different reason why now, because there are some cases in this book where the body was never found. And in a sense, I thought maybe for you, Bob, this was your way to give justice to the victims. Bob Hilland: You can be the best FBI agent or investigator, run everything to the ground, and sometimes the cases don't work out like you want. When the readers go through this book, I think they're gonna feel like they're a part of these investigations when they hear the conversation between John and I, but I really hope they take away that we cared about these people. We cared about their families, the sacrifices we both made going through this personally and professionally. John Edward: Not the height difference. But also we should say you are, what, six foot eight? Bob Hilland: Well, I think for me, there's been a lot of laughs, a lot of tears, a lot of growth, and sometimes the only way you grow is through pain, and there's been some of that too, right? I mean, not between us, but in the journey we experienced together. We all have, I think, a lot of acquaintances in our life. I think everything happens for a reason. Joelle Garguilo: Not that this is about that, but for the skeptics out there, what would you say? John Edward: Stay skeptical, but don't be cynical. God forbid that any of these people who are skeptical, if they had somebody close to them that disappeared and they had the best investigator working the case, and that investigator ran every lead to the ground. And despite everything, they couldn't find a loved one. But I happen to have this buddy here who may be able to say, "Hey, maybe look over there." Joelle Garguilo: What's it like for you when you're introducing new people to your friend and you know that they are skeptics, and all of a sudden, he does what he does? Those moments, and there were a few of them. There was another one with the Secret Service. * Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts Send it to Eyewitness News using the form below.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sometimes a musician can be so otherworldly that we have a hard time coming up with anything else to give credit to. Yes, some musicians seem to be sourcing power from something supernatural. It all started with Robert Johnson, an early blues guitarist who became a myth when a story circulated that he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for supernatural musicianship. Johnson's story inspired many others, forging an ironclad connection between music and the dark forces. While those claims have never been proven, the myth hasn't stopped building. Rock artists have long been associated with the occult. While many musicians attempt to push back against that notion, a few help proliferate it—Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page being one. His offenses include buying the famous occultist Aleister Crowley's former home, opening up an occult bookstore, and the plethora of creepy notions he helped inject into Zeppelin's catalog. Though it seems Page is likely more of a hobbyist than a believer, his interests outside of music certainly add some color to his career. One look at Marilyn Manson had people accusing him of Satanic rituals and other occult practices. He's certainly got the look of someone who'd be into that kind of thing, and while we don't like to judge a book by its cover, Manson's demeanor is more than a coincidence. Manson is a shock artist, hellbent on turning heads. In doing this, he's racked up some interesting anecdotes and also criminal investigations. At any rate, Manson hasn't done much to dispel his occult rumors. In fact, it seems like he rather enjoys being a point of contention. 3 Female-Fronted Classic Pop and Rock Songs That Hit No. 3 Artists That Were Rumored To Be Working With the Occult</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MISSISSIPPI — As revelers ring in the New Year and scan the skies for fireworks, Mississippians hoping to spot something more otherworldly may want to temper their expectations. A new study ranks Mississippi among the worst states in the nation for reported UFO sightings, with just 7.82 sightings per 1 million residents each year. Full disclosure: Last year a different company put out a different study based on different criteria that said we're the 4th most likely to see a UFO, so really, is any of this for anything more than fun? By contrast, Vermont tops the list as the state where residents are most likely to report seeing a UFO, averaging 33 sightings per 1 million residents annually. New Hampshire and Idaho followed closely behind, with more than 31 sightings per 1 million residents each year. Mississippi ranked 48th out of 50 states, with 115 reported sightings over the five-year period. Texas, despite having one of the highest total numbers of reported sightings, ranked last overall when population was taken into account, with just 7.01 sightings per 1 million residents annually. In a release sent Tuesday, McLuck researchers calculated sightings per capita to better reflect how likely residents are to report unexplained objects in the sky, rather than simply tallying raw numbers. They also analyzed patterns by month and time of day. Idaho, Maine and Oregon rounded out the top five. Oregon, meanwhile, recorded a decline in sightings last year despite ranking high overall. “This is probably due to the lighter evenings and Americans spending more time outside, which could increase their chances of spotting these phenomena.” More than 60% of Americans believe the U.S. government is hiding information about UFOs and extraterrestrial life, according to a recent YouGov survey cited by McLuck. While Mississippi may not be a hotspot for reported sightings, researchers note that location, weather patterns and population density all influence reporting rates. For those determined to improve their odds this New Year's, the data point north — preferably toward Vermont — and suggest stepping outside just after dark, eyes on the sky. This study analyzes reports submitted to the National UFO Reporting Center between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2025, to identify which US states have the highest number of UFO sightings. The total number of yearly sightings per 1 million residents was then calculated for each US state to determine a fairer ranking. In addition, the months and hours of the day where UFO sightings are most likely to occur, both at state and national levels.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fan theories and conspiracies are nothing new in the world of gaming and there's a recent Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 one which has been completely shut down by a developer. Pretty well ever since it was announced open lobbies would be returning in Black Ops 7, there has been all kinds of speculation about how much skill is actually taken into account. Open lobbies mean that SBMM (skill-based matchmaking) is minimally considered (but not entirely ignored) when deciding who players will be up against. Although it was welcomed with open arms during the Beta in October, and continues to be a very popular choice among Black Ops 7 players, there have been constant claims Activision has been tweaking it. I've been finding nothing but master prestige players in every lobby." And in response, Treyarch design director Matt Scronce himself shut down the claims. He simply replied: "No they haven't."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The human circus — eschewing animal acts for dazzling derring-do from acrobats and athletes — is making its South Florida debut Jan. 9-19 in a big-top tent to be set up in Miramar Regional Park. And unlike other circuses that crisscross Broward and Palm Beach counties, Paranormal Cirque is not for the whole family. “We're bringing our R-rated horror circus with a haunted attraction pre-show,” says Steve Copeland, a comedian and spokesman with Cirque Italia, the show's Bradenton-based producer. No nudity, unless you maybe buy the performers a couple drinks, but no nudity in the show itself. According to Copeland, some of the acts include: “We're a strictly non-animal circus, although some of our performers do eat like animals,” he adds. “You're going to see awesome acrobatics, beautiful aerial acts, you're going to see feats of strength and daring and death-defying death stunts — all with a horror theme. There's also a lot of comedy, which people don't expect. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to see Paranormal Cirque, but teenagers (ages 13 through 17) can attend as long as they have an adult guardian. Copeland continues, “And in addition to two hours of Vegas quality R-rated power circus entertainment, you get a haunted attraction free show that begins an hour before show time and it's free with the admission ticket. And it's a walk-through haunted house starring the same performers that you're going to see in the show. They're going to scare the heck out of you. The show's parent company, Cirque Italia, was started by Manuel Rebecchi in 2012 and now has seven touring companies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For decades, admitting to a belief in aliens was enough to have an academic's credibility questioned, but a profound shift in the scientific zeitgeist is underway. In a recent survey of 1,055 scientists (including 521 astrobiologists), a staggering 86.6 per cent of respondents agreed that extraterrestrial life almost certainly exists somewhere in the vastness of the cosmos. The study, published in Nature Astronomy and led by Peter Vickers of Durham University, also revealed that 58.2 per cent of astrobiologists believe intelligent alien life is out there. At the heart of this changing perspective is the Copernican principle—the scientific idea that Earth is not special, but merely one of countless similar worlds. To put that in perspective, there are 13.33 billion times more stars in the sky than there are individual grains of sand on every beach and desert on Earth. Against this backdrop, the recent passing of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has served as a timely reminder of our cosmic connectivity. While scientists like Mike Garrett, the Sir Bernard Lovell Chair of Astrophysics at the University of Manchester, maintain that such objects are likely natural, their presence proves that material from other star systems can and does reach our own. Garrett argues that the ingredients for life—carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen—are far from rare. 'We now know that most stars have a planetary system,' Professor Garrett explains. 'That means there are loads of places where life can arise. Besides, simple life arose so quickly on Earth; to me, that's a key sign that it must be happening elsewhere.' The challenge is no longer debating 'if' life exists, but determining exactly 'where' and 'how' we can find it. The search has moved beyond looking for microbial 'biosignatures' to a more ambitious hunt for 'technosignatures'—measurable evidence of past or present technology, such as radio leakage or atmospheric pollutants. In fact, recent research from the University of Manchester suggests that human-made radar from international airports could be detected by advanced civilisations up to 200 light-years away—meaning the same applies to us searching for them. Mike Garrett remains optimistic about our chances of a breakthrough. 'We're in a much better position to discover it now than we were five years ago,' he notes. 'Everything is going in the right direction for detection.' The rapid acceleration of computing power, digitisation, and artificial intelligence is providing researchers with the tools to sift through astronomical data at speeds previously thought impossible. Having reached its closest point to the Sun on 29 October 2025 at a distance of 1.36 AU, 3I/ATLAS is now on its way out of our system, leaving behind a legacy of data. We are no longer looking at a silent, empty void, but a universe potentially teeming with stories that have yet to be told.</p>

Your info will be used in accordance with our Privacy Policy You'll now receive top stories, breaking news, and more, straight to your email. He said this belief came from a supernatural ability to read people's minds. Correctional officers discovered Kelly “lying motionless inside a cell” during routine checks on Friday night.

This follows Ollinger and his father, Duane, as they search for a long-rumoured Aztec treasure on their 160-acre property in Utah's Uinta Basin. Jail records show Ollinger was arrested on October 27 as a fugitive from another state. He has had prior run-ins with law enforcement, including an arrest last year for avoiding police before later posting bond. It remains unclear why his cellmate was being held at the detention centre.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The site was going to play a crucial role in defending Britain if nuclear war ever broke out AN abandoned RAF site dubbed Britain's ‘Area 51' is a magnet for UFO hunters, urban explorers and conspiracy theorists who believe it was once home to government investigations into aliens. From the outside, Rudloe Manor in Wiltshire looks like your typical 17th century Grade II listed house set in quiet rural surroundings.

I treated twin who ran onto M6 & stabbed man… did telepathic bond drive her? How troubled Brits ‘seeking violent deaths' are groomed on twisted fetish sites “Seeing it over the years, every time I went there I went into a different building, and the change is kind of apocalyptic.” Top secret documents declassified in 2010 confirmed RAF Rudloe, between Corsham and Box in Wiltshire, WAS used as a UFO intelligence base. Hot dinners & warm beds… how  West Ham opened its doors to rough sleepers Snow warning MAPPED for New Year's Day as Arctic air creeps across UK in -4C dip Hilarious moment bank robbers in brazen ‘£30m' Xmas heist PAY for parking Ministers heard weekly reports of UFO sightings and Churchill once even ordered one reported meeting between RAF planes and a UFO to be kept secret for at least five decades in order to prevent “mass panic”. Wiltshire has long been an epicentre of strange activity, including crop circles, UFOs, and mysterious ancient sites like Stonehenge. And to add further intrigue, the base sits on top of a vast maze of underground tunnels and bunkers built in old Bath Stone quarries that was essentially a city able to house as many as 4,000 people. Government ministers would also have been evacuated to here in case of a nuclear attack on Britain, and there was even a section dedicated to the Royal Family. There was also a BBC TV studio that the government would have used to broadcast to the nation while war raged above ground. Although Rudloe Manor is now a separate dwelling belonging to a local family, the RAF site and its 40 prefabricated buildings still lay abandoned, surrounded by security fences topped with razor wire. Today, a metal gate covers the old entrance bearing the sign ‘private, keep out', windows of the huts are boarded up or smashed out, while several oil tanks capable of holding 6,000 gallons lie peeling, covered in graffiti and vandalised. Dog walkers use the old access road for exercise, but locals remain tight-lipped for fear of inviting more conspiracy theorists or intruders. It was left for 20 years in a state of dilapidation. I know someone who's really into UFOs who got into Rudloe Manor, but it was just a shell, just rooms blocked off with breeze blocks and in a complete state of disrepair. “I've only been in the old RAF buildings though. I just find the way somewhere can be left as it was with signs of what used to go on there just fascinating. “We've all seen videos of unexplained objects in the air, or UFOs, but personally I think most things can be explained, so I think it's a pretty bold claim there was ever anything like that at Rudloe, other than documents. “Last year when I went, I didn't get past the boundary because there was security to stop the many people they had breaking in there.” A source close to the new owners of Rudloe Manor claims the property, which lay empty for 20 years before it was renovated, is still regularly targeted for its historical link to the UFO reports. One woman who did not want to be identified said: “We've always known about the UFO rumours, some people want it to be true because it's more interesting. “Some people believe parts of a spaceship housed there, but I don't think it is true. Other locals suggest the land is ear-marked for development, but no planning applications have currently been submitted. Conspiracy theorists believe the facility is used to store, examine and reverse engineer crashed alien spacecraft, including material supposedly recovered from the 1950s Roswell crash.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But one thing's for sure: contrarian narratives are not going away. Here are 10 widely held falsehoods concerning space and our place within it, which we examine rationally. Let's start with perhaps the strangest conspiracy theory of all: that Earth is flat. Furthermore, the idea that Earth is a sphere is a villainous lie spread across millennia by an evil, secret establishment. There are many reasons (or excuses) flat Earthers give for this belief: Earth looks flat; we don't feel Earth moving; NASA has faked images of the spherical Earth; gravity doesn't exist; ships don't sink below the horizon; the tides are caused by Earth moving up and down; explorers who have discovered the edge of the world have been silenced; the Moon generates its own light; artificial satellites don't exist… and so on. All of these can be easily disproved or logically discounted. You can actually perform a similar proof yourself. All you need are two synchronised clocks, two sextants(or other devices for measuring angles in the sky), a car and a friend. There are only two possible explanations for this. We can go further and disprove the first possibility. If Polaris were only 6,371km high, then if you travel 6,371km from the North Pole on a flat Earth, you have made an equilateral triangle and Polaris would be 45˚ above your horizon. Sadly, NASA is the recipient of much distrust and derision from conspiracy theorists. The idea has a long history, first appearing even before the first Apollo landing, and was undoubtedly given a boost by the 1977 movie Capricorn One, in which a manned mission to Mars is faked by NASA. Or that shadows, backgrounds, and even footprints do not appear as expected. They also often refer to the US flag ‘waving' when the Moon has no atmosphere, or that astronauts would be killed by radiation while passing through Earth's Van Allen belts. Actually, all of the ‘proof' for a faked Moon landing can be easily refuted. For example, there are no stars in the lunar sky because photos were taken in full sunlight and therefore with short exposures. The US flag only ‘flutters' when it is moved by an astronaut. But can we prove that humans went to the Moon? Lunar module descent stages, the tracks of lunar rovers and even disturbances by the astronauts themselves can clearly be seen. Unfortunately, even these proofs are often discounted as merely part of the conspiracy and therefore faked. What about scientists who have analysed Apollo rock samples? Has NASA managed to dupe all these people too? Modern science is pretty confident that Earth cannot be the only place in the Universe where life has emerged. Currently, however, we have no evidence of life beyond our tiny planet. Aligned with this is the belief that Earth was visited in prehistory by ‘ancient astronauts', or that recently discovered interstellar asteroids or comets are really alien spacecraft. Despite often-cited ‘evidence' for aliens (and their collusion with governments), none of it stands up to thorough scientific scrutiny. Claims are not repeatable, measurable, testable or unambiguous. Most can be discounted, and those that can't do not necessarily imply alien involvement; other unproven but possible explanations can easily be put forward. In July 1976, NASA's Viking 1 orbiter took an image of the Martian surface that seemed to show a human face on Mars. A popular conspiracy theory holds that an extraterrestrial craft, dubbed ‘Black Knight', is in orbit around Earth, and that its existence is being covered up. This seems to be an amalgam of various myths and misunderstandings, and was probably inspired by a NASA photo of space debris taken during a Space Shuttle flight in 1998. The idea that Earth will be destroyed by a collision with a planet called Nibiru was first proposed in 1995 by Nancy Lieder, a Wisconsin woman who claims to have been abducted (and implanted) by aliens. There is a small possibility of a large Planet 9 (or Planet X) floating somewhere in the farthest reaches of the Solar System. This could explain the observed clustering of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). Even if eventually found, however, it would not be a threat to Earth. Some claim the Moon is hollow and may be an alien spaceship. This theory gained traction in the 1970s following several pseudoscientific publications. It's easy to show that the Moon isn't hollow. Data from seismometers placed on the Moon by Apollo astronauts, and countless orbital observations, clearly show the Moon has a solid interior with a thin crust, thick mantle and dense core. During its mission to Saturn in 1981, NASA's Voyager 1 probe discovered an odd hexagonal cloud feature around the planet's north pole. The Cassini mission confirmed it to be about 14,500km (9,009 miles) long. Such an odd shape, which doesn't often occur in nature, has led some to suggest intelligent design. Numerous studies have shown that such shapes can easily form in turbulent rotating fluids. An engineer named Harold Hill claimed that while working for NASA, a missing time period was uncovered when calculating space probe trajectories. Hill never worked for NASA, and the story is completely undocumented. Still, many believe that NASA found a missing day and is hiding the truth. More hoax than conspiracy, the infamous ‘green Moon' meme began in 2016 with a single Facebook post claiming that on 29 May the Moon would turn green due to an alignment with Uranus, the first since 1847. Despite its increasingly tongue-in-cheek tone, it's still believed far and wide. Sadly, no amount of reasoned debate can shake these 10 beliefs for true conspiracy followers. Arming ourselves with clear, testable evidence is the best defence – but perhaps the healthiest response is to accept these theories as an often humorous quirk of human nature. What conspiracy theories would you like to see debunked?</p>
