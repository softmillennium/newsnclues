                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Depending on where you live, relying on a postmark to prove you mailed your tax return, mail-in ballot, bill payment or any other time-sensitive document by a specific date may no longer work as you expect. Postal Service continues implementing operational changes in an effort to shore up its finances and modernize its infrastructure, the agency expects an increase in delays between when you mail something and when it is postmarked, according to a public notice in the Federal Register that took effect Dec. 24. A postmark shows the date your mail was processed, and historically has been applied the same day you mail an item. While households increasingly use digital options to file taxes, pay bills and handle other personal business, there are still people who use the Postal Service for time-sensitive mail. About 29% of voters mailed in their ballots last year, according to USAFacts. And 13% of households paid their bills by mail last year, according to the Postal Service's 2024 Household Diary Study. "Consumers have always assumed that the post office will postmark their mail on the day they take it to the post office or drop it in a box," said Edgar Dworsky, founder of advocacy site Consumer World and a former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts who focused on consumer protection. While the Postal Service said in the notice that it is not changing how it postmarks mail — that has always been done at its processing facilities — the agency has added language to its Domestic Mail Manual to clarify for the public when postmarks are applied. In 2021, USPS unveiled an initiative called Delivering for America to improve its financial condition, which included increasing postage prices and redesigning its network and processing operations. Changes to transportation schedules and the consolidation of processing facilities under that initiative mean many post offices that previously sent mail twice a day to a hub now do so only once in the morning, according to new research from the Brookings Institution. Under the new network, roughly 26% of post offices are within 50 miles of their assigned regional center, and another 26% are between 150 and 500 miles away, according to the research. In some cases — i.e., ahead of weekends or holidays — it could take longer than a day for that crucial stamp to be applied. The importance of ensuring your mail is postmarked in time applies to a range of documents or forms that have deadlines. For example, ballots that are mailed can require a postmark by a specific date to be counted, as can federal and state tax returns and certain legal documents. Asking a postal clerk to manually postmark something costs nothing. Or, you can pay $5.30 to send a time-sensitive document via certified mail, which includes a receipt for the sender as well as a return receipt showing when it was delivered and who signed for it. Alternatively, a certificate of mailing, which you keep for your records, costs $2.40 and shows the date you mailed something. "Waiting in line at the post office is never fun, but you get that proof of timely mailing," said Josh Youngblood, an enrolled agent and founder of The Youngblood Group in Dallas. Given the possibility of a delay, you may want to explore electronic filing or payment options when available. Or, give yourself a deadline to mail something important well ahead of the official due date. While April 15 is when federal taxes are due, the IRS considers any tax return postmarked on or before April 15 as being filed on time, even if it's not received until days later. So if you are prone to waiting until the last minute to file taxes and do not do it electronically, you can't assume dropping off your return at the post office or putting it in a mailbox means it will get postmarked that day. If your tax return is postmarked late and you owe taxes, you may face penalties and interest. For individual tax returns — i.e., your Form 1040 — the penalty for filing a late return is 5% of the tax due for each month or partial month the return is late, capping out at 25%. On top of that, the penalty for paying late is 0.5% of your unpaid balance per month, also capped at 25%. Interest is also charged on unpaid balances, accruing daily at the federal short-term rate plus 3%. However, if you have filed and paid taxes owed on time over the previous three years, you can request that the penalties be waived, Youngblood said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Department of Justice has 5.2 million pages of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents left to review and it will take weeks longer to complete the effort, multiple outlets reported. About 400 lawyers are being enlisted from multiple government divisions to pore over those records, The New York Times first reported late Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. A government document reported by Reuters on Wednesday morning said that the process of reviewing the remaining records will take place between Jan. 5 and Jan. 23. The updated timeline is likely to draw more criticism from lawmakers who have already accused the Trump administration of flouting a statutory deadline to release its files on Epstein, the notorious late sex offender. While it was unclear how many total records would be disclosed, the latest reported figure is much larger than previously indicated, and appears to further undermine a July memo claiming the DOJ conducted "an exhaustive review" of its files on Epstein. Asked for comment, the White House and the DOJ both referred CNBC to an X post from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who said lawyers "are working around the clock through the holidays, including Christmas and New Years, to review documents in compliance with federal law." "It truly is an all-hands-on-deck approach and we're asking as many lawyers as possible to commit their time to review the documents that remain," Blanche wrote, adding, "Required redactions to protect victims take time but they will not stop these materials from being released." President Donald Trump signed a bipartisan bill in mid-November requiring the government to publicly release unclassified records from its investigations into Epstein by Dec. 19. The DOJ released thousands of records on that date, but Blanche indicated that more would be doled out over the "next couple weeks." "I expect several hundred thousand more," Blanche said at the time. On Christmas Eve, the DOJ revealed that more than a million additional documents potentially related to Epstein had been "uncovered" and that it would take "a few more weeks" to release them. Lawyers involved will be expected to review up to 1,000 documents per day over three to five hours, and volunteers are being offered incentives including time off awards and telework options, the document reportedly said. After releasing its initial batch of files, the DOJ quickly drew accusations of failing to produce the required files and of redacting more information than was legally mandated. The department said it "is not redacting the names of any politicians" and maintains that it is fully complying with federal law. Democrats have nevertheless signaled they will take legal action against the administration over the alleged violations. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused the administration of carrying out a "cover up to protect Donald Trump," a former friend of Epstein's who has frequently griped about the public focus on the files.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nike shares were up 4% in midday trading Wednesday after insiders picked up the stock near the end of a rough year. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who serves as a director at the athletic apparel maker, added around 50,000 Nike shares, an approximately 90% increase in his stake, according to financial data provider Verity. Fellow board member Robert Holmes Swan added roughly 8,700 shares, per Verity. That marked a 24% expansion to the former eBay and Intel executive's position. Nike CEO Elliott Hill got about 16,400 shares in a transaction valued at $1 million, Verity found. His personal stake grew by more than 7% as a result. This buying comes as the Oregon-based company wraps up another tough year in the eyes of investors. Shares of Nike have tumbled around 19% in 2025, on pace for its fourth straight down year. Nike has recently contended with weak sales in China and hits from tariffs, the latest in a string of challenges for the retailer. The company has pitched its turnaround story led by Hill, who took the role last year. Wall Street appears optimistic that the stock can rebound. The average analyst polled by LSEG has a buy rating and price target suggesting shares can rise about 26% over the next year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Dec. 8, Federal prosecutors in Texas unsealed documents that revealed an investigation into a massive smuggling network that stretched across the U.S. and the world. Dubbed "Operation Gatekeeper" by the feds, the investigation wasn't focused on drug smuggling or stolen goods but rather an alleged secret, underground network of suppliers for Nvidia's graphic processing units, or GPUs. The government said a hidden smuggling ring was sending chips to China in defiance of American national security export control laws. The smuggling syndicate allegedly involved operatives illegally entering the United States, phony front companies and a secret warehouse shipping operation in New Jersey that was penetrated by at least one undercover agent working on behalf of the U.S. government. The smuggling ring, they said, attempted to export at least $160 million worth of Nvidia H100 and H200 GPUs to China between October 2024 and May 2025. Although China is establishing its own local AI chip market, the county remains highly dependent on Nvidia's technology. "I think more than 60% of the leading AI models in China are currently using Nvidia's hardware," said Ray Wang, an analyst at SemiAnalysis. "Nvidia have [a] systematic advantage ranging from hardware to software. And I think for now, if you combine [those] two factors together, it's still a thing that China is trying to catch up to." As they gathered facts, the government sent an undercover agent into a warehouse in Secaucus, New Jersey. There, the person allegedly witnessed suspects relabeling Nvidia GPUs with branding for a phony company they called "Sandkayan." Operation Gatekeeper culminated in a dramatic scene at the New Jersey warehouse on May 28 as three trucks hired by the conspirators pulled in to pick up the smuggled chips. Five minutes later, according to prosecutors, one of the conspirators sent another message to the entire text thread: "Dissolve this group chat. Soon after that, prosecutors said federal agents swooped in and secured the high-tech equipment, preventing the goods on site from being shipped to China. The case comes amid a flurry of similar busts regarding unauthorized Nvidia exports in recent months. The think tank Center for a New American Security estimates that between 10,000 and several hundred thousand AI chips were smuggled to China in 2024 alone. "In today's world, I feel there's so many ways that you can get your hand on Nvidia's chips in all kinds of illegal" ways, Wang said. A Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC that the U.S. government's export is rigorous and comprehensive. "Even sales of older generation products on the secondary market are subject to strict scrutiny and review," the Nvidia spokesperson said. "While millions of controlled GPUs are in service at businesses, homes, and schools, we will continue to work with the government and our customers to ensure that second-hand smuggling does not occur." But on the same day that federal prosecutors announced their investigation, President Donald Trump made a social media post that could undermine the whole operation. Trump said on Truth Social that the United States would now allow Nvidia's H200 GPUs — the most powerful GPUs seized by authorities in Operation Gatekeeper — to be exported to China. Trump added that Nvidia's most advanced AI chips, the Blackwell and Rubin GPUs, are still not authorized for export. Operation Gatekeeper resulted in the arrests of two businessmen and a guilty plea from a Houston man and his company for smuggling the cutting-edge AI technology. In a court filing the next day, defense attorneys wrote that "the President gave the lie to that claim when he announced that the United States will now allow Nvidia's H200 GPUs—the most powerful GPUs seized by authorities in this case—to be exported to China." Some experts said they believe smuggling of even Nvidia's highest end AI chips into China will continue. "I don't believe the smuggling will just stop," Wang said. "It is unclear to me that the new opening of the H200 chips will be enough for Chinese AI demand. The compute demand we are seeing globally has been accelerating, and I believe that should be the case in China as well." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China has urged the Netherlands to swiftly correct its "mistakes" over chipmaker Nexperia and restore stability in the global semiconductor industry, in the latest development in a dispute over technology transfer. In September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands. In response, China moved to block its products from leaving China, which, in turn, raised the alarm among global automakers as they faced shortages of the chipmaker's components. "What is perplexing is that, faced with the anxiety and unease of the global industry, the Netherlands remains indifferent and stubbornly insists on its own way, showing absolutely no responsible attitude towards the security of the global semiconductor supply chain, and taking no substantive action whatsoever," the spokesperson said in a statement, according to a Google translation. A spokesperson for the Dutch government was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Wednesday morning. Dutch Economy Minister Vincent Karremans has repeatedly defended his decision to intervene in the company over recent weeks. The low-tech, inexpensive chips are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, they're used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows. Auto industry groups have said that disruptions in the supply chain for Nexperia parts have not yet been fundamentally resolved, meaning that component availability remains uncertain. Japan's Nissan and German auto supplier Bosch are among the firms to have warned about looming shortages. Speaking to CNBC last month, a spokesperson for the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW among hundreds of others, warned of elevated risks to supply, "particularly for the first quarter" of 2026. — CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report.

A major Groq investor said data center development was "speculative" and would put "stress on the system." Alex Davis, the CEO of Austin-based investment company Disruptive Tech, sounded an alarm about the US data center market in an end-of-year letter to investors on Monday. "I am also deeply concerned about the 'speculative' data center market," Davis wrote in his letter. "The 'build it and they will come' strategy is a trap. In a similar letter on LinkedIn, Davis also talked about data centers, and said AI has spurred "too many business models with no realistic margin expansion." The release also said that Disruptive Tech had invested in Airbnb, Spotify, and Slack, as well as AI-forward companies like Shield AI, Palantir, and Databricks. This funding round took place shortly before Groq signed a $20 billion licensing deal with Nvidia in November. Davis's comments about data centers come as tech companies are spending billions of dollars on their construction. A Business Insider investigation into the US's data centers in June showed that at the end of 2024, companies had filed permits for 1,240 existing or planned data centers. This was nearly four times the number of permits in 2010. Cities give companies tax incentives to build data centers, spurring the rate of their construction.</p>
