FILE- In this May 7, 2018, file photo, Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett smiles during an interview in Omaha, Neb.. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File) Warren Buffett, Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, puts pen to paper during a game of bridge following the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting in Omaha, Neb., Sunday, May 5, 2019. (AP) — The advice that legendary investor Warren Buffett offered on investing and life over the years helped earn him legions of followers who eagerly read his annual letters and filled an arena in Omaha every year to listen to him at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meetings. Buffett's last day as CEO is Wednesday after six decades of building up the Berkshire conglomerate. He'll remain chairman, but Greg Abel will take over leadership. That's how Buffett summed up his investing approach of buying out-of-favor stocks and companies when they were selling for less than he estimated they were worth. He also urged investors to stick with industries they understand that fall within their “circle of competence” and offered this classic maxim: “Rule No. “After they first obey all rules, I then want employees to ask themselves whether they are willing to have any contemplated act appear the next day on the front page of their local paper to be read by their spouses, children and friends with the reporting done by an informed and critical reporter. “If they follow this test, they need not fear my other message to them: Lose money for the firm and I will be understanding; lose a shred of reputation for the firm and I will be ruthless.” That's the ethical standard Buffett explained to a Congressional committee in 1991 that he would apply as he cleaned up the Wall Street investment firm Salomon Brothers. Many companies might do well when times are good and the economy is growing, but Buffett told investors that a crisis always reveals whether businesses are making sound decisions. “Who you associate with is just enormously important. Buffett always told young people that they should try to hang out with people who they feel are better than them because that will help improve their lives. He said that's especially true when choosing a spouse, which might be the most important decision in life. He wrote in 2021 that “there has been no incubator for unleashing human potential like America. Despite some severe interruptions, our country's economic progress has been breathtaking.”</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Christian Pulisic is not dating Sydney Sweeney, and he wants everyone to know. The United States Men's National Team superstar has been rumored to be dating the famed actress, but he put those rumors to bed earlier this week. "Please stop with the made-up stories about my personal life. Need to hold sources accountable it can affect people's lives," Pulisic wrote on his Instagram story earlier this week. Christian Pulisic denied rumors that he is dating Sydney Sweeney. In another post that highlighted Pulisic's accomplishments, one of which was his reported fling with Sweeney, Pulisic wrote, "Fake news guys let's stop with the silly rumor." Sweeney, 28, is just one year and six days older than the 27-year-old Pulisic, who was born in 1998 — both were born in mid-September. But Pulisic has been dating golfer Alexa Melton since at least the summer of 2024. Melton played college golf at USC and competed in the 2024 U.S. Women's Open. She has mostly competed on the women's Epson Tour but not since 2024. Christian Pulisic kicks the ball during the CONMEBOL Copa America 2024 Group C match at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on June 23, 2024. Sweeney, meanwhile, has been linked to music manager Scooter Braun, who has worked with Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift. Pulisic will suit up for the Stars and Stripes this summer at the 2026 World Cup, which will be played throughout North America. The final will take place July 19 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, home of the New York Giants and Jets. The U.S. is the highest-ranked team in its group this summer, joining Australia (26th), Paraguay (39th) and a team to be determined in a playoff. It returned to the Round of 16 three years ago but couldn't advance out of the Copa América group stage on home soil last year. United States players celebrate a goal by Christian Pulisic (10) against Mexico during the second half of a CONCACAF Nations League semifinals soccer match Thursday, June 15, 2023, in Las Vegas.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed on Wednesday that President Donald Trump wants to denaturalize members of Minnesota's Somali community involved in yearslong, billion-dollar fraud schemes. During a Wednesday morning interview with Fox News, Leavitt said the scandal will be a “top priority” for federal investigators heading into the new year. “The Department of Justice, as we speak, is continuing to execute search warrants and subpoenas. People will be in handcuffs as a result of the fraud that Governor Walz has allowed to occur there for many, many years,” she said. Leavitt was asked by Fox News to clarify whether Somalis convicted of fraud should “have their citizenship revoked,” to which she responded, “Absolutely.” It's something this administration has already done, and we know that there are liberal activist judges across the country who will try to block and tackle this administration from pursuing justice at every turn,” she continued. “But that's not going to stop the president and his entire cabinet by acting on behalf of law abiding, taxpaying citizens in the state of Minnesota and in states across the country who have been ripped off by people who abused our immigration system, came to our country, do not love our country or respect our values, and now have been ripping off and stealing money from law abiding Americans. From 1990 through 2017, the federal government opened an average of just 11 denaturalization cases per year, although the number rose to 25 cases per year during Trump's first term in office. Roughly 100,000 Somalis currently live in Minnesota, with more than half being born on U.S. soil. Nearly 90% of Somali immigrants living in Minnesota are believed to be naturalized citizens.</p>

Residents use their smartphones to film a large screen at a shopping mall showing CCTV broadcasting Chinese President Xi Jinping delivering his 2026 New Year message, in Beijing, Wednesday, Dec. 31, 2025. BEIJING (AP) — Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday hailed his country's technological progress in areas such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors while once again insisting his country would annex self-ruled Taiwan. During his New Year's Eve address broadcast Wednesday evening by state media, Xi praised the country's advancements in key sectors including military tech and space exploration. Images ranging from humanoid robots performing kung fu to new hydropower projects rolled on the screen as he spoke. “We sought to energize high-quality development through innovation,” Xi said while thanking Chinese people for contributing to the country's economic growth over the past five years. China plans its economic development over periods of five years and is preparing to discuss its new five-year plan at the upcoming legislative session in March. The country is set to speed up self-reliance in science and technology as the United States imposes increasingly tight controls on access to semiconductors and other high-tech items. Regarding Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that China considers sovereign territory, Xi reiterated Beijing's annexation intentions. “We Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait share a bond of blood and kinship,” he said. China this week conducted two days of military drills around Taiwan, launching rockets and sending aircraft and warships in response to a planned arms sale by the U.S. to the island. Taiwan President Lai Ching-te condemned the drills but said his territory would act responsibly by neither escalating the conflict nor provoking disputes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has spent the last several weeks sprinting towards a deadline. After publicly committing to filling many of the top posts in his new administration before taking office, Mamdani, 34, is closing 2025 with a still-evolving image of the team that is going to help steer his government and enact an ambitious agenda to tackle the affordability crisis in the nation's largest city. During the campaign, Mamdani – a former state assemblyman who will make history as New York's youngest mayor in a century when he takes the oath of office at midnight on New Year's Day – battled criticism that he lacked the experience needed to lead the city's massive bureaucracy. Since his election, Mamdani's transition has continued to try to swat away that criticism even as it has slow-rolled some of its appointments, leading critics and political insiders watching from the sidelines to wonder if the pace of the transition is an indication of what the Mamdani era of government will bring. A look at Zohran Mamdani's policy ideas as he becomes New York City's mayor The appointments of newly elected mayors are closely watched affairs, as they provide an early test for a new administration. Still, several members of the transition granted anonymity to speak freely about confidential proceedings acknowledged the transition has indeed moved slower than previous administrations, in part due to Mamdani's limited network of seasoned government hands and a struggle to appease competing constituencies inside the transition. “But he also has a lot of very hard left people internally who are less interested in compromising, and that push and pull is really delaying things.” Another member described the effort as a “careful managing of everyone's political feelings.” And while some have been quick to focus on the delays, members of the transition have also praised some of Mamdani's picks so far, describing them as “sane, sober choices” that should put at ease anyone worried Mamdani would place a “bunch of radical kids” in charge. “I feel confident about the team we're putting together,” Mamdani said earlier this month when asked about the pace of his appointments. “We are going to be building out a team that New Yorkers will see being the ones who will help to make the decisions that will shape their lives and their ability to afford living in this city.” Since winning the general election in November, Mamdani hasn't quite stopped running. He has held a series of quasi-campaign events in the past two months: Rallying alongside independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Starbucks workers on strike, distributing hot chocolate to tenants in the freezing December temperatures to highlight his proposal to freeze stabilized rents, meeting with daycare workers to talk about his universal childcare pitch and traveling to Washington, DC, for an Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump. New York City's municipal gears turn with the help of more than 300,000 public workers and dozens of agencies, mayoral offices and boards. They're tasked with everything from picking up the more than 10,000 tons of garbage the city produces daily, to leading the city's public hospital system, helping small businesses, and awarding city contracts, to name a few of their collective responsibilities. And Mamdani hasn't named a transportation commissioner, who would be key in helping implement his “fast and free” bus plan. Former New York Mayor Bill De Blasio, whose transition had a similar pace of appointments to Mamdani's, announced job appointments through the last day of the year before he took office. Mamdani is expected to do the same: Sources familiar with the plan tell CNN he is expected to announce a schools chancellor on Wednesday. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to introduce Zohran Mamdani at New Year's Day inauguration Mamdani jumped into action after election day, appointing a transition committee led by Grace Bonilla, a seasoned non-profit leader who previously served in de Blasio's administration, and Lina Khan, the former Federal Trade Commission chair under President Joe Biden best known for her work in antitrust and consumer protection. Days later, Mamdani named Dean Fuleihan as his first deputy mayor. Gaspard has also acted as a bridge between Mamdani and Obama and has been providing advice on everything from hires to communication strategy. The transition has not been without controversy: Catherine Da Costa resigned as Mamdani's director of appointments less than 24 hours after she was named to the role after a series of antisemitic social media posts she made more than a decade ago surfaced. Da Costa expressed “deep regret” for the statements and said she felt “a profound sense of sadness and remorse at the harm these words have caused.” After accepting Da Costa's resignation, he said “clear changes” needed to be made to the vetting process, adding he would not have hired Da Costa if he'd been aware of the posts. The transition has since brought on an outside legal firm to vet potential hires. Before that, vetting of candidates was led by an internal team and paid lawyers. Mamdani's transition – a group of more than 400 people split into 17 committees dedicated to different policy areas – met a handful of times since the election, kicking off with an all-hands meeting in mid-November. That gathering was followed by Zoom meetings and smaller committee working groups, giving transition members a chance to discuss inner government workings and submit suggestions for potential hires. Then came the job interviews: Some candidates sat for meetings with members of the transition, sometimes over Zoom and in a handful of cases without a clear idea of which job they were interviewing for, according to two members of the transition who spoke about the process. That led to frustration among government wonks and public servants who wondered if they would need to inform their current employer that they were leaving to work in Mamdani's City Hall. Indeed, much of the work has taken place in secret. Mamdani's allies say the delay in making some appointments is not cause for alarm. Several pointed out Mamdani and his team have been working under a much shorter timeline than his predecessors: In previous years, the winner of New York's Democratic primary was considered a shoo-in for the general election, allowing them to shift focus to the work of the transition and start vetting dozens of candidates for high-stakes posts. Andrew Cuomo mounted an independent general election bid despite his primary loss to Mamdani, and Adams, the incumbent, declined to drop his bid until just days before the election. “They had to do a job very quickly on something that usually can be spread out over months,” New York state Sen. Gustavo Rivera, a member of Mamdani's advisory committee, said of the transition process. “Zohran has a vision, and he is also smart and humble to know what he doesn't know.” Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the year in which the latest New York mayoral election took place.</p>

A girl poses as she holds new euro coins with Bulgarian symbols in Sofia, Tuesday Dec. 30, 2025. But the historic milestone arrives amid political instability and skepticism among ordinary people fueled by fears of price rises. They hope it will make the country more attractive for investors and strengthen its orientation toward wealthier Western Europe. One fear is that merchants will round prices up or otherwise use the changeover to worsen inflation, at a time when inflation has rebounded to 3.7%. An EU Eurobarometer poll from March showed that 53% of 1,017 people surveyed opposed joining the eurozone, while 45% were in favor. A separate Eurobarometer poll, taken between Oct. 9 and Nov. 3 on a similar sample, showed that about half of Bulgarians opposed the single currency while 42% were in favor. The government successfully completed the euro adoption process by beating inflation down to 2.7% earlier this year to comply with EU rules and win approval from EU leaders. But clearing that hurdle was followed by a new chapter of political chaos. The government resigned after less than a year in office amid nationwide anti-corruption protests. This left the country without a regular budget for next year and is hampering plans for long-overdue structural reforms and decisions on use of EU support funds. A new election — the eighth in five years — is expected to be held next spring. “Bulgaria is a full member of the European Union, and its rightful place is alongside the other developed and democratic European nations,” he said. Others, like Darina Vitova, who runs a pedicure salon in Sofia, said things were moving too fast although she welcomed the change “in principle.” “The standard of living and incomes in our country are far from those in the richest European countries, while prices here are rising and life for the average person will become more difficult,” she said. She acknowledges that when heading to the beaches in neighboring Greece, it will be more convenient to pay with the same “pocket money” she uses at home. Countries that join the EU commit to the euro, but actually joining can take years and some members are in no hurry. Opponents of joining have fed fears that the changes will allegedly lead to more poverty and loss of national identity. Social media has spread disinformation such as false claims that the euro could lead to confiscation of bank accounts. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has said that countries have experienced a slight, transient rise in prices of 0.2%-0.4% right after joining. Price rises can be more apparent than real, as cafe and hairdressers may put off printing new menus and price lists ahead of the change, so that increases are only delayed, not caused by the euro. While the anti-euro protests were supported by older people based on economic anxiety, the mass protests that toppled the government appeared to represent a younger electorate fed up with corruption and eager to integrate with Europe. Anti-euro disinformation spread by pro-Russian politicians and social media aim “to reduce support for the European Union, NATO and Ukraine,” said Dimitar Keranov, program coordinator for engaging Central Europe at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. Bulgaria's European integration “is not in Moscow's interest at all, so if it can somehow polarize society and weaken support for the European Union that's what it tries to achieve,” he said. Petar Ganev, an analyst at the Sofia-based Institute for Market Economics, says that that by stepping down the outgoing government has sent a signal of uncertainty to foreign investors. “Instead of capitalizing on euro adoption as a strong and positive signal to the international community—investors, debt holders, and those investing in Bulgarian assets and economic activity—we risk sending the opposite message,” Ganev said in an interview with the Associated Press. Ganev believes that eurozone membership should be regarded as an opportunity, an additional mechanism to address corruption and the rule of law, although it alone cannot resolve Bulgaria's chronic cycle of elections and political fragmentation and instability. Local economists think that joining the euro will not bring dramatic changes to Bulgaria's economy. That is because the lev has been pegged since 1999 to the euro by law, at a fixed rate of 1 lev for every 51 euro cents.</p>

U.S. and partner forces killed or captured nearly 25 Islamic State operatives in Syria in the days following a large-scale U.S.-led strike on Dec. 19, according to a new statement from U.S. Central Command, underscoring Washington's assessment that ISIS remains an active and persistent threat inside the country. CENTCOM said those forces conducted 11 follow-on missions between Dec. 20 and Dec. 29, killing at least seven ISIS members, capturing the remainder and eliminating four ISIS weapons caches. The operations followed Operation Hawkeye Strike, when U.S. and Jordanian forces hit more than 70 ISIS targets across central Syria using over 100 precision munitions, destroying infrastructure and weapons sites linked to the group. "We will not relent," CENTCOM Commander Adm. Brad Cooper said, adding that U.S. forces remain "steadfast" in working with regional partners to dismantle ISIS networks that pose a threat to U.S. and regional security. The scope of the follow-on raids highlights a reality U.S. commanders and analysts have been warning about for months: ISIS no longer controls large swaths of territory, but it retains the ability to organize, strike and regenerate inside Syria's fragmented security landscape. U.S. Army soldiers prepare to go out on patrol from a remote combat outpost on May 25, 2021, in northeastern Syria. U.S. forces, part of Task Force WARCLUB operate from combat outposts in the area, coordinating with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in combatting residual ISIS extremists and deterring pro-Iranian militia. Syria remains divided among competing forces, militias and foreign-backed armed groups, with no single authority exercising full control over large parts of the country. Analysts say that vacuum continues to provide space for ISIS cells to operate quietly, recruit and exploit overstretched local forces. Analysts note that Syria's security environment remains shaped by former jihadist networks that were never fully demobilized after the war. The country's transitional leadership, including President Ahmed al-Sharaa, emerged from armed Islamist factions that relied heavily on foreign fighters and militias, according to regional security assessments. While those groups are not synonymous with ISIS, experts say the incomplete dismantling of extremist networks has left gaps that ISIS cells continue to exploit. "ISIS today doesn't need a caliphate to be dangerous," Bill Roggio told Fox News Digital. "We've always been quick to declare terrorist organizations defeated and insignificant, and that couldn't be further from the truth." Roggio said the group has adapted rather than disappeared, shifting away from holding territory toward smaller, more covert cells capable of carrying out lethal attacks. He pointed to ongoing ISIS activity not only in Syria and Iraq, but also in Afghanistan and other regions, citing United Nations reporting that estimates roughly 2,000 ISIS fighters remain active in Afghanistan alone. "That's not what a defeated group looks like," Roggio said, noting that ISIS continues to recruit, indoctrinate and inspire attacks even without the visibility it once had. Those prisons are guarded primarily by Kurdish-led forces backed by a small U.S. military presence, estimated at roughly 1,000 troops, according to Reuters. Kurdish officials have also raised concerns about funding shortages, manpower strain and pressure from rival militias operating nearby. While U.S. officials have not publicly linked the recent strikes to prison-related threats, analysts say the broader environment of fragmented control increases the risk of coordinated attacks, insider assistance or prison unrest. ISIS has previously staged mass prison break operations in Syria and Iraq, including a 2022 assault on the al-Sinaa prison in Hasakah that required days of fighting to contain. The U.S. strikes also come amid continued instability inside Syria, where multiple armed actors operate with overlapping authority. Analysts note that clashes among militias, sectarian violence and unresolved command structures have weakened overall security and diverted attention from counterterrorism efforts. U.S. soldiers attached to the Iowa National Guard sign GBU-31 munitions systems in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility Dec. 18, 2025 as the U.S. military launched large-scale strikes against dozens of Islamic State targets in Syria in retaliation for an attack on U.S. personnel, U.S. officials said. Bombings in neighborhoods of Damascus, including Mezzeh, and unrest in minority areas have further illustrated the gaps ISIS and other extremist groups can exploit, according to regional security assessments and open-source reporting. "ISIS thrives where no one is fully in charge." U.S. officials and analysts stress that ISIS activity in Syria is part of a wider pattern rather than an isolated flare-up. Sources in the Israeli Mossad told Fox News Digital of continued ISIS-linked activity across multiple theaters, including recruitment networks and small-scale attacks designed to test security responses and maintain operational relevance. In Turkey, security forces recently clashed with Islamic State militants during counterterrorism operations, wounding several officers, according to Reuters on Monday. Security forces loyal to the interim Syrian government ride in the back of a vehicle moving along a road in Syria's western city of Latakia on March 9, 2025. The renewed U.S. military action raises difficult questions for policymakers about how long the current containment strategy can hold. While U.S. officials say the Dec. 19 strikes delivered a significant blow to ISIS infrastructure, they have also acknowledged that counterterrorism operations alone cannot eliminate the underlying conditions that allow the group to persist. "Just because we want to declare the war against terror over doesn't mean it's over," Roggio said. Efrat Lachter is an investigative reporter and war correspondent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Another series of atmospheric river-enhanced storms will soak California as the new year begins, bringing a flood threat and evacuation warnings back to the state just days after a destructive Christmas-week storm. The midweek storm lacks the extreme ingredients of last week's flooding, but it arrives in a state already pushed to its limits. With soil having little room to absorb additional water, rainfall rates rather than totals will determine where problems emerge. “Since the ground is so saturated from the super soaking Christmas storm, almost all rainfall will become runoff. This will allow flooding to occur with less rain amounts and rates than is typical,” the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said. Evacuation warnings have been issued for the second time in a week in parts of Los Angeles County recently burned by wildfires. The storms present a heightened threat of debris flows and flash flooding in these areas, which are the most incapable of absorbing heavy rain. The voluntary warnings begin at 11 a.m. PT and are meant to give residents time to prepare with heaviest rain moving in Wednesday night. Those warnings include the greater Wrightwood area, which was devastated by debris flows and flash flooding on Christmas Eve. Residents had to frantically flee their homes as a torrent of debris rushed through town and encased homes and cars in feet of mud. No evacuations have been ordered for Wrightwood proper in San Bernardino County, but they are in effect just to its west across the county line in Los Angeles County. The storm is expected to reach Southern California New Year's Eve, then spread north through much of the state into New Year's Day. Much of Southern California is in a Level 2 of 4 flooding rain threat Wednesday and Thursday, the Weather Prediction Center said. Coastal and valley areas such as downtown Los Angeles could see 1 to 3 inches of rain, with 2 to 5 inches possible in foothills and mountains. Light rain began in Southern California Wednesday morning, but the most worrisome downpours arrive around the stroke of midnight and will last through noon on New Year's Day. Rain arriving Wednesday night will affect parade-goers camping along the route, with downpours continuing into Thursday morning. This system is only the first of three in a conga line that could affect the waterlogged state through early next week. Conditions change late Friday into Saturday as colder air drops snow below major pass levels, including Interstate 80 through Donner Pass. Over a foot of snow is likely at Sierra Nevada ski resorts, though exact totals remain uncertain and could make mountain travel hazardous. It happened after feet of snow buried the mountain range last week.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hardman defeated Republican candidate Lucas Loftin by nearly 45 percentage points, according to the election results, which showed that more than 95% of the votes were in by late Tuesday. The special election was for a seat representing parts of Des Moines's suburbs. The seat became vacant after Democratic state Sen. Claire Celsi died of an undisclosed medical condition in October. With Hardman's victory, her party now holds 17 seats, compared to the Republicans' 33. The Democratic Party previously broke the GOP supermajority in an August special election, but that victory was undermined by Celsi's death two months later. If Loftin won, Republicans could have easily overrode gubernatorial vetoes, called special sessions, and confirmed Gov. But given his loss, Iowa Republicans now need at least one Democratic vote to confirm the governor's nominees to state agencies, boards, and commissions. Tuesday's special election adds to the Democratic Party's winning streak this year. “Senator-elect Hardman … will be a voice for working Iowans and will fight tooth and nail to make Iowa more affordable,” DNC Chairman Ken Martin said. “Her victory ensures that Iowa Republicans will not have a supermajority in the Iowa Senate, a major check on Republican power that puts billionaires first.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Department of Health and Human Services announced on Tuesday that all child care payments to Minnesota have been frozen in response to the widespread fraud allegations under federal investigation. The move taken by HHS concerns Somali-run day care centers that are allegedly benefiting from government payments issued by the Administration for Children and Families. In a video, HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill and ACF Assistant Secretary Alex Adams said they took three direct actions to combat the alleged child care fraud. Tim Walz (D-MN) provide a comprehensive audit of the day care centers. O'Neill said the audit will include attendance records, licenses, complaints, investigations, and inspections. Thirdly, HHS launched a dedicated hotline and email address to report suspected child care fraud. In a subsequent post, O'Neill said the frozen funds will be released “when states prove they are being spent legitimately.” “It's a serious issue — but this has been his plan all along. The Democratic governor maintains his administration has taken steps to crack down on fraud by referring cases to law enforcement and shutting down or auditing certain programs. Minnesota's day care system recently came under scrutiny following a viral video that shed light on the state's fraud scandal. Adams said his office provides Minnesota with $185 million in child care funds annually, estimating that 19,000 American children are meant to benefit from that amount of money. After speaking with the director of Minnesota Child Care Services, Adams said he was not told with “confidence whether those allegations of fraud are isolated or whether there's fraud stretching statewide.” Commissioner Tikki Brown of the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families revealed that while no fraud has been found at child day care centers in the state so far, her office is investigating the centers again in response to Shirley's video.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge has ordered the Department of Justice to turn over internal records tied to its decision to investigate and charge Salvadoran migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, signaling growing judicial skepticism that senior DOJ leadership may have pushed the prosecution while publicly denying involvement. The order, issued earlier this month by U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw and unsealed on Tuesday, requires prosecutors to produce documents related to the opening of a criminal investigation and the pursuit of charges stemming from a 2022 traffic stop. While stopping short of ordering testimony from senior officials, the judge highlighted internal emails that appear to contradict prosecutors' repeated claims that the charging decision was made locally without outside pressure. Those emails suggest that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and his office were closely looped in as the case progressed. “The government's documents may contradict its prior representations that the decision to prosecute was made locally and that there were no outside influences.” In an April 30 email, Aakash Singh, a senior official in Blanche's office, told prosecutors that charging Abrego Garcia was a “top priority” for DOJ leadership, according to page five of the unsealed order. McGuire responded that the office wanted the “high command looped in.” In another message weeks later, McGuire said he had heard “anecdotally” that Blanche and then-Principal Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove III wanted charges filed quickly. Crenshaw previously ruled in October that Abrego Garcia had established a “reasonable likelihood” of vindictive prosecution, shifting the burden to the government to rebut that conclusion. Blanche's office has dismissed claims that he played a leading role in the prosecution. The criminal case is unfolding alongside parallel immigration litigation. A Maryland judge on Dec. 11 ordered Abrego Garcia released from immigration custody and accused DOJ lawyers of misleading the court.</p>

At some point, the amateur effort to knock on doors of home daycares intersects with robust stand-your-ground laws Stand-your-ground laws allow people to use deadly force for self-defense when threatened in public. Gerstein's post suggests that deadly force could be used against ICE officers if they knock on the doors of day care centers. “You would think a ‘Senior Legal Affairs Reporter' for POLITICO would know better than to tweet something inciting violence against federal agents,” the agency posted on social media. Minnesota does not have a broad stand-your-ground law, but the state does permit the use of deadly force without retreating in a person's home, vehicle, or place of business as long as the person reasonably believes they're in danger of serious bodily harm or death. The federal government is currently investigating alleged fraud schemes involving Minnesota's social services programs and day care facilities. ICE is collaborating with the FBI to investigate suspected fraud sites in Minnesota. ICE is highly active in Minneapolis and St. Paul, where Somali immigrants are concentrated, as part of an immigration enforcement operation in the blue state.</p>

He said he was protesting racial injustice in the U.S., and took it a step further when he wore socks depicting police officers as pigs and expressed support for Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. An anthem controversy sparked up again when James and others took a knee during the song in the NBA bubble after Jacob Blake was shot in a police incident weeks after the death of George Floyd.
