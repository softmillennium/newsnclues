                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But certain transactions are exempt from regulation under the CEA, including those that result in “actual delivery within 28 days.” In 2013, the CFTC issued a “final interpretation” of “actual delivery” in the context of margined, financed or leveraged retail commodity transactions generally. And in 2020, it issued the now-withdrawn “interpretive guidance” setting out the agency's views on determining whether actual delivery has occurred with respect to virtual currencies. Notably, the withdrawal statement did not replace the 2020 guidance, perhaps out of concern that any new guidance could become entrenched before a new statutory regime potentially renders it obsolete. Action on digital asset market legislation has stalled in the Senate amid partisan differences. According to Decrypt, some crypto industry insiders now view the legislation as far too complicated and touching on too many politically sensitive issues to pass before Congress effectively grinds to a halt ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. They point to key victories for the industry in new regulations issued by CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that will be difficult for a new administration to unravel, even in lieu of new legislation. “As soon as we get a token safe harbor, it's over for market structure,” one crypto policy leader told Decrypt, referring to an SEC exemption for crypto projects expected to roll out in January. The prevailing official guidance on whether digital currency transactions are exempt from futures regulation under the “actual delivery” standard has been voided without being replaced and any legislative path forward on clarifying the rule may be blocked at least until 2027.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The software company — formerly MicroStrategy — has become a volatile bitcoin proxy because it holds the token on its balance sheet and regularly raises money to buy more. That structure is back in focus as investors weigh the trade-off between added bitcoin exposure and shareholder dilution. A Form 8-K dated Dec. 29 showed Strategy bought 1,229 bitcoins for $108.8 million between Dec. 22 and Dec. 28 at an average price of about $88,568 per coin, funded by selling 663,450 shares through its at-the-market program. The filing put total holdings at 672,497 bitcoins and said roughly $11.7 billion of common stock remained available for sale under the program. At bitcoin's latest price of about $87,516, that stash would be worth roughly $58.9 billion. Other crypto-linked stocks were mixed: Coinbase fell 1.2% and Marathon Digital slipped 1.5%, while miner Riot Platforms rose 1.6%. At-the-market offerings allow a company to sell newly issued shares into the market at prevailing prices, typically in small increments. Chairman Michael Saylor posted “Back to Orange” on social media ahead of the disclosure, a phrase long associated by followers with fresh bitcoin buying. Traders are likely to keep keying off bitcoin's direction into year-end trading and whether Strategy continues tapping equity markets for more purchases. For now, the stock's day-to-day path remains tightly tied to bitcoin's swings, with financing headlines adding another layer of volatility.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One investor has leaned into Core Scientific's infrastructure pivot, seemingly betting the market is missing what comes next. San Francisco-based Valiant Capital Management increased its position in Core Scientific (CORZ 0.20%) by 1.68 million shares in the third quarter, adding an estimated $34.34 million in overall position value, according to a November 14 SEC filing. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated November 14, Valiant Capital Management reported buying 1.68 million additional shares of Core Scientific (CORZ 0.20%) during the third quarter. The fund also reported holding call options tied to about 4.21 million shares. As of Wednesday, CORZ shares were priced at $14.65, up about 4% over the past year and underperforming the S&P 500, which is up about 17% in the same period. Core Scientific, Inc. is a leading provider of blockchain infrastructure and digital asset mining services in North America, operating large-scale data centers and offering both self-mining and hosting solutions. It's important to note that this stake was built while Core Scientific was rallying sharply, not after the wheels came off. This was not a reflexive dip buy. It was an endorsement of the strategy before the headline risk reentered the picture.At the time, Core Scientific was starting to be valued less like a pure-play Bitcoin miner and more like a power and compute platform. Third-quarter results reinforced that shift, highlighting growing colocation revenue and the optionality embedded in its large-scale, power-rich data center footprint. 13F reportable assets under management: The portion of a fund's assets required to be disclosed in quarterly SEC Form 13F filings.AUM (Assets Under Management): The total market value of investments managed by a fund or investment firm.Colocation services: Renting space and infrastructure in a data center to host clients' computing equipment.Digital asset mining: The process of using computing power to validate blockchain transactions and earn cryptocurrency rewards.Hosting solutions: Services that provide infrastructure and management for clients' computing or mining equipment.Self-mining operations: When a company mines digital assets for its own account rather than on behalf of clients.Dual business model: A company strategy that generates revenue from two distinct but related business activities.Quarter: A three-month period used by companies to report financial performance, often aligning with calendar quarters.Market value: The total value of a holding, calculated as the current share price multiplied by the number of shares owned.TTM: The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.Colocation: The practice of housing privately-owned servers and networking equipment in a third-party data center.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto-linked equities were largely muted in after-hours trading Tuesday, with one clear exception. The clean energy and tech infrastructure company said it acquired 15.1 Bitcoin at an average price of $87,686.33 and 301.1 Ethereum at an average price of $2,934.67. IPW's stock rose more than 5% in after-hours trade, offsetting a 5.49% decline during the regular session. The acquisition marks iPower's formal entry into holding cryptocurrencies as part of its balance sheet. Corporate adoption of digital asset treasury strategies has expanded beyond Bitcoin-only approaches in recent quarters, with a growing number of firms opting to hold Ethereum alongside BTC. According to data on Arkham Intelligence, spotted by Lookonchain, Tom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) bought another 32,938 Ethereum and staked another 118,944 ETH on Tuesday night. Retail sentiment on Stocktwits around the company remained in ‘bearish' territory even as chatter rose to ‘normal' from ‘low' levels. This comes on the heels of BMNR announcing its total Ethereum (ETH) holdings had reached 4.11 million tokens after adding over 44,000 ETH over the past week. BMNR also disclosed it has staked 408,627 ETH, locking up tokens to validate transactions and earn rewards. Liquidations across the market were relatively contained at $142 million, according to CoinGlass data. Bitcoin's price rose 2.1% in the last 24 hours to around $88,700, with retail sentiment on Stocktwits trending in ‘bearish' territory over the past day amid ‘normal' levels of chatter. On Stocktwits, retail sentiment around QQQ remained in ‘bullish' territory, but chatter rose to ‘normal' from ‘low' levels over the past day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT), the company behind Truth Social, said Wednesday it plans to distribute a new digital token to shareholders through a deal with Crypto.com. Trump Media said in a press release that once the program launches, each shareholder would receive one token for every whole share of DJT held. U.S. president Donald Trump is the majority owner of Trump Media and Technology  and has spoken favorable about the crypto industry in 2025, stating in November that he wants the U.S. to become a "bitcoin superpower." Crypto.com's native token, CRO, initially jumped 3.8% following the announcement before giving back some of those gains. KuCoin captured a record share of centralised exchange volume in 2025, with more than $1.25tn traded as its volumes grew faster than the wider crypto market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dec. 31, 2025 -- Trump Media and Technology Group Corp. (Nasdaq, NYSE Texas: DJT) ("Trump Media"), operator of the social media platform Truth Social, the streaming platform Truth+, and the FinTech brand Truth.Fi, today announced plans to distribute a new digital token to its shareholders in partnership with Crypto.com. The distribution is expected to leverage Crypto.com's cutting-edge technology, including the high performance, interoperable Cronos blockchain designed for speed, scalability, and seamless connectivity between networks. Trump Media anticipates that, beginning in the near future, each ultimate beneficial owner will be eligible to receive one of the new digital tokens per whole share of DJT, with various rewards being made available to token holders periodically throughout the year. It is anticipated that the digital tokens distributed to Trump Media shareholders will not in and of themselves represent an ownership interest in Trump Media or any other entity, nor should token holders expect rewards to include profits from the essential managerial efforts of others. It is further anticipated that the tokens may not be transferable and cannot be exchanged for cash, and that only ultimate beneficial owners (not borrowers) of DJT shares as of the specified record date(s) will be eligible to receive digital tokens. Trump Media reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change, modify or terminate this distribution or any of the terms and conditions relating to the distribution at any time, with or without prior notice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China has taken a decisive step in reshaping its central bank digital currency strategy, transforming the digital yuan from a non-yielding form of cash into an interest-bearing financial instrument. On Monday, December 29, the People's Bank of China announced that starting January 1, 2026, commercial banks will begin paying interest on digital yuan (e-CNY) wallet balances. Under the new framework, e-CNY holdings will be treated more like bank deposits rather than simple digital cash in circulation. According to trading data, Chinese investors poured approximately $188 million into digital yuan–related A-share stocks following the announcement. One of the biggest beneficiaries was Lakala Payment, a major third-party payments provider involved in digital yuan infrastructure. Lakala reportedly captured around 30% of the total inflows, with its shares jumping more than 12% as investors positioned for increased CBDC adoption. By allowing interest on e-CNY balances, the PBOC is closing that gap, encouraging users to hold digital yuan rather than immediately converting or spending it. This also signals a deeper shift in classification: the digital yuan is moving away from pure M0-style cash toward a form of deposit-like money, potentially usable within bank reserve and lending frameworks. Beyond domestic adoption, the change positions China's CBDC as one of the most economically integrated digital currencies issued by a major central bank. As global central banks continue experimenting with digital currencies, China's move underscores a key lesson: adoption follows incentives, and yield may be the strongest one yet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Neo blockchain co-founders fight over finances and control. The Neo blockchain, often referred to as the “Chinese Ethereum” due to its smart contract capabilities and focus on digital assets, has been rocked by a public feud between its co-founders, Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang. This dispute centers on financial transparency, control over the project's treasury, and allegations of governance hijacking. We sometimes use affiliate links in our content, when clicking on those we might receive a commission at no extra cost to you. As of Dec. 31, the co-founders had exchanged pointed allegations on X, with each believing the other was to blame for opacity and potential resource waste. Neo co-founder Erik Zhang accused Da Hongfei of failing to disclose Neo Foundation finances and urged a complete, verifiable report. He said Hongfei will step back from Neo mainnet work, effective Jan. 1, 2026, to focus on NeoX and SpoonOS. Hongfei replied  that Zhang controls most NEO funds and consensus power, stating that one person should not run the project. The co-founder allegedly agreed to withdraw, believing it would benefit Neo. Zhang realized that Hongfei was working on AEON, a new blockchain project with its own coin that might potentially utilize Neo's resources. This motivated Zhang to return and question what he regarded as a conflict of interest. According to Zhang, a phone call agreement was reached, where Hongfei would disclose financial reports and shift focus to side projects, such as NeoX, a cross-chain bridge, and SpoonOS, an operating system layer for Neo. Erik posts publicly on Dec. 31, accusing Da of failing to honor the agreement. He demands the immediate disclosure of NF assets and expenditures, stating that Da will no longer handle Neo mainnet matters as of Jan. 1, 2026. Da responds, countering that Erik controls the “super majority” of NEO/GAS in personal custody, refusing to transfer to multisig wallets despite promises. Da pledges a full 2025 financial report in Q1 2026 and vows to pursue treasury transfer through “all available remedies. Da Hongfei, who is sometimes referred to as the public face, has prioritized company development, collaborations, and ecosystem expansion. The current spat revolves around the NF's treasury—estimated to include significant NEO/GAS holdings and allegations that one founder has monopolized access, leading to a “black box” of unaccounted expenditures. Community sentiment reflects displeasure with both parties for undermining confidence. Some note danger signals, such as blocked access to reports, which mimic bigger blockchain governance flaws encountered in projects like Mantra DAO.</p>

Despite the shift in institutional interest from Bitcoin (BTC) to altcoins, Bitcoin's dominance remains around 60%, suggesting the chances of an altcoin season are low. Bitwise, a crypto asset management fund, filed for 11 new crypto ETFs with the US SEC on Tuesday, expanding its offering to include niche altcoins such as Aave, Uniswap, Zcash, Canton, Ethena, Hyperliquid, Near Protocol, Starknet, Sui, Bittensor, and Tron. Bitcoin dominance, the share of BTC market capitalization of the total crypto market, is at 59.70% at press time on Wednesday. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at 0.03358 BTC, stabilizing above 0.03000 BTC after a decline from mid-August to early November. At the same time, CoinMarketCap's Altcoin Season Index at 19 indicates a Bitcoin Season, aligning with the BTC-dominant market sentiment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom Lee attributed Ethereum's late-December price weakness to automated trading activity and year-end tax losses. BitMine's Tom Lee said “bots” and year-end tax-related selling were driving Ethereum's recent price weakness, even as the firm added another 44,463 ETH tokens. In a post on X, Lee said market conditions in the final days of December are typically distorted as institutional investors step away for the holidays, as Ethereum continues to trade below $3,000. “Market activity tends to slow as we enter the final holiday weeks of a calendar year,” Lee said. Adding: “Year-end tax-loss related selling is pushing down crypto and crypto equity prices, and this effect tends to be the greatest from Dec. 26 to Dec. 30, so we are navigating markets with this in mind.” “Typically, in these last holiday trading days, many institutional investors have stepped away from markets,” Lee said. That dynamic, he said, leaves markets more heavily influenced by automated trading systems and year-end tax-loss selling. “As a result, trading is dominated by bots and other automated strategies, along with tax-loss related selling. Ethereum was trading below $2,971 on Wednesday, up almost 5% in the last 30 days. However, analysts say near-term risks remain skewed to the downside. “Despite the uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin's recent on-chain movements, Ethereum's price still appears exposed to additional downside risk,” Olanrewaju said. Data from CryptoQuant shows Ethereum's exchange reserves have climbed to their highest level in more than a month.

OKX Review 2025: Pros, Cons, Fees and Key Features Explained Gate.io Review 2025: Is it Safe and Legit for Crypto Trading? Coinbase Referral Code 2025: Steps to Earn $200 in BTC Welcome Bonus Lighter does not run on general-purpose L2s; instead, it utilizes a custom ZK Rollup architecture optimized specifically for high frequency trading (HFT). Uses ZK SNARKs to cryptographically prove that every order matches the Price Time Priority rule, completely eliminating exchange manipulation. For over a decade, the crypto market has been dominated by a paradox: We trade decentralized assets on centralized platforms (CEXs) that operate as “Black Boxes.” Users deposit funds, place orders, and blindly trust that the exchange will match them fairly. Gox to FTX has repeatedly proven that “Don't trust, Verify” is the only true standard. First generation DEXs (like Uniswap) solved the custody problem but failed on performance and slippage. Backed by industry giants like a16z and Paradigm, Lighter promises to end the “Black Box” era by bringing Nasdaq level speed to Ethereum grade security. Unlike typical DEXs running on general purpose Layer 2s (such as Arbitrum or Optimism) where financial transactions must compete for bandwidth with gaming or NFTs, Lighter is built on a distinct ZK Architecture. General purpose Layer 2s like Arbitrum or Optimism operate like public highways where financial transactions must share bandwidth with everything from NFT minting to gaming. This creates latency and costs that are prohibitive for Market Makers who need to update quotes thousands of times per second. Lighter opts for a Custom ZK Architecture, stripping away the overhead of a general purpose blockchain to dedicate 100% of its computational resources solely to order matching. Technically, it operates as a high performance Compute Engine atop Ethereum. In essence, Lighter bridges Web2 performance (off chain matching) with Web3 guarantees (on chain settlement), transforming transparency from an optional feature into an enforced technical primitive. To realize the vision of a high performance yet decentralized order book, the Lighter team engineered Lighter Core based on four immutable principles: In computer science, building a Verifiable Compute Engine always involves trade offs. Lighter Core rejected two common approaches in favor of the most challenging, yet optimal, path: It decouples “execution” (fast, off chain) from “verification” (secure, on-chain). In a worst case scenario, such as the Sequencer being compromised or attempting to censor your withdrawal, Lighter Core triggers the Escape Hatch mode. The protocol allows users to submit a Priority Request directly on Ethereum. In this state, users can leverage the compressed Data Blobs previously published on Ethereum to reconstruct their account state and withdraw full asset value directly on chain, independent of the Lighter team or off chain coordination. If Lighter Core is the “engine,” then the Order Book Tree is its most sophisticated “transmission.” To understand how Lighter operates smoothly while other ZK DEXs struggle with latency, we must dissect its data structure. In traditional computer science, to match orders based on “Price Time Priority,” Matching Engines (like Binance's) typically use Linked Lists. But in the Zero Knowledge world, Linked Lists are a disaster. This is why early DEXs defaulted to AMMs instead of Order Books. Instead of using Timestamps which are susceptible to manipulation or desynchronization in decentralized networks, Lighter uses a Nonce. An order with a better price and a lower Nonce (arrived earlier) automatically falls into the priority position within the tree without requiring any expensive sorting algorithms. This is the key to unlocking High Frequency Trading (HFT) on chain. Sample Order Book Tree internal node construction – Source: Lighter Another fascinating detail found is the use of “Smart Internal Nodes.Standard Merkle Trees only store Hashes. And lighter Trees store Aggregate Data like AskSizeSum or BidQuoteSum directly within the branch nodes. In essence, the code enforces what regulators cannot. An analysis of Lighter's architecture reveals a divergent approach from the industry trend: instead of utilizing general purpose zkEVMs, the project has opted to build an App specific ZK infrastructure. A significant challenge for current Layer 2 scaling solutions is the “technical debt” incurred from attempting to simulate the entire Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This often necessitates redundant opcodes that are unnecessary for specific financial tasks. Lighter addresses this by engineering Custom Arithmetic Circuits from scratch. Lighter's ability to offer zero trading fees for Retail Users does not stem from short-term subsidy strategies, but from the structural advantage of Multi Layer Aggregation. The verification process operates as a data compression assembly line: This creates a sustainable competitive advantage regarding operational costs. Regarding security, Lighter's architecture establishes a rigid link between Off chain and On-chain data via Public Inputs (Commitments). Complex infrastructure projects like Lighter require substantial R&D resources. Lighter's capital structure features participation from Tier 1 venture capital firms, including a16z (Andreessen Horowitz), Paradigm, Founders Fund, alongside angel investors from Robinhood and Coinbase. Following the TGE event, LIT is now listed and liquid on major centralized exchanges. LIT is currently tradable on platforms including: BingX, MEXC, Gate.io, and BitMart. Once the purchase is complete, you have two options: Unlike traditional DEXs, Lighter offers the low latency matching and seamless experience of a CEX, while guaranteeing absolute transparency via mathematical proofs (ZK proofs) and offering strictly zero trading fees for retail users. Is Lighter truly safer than CEXs like Binance or Bybit? On a CEX, you surrender asset control to the exchange (Custodial). Are there hidden terms behind the “Zero Fees” for retail? According to current documentation, there are no hidden trading fees. However, users must still pay a nominal Gas fee (typically a few cents) to Deposit or Withdraw assets between Layer 1 and Layer 2. Trading fees are cross subsidized by revenue generated from institutional clients (HFTs). What do I need to start trading on Lighter? You need a standard Web3 wallet (such as MetaMask, Rabby, or WalletConnect) and collateral (typically USDC) on the Ethereum Mainnet. Since Lighter is a Layer 2, you will need to perform a “Deposit” action to bridge USDC into Lighter's smart contract before placing orders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, has shared this stark warning as China emerges as a strong rival. Coinbase's chief policy officer, Faryar Shirzad, took to X to share concerns about the rising competition from China in the digital finance economy. He stated that the US lawmakers are giving China and other global rivals a strategic advantage by limiting rewards on US-based stablecoins. It only allows third-party rewards, which marks a point of focus in the ongoing Senate negotiations surrounding the market structure legislation. They claim that limiting stablecoin rewards may hamper innovation. Significantly, the Coinbase executive's warning comes in response to China's latest decision to pay interest on its CBDC, the digital yuan. Taking effect on January 1, 2026, the People's Bank of China is allowing commercial banks to pay interest on e-CNY holdings under a new framework. He noted, “If this issue is mishandled in Senate negotiations on the market structure bill, it could hand our global rivals a big assist in giving non-US stablecoins and CBDCs a critical competitive advantage at the worst possible time.” Tap here to Add CoinGape as a Trusted Source Our journal analysts bring years of experience in market analysis and blockchain technology to ensure factual accuracy and balanced reporting.
